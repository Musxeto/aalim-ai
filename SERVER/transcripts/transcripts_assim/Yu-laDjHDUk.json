  "transcript": "Abdullah from Russia Abdullah from Russia Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh I have a question, I was forced into a haram job and Alhamdulillah I repented and did not commit any of such work afterwards so just for living, for food and etc. and some of that they deducted from my salary so I have only a small amount left so the question is should I give the entire amount that I had to receive for charity or just that small amount? What was the work? So it was a big meat factory Okay the whole amount is haram for you and whatever you consumed due to necessity, ask Allah for forgiveness and this is gone and whatever you spent is gone, now whatever you have in hand you have to dispose of that in charity unless you are stone broke and you don't have anything to feed yourself or to pay the bills and you're poor otherwise if you give it away in this case you can use whatever is needed for you due to the necessity and Allah knows best"
