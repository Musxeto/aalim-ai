  "transcript": "Abdul Raheem from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh My question is that there is a limited company installing solar panels in the houses and the director of the company is practicing receiving payment rather in his own account rather than in the account of the company. So if I ever dealing with him would I be sinful or contributing towards his act of evading income tax? If there is an illegal transaction it is not permissible for you to be involved in it because you are defying the laws of the country and committing a felony. However, if you know the consequences and that if caught you will be forced to pay much much more than the taxes you are trying to evade, this is your problem, it's your risk. Either save a hundred dollars on these panels or face paying two thousand dollars as fine for tax evasion and the choice is yours and Allah knows best. For more information visit www.fema.gov.uk"
