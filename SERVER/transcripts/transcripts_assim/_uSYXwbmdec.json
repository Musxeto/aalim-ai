  "title": "Woke up late for fajr, can we pray the fard first and then the Sunnah? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "if someone wakes up for fajar late he praised the fort first can he continue with the soon afterwards despite it being forbidden times how about his intention for the Sunnah should it be Allah first of all we know that for such a prayer you have to pray 2 rakaats before it if a person misses is misses these two rakahs he can pray them afterwards whether he praised them afterwards before the Sun rises or he waits until the Sun rises the evidence is the hadith of the prophet alayhi salatu salam when he wants prayed fetcher with the congregation after he concluded the prayer he saw one of his companions standing to a pillar praying Torah cos so he stood up and walked to his companion while the companion was praying and kept on repeating is fair for is fair for Jonnie we pray 2 rakaats why are you adding to ruckus - it is fudgie pray for ruckus what is this so the man concluded his prayer quickly and then explained to the Prophet arey salatu salam o prophet of allah i was in my home wind-up yama when the fajr prayer was called for so i rushed to join the congregation skipping my voluntary prayers so now i am making them up so the prophet alayhi salatu salam did not elaborate and walked away scholars say that the son is identified by whatever the prophet had said verbally or whatever the Prophet had done in action sallallahu wasallam or whatever he approved so by approving what his companions had said and done means that it is permissible to pray the Sunnah of fudger after you pray the fault of fajar even though that this is a time of restriction because as we have explained earlier in the chapter that dealt with salat that the times of restrictions it is prohibited to pray voluntary prayer that has no legitimate reason but prayers that have a legitimate reason can be prayed even if it is times of prohibition such as you can pray to hiatal Masjid whenever you enter a message it and it's five minutes to sunset you can pray 2 rakats before you sit down you can pray funeral prayer after us or fetcher you can pray the prayer of Eclipse you can make up any missed prayer because all of these prayers have a legitimate reason to offer and hence there are exempt they are exempted from the prohibition period"
