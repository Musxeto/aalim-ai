  "title": "Hadith Whoever shelters an innovator is cursed, Did Ibn Taimiya shelter Al Bakri",
  "transcript": "uh i'm my name is waji from canvas okay yes oh sorry i apologize yes stories that's okay uh so i just wanted to ask uh there's a hadith of the prophet and i'm paraphrasing because i don't remember it exactly uh but it says that whoever shelters an innovator will be cursed um so my question was uh did sheikh islam and shelter a person who did istahasa i believe his name was al baqri or something but i don't recall exactly so i just want to ask regarding that okay i will answer inshallah well from canada says the hadith that may allah curse whoever [Music] shelters or take whoever takes in an innovator in the hadith of ali if i'm remembered correctly so uh he's saying is it true that ebentamia sheltered an innovator by the name of bakri in his lifetime i don't know and to tell you the truth who cares is one of the great scholars of islam but he's not a companion he's not a tabuli and he's not tabith so he's just a scholar a great scholar of islam do you think that whatever he does would be a role model for us to follow no not at all there are hundreds of similar scholars to eventemia and they are definitely not on the same level each one has his own personality and way of thinking we as muslims are obliged to follow the prophet sallam he is our role model we are obliged to follow this the companions if they don't go against the quran and sunnah and if they don't go against one another meaning they all agree on that opinion but to come seven or eight centuries after them and ask whether ebitemia did this or that i wouldn't know and even if i were to know this doesn't make any difference because the hadith is crystal clear and allah knows best"
