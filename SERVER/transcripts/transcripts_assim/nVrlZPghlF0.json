  "title": "If I breastfeed a baby girl would she became mahram for my husband",
  "transcript": "Last question is uh Rafia's question. If I uh she's she's a female, she's talking about herself. If I breast uh feed a girl uh that is a baby, an infant, will she become maharam for my husband, son, father, and brother? And what are the obligations upon her? Suckling or breastfeeding is one of the ways that a person becomes a maham to that woman who breastfed him. She becomes his mother through breastfeeding and all those related to her become related to him because he is now her son. Providing that the suckling takes place within two years of his uh uh life. If he exceeds two years of age, then the suckling is not counted and that he suckles five meals. And if this happens, if a woman suckles a um a baby girl who is like 10 months old and she feeds her five meals five times in this case, uh she becomes her daughter and her husband, the woman's huh husband becomes her father through suckling. And the brothers of the woman becomes her uncles. And the uh uh uh the sons of the woman from previous marriages or coming marriages become the brothers of this baby girl. What are the obligations upon her? To be kind and to be uh to honor them. But it it is nothing close to a biological woman. A real let me well let me rephrase that. It is nothing close to a biological mother because the rights of a mother are far exceeding the rights of a suckling uh uh mother. Even if that suckling mother brought her up and was kind to her and took care of her, still she is not related to her through blood but rather through suckling. So what are the obligations? Of course she um becomes a maham uh she can travel with the relatives of that suckling woman uh the husband or uh her brothers through suckling uh etc. But there are no relationship in terms of um for example inheritance. She cannot be inherit she cannot inherit that woman or her relatives. She um also is not obliged to obey and respect her as she does with her original parents. Allahel knows best. We have calls"
