  "title": "Allah's 99 Names and Attributes",
  "transcript": "as for the hadith allah azza wajal night has 99 names a hundred minus one whoever counts them whoever calculates them whoever understands them implements them then allah azza wajal would admit him to Jenna these 99 names are not the attributes see we have names and we have attributes the chapter that deals with attributes is far wider than the limited chapter that deals with names limited to our knowledge not limited due to allah's limited number of names because we know that allah has names beyond our imagination there in finite this is what the Prophet said that I saw someone and he said that on the day of judgment I will ask for permission I'll be granted this permission I will come to a Las court and I will prostrate in Allah would open my heart with praisings and names of Allah that I did not anticipate and also in the hadith was a look at me could this mean who Alec I asked you with every name that is yours whether you have named yourself with it or you taught it to some of your servants messengers prophets or you evenly revealed it in one of your scriptures or you have kept it with you in the world of the unseen meaning that there are names that we are unable to think of or to imagine so the 99 names are only names and not attributes what is the difference a name is seer here attribute is the attribute of seeing the attribute of hearing he is a high and high is a name and the attribute is al-hayat life so it goes on and on and alo'so gel knows best"
