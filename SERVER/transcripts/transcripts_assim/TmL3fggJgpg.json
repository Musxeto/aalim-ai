  "transcript": "alham we all know that the Quran is Allah's word and it's Allah's attribute and it's the last Testament that nothing will come after after it it is the miracle given to our Prophet Muhammad Alat wasam and we are the bearers and the holders of the torch after him why is it to Miracle it's the only scripture on Earth that has not been changed since it was revealed 15 centuries not a single letter is changed and the challenge stands duplicate if you can duplicate 10 suras one Surah 10 ay one Ayah no one can they've tried and failed miserably sh the lecture is about the steps of Shan is it why would I introduce this in the beginning because Allah mentioned the devil the Shan Satan in the Quran and there are among the Muslims who deny the existence of Jin or of the Devils or of Shan anyone who denies anything in the Quran is a blatant cfir an apostate no matter how many rakas he prays per day or how many Ramadan he fasts throughout his life or how many Hajj he performs the moment you reject a single letter from the Quran you are a whether you like it or not as I said previously this is something I've heard from the Americans and the Canadians you are a Don't Judge Me No I'm going to judge you I am going to judge you this is my duty and whoever does not recognize an individual of being a cfir he's a cfir you know someone is rejecting something from the Quran and you're refraining from saying that he's a cfir we showed him we taught him we gave him all the evidences and proofs that he still no I don't believe in the existence of Jin I don't see them then he is a blatant cfir so to start our talk Allah told us in the Quran that or Satan or Shan is our enemy so take him as an enemy this is a command from Allah take him as an enemy and in order to take him as an enemy we have to re recognize his tricks and the way he acts his strategies in order to be careful and aware so that we would not be fooled or tempted by him unfortunately and I do this a lot I do counseling session for those who have OCD and they come and they say we would like to book 10 sessions no one is need only one and some some of them even don't finish 10 minutes in a session so I save 20 minutes off why people are so blinded they don't see the moment you open their eyes whoa I didn't know that it was that easy okay now you recognize yes I know my enemy alhamdulillah go give him a cookie and he goes away so we have to adhere and and and acknowledge his tricks but this is also not enough knowledge is not enough okay how if a doctor tells you that you have the following illnesses in you and these are the medication that with the grace of Allah will cure you will you be cured why not you have to take the medication you have to walk the talk so acknowledging his tricks is not enough everyone knows smoking kills smoking is bad smoking is Haram smoking is from the yet they still smoke and if you give them an A4 paper to write the disadvantages and harms of smoking they would fill three four pages but they still enjoy smoking so this is a problem that all Muslims have they have to implement the knowledge otherwise it's going to backfire now you're here in this beautiful whole blessed Institute you're learning something maybe you already know it but this is something you're going to be held accountable on the day of judgment you had the knowledge why didn't you do it why didn't you implement it now this is H upon you that Allah Asel would hold against you or if you walk the talk you're in good hands inshallah in the the Quran Allah asael says oh you who believe do not follow the footsteps of Satan footsteps wouldn't it been easier to say do not follow Satan logical why footsteps Quran is a miracle because it's in Arabic and the way it was formed is from Allah who said it so it is so perfect above or or Beyond Perfection that we know of Allah says do not come close to Zena to fornication he did not say Do not fornicate it would have been sufficient why because do not come close means that anything that would draw you closer to it is Haram gaze not lowered Haram perfume applied by by women that tempts men and seduces them Haram the anklets that women used to wear and makes a sound and men with weak hearts or with illnesses in their heart would be tempted is Haram for a woman to wear Sometimes women don't wear those wear high heels and you hear the heels tick tock tick tock and the man y Allah this is Miss Universe walking and he doesn't know she's a gorilla on Heels you you never know but this is how shaan works so don't come close to Zena Allah says about the intoxic intoxicants stay away from it he did not say don't drink it because again you can't sit with someone who drinks you cannot join them you cannot uh uh purchase it for someone you canot make it manufacture it sell it so this is the eloquentia you're crazy you're out of your leak but Shan starts with little little things a video clip a song a a poetry a uh a flirting comment little little things and he builds up on them these are the steps of shatan someone tells you let's steal let's rob a bank said you're crazy this is okay what about under the table if I give you like $50 and you do this for me which is against theone okay don't pay me uh uh through bank account because they will tax me for it pay me cash so little by little you follow the footsteps of shaitan so what are the footsteps of shaan Scholars say that that there are seven major obstacles and this is what said hundreds of years ago there are seven main obstacles that shatan places in front of each and every one of you and by the way if you were to look at my resume my CV you will find it to be a little bit thick training courses jobs positions Etc long lifelong jobs how many pages do you think Satan has in his CV not it's not enough since the time of Adam peace be upon him he's been working relentlessly 7 Days uh uh 24 hours 7 days a week non-stop no time off no holiday he's a hard worker the so but inevitably he has experience he knows what makes you click and this is the danger of him he runs in our veins like the blood as the prophet said so he knows our inner thoughts he knows our inner thoughts yes Allah gave him the capability to know what we think of that's why when you go to the circus or to the to a soothsayer and he says I know what's in your pocket and he tells you what's in your pocket how did he know that his Jin spoke to your Jin and they communicated and he told him that he has this much in his pocket and this is what so many people are deceived by they don't know the Unseen but the Unseen is relative for example what's behind this door is unseen but someone who's inside knows what's in it so does he know the r no so it is a relative issue but this is not an issue so what are the seven obstacles that Satan has developed throughout the years and centuries number one the main objective of Satan in this life is to get you into hell full stop how it doesn't matter whatever you do as long as the final conclusion is that he manages to have you accompany him in Hellfire for eternity that's good news chapter 14 Surah ibraim verse number 22 very easy 1422 Allah tells us about the oration the of Satan in Hellfire when people of Hell come and blame him and complain you are the reason we're in hell it's all because of you Allah says that Satan says Allah has promised you the truth truth I promised you and betrayed you I had no control over you except to call you and you responded and answered me so don't blame me rather blame yourselves I'm not going to benefit you and you are not going to benefit me so whatever you do don't say well I was overwhelmed Shan had control over me Allah says he had no control over you Allah says in the Quran the plotting of Satan is weak so I believe Allah it's you who called him in and asked him to do whatever he wants to do and gave him the Liberty to do so so his main objective is to get you in Hellfire how obstacle number one and this is the most preferred and beloved thing to Satan's heart through kufur or shik if he manages to get you out of the fold of Islam or to associate others with Allah then he had one because this is the only sin that is Unforgiven Allah does not forgive shik or kufur if you die in such a state yes if you committed shik today and you repent and feel remorseful and ask Allah for rep for forgiveness Allah forgives you no problem but if you die in that state you are bound to hell my friend for eternity so grave worshippers those who go to the graves and start to rub the graves and claim that they can help and they can do this and can do that and they call the deceased as if they are alive this is shik Sorcerers who deal with with with magic with Jin this is shik those who believe that some someone knows the Unseen soothsayers fortune tellers they believe them this is shik and kufur those who reject any ruling of Islam I don't believe that it's mandatory to pray I think that prayer is between me and my lord it's in my heart as long as I'm a Muslim and a Believer that's enough if you reject prayer you're a cafir if you reject it is mandatory to fast you're a cafir any rejection of the rules of Islam that is well known by default there's no ambiguity in it this is kufur because it is well established in Islam so Those who commit kufur or commit shik those who make jokes about Islam about the Quran about Allah about Prophet Muhammad Alam about any ritual this is an act that takes you out of the fold of Islam so this is what Shan wants and would love to hold you cap in because then he doesn't have to work anymore mission accomplished he goes somewhere else now if you and all of you inshallah are like this if you abide by the and your conviction and belief in Allah okay no problem we have six more obstacles he tries to get you captive in the second obstacle what is that second obstacle huh [Music] half an hour later whoa that's more dangerous than major sense yes why you guys from Saudi you always come say all what you know is what is this everything we do you you guys you have some you have issues man you got to check with with the doctors with the psychiatrist everything yeah come let's come to Common terms I did not say this it was the prophet Muhammad Alat wasam he says whoever innovates in our religion what is not part of it it is rejected so is the religion fine is the religion complete yes Allah says in the Quran this day this is on the 10th year of hij in this Ayah was revealed to the prophet Alat wasam Allah says this day I have perfected for you your religion and completed my favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as a religion so you tell me is or was Islam completed at the time of the prophet yes or no can anyone come 10 years after his death and say whoops we forgot a loose bolt can we please tie it we would like to increase this by the way uh we s something that's not uh normal is three we'd like to add one ra so that would be all even can anyone do this why because the religion is complete so now if someone comes after M prayer finish Salat the IM finishes faces the congregation and says okay let's read Subhan Allah 33 times everybody subh subh let's read alhamdulillah 33 times hey hey whoa hold your horses my friend what are you doing he says uh this is good for you did the prophet do itam yes or no no so where did you bring this VI Quran please it's not found Sunnah please it's not found so what is this end of story if someone introduces things to the dean no authentic Hadith backing it up and insists on doing it why well our forefathers used to do it every time we say what are you doing I'm holding my head doing for what if it is in the Sunnah I will do both H I have no problem and sometimes with flexibility I can put my foot on my head I'm very flexible but give me what the otherwise we can introduce to the dean what's not part of it and the sad thing is you think that you're doing something good while Allah is angry with you Satan is Happy the prophet says in an authentic Allah has blocked repentance from everyone who commits B scholar said whoa we know that Allah accepts repentance how would he block repentance the scholars said ah Allah does not prevent in the sense that he does not accept Allah accepts anyone who repents but but those who innovate don't think that they're innovating go to them when they're swirling doing VI Allah and they're swirling in the Masjid like the tornado category number five good for you mallah you go to Jenna straight what are you doing said oh this is we are in a state of you in a state of hallucination change the brand my friend this is not good for you it's bad it's doing making you do things that are not from Islam show me any of the Prophet any of the companions that he had ever done such a thing the the the scholars of Islam any Tom Dick or Hari no one does this so excuse me is the religion complete or are you doing an innovation now you put him between a rock and a heart place so B is something that Shan loves he adors it because you're changing the dean and the that thing is everyone who does B is an arrogant imbecile arrogance in his heart never allows him to accept what you're saying to him especially those blind followers in some continent I would not say the subcontinent I'm not racist some blind followers you go there and the IM says you say they'll lock you up for half an hour after Salah what are you doing W he some m they lock you they have a small jail and I had people students of mine coming if I say a or I raise my hands in and and rising from the r it's an issue of dispute only in the Han school of thought but it's an issue of dispute your prayer is valid don't do it but if I do it you have the audacity to put him in jail yeah what is this this is Islam so B is beautiful to Shan he loves it now all of you masallah you go by the authentic you don't have this nonsense in your agenda so no can do mashallah good for youan says no problem we still have five obstacles number three if he misses you inur if he misses you in the third station the third stop would help what is it major sins major sins okay what is this major sins and minor sins tell me about it Allah classified and categorized sins in the Quran into two major and minor he says if you avoid the major sins the minor sins will be forgiven and that's a glad Tiding from Allah this is a gift from Allah subhana T but what is the definition of major sins the vast majority of Muslims today when you tell him what you're doing is Haram said I don't drink I don't kill I don't steal and I don't fornicate I'm not doing any Haram thinking that theab the major sins are limited into seven that's what they think IB Abbas may Allah be pleased with him was ask are the major sins seven IB Abbas said they are closer to 70 than seven there almost 70 major sins whoa that's too much we know that's seven but 70 we have Houston we have a problem well we do have a problem because the definition of major sins is any sin that Allah had a prescribed punishment for execution flogging chopping the hand and the likes this is a major sin or Allah told that whoever does this is cursed by Allah or he will go into Hellfire then this is a or deprived from Allah's Mercy these are the criterias that you can Define which is a major sin and which is not this includes all what you know from the sins back biting is a major sin slandering gossiping lying cheating stealing deceiving people people arrogance boasting about your good deeds all of these are major sins so Shan tries his level best to hold you in that station if you haveed and you have Sunnah and you have good Iman and conviction in your heart that would block you from falling into major sins no worries he'll take you in the minor sins and the minor sins who doesn't do minor sin here raise your hands nobody no no no no no no no no don't raise your hands everyone makes major sense uh minor sense minor sense is things that we don't pay attention to for example the gays not you see Brothers in the street what are you doing oh this is the first look I didn't blink I didn't blink don't hold me accountable no this is you have to lower the Gaze this is a minor sin so many things that we can mention that are not under the major sins category can be classified as minor sins but because their minor people take it lightly listen to The Prophet Alat wasam saying beware of trivial sins for they will accumulate until they destroy a like a group of people who stopped to camp in the wilderness and they wanted to prepare some food they wanted to cook so one man went and brought a stick another person went and brought another stick small stick and they gathered a huge pile and let a fire and whatever they put in the pot was cooked as a result this is an example from the prophet Alat beautiful a stick doesn't start a fire it's a stick it can't cook anything and this is a small minor sin but when you gather more and more minor sins to it then you have a big problem that may result in dragging you to Hell Fire without you knowing it because once you get accustomed to minor sins it's by human nature you want to go a bit further you want to push the uh uh um the line a little bit when we were when we were young we used to love to watch Tom and Jerry and now Tom and Jerry are grandfathers Mah kalas they're too old for the new generation the SpongeBob maybe I don't know so when you reach the age of 10 or 11 Tom and Jer is not exciting enough you want to see something more uh adventurous a little bit fighting so you go to maybe anamy maybe to Japanese uh um granders and and and the likes when you're 14 or 15 past the age of puberty PG is not good enough for you you want to go for R rated R yes I want to see some flesh I want to see some blood I want to see some explosions killing violence and then when you're out for college and you don't have anyone to monitor your PC or your iPad or then we go to you know what this is Shan and later down the line you want to try The Real McCoy I don't want to watch I want to experiment do not follow the steps of Shan so these minor sins when you get accustomed to them after a while it doesn't work I need a higher dose and without knowing it you will OD may Allah protect us on on sins seriously why why do people o D they started with a with with a normal cigarette Mar B and then they went for a a joint someone said come on it's G to make you feel high and happy and you eat a lot of Doritos afterwards so no problem just go for it then cannabis then maybe some cocaine maybe some uh amphetamin maybe some crack maybe little by little injection heroin and after a few weeks well he used to come with us in but then Subhan Allah he went down the drain he ODed this is what's happening and that's why those like us we have a fence that protects us we have the night prayer if we miss and thean penetrates we have if we miss and he penetrates we have praying in the Masjid five times a day if we miss and he penetrates we pray five times a day in the home but we have fence after fence after fence and when Shan penetrates and infiltrates all all our defense lines then this is when another one bites the dust so if you manage to avoid minor sins then you are a perfect and a good individual you've almost made it and I say almost why because Shan is Relentless he's not going to let you alone so what is going to do no sh no no no what is that going to do let him test me you know what he's going to do what's number five sinko good I'm not asking you about your Spanish ISM what's what's number five permissible things come on is this an obstacle yes she is eating a a cupcake becoming an obstacle is doing something Halal reading an encyclopedia reading a car magazine watching uh nature shows these are all permissible Hal isn't there any problem yes there is any there is a problem because basically speaking doing this a little is fine the problem is Shan in the beginning makes you do them a little then a little bit more then a lot until it consumes your time once it consumes your time with in the back of your head it's permissible I'm not doing any but you don't know that by doing a lot of it it's going to reduce the amount of Good Deeds you're doing so instead of praying two Hours night prayer tud now you're praying only half an hour because you spent a little bit more time instead of sleeping at 10: you slept at 11:30 so you woke up a little uh beaten up and little by little he will make these permissible things make you skip Sunan prayers I didn't do Haram but I was go carting with with the boys we went for two three hours I was paint uh uh what is it ball paintballing is this just a verb even I don't know I many people ask me to join them in paintball and I say I can't because I have very weak knees if I go down and shoot I cannot come up so but it's fun I I would love to try it go- carting I love to do go-karting um target shooting beautiful Hal but once it exceeds like so many people I know in my country the the the in in where I come from they fancy fishing but fishing if you know would take six or seven hours of your time just sitting there and you will skip prayers with the JAMA Halal I am almost semi- trving and it becomes a weekly habit then twice a week and then yeah go to the fish market and buy a full ice box and just tell people I I fished it and save a lot of hours so this is what Shan does little by little creeping into your system you lose great deal of reward through doing permissible things but if you were to avoid this fifth obstacle and there are a handful in this world who do unfortunately not everyone can do this it it is way way up there in the ranking of the Believers that they don't do shik they don't do B they don't do major sins or minor sins and they're not preoccupied with permissible things they have a strict routine they do everything on time they know how to divide and balance their times so what is the sixth obstacle now Shan is very smart he utilizes the sources and the time so I know this individual is pretty pretty smart and on the Sunnah he is an excellent servant of Allah so instead of him harvesting a million Good Deeds every day I'm happy if he harvests 700,000 a loss of 300,000 for you is a gain for Shan imagine how evil he is yeah if I can reduce your gains I'm I'm happy with that but I will keep on trying to reduce them reduce them reduce them until I get you in the permissible uh uh level but meanwhile I'll try to reduce your gains how by making you choose what's not the best at the time for example we inshallah say I mean I didn't make a Dua wait wait they want to just leave I pray that we all inshallah on the 27th night of Ramadan be in Makkah in in this is not but it's most likely to be and hoping it is so imagine yourself there for a blessed night better than a month whoever praise it anticipa the reward with Allah and believing in it its virtues Allah will forgive all his previous sins what a great benefit one gets inam one prayer is equivalent to 100,000 yeah imagine the prayer in Medina is equivalent to a th000 so if you pray one day five time five prayers in Haram of mecah this is equivalent to a 100 days in Medina money want wi I always go to Mecca seriously because the money I spend as a merchant it's it's more return of investment over there so we inshallah are all in Haram and one of you gets a call after mam alayam listen your uncle has just arrived and he's resting in this hotel how about we go and have dinner and with him and spend the night this is connecting your NEX of there is a Allah did this Allah will do this for those who do not civer their kinship and who connect to their kinship is he right yes the reward is way way there in the Good Deeds but wait a this reward can be achieved tomorrow can be achieved after Ramadan can be achieved in the morning time at the moment has a limited time if I miss it it's gone Shan is happy if you miss it he's okay do whatever Good Deeds you want go and feed the orphans feeding the orphans and the hungry this is very good uh uh business leave the Salat take the baskets of of food and dates and let's go to The Villages and give but I I I'll waste it's okay this good deeds this is what is known as this is howan thinks but we don't think like this because we don't open our eyes and see what he is doing so now we we have six so number one alhamdulillah withed we managed to pass this Obstacle of shik and kufur with Sunnah we managed to pass the Obstacle of innovation with conviction and determination major and minor sins with knowledge we manage to avoid the uh permissible and the way weighing of good deeds and taking what is more heavier in the scale there is the seventh obstacle that stands in our way this obstacle says if you escaped all these six obstacle then there's a seventh obstacle not a single human being managed to escape it not even the prophets or The Messengers o I have to know this well this is what you'll hear after the commercials in so stay tuned leaving them on suspense this is even more expensive than the Super Bowl so what is this that even the prophets and The Messengers could not Escape says is when Shan gives up hope he orders his soldiers from the gin and from the humans to abuse you physic physically mentally and verbally these are the en these are the soldiers of shatan they will come to you and they will do heinous things to you they will torture you they will attack you they will say bad things about you and this is not in my capacity there's nothing I could do about it someone is coming to attack me to say bad things about me and the more you go up the more attacks you should get and this is why when when people throw stones at you remember that they throw stones at a tree that has Apples because of its fruits and this obstacle you have no way out of it other than to be patient and to be tolerant and to continue to do what you're doing because this is what makes Satan angry and this is his last resort in getting you out of the straight path into other venues of his obstacles so these seven obstacles are the ones that we have to open our eyes to and to be careful not to fall into and no one unfortunately is capable of coming and holding your hand and say you're an obstacle number three and even if they do probably you're G to spit in their faces it's not of your business we need Brothers to hold on to us and say this is Haram and you have to be appreciative and grateful and show you gratitude to the brother by saying Wallah I love you for the sake of Allah all those brothers did not tell me I was doing something wrong you came up to me may Allah reward you we need to stand by one another we need Brothers to be our back a rock and we need and sisters need sisters to be also their advisers and their mentors and their beloved sister who would give them advice for the sake of Allah only through this we would manage with the grace of Allah to avoid falling into Shan's straps and Allah knows best I go we'll have Q&A she is that okay yes we'll obviously begin with the sisters because this is uh primarily sisters uh in Institute and ladies first inshallah so uh just because we don't really have U any QR system uh made what we're going to do is we're going to start with the rule of so the people in the first rows will get uh first preference and inshallah one question uh the sister over here for the ladies we will um she will bring the mic to you and we'll start off over here because she raised her hand first and inshallah we'll take uh three questions from the sisters and then we'll take three questions from the brothers and uh likewise from the brothers from the first row and um we can can then continue from there alikum okay Asam Alum uh I have a question about face covering like um is it optional or it's a compulsory according to Quran and Sunnah for men okay face covering is an issue of dispute among Scholars and I remember maybe 12 14 years ago I had a discussion in Green Lane Masjid in Birmingham with Abu us zabi our beloved uh Sheikh and brother and it was a in a mid like this in a gathering so he took the side of uh the scholars who say it's not mandatory and I took the side of the scholars that say it is mandatory and I mentioned and I think it's on YouTube the evidences from the Quran and the Sunnah and in a nutshell whoever covers her face can anyone come and condemn her and say oh this is not good it's an innovation no it's part of Islam what do you mean part of Islam the prophet saidat that the woman in the state of must not wear the or the gloves which means that in other state of theam she can or she's recommended to wear nikab and gloves it was something practiced secondly it was the covering of the mothers of the Believers by all consensus of Scholars they used to we the full hijab or the full face cover the evidence chapter 33ah verse 53 Allah says and if you were to ask them for any of the utensils oh Companions of the Prophet abak if you were to ask the mothers of the Believers your mothers anything of the utensils ask them from Beyond a why this is Pur for your hearts abaki and their hearts Z habba J and the rest Subhan Allah who is in need of purity of heart more us or them definitely us thirdly we agree that they have the cover of the face mandatory there's no dispute among Scholars ever they all agree mothers of the Believers must cover their faces okay if we go to verse 59 in the same Surah Allah says oh prophet of Allah instruct and order your wives your daughters and the women of the Believers to lower their jilbab so that they would not be recognized otherwise uh uh harassed now let's not look into not being harassed different of opinion among Scholars of the interpretation let's look at the logical thing oh prophet of Muhammad tell your wives okay tell your wives to do what this is six ayas after ordering them to to wear the hijab the full hijab tell them to lower their jilbab okay now I know how to lower their jilbab to cover what about your daughters and the women of the Believers they should follow suit so if we agree that the hijab of the mothers of the Believers is to cover their faces then we have to by default agree that hijab of the daughters of the prophet and the mother and and the rest of the women is the same but again this is not our topic so inshallah this answers your question alikum so you mentioned about the B and then you mentioned about the collective VI after FAS so is it not permissible to do VI even when you're alone after F namas or is it only for the collective prayers it's only for Vick in congregation why because the prophet used to do alone and he used to instruct us to say the alone and all the companions used to do it alone so this is not a b because everybody was doing it now for the IM to come and say it they have to Pro provide me the proof If I go to some countries in the Middle East between before aan by 15 minutes of f the MU grabs the mic and starts to recite the last twoy of beautiful sound truly especially in turkey and the rest of and Syria beautiful sounds but this is a blatant B what are you doing this is not from Islam so though it looks nice it is not nice because the prophet did not do it likewise and I'm going to throw a clean bomb not a dirty bomb and it's a safe bomb not something of terrorist activities likewise with M oh now again you're becoming Saudi who doesn't love the prophet Alam raise your hands watch people are with stones here everyone loves the prophet Alam wall anything that would draw us closer to sit with him in Paradise we will do even if we buy tickets we'll buy we'll do anything we we have nothing more beloved to our hearts than the prophet more than our parents more than our wives more than our children more than our own selves we love him we're ready to sacrifice our lives for himat but did he ever participate in a m of his own yes or no did he participate in a m of his beloved Messengers such as ibraim or Isa at least throw a Christmas party and you they they're your ancestors he didn't okay maybe he was too big busy companions abak Ali do you love Prophet mhammad without any doubt so did anybody of them practice it no Subhan Allah okay the whole companions none not a single one okay the who came afterwards Hass the whole nine yards none what's wrong they don't love the prophet okay none of the favorite three generations had ever celebrated now you you ignorant imbecile come and claim that you know more than them and that you love the prophet more than them isn't this a w he Satan is so happy with you and he says man you're doing a good job keep up the good work we follow the prophet Alat follow his Sunnah to the letter even if they say you're extremist you're a fundamentalist you're too rigid sue me I don't care as long as I'm following Quran and Sunnah to the letter I guarantee inshallah inshallah that I'll be with the prophet Alam like you guys because what we're doing is complying to his instruction whoever obeys me will enter Jenna and we do our level best to obey him so I hope this answers your question question about the youth kids teen kids and actually here in our Muslim Community we try our best to make them practicing Islam and all but uh in school or colleges they are out for six to seven hours and there is a fitna sometimes when we don't allow them to watch movies listen to music and pray and all these things but after uh going out uh other kids or they they make fun of them oh you don't uh uh watch movies and all that and they sometimes I see they fall uh uh feel the peer pressure from out of that what advice will give to the such a youth or the parents how they should balance these number one migrate you are in the wrong country go to a Muslim country if you can I know the vast majority of you can't and this is a sad story option number two put them in a Muslim school and work hard what do you mean a lot of the parents work to gain money and put their children in Islamic school and they wash their hands and sanitize it what do you mean the school will take care of them no the school is only a brick in the wall you are the foundation in the house so it's not enough that you I took them to a uh school I took them to a Sunday school and the boy is is not becoming a good Muslim because he doesn't see you walk the talk he goes home and watches you watching Netflix games of thr season 15 the father what is this it's okay it's okay go go and play in the playground or do whatever you want and the mom is on the phone all the time or with her girls and and and and uh friends and parties and so the Islamic parties of course so you are failing miserably in the home no you have to struggle and burn yourself like a candle in the night to give light to this young youngster by giving them Quality Time by substituting them no movies okay what's the substitute I don't know go to the to school go to Quran he will not live like Quran he will hate Quran no movies substitute let's go to the park let's go to the fun fair

hours to fly from one end to the other what is this oh what you see is desert in in my country we see desert here we see snow what what makes you live here I don't know it's your choice it's your preference but you have to substitute so Muslim schools option three I can't afford a Muslim School my paycheck doesn't allow me to do this I have to put them in uh Public Schools well public school is yeah a furnace will burn all the things good and bad public school is fitna imagine me teaching in a public school oh whoa wow that'll be fun I will not survive a Week seriously so you should do homeschooling if you can for girls at least no Public School do homeschooling boys if the boy is yeah raised well um well behaved have has a lot of good friends in the class that he can segregate himself I'm monitoring him all the time he's the bread winner he has to go girls usually they'll managed to get married inshallah and on their way so they don't have to have high aspiration for no I want to be a nuclear scientist why don't be we have so many men no no I'd like you g to mix with men you're GNA do this you're GNA do Haram well me too movement needs me well I can't do anything about that so you have to strive and struggle it's not an easy thing oh I have lots of kids Allah okay what did you do for them nothing then you are sinful you have to put your effort until you die in bringing these children to be imams of Islam and the Muslim to the best of your ability now is there any guarantee that they will be no but whenever you establish and set the foundation and the children grow on correct cemented Foundation of Islam they may drift somewhere down the line but they will come back inevitably they will come back to that what they were brought up to but if you leave them unattended then it's a big problem so it's not something that we can answer in one question it needs yeah brainstorming it need to take to talk and and and discuss this in a lecture or more maybe Allah will and and I'm talking without experience huh I live in the land of Islam alhamdulillah 12 of my daughters memorize the Quran in school I have 13 the 13th one no she went to a technological school so but she's trying so yeah I had it made the mothers of my daughters were mallah 24 hours 7 Days focused on the girls trying to give them everything they need to substitute Haram we never had Haram TV at all imagine growing up my eldest is 39 years old she had not had a Haram TV public TV in home all Islamic stuff and they were the best in their grades in school no Tom and Jerry had Tom and Jerry we did not have I I believe that it it was not modest to have Tom and Jerry especially when he paints his tail like a woman in Hawaii in bikini to to seduce the mouse this is what is this anyhow this is not our topic so you have to work hard and if you do make Dua andj W every time I pray I make Dua in my sujud I cannot do anything alone I need Allah to help me raise my children and to make them steadfast and to make them memorize the Quran and revise it over and over I make Dua every time for my kids you have to do this and when you do this Allah is with you think positive of Allah Allah will not let you down ever and Allah knows rest I I don't choose they choose if a couple is um having fertility issues for more than a decade can they go for adoption is it permissable so let me if I heard the question correctly if a couple don't have children can they go for adoption adoption is open even for for people with children the prophet said I with the person who sponsors an orphan like this sponsoring an orphan is not sending $200 to some orphanage in a Muslim world no sponsoring an orphanage to getting him in your home with your children feeding from your food and and and living under your roof this is the actual thing so this is halal but but the problem here in the west that there are many many no Nos and wrong uh things number one you cannot name the child to take your name or his adopted Mother's name so your name is chodri and the child's original name is Khan you cannot name him Muhammad Muhammad Chri give him your name or he's the son of no he has to be called after his original biological father she he's an orphan we don't know who his his father is give him a generic name so say that his name is Muhammad IB abdah his father is Abdullah true we're all Abdullah everyone is Abdullah so this is not lying what about the last name she he is Muhammad Abdullah tonti attributed to Toronto and is from AWA it's that would be difficult to make but you get you the point we have so many people in the Arab world is named al- misami alwi alwi they they attribute such there are families by this name but they attribute someone who they do not know their lineage into it so it's a generic name number two he does not inherit from you like a child because he's not your blood number three if he's a boy when he reaches or approaches the age of puberty he cannot see your wife without hijab she she raised him yes but she's not M to him now to avoid this give her medication If the child is below two years of age give her medication so she could have uh a milk to suckle them and breastfeed him five meals and then he becomes her son and he by default becomes your son oh that's good the same thing go goes with the girl she but we've adopted a girl when she was three years the old suckling doesn't work well you have to have her wear the hijab when she reaches the age of puberty of like 10 or 11 and you can't mix with her you can't speak with her you can't do this because she's nonaham to you so these difficulties if you avoid them alhamdulillah you're good to go there's a difference opinion in the me of if you could give it a little insight if he can have a chicken or meat with Canada this is an issue everywhere I go people ask me about it and I said it so many times throughout the year and lately some of the duat went on the Rampage and started rapid fire against me and I made a video about 15 minutes on YouTube I clarified all the instruction and in a nutshell in a nutshell you don't want to eat good for you don't go to Halal shop and eat from them you're safe but the Islamic ruling as per chapter five Ayah five Sur Ayah number five that the slaughtering of the Animals by the people of book is halal for us to eat this is mentioned in the Quran and the doing of the prophet am confirms this when a Jewish woman invited him to a ram he accepted an invitation and ate from the ram without checking with is it halal meat or not was it slaughtered or not was it bought from Halal money or from extortion and from RBA as you Jews always do he didn't he just said B and ate and inah Muslim the companions came to the prophet Alam saying to him oh prophet of Allah some people of the book bring us food and we don't know when whether they've mentioned the name of Allah before slaughtering it or not so the prophet said you say bah and eat the prophet could have asked them and said well when they bring you the food ask them was it slaughtered or not did you mention the name of Allah or not he didn't he simply said you say bismah and eat because the default is all people of the book Slaughter and their animals that they slaughter the meat is halal for us now people bring up what if so they say what if they don't Slaughter in slaughter houses said what if your father is not your biological father do you have a DNA how dare you how dare you ass me what you got to do you got do nothing I have two bodyguards with me coming with me and going with me alhamdulillah they're taller than me so seriously speaking we're talking about issues of Islam technicalities the Allah says the slaughtering of the Animals by the people of the book is Hal for you now you say what if I say prove it is it's as if I'm saying what if your hoodie has NASA on it how dare you pray and said there is no Nas said what if a lizard came and pooped and went and you don't see its poop what are you going to do well I never thought of this she should I pray again come on give me a break you you need a counseling session but you have to pay for it so this is how I make business huh so these guys make business they they come to me like crazy and they have these weird questions what if Islam is not based on what if Islam is based on proof and evidence oh prophet of Allah while I'm praying I feel that I passed wind should I break my prayer the prophet did not say yes he said do not break your prayer until you hear a sound or find an offensive OD proof So when you say that maybe they don't Slaughter in these slaughter houses I said prove it to me if you don't have proof I have Quran and Sunnah why would I go against it just because you don't like it you don't like it go to the Hal shop and buy it I have no problem with that but don't force your opinion upon me and say sh you're eating from these cfir countries in America and Canada and this is Haram no you say Haram bring evidence you don't have evidence keep a mouth shut please uh what is the more correct opinion about bring fat behind the Imam okay again yeah guys watch my YouTube channel I discussed all of this in detail now it's an issue of dispute and the issue of dispute is highly um between Imam Abu hanifah who says it's not to be recited and IM Al bukari who says it's must be recited and the schools of thought went different ways compiled a very small booklet it's called the ruling on reciting before behind the Imam so in silent ra silent prayers and Silent ra there is no dispute among Scholars the IM the follower and the individual praying alone they must pray the fa in every RA in what silent such as two last of one last of and which they awake alhamdulillah bingo so they all agree you have to the three categories Imam individual and follower they must recite the faat otherwise your prayer is invalid because it's a rook it's a pillar in loud raas they all agree that the IM and the individual must recite the fat imagine the IM coming in prayer doesn't recite the faat what's ruling on his prayer invalid imagine you are alone in the home and you skip F and you recite first prayer is invalid the follower here we come to a fork of the road because some say You must recite it the prophet said there's no prayer valid for those who do not recite the F so even if it is a low ra the IM recited it you as a follower must recite it others Scholars said no you don't recite it because and this Hadith is not that authentic but a lot of the scholars use it the recitation of the IM is sufficient for those behind him so when you look at the different opinions and one Hadith of abuur may Allah be pleased with him that the prophet once prayed and afterwards he finished the prayer and he said who was reciting behind me because he made me mix up my recitation if one of you were to recite do not recite except with only F you're allowed as a follower to recite you can't recite in loud ra and Abu said then afterwards they were even prohibited from doing that so some Scholars say oh this is an indication that even the fat you don't recite so it's an issue of dispute IMB said that from all the evidences reciting the fa is not mandatory it is highly recommended for the follower so if you find a place or a gap to recite it good for you if you don't your prayer is valid and this is the opinion of IM Malik that in silent you have to in uh uh loud R you don't have to and I choose this opinion and Allah knows best I can't if is silent it's silent is silent you have to recite it yes sir for everyone joining us today and that will be the end of the session inshallah we have just one two announcements before Adan um just because there's a lot of people over here we don't want any mishaps uh so the there's a couple of things that we want to just keep in mind number one um the uh uh the Sheik will pray with us and after we would just want to respect that the Sheik can just leave so everybody if they can just remain if you want to pray your sunnas you can pray your sunas as well um the second thing is is that when the shik will leave once he's left then everybody can um go as well there's going to be a lot of people so just be patient and um just make sure that inshallah we we treat each other well uh the other thing is is that um just because there's a lot more people here uh we might be a little bit tight right but a lot of us Muslims we're not used to shoulder Tosh shoulder feet to feet so it's okay if your brother is standing right next to you and he's a little bit squished that's good Allah likes a that is uh I believe so we want to make sure that we are feet to feet shoulder Tosh shoulder if you can give way to other people that'll be good and if there is no room um uh I would request some of the brothers from the back because the the the crowd will move this way if some of the brothers at the back if they cannot pray they can pray inshallah right afterwards after we finish Salah so for joining us right after Salah I will have one two other announcements just as reminders we will have our Adan and right after Ouran we will begin Salah allahar"
