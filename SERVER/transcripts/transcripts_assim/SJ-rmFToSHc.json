  "title": "Contributing Attending Giving gifts 2 Non Muslim relative / friend for their wedding assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um can one contribute some money towards a non-muslim relatives you know wedding or can give them a gift during their marriage ceremony sure let me understand your question correctly what's the ruling on giving non-muslim friends or relatives a gift no non Muslim relatives when they are doing their marriage or contributing towards their marriage okay so are they marrying in a a church and the likes no you're not supposed to give them no no this is not permissible to participate in their rituals that are related to their religion such as marriages and funerals and uh baptizing the children and and the rest this is totally prohibited for a Muslim to contribute or to congratulate or to uh uh take part in and giving gifts is one of that so no you should not do that if they have a reception that is not related to their wedding in the church and part of thinking that your gift would maybe make their hearts inclined to Islam maybe this would be permissible and Allah Knows Best"
