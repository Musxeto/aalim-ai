  "transcript": "Abdulrahman from the US. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Sheikh, my question is regarding credit card hacking which is like opening up credit cards to receive like rewards. They say like let's say if you spend $5,000 within the first month, you get a certain amount of reward points and you can use those reward points to travel and stuff like that. We know that using credit card as a necessity is halal, but what if you're using it let's say to use these rewards that are gifts from the companies and what if they have an annual fee? Now the issue of credit card, the most authentic opinion is it's prohibited. Due to the fact that you have to pay sometimes an annual fee that is not logical and they put this annual fee according to the level of your card, whether it's silver, gold, platinum or diamond or whatever and the more benefits they give you, the higher the annual fee is which is not realistic. It's not in accordance to the actual paperwork they have to go through to issue you such a credit card. Secondly, they have a clause that states that you must pay them interest because they're giving you a loan. Whenever you use your credit card, they're actually lending you a thousand, five, ten thousand dollars and they give you a grace period of 40 days. If you pay within time, then there's no harm, but if you're late, if you're imprisoned or admitted to hospital and could not pay on time, they'll charge you riba for that and one this is one of the major sins in Islam. Allah has waged war against those who deal in riba, so it's a scary thing. Therefore it is not permissible to issue a credit card and the alternative is having a debit card where you charge your debit card with five thousand, ten thousand, twenty thousand euros, it's up to you and you can use this money which is yours until you run out of cash, then you charge it again and that's the Islamic alternative and it's halal. Now if a person says, well I live in the States and I have to build my credit and when I book airplane tickets or want to rent a car or get a hotel room, they don't accept debit card and this is debatable, but hypothetically assuming that is something that is required and needed for your day to day life and there's great hardship, in this case yes it's permissible for you to take a credit card, I would highly advise that you charge it up front before using it, so instead of lending from them you charge it with ten thousand euros or dollars and you can use that and whether the grace period is due or not, you already have the money with them so there's no possibility of getting riba from you and benefiting from the cash back on a credit card, this is permissible inshallah and Allah knows best."
