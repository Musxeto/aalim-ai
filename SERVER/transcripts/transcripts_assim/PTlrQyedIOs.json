  "title": "Would Allah answer a bad dua (curse) against me? How to protect ourselves from this assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so here I wanted to ask you um what is the ruling on Allah what is the ruling like is there a possibility that Allah answers about in the west possible way or one of the worst ways for example if someone says to another person you're going to fail the exam would this mean that Allah takes away their hands so then they call right or takes away the eyesight so then they can't provide for it just like a love for you foreign so this is something that only Allah can answer the prophet said in an authentic Hadith do not make Dua against yourselves against your children against your servants or against your wealth so that you may not coincide a time where Allah answers the Dua and he answers your Dua a time of distress many people would say out of their ignorance oh Allah take me destroy me o Allah  me because of their frustration and it so happens that this coincides with a time where Allah accepts the Dua and Allah accepts it so this is possible but when someone randomly makes Dua against you may Allah you may Allah break your back if you had not done a Bad Thing If You observe your ascar and you are a good Muslim the chances of Allah accepting such a bad Dua is very very minute so we shouldn't fear people's Dua if we are righteous and not oppressive or wrong wronging others we should have trust in Allah that Allah is fair and just and he would not hold us accountable for such uh um bad Dua that is not uh called for"
