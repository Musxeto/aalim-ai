  "title": "Can i come in front of non mahram infront of my parents for marriage proposal By Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Aisha has a question and she says can I come in front of a brother with loose Sha Sha or sha on my head and in the presence of my Maham brother or father for only few uh uh minutes so he can be satisfied and we can head to nikah to marriage also this brother does not have a mother or a sister so he does not have female relative that that he can trust in this very personal and sensitive matter please advise me the answer is yes what is AA asking about a man is proposing to her he doesn't have any female relatives that can come and take a look at the bride to be and go back to him to describe how beautiful she is how what's her height what's her uh skin color Etc things that would make him uh interested in getting married to her so when this is not possible she's asking is it possible for him to come and propose in the presence of my father or my my brother a Maham a male Maham and he would sit with me and take a good look at me as well as I would take a good look at him and then both of us can decide whether to go on with the marriage or not because he may see me and be interested in getting married to me so is this permissible the answer is definitely yes this is part of our Sunnah we don't have any blind marriages in Islam you don't go and marry someone without looking at her without sitting with her without talking to her because this gives you a better life in marriage afterwards but if you propose to someone and you get engaged and you get married without looking at her just only on the description of your mom or your sister and then on the wedding night you discover that she's a champane and not a human being well this is what your mom saw tough luck she needed a servant in the house she didn't want a model to please you then it's your mistake because the prophet wasam saw a one of his companions and he told him the companion that he uh uh got engaged to a woman the prophets told him did you look at her and the man said no he said the prophet told him go back and look at her because there is something wrong in the eyes of the ansar maybe you would not be satisfied after marriage and this would cause you to divorce her the following week or the following month or the following year but when you take a good look at her before marriage and you're totally satisfied with her this goes for a very long time and this is the best way of doing it so yes you can come in front of this man who is proposing to you you can even show your hair nor you wear your normal clothes not very revealing not revealing at all of course and you must not put any makeup on your face not even mascara nothing you come and talk to him and look at him well and communicate with him for about half an hour an hour it's all permissible inshallah so that this would increase the love between you if there were to be marriage maybe you would look at him and the guy is a an ape or a gorill if if if she was a champan you never know so if this did not take place you were not following the Sunnah if you sit with him and you look at him and he looks at you this is part of the Sunnah"
