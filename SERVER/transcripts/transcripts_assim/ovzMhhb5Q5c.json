  "transcript": "Imad from Sweden Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa'alaikumussalam. So Sheikh, if a person has a mother and his mother wants to fly from, for example, Saudi Arabia to Germany and she doesn't care about the ruling that it's haram for a woman to travel. Is he obliged to travel with her and does he have, if he travels with her, does he get reward? Wa Fikum Barakallah. This is something that is dependent on your circumstances. Now if my mom wants, may Allah bless her soul, have mercy on her soul, she's dead. But let's assume, if my mom wants to do something haram and she doesn't care whether it's haram or halal, I could break the cycle of haram by accompanying her if she wants to travel without a mahram. But either way, I'm not saving her from sin because she doesn't care. She's doing it regardless. So the sin is there. Secondly, I have to look into my own circumstances. Am I doing something that is applicable? Do I have the financial means? Do I have off from my vacation, from my work? Would this jeopardize my well-being with my family, my kids and the likes or not? Because at the end of the day, she is a grown-up woman. She's an adult and she's accountable for her own actions. Allah is the one who's going to punish her in her grave and on the Day of Judgment, not me. So if she doesn't care whether Allah is pleased or not, I would not go out of my way to make that not happen if she doesn't care. She's going to do more haram things. But if I'm not going to lose anything and I may utilize this trip to give her da'wah and to show her how dutiful and obedient I am to her, maybe that would help and Allah knows best."
