  "transcript": "Zakariya from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Barakatuh Sheikh my question was, so when I was, it was a couple of days ago when I was praying I, I was, I finished my Tahiyat and then I did my Taslim and then once I finished it I was in a bit of a hurry and then when I stood up and I walked like 20 seconds later I realized I might have made a mistake either I forgot one of my Taslims or I didn't do both and I was wondering what should I do in that type of situation, should I repeat, I repeated my whole prayer just in case but was that the right thing to do? You forgot what? The Taslim You, you imagined or were you certain? I was more towards certain and I never usually get this because I was in a bit of a hurry that was the reason why this happened First of all we have a rule Akhi, the rule states that after the Ibadah, after the form of worship is over whatever doubts you get this is from Shaytan because when the Ibadah was over I finished it while believing that I did everything legit The doubt I'm getting is from Shaytan so ignore it, if the Ibadah came while you are in the actual prayer then you have to rectify it and act accordingly but after it's finished if there is no 100% certainty then you ignore this doubt and move on"
