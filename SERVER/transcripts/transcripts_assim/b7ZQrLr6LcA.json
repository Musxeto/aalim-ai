  "title": "Good person = Jannah? or whatâ€™s the point when satan worshiped but ended up in hell",
  "transcript": "We have brother Sam from Canada and I'm doing great for asking you know how do we advise people sometimes when you want to remind them of the importance of salah or importance of worshiping Allah sometimes they say oh you know maybe if I don't do any of the as long as my heart is clean or as long as I didn't oppress anybody I didn't do anything wrong nothing big and you know it's okay Allah will forgive me or they say that uh you know look at shaitan right he worshiped Allah thousands of years where is his destination the story of barca so they come with all these reasonings saying that the end goal was hell for those people like foran and for barca like so what's the point if you know if the ibad is just going to lead to uh you know like it's not going to benefit me as much a person thinks and believes this, he's not a Muslim. When someone says, \"What's the point of if we're going to have the same fate as Satan?\" This is rejection of Islam. So, they have to be very careful of what they say. So many people are unaware of the gravity of what they utter and say not knowing that the prophet said an individual can say a word that he doesn't pay attention to. This word throws him in hellfire for 70 years and he would not reach the bottom of it. 70 years just because of a word. So they're rejecting Islam by saying this and they're stupid with all due respect or without any respect. Who cares? They're stupid because Shan though he worshiped Allah so many decades and thousands of years. What threw him in hell was a sin. Arrogance and envy when he did not prostrate to Adam when commanded by Allah. That is what doomed him. And these people when we tell them to pray and they say no, we don't want to pray. This is the sin that will doom them in hell with the grace of allahel because Allah is fair and just. So what they're doing is a huge mistake. And such people they're not truth seekers. They just want to argue and debate without any knowledge. And hence it would be best for you to isolate yourself from them and focus on your own self because talking to them would corrupt your heart and would cast doubt in your heart that would resonate someday when you're weak and vulnerable. Shan would use this. So eliminate yourself from them and isolate yourself from them and focus on those who want to learn from your guidance and your preaching. These people don't know Allah, have no iman in their hearts. So what you're seeing of not praying on time is a sign is a not the actual illness but it is a reflection or a result of that illness. So work on the illness, tell them how to worship Allah. Tell them who Allah is. Show them what is hell fire and paradise. What is the day of judgment? Once they're convinced then such symptoms would be eliminated inshallah."
