  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] m [Music] alhamdulillah going on and mentioning the detachments and the Expeditions that the prophet sallallah alhi wasallam used to send out of Medina to intercept the Caravans that the posts of Mecca used to send up north one may have the question of isn't this form of Terror ring people isn't this a form of aggression it's like a dictorian like gr and robbing Caravans you know back like the English used to rob the rich and give to the poor Robin Hood's like Robin Hood style yeah what do you think Abdullah yes very similar to that but um how to view it sometimes it might have justification okay I think that if you look at these incidents without revising the history yes that would not be very appropriate you we have to understand and know that these acts came after 13 years of continuous oppression they have confiscated the properties of the Muslims in Mecca they have kicked them out they've oppressed them tortured them and in some incidents they've killed them so after 13 years of being patient and tolerant the only logical thing would be for them to fight back and this is exactly what the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam did he fought back and he started by threatening the economical benefits of the mushriks of of the posts by intercepting their Caravans and among one of the Expeditions of the Prophet Alam was the expedition of safwan and actually this came as a retaliation of an attack on the second year of Hijra by kurb jab he was a disbeliever who came with some of his Companions and looted the camels and sheep of the Muslims in Medina and fled so the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam went out in 70 of his men of his companions trying to pursue him and and and get whatever they have taken Unfortunately they were ahead in time and distance so the prophet Sall wasallam could not uh uh catch him but they managed to pass by a valley that is called the valley of safwan close to the area of Badr and that is why this is called bad the first now we have the big or the grand Battle of bad which was in the same vicinity in the same area this one was the first B the buildup to B well it's it wasn't no buildup because was trying to catch kurb jabber but he missed him so he was in the area so the prophet came back sallallah alaihi wasallam without fighting anyone but because he came to the area of Badr they called this battle or this Expedition the expedition of safan which is a valley or the Expedition of bad I first now the prophet wasam did not fight anyone but this attack of Kur I jabber was considered to be an assault on the Muslims now it was a change of Direction because it was the Muslims who were attacking the Caravans now being attacked by uh uh these politist was a change of Direction on the fourth or the fifth month of the second year there was another detachment or another battle which was called and this was to intercept a caravan that was going from Mecca to aam and they the rot was you know off and on a lot of Caravans going and coming and they had to take the same route so the prophet Sall wasallam went out with 150 of his companions and some say 200 of his companions trying to get and and and catch that Caravan with all its wealth and he discovered once he reached the area that he missed it by few days so he took the opportunity and he signed a a a treaty of mutual uh understanding not to assault each other with Ben medage which was the tribe prevailing on that area now this Caravan that the prophet wasam wanted to intercept is the same one that came from a sham area from North and the it it caused the Battle of bad but this of course is not the time to go through this in rajab there was another uh uh uh Det attachment that was sent and this was led by the companion Abdullah J Allah be pleased with him he left Medina with 12 of The Companions of the Prophet Alam the migrant uh Companions of the Prophet The Prophet wasam gave him a letter and he told him go south and do not open this letter until to days pass that was very strange you're going blindfolded to an area to fight people to meet people you don't you have no uh uh uh uh information about yet the companions complied they left Medina and after two days he opened the letter and he found in it that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam is telling him that you you should go to a location between Mecca and T it's called nla nla means palm tree but he instructed them to go to this area which is known to be and to sort of spy it's it was a a reconnaissance mission to spy on the posts and to know their movement so that he can come back and report it to the prophet Alat wasam they were not instructed to engage so they went and in that letter the prophet told him that you should give the choice to your companions and tell them if you want to go on with me you have the choice if you want to go back to Medina also the choice is yours as written by the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam now the prophet did not write he was illiterate so when saying that as written by the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam that he had someone else to do the writing for him one would say why would the prophet Alat wasam write a letter and ask the leader of that uh a Detachment not to open it except after two days the answer would be this would be realize if you look back into the detachments and the Expeditions that were sent by the prophet Alam to intercept the Caravans every single time they are a day or two late every single time and this meant that there was probably someone leaking the information so the Hypocrites among the Muslims were there so whenever they knew that the Muslims were going out they would send a message of a warning to warn the pothus that Muslims are coming that is why the prophet alai wasam did not want this to happen again so he sent this Detachment no one knew where this Detachment was going to and two days later they've opened the letter and they knew their destination now when they reached that designated area of nla it was on the last day of rajab the holy well it's not a holy month but it is uh uh in a sense sacred month of the year we have four months in the year that we are not allowed to fight fight in It's called The Forbidden months or the sacred months well the translation does not fit uh uh so these months do any of you know what are they in Arabic well is the first one the second which is number 11 then you have then you have muharam which is the first month in the lunar year and then you have rajab which is the seventh month of the year so you have three in a row 11 12 and one and then you have the seventh month which is the month of rajab I believe these months were also sacred uh before Islam that's very true and why is that because the the non-muslims before Islam used to perform pilgrimage in the three months in a row and they would leave to their country on muharam the first month yes and they also used to make in the month of rajab so these months were made sacred or made forbidden so that they would be safe to travel to to Mecca back that was a principle of the whole of Arabia that was the principle of the whole that's true of the whole of Arabia that they were not to fight in these months so they were faced with a caravan on the last day of rajab and Abdullah J saw this Caravan and saw also it was led by uh uh and they didn't know what to do if they waited one more day the Caravan would go into the area of Haram of Mecca which is forbidden for them to attack anyone and if they attack them now they'll be attacking them in the secred month sacred month and this was a shame uh this was something that would be a major sin among the Arabs who were not Muslim to begin with but it was honored by everyone in Arabia so the they did not know what to do and we inshallah will know what they did just right after the break so stay [Music] tuned increase [Music] your learning how to recite the Quran properly learning the meaning of what we recite concluding the from the verses which we recite trying to implement what we learn in our daily life would listen to The participants and the guest will take your phone calls we're going to recite life we listen to your recitation and we correct it according to the rules and regulations which will state in each episode now your dream will come true [Music] [Music] Alay and welcome back again we're talking about the expedition of nla the Detachment of abdah among 12 of his companions they are stuck between a rock and a hard place they are at the last day of rajab one of the Sacred months and this Caravan is passing in front of their eyes with and among other of his poest companions if they wait one more day they will enter the area of Haram and they would not also be able to fight so they discussed the issue among themselves and they came to the conclusion that we should seize the moment and attack so these 12 men attacked the Caravan they managed to kill and captured two prisoners and so it wasn't a big Caravan it wasn't well the Caravans at the time did not have a lot of guards with them because the people of Mecca had treaties with all the tribes covering the root of freading and everybody respected and feared the people of Mecca they respected them because they were the custodians of their idols and as we know that the Caba the holy mosque had more than 360 Idols surrounding it and each Idol was an idol of a tribe or so and they feared the people of Mecca because they were Knights and soldiers and and professional uh uh army people men of power and and and and and dignity so they were afraid to attack their Caravans that's why they did not send a lot of uh uh uh protection with them yeah and also so being the sacred mouth they would not have expected to be attacked attacked yes and this is also a good reason so they attacked it and they took the loots back to Medina the minute they went into Medina it was a window of opportunity for the Jews and the posts they they thought how dare you do such a thing it's the sacred month and you did a very bad thing that even the poist themselves would not dare to do and you claim to be men of Peace you claim to be men of of of of religion and respecting the others and so on and they started building up an argument that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam himself did not approve of it he did not approve of what Abdullah jash did because it was a sacred month of rajab so so how did you do such a thing and you can imagine what Abdullah J and his companions may have felt you know everybody's against them and even the prophet Sall wasallam and they did this out of good intention and for the cause of Islam and not long afterwards Allah the almighty revealed the verses from the Quran he revealed from the heavens these verses that explain and exempt them from any wrongdoing Allah says in chapter 2ah Bak in Ayah 27 they ask you concerning fighting in the prohibited month Allah tells the prophet they ask you about fighting in the prohibited month which is the month of rajab say fighting therein is a grave offense but Graver is it in the sight of Allah to prevent members to prevent access to the sacred mosque so now Allah's comparing fighting in the sacred or prohibited month to preventing access to his mosque and this is what Theus did so they prevented access to the sacred mosque also and drive out its members so he's twisting the argument back on them yes now now priorities set priorities okay you're complaining look what you did you drove out the members of that Holy mosque you kicked them out you may you forced them to migrate and and also Allah says telet and oppression are worse than slaughter though one man died but what you've done from oppression and causing this tulet among the the the people is f is far greater Allah continues to say nor will will they cease fighting you until they turn you back from your faith if they can so prophet of Allah you have to understand this no matter what you do they'll always be against you until they succeed and turning you back on uh uh uh uh your your faith if they can and if any of you turn back from their faith and die in unbelief their Works will bear no fruit in this life and in the Hereafter so this is a warning from Allah and this teaches us that Muslims should not be more Roman than the Romans themselves and in in a lot of cases you find Muslims trying to defend and trying to protect they trying to go out of their way to please the non-muslims and even if it means that they will distort Islam No this is unacceptable the non-muslims will not be comfortable until they turn you on your heels until you they make you reject your faith and it started in Europe for example with with the problem of the veil and are you part of us have you integrated are you uh considered to be citizens you have to take off the veil for women that is of course not for men and I've seen so many programs on the BBC on on on elsewhere condemning the veil and making this pie of cloth the only difference between the britishers and Islam and if you go with this hypothetically and take off the veil they'll say well we have the head cover and if you take off the head cover well you're wearing long sleeves yeah they find something else it goes on and on and on and they will not ever accept you for what you are and this is written in black and white for Muslims and also just to add to that they it's not as if they perceive these things some part of unbelief which I've experienced before I embrace Islam is also ignorance because sometimes you don't know what you are against and all this uh Expeditions that you're explaining to us the policies they can't see it the way the Muslims see it that's why they're attacking Islam why are you attacking us at this particular time why you you're supposed to be religious you're supposed to be people that we' suppressed and you know it takes it takes uh you know some kind of retaliation to open their own eyes and and it's true and they keep on getting this allegation of if you slap one if you slap me on the cheek I'm going to give you the other the cheek well they've slapped us left right and center and we're out of cheeks so you cannot ask them after 13 years of being oppressed not to retal retaliate this is their god-given right to do and coming back again it is the practice of the non-muslims you either follow our way or there there are no compromises in Islam is different you're not forced to convert or to revert to Islam you may accept your religion as it is no one is forcing you to uh uh change it but do not stand as an obstacle as a hurdle to the spread of Islam do not be offensive to Islam or hostile to Islam and you are in the safe and throughout history this was the case you are not hostile to Islam you practice you live and you do whatever you want uh uh in your life but it's hard to protect that hostility amongst non-muslims when you have media machines or uh propagandas which fuel the people's mind who want to know about Islam but they're always hearing that Islam is this Islam is that but I'm sure the people for them themselves if they was to Bear witness amongst their own experience to the propaganda is totally different yeah I I I agree with that and I think that it's easy to blame people yeah rather than to do something to change their uh uh uh uh way of thinking that is why though we agree that it's the media role in stereotyping and and and brainwashing uh uh uh the heads of people and how they conceive Muslims it is our duty to sh to show them otherwise it's our duty to portray the real practice of Islam as Muslims to to show them that we do not lie we do not cheat we do not uh uh steal we do not fornicate we do not uh drink intoxicants we're honest we're on time by doing this they would have no uh uh way to think otherwise but if we promote violence or if we give excuses to terrorist attacks by saying well if they were not oppressed they would not have done this no this is not acceptable two wrongs never make a right so we say that this is wrong and we also say that oppression is wrong but we do not justify this with that yes yes just to add I was going to say um the non-muslims also because of the lack of um understanding of Islam as a foundation what they receive is something that they build on so convincing them will take a lot of work even though it's not impossible but it it just hads to the to the difficult task the Muslims have and even in terms of what the Muslims do do wrong themselves there are Muslims who fornicate there are Muslims who do what they shouldn't do but again this is the nature of the human being it's true but I think it is not a priority to call people to Islam our priority is to ask the people to observe us as we are practicing our Dean see a lot of the Muslims think otherwise they set the priority to call people to Islam instead our priority is to practice Islam and if we practice Islam this would be the best way of calling people to uh uh Islam and going back to uh uh uh this uh Detachment of nla once this verse was revealed the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam gave the blood money to because he was killed in in the sacred month so he gave his family though they were pothus he gave them the blood money and he set free the two prisoners that uh he took and from this eight Expeditions and eight detachments we learn that there was no Bloodshed except in this one where died there were no looting there were no uh attacks it were only skirmishes and nothing materialized this was also the result of 13 years of Oppression I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program so inshallah until we meet next [Music] time [Music] h [Music] oh"
