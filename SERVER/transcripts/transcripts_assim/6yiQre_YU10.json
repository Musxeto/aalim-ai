  "transcript": "um i have a question but this sounds disgusting there's a person who has like a discharge from his um anus and sometimes also feels like an exit so does it nullify the wudu and it's also impure okay anything this is a rule by default anything that exits your anus your private part it invalidates your woodle and we're talking about the rear exit so that we would not go into vaginal discharges etc we'll just limit it to uh the rear exit your a person's anus any discharge whether accompanied by feces or not as long as it comes from inside to the outside this is something that nullifies your wudu and it's also impure and this is why scholars differentiate between piles that are inside the anus and sometimes blood comes out and those that are outside the anus and blood comes out in the first case this is nudges and it invalidates rudolph in the second case this is not najis because it's outside the anus and it does not impact the wudu or the purity and allah knows best"
