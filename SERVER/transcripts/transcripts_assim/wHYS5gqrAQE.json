  "title": "Hiring someone else to do my work permissible in Islam  Outsource or Contracting",
  "transcript": "there is a business idea or a business where for example I would have an agency and I would try to find clients where I would do work for them such as uh like building a website for them or uh maybe two advertisement for their company for their business on Facebook or Instagram or whatever social media or so basically I get a contract for them unless I will do this work for you for uh five thousand dollars but what I do is uh what I'll do is I would find uh another contractor from a country where the currency value is uh much higher compared to the uh not much lower I mean compared to the dollars for example uh five hundred dollars is equivalent to uh 65 50 000 uh in their debt currency that countries currency so ISP that uh contract for 500 to do this job uh where I promised the client I will do the job but I charged the client uh like five thousand dollars so I just uh pay that uh contractor 500 and I picked myself 4 000 or 4500 it is kind of a visibility what you're referring to is called Outsourcing or Contracting so if someone comes to me and he asks me to execute a specific task and we sign a contract in the contract the conditions and terms are set the quality of the work is defined and the quantity and the time of delivery if I manage to Outsource it or to hire another contractor subcontractor who would execute the same job with less cost but the quality in the standards and everything is according to the clients request and demands there's nothing wrong in that and I put the difference in my pocket this is totally permissible insha Allah"
