  "transcript": "and she says her question like the question of Mohammed from Medina I think that if someone breaks the fasting of Ramadan due to a legitimate reason and then makes up for these days later on after a year or two or so depending on how long the reason is staying for does that person get the same reward of someone fasting in Ramadan answer is yes because Allah is the one who exempted him Allah is the one who told him to break his fast due to his illness or due to breastfeeding or due to pregnancy or due to any other reason and once the reason is not there anymore he should go back to square one and fast it and he would get the same reward with the grace of allah azzawajal"
