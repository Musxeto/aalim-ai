  "title": "The Prophet’s ‎ﷺ  dua for Anas assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "The request of my mom, I am the longest of all the companions. I don't know companions left. He lived over a hundred. And my offspring exceeded my children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren exceeded a hundred. And I've buried many of them. As for my wealth, all farms in Medina produce once a year. Mine only produce twice a year. So what a beautiful reward for serving the best man ever to walk the earth. Nowadays, liberals and enemies of Islam say, look, this is child abuse. How dare she give her own child to the Prophet to serve him, alayhis salatu wassalam? A foreigner, a stranger, blah, blah, blah. Look at the fruits he managed to gain from serving the Prophet, alayhis salatu wassalam."
