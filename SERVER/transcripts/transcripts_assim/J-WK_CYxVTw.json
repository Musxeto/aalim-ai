  "transcript": "this is a continuation to a project that began about 14 years ago in studying the book of which deals generally speaking on issues based on the Hadith of the Prophet which was compiled by may Allah have mercy on his soul and this project began with Huda TV about 14 years ago and since then there was no attempt to continue the project but now alhamdulillah as we have the facilities to uh be online through uh video cams and YouTube so uh Allah has blessed me with a good team where we will inshallah try to pick up where we left uh uh the subjects 14 years ago we were studying the book of Salat and specifically the chapter that deals with and the word is the essence of Salat and Scholars have differed whether the is by the heart or is it by our actions or is it a combination between the two the most authentic opinion is that it's a combination of both the heart and the organs the body movement and as stated before might mean contemplation concentration or submissiveness and it is the essence of the prayer because without it your prayer would not be accepted fully and the more you have the more possibility of having your prayer accepted by Allah and the Lesser you have then the Lesser uh of reward you will get for that and may Allah have mercy on his soul said a beautiful statement and trying to Define what is he said that is to feel humility towards Allah who orders us to do things it is to surrender to Allah's Shar to Allah's laws and regulations it is to follow the truth and to abide by it it is to surrender yourself to whatever Allah decrees without any objection without any uh whims or desires or your own opinion because there is no place for that and when you feel that your heart is broken when standing in front of Allah when you feel it being humbled to Allah's uh uh uh Grace and to Allah's sight over your heart and your organs then you will feel the correct in your Salat and in order to attain it is not something mystical is something that comes when you abide by the Quran and the Sunnah when you follow the footsteps of the Prophet Alat there are a number of things that may increase or decrease your as we will come inshallah in a while to discuss this but the more you know and realize your own shortcomings the more you acknowledge the greatness of Allah asael and how small you are the wealth of Allah Asel and how poor you are the strength of Allah and how weak you are the pride and honor of Allah and how humilated you are the more submissiveness you get in your prayer and whenever you pray without the intention of showing off without having any arrogance in your heart only then you will find that your prayer is topnotch and to the pleas in level of Allah Allah says in the Quran certainly will the Believers have succeeded they who are during their prayer humbly submissive and this is what called some Scholars to say whoever does not attain in his Salat he's not successful because Allah says they have attained they have uh uh certainly that the Believers have succeeded so when will they succeed when they attain in their Salat and that is why the prophet saidat that when a Believer stands to pray and to worship Allah Allah tells the angel tell tells the angels to write down the amount of of reward or the amount of his prayer that would be accepted so they write as the prophet saysat half of it 1/3 one4 up to 1/10th and Scholars say this depends on your amount of concentration within the Salat so if you concentrated well and you feel that you had reached the level sub submissiveness then mashallah you will get more and more reward for that Scholars say that there are means to help you um contemplate and reach the level of submissiveness in prayer one of them is that when you start your your Salat you wholeheartedly seek refuge in Allah from the outcast Satan because his prime objective that is the devils and Satan in general his prime objective is to distract you from your Salat in Muslim the prophet said whenever the son of Adam prostrates to Allah Allah the almighty uh uh whenever the the uh slave of Allah prostrate to him Satan takes aside weeping he said he was ordered to prostrate and he did that and he will go to Jenna and I was Pro ordered to prostrate that is to Adam and I refused and I will go to hell so this is the prime objective of shatan seek refuge in Allah from him and you inshallah will attain a a good level of by contemplating in the Quran when you recite the Quran the fa and you understand what it means and you feel every word that you speak and utter when you contemplate in the you're doing in your R and in your what does subh mean what does what does mean how many times you we recite this this gives you thirdly when you remember that Allah is the greatest of all and that you are addressing Allah in your prayer and you're requesting and you're begging him this increases your and fourthly when you acknowledge your poverty and humility when prostrating and bowing to Allah when you acknowledge your need to Allah and how great your lord is subhah wa ta'ala this definitely adds a lot of value especially if you study and memorize the beautiful names and attributes of Allah because if you're praying to someone you don't know how to describe him how to name him how to talk about him how would you attain and this is a very big gap that we Muslims have in our forms of worship when we pray to Allah we don't know who Allah is we cannot give him names or describe him as he described himself and so did his Prophet Alam in the Quran and in the Sunnah uh fifthly to limit your sight When you pray from looking right left or Center so you always look at the place or the spot where you prostrate and this shows that you are expressing your poverty to Allah but once you send your gaze here and there you will never attain and finally when you enter the Salat you try your level best not to be distracted so you empty your mind and soul from any engagements if you want to answer the call of nature don't push it Go and to the toilet even if you miss a or two because this is more important than uh going into Salat while fighting the urge to answer the call of nature if you're hungry and the food is served eat first and this is what the prophet instructed us am by doing these things that the prophet had ordered us to do inshallah we will be able to attain the level of so until we meet next time"
