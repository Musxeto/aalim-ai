  "title": "Is selling or using Betel leaf, Betel nut, or Paan haram? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "next question that we have is from a sister and she's saying that people grow little nut trees in our village the people who grow them do not use it you only sell it and that's their main source of income the people who consume betelnut we don't see them as good people we do not know after selling for what purpose it is being used could you please tell if this income is halal and allowed this depends on the usages of this betelnut now if it is not intoxicating if it does not make you drowsy or lazy or it gives you more activity and power and and an energy if it's just a spice that is added to food this is okay but if it is used mainly for having it mixed with tobacco or with this thing that people chew and it is not healthy it's not medically safe or it is sort of doing something that is not productive to your body whether it is putting you down or energizing you and the Prophet as some had prohibited every Musker one more factor he prohibited anything that intoxicates or that puts you down and and calms you down so if it falls under this category then selling it would be hallam so in order to answer this I have to know exactly what it is used for and if this is the only thing it is used for analyzers and knows best"
