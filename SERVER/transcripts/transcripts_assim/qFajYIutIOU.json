  "title": "Ruling on 401k plans in Islam | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "muhammad from the u.s what's the ruling on 401 k 401 k is a retirement scheme where you work and you pay the money and then at the end of your working experience or working years when you retire they give you a monthly salary so that you can live off it and we said so many times that such provident funds or retirement schemes if they are voluntary meaning i'm working what is your job i am an i.t uh expert good job how much you they're paying you they pay me five thousand dollars good so now they come to me and say listen if you give us five hundred dollars for 20 years when you retire after 20 years we're going to give you 400 4 000 a month indefinitely if this is optional this is haram why because my five hundred dollars throughout the 2000 er 20 years is a lump sum and what i'm getting from them after retirement can be this big if i don't die and it can be this little if i die early and it's gone down the drain so this is gambling this is like insurance this is totally haram if the 401k is mandatory by law so whether you like it or not whether your employer likes it or not the government mandates that any employee has to pay a certain percentage of his salary and the employer has to contribute a certain percentage from his basic salary and we collect this in a fund for the government once he reaches the age of retirement he can uh receive a salary every month till the day he dies this case it's halal now to my knowledge the 401k is not halal because you have the power any time of the year to withdraw whatever you had deposited in the previous years of your employment which means it's an optional thing and allah knows better"
