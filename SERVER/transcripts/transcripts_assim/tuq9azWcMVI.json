  "transcript": "um in different countries there are different norms for clothing um for example in Nigeria they wear colorful clothing and in Saudi Arabia they wear simple and plain clothing I was wondering if it's who car as a Muslim sister to wear clothing with patterns keep in mind this is not Embroidery For example zigzags polka dots or tiey on my jacket dress Etc this is what normal Street where in the UK is like for people like me and others living here especially the youth is it okay to wear these patterns as long as they're not vibrant and very attractive colors rather they are mute and simple colors dress code is related to both Islamic traditions and to the culture so Islamic dedicate dictates that your dress code must not be tight showing your curves and bone structure must not be see-through must not be imitating men or imitating women and must not be attractive in themselves drawing attention so one must not wear something that is really weird that would make him or her stand in a crowd if these are fulfilled then we go to the norm of a society and a community so if you are in a country such as Nigeria where the people are used to wearing such colors where if she were to wear it in Saudi Arabia or in Qatar for example that would not be accept because it would be too attractive an ey attraction and distracting the people in this case this is according to the culture so you have to go to the real righteous practicing imams in the UK and say to them is what I'm wearing acceptable in the community or not so normal color colors that are not uh um catching and not attractive wouldn't make you stand in a crowd everybody is wearing it among the Muslims not that you're the only Muslim who's wearing it and everybody else may be uh um uh tempted to look and investigate what's behind the curtains if this is the case and they say it's normal then it's normal without any problem inshallah"
