  "title": "My mom has back painâ€”should she use a stick for rukusujood or pray standing the whole time",
  "transcript": "Ijaz from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi I am asking this question on the behalf of a sister She says, my mother has a back problem causing pain when standing from a sitting position Due to this she performs Salah standing including Sajdah I offered her a walking frame to support herself But she is hesitant Is it obligatory for her to use the walking frame to perform Sajdah correctly Or can she continue as is? JazakAllah Wa Jazakum This is not normal Because people usually are able to do these both things But if she has a chronic illness And we are in a dilemma Either she stands up and performs her prayer standing up without sitting Without doing Sujood properly on the ground Rather just bending over Or she sits on the ground Not standing up And continue her prayer in the sitting position But being able to do Sujood normally It seems that standing up is what she is supposed to be doing Because this is more important pillar than Sujood As per the Hadith of Imran Ibn Hussain May Allah be pleased with him The Prophet said to him, Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam Pray standing up If you can't, pray sitting down If you can't, pray lying on your side So if a person is able to stand, this is what he is supposed to do And Allah knows best"
