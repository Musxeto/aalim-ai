  "title": "Can the Imam stand in an elevated place, how high, is it a carpet or mat's height?",
  "transcript": "Abu Raiyan from Senegal Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Sheikh my question is I read from Imam Al-Albani Allah have mercy on him that one of the place that is not permissible to pray is the elevated place on which the Imam stands making him higher than the place of the followers in prayer I was wondering like how high are we talking? Is it like an extra mat on the regular carpet? This is an issue of dispute among scholars and the most authentic opinion is if the Imam has a step that's elevating him from the rest and he prays on it this is not permissible because it gives him a sort of edge over the worshippers as if he's better than them but if it is done due to a legitimate reason for example the Prophet once Alayhis Salaam prayed on the pulpit so that everyone would see how he prays and whenever he wanted to make sujood he would mount off that pulpit and walk down make sujood on the ground then climb up again this was done once or twice as a form of educating the masses not to an arrogant person who thinks that I am a ruler I am a scholar I can't pray with these peasants I have to be elevated now the carpet itself is not an elevation no one would see the imam standing on a carpet saying oh mashallah he's wearing high heels it's little nevertheless I personally don't use such carpets when I go to masjids and I see and they ask me to lead and I see that it has a carpet if it's possible I remove it so that I pray on the same carpet that everyone else is praying on why would I have an extra carpet that has lots of decoration that may distract me it doesn't make any sense we are all alike so I remove it and we pray all together on the same carpet and Allah knows best"
