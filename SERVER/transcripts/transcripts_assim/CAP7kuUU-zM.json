  "title": "When does water become impure when you pour on impurity or when its flowing & water touches impurity",
  "transcript": "uh i have some confusion from uh your two answers it's in contracting each other the first answer was when someone pour water to a solid nudges and water doesn't overwhelm or remove the mass of najis then the water becomes nudges but in your second answer when someone spills some water to the floor then the water move and spread around the floor and accidentally touch a cat feces then the water doesn't become nudges yes because okay you're mixing up how many times did you send this to my website you have not answered this uh because i have answered i've answered you but after i gave the first answer and you really you keep on answering asking again and again and stalking me on twitter uh anyhow listen listen to me listen to me okay the second question is related to the water spreading and touching a cat feces or an impurity now your understanding is this makes the whole water electrified as if it's touched a an exposed wire of electricity so the water here would become also an edges because of this area has touched this impurity and this is not true the first question is pouring water and the water is coming over a pile of crap excuse my french it's coming over a piece of stool and it spreads everything that touches it becomes nudges because the mass is there and the whole water that spreads from touching it so it's a different question totally a different scenario we have a small piece of poop cat poop and the water is here pouring so the water flows and a little of it touches this poop you want me to say that the whole area now has become impure and this is not the case so i pray to allah azzawajal this is that this is the last time we ever discuss this and i don't know if i said this or not it's easier for you to get rid of the cat so it doesn't poop that much"
