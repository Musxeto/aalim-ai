  "transcript": "muhammad from the philippines says a traveler who resides in a hotel next to a masjid and he hears the adhan is he obliged to attend the prayer it's an issue of dispute some people say that a traveler exempted from praying in the masjid similarly to a woman to a slave and to someone who's sick he has a legitimate excuse to skip it other scholars like sheikh hamid fameen and and other scholars say that the hadith of the blind man is a general hadith so a blind man comes to the prophet islam asks for permission to pray home because he's blind he doesn't have a guide to lead him and medina has a lot of insects and snakes etc it's scary so the prophet says yes you have permission just before the man left the message the prophet called him back again allah and he said do you hear that then the man said yes so the prophet said you must respond you must answer the adhan in the masjid i i don't find any permission uh for you to skip the prayer so these scholars said that a traveler who is residing who's not traveling from a city to city no he's residing in the city but he's still a traveler for a day or two or more and the message is adjacent to him he hears the adhan he's obliged to attend and this is the most authentic opinion and allah knows best you"
