  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh and Rupa from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh I'm from Bangladesh and I don't like Bangladesh for so many reasons so I wish to get married to a man from like UK. I don't have any specific man selected and I am very pious Alhamdulillah so I believe I will be able to stay on deen and make my child's better ummah and spread Islam there. I know I am not worthy of a man from UK but there is no harm in trying and every time I make decision I take advice from you and make dua to Allah. We can get anything if we make dua right? So can I make dua to Allah for a pious good man from UK? Should I make this dua? Please advise me. First of all there is no problem in making dua to Allah Azza wa Jal to grant you a righteous practicing, pious, rich, healthy, wealthy, handsome husband. Totally permissible. However your dua should be governed by Quran and Sunnah. So if the result of your dua would lead you to travel to a non-Muslim country and stay there and leaving behind your Muslim country despite the corruption, the bribes, the lack of education, the bad attitude towards women etc. Still it is a Muslim country. Still Islam is valued there and you can practice and not fear upon your children that they would shove down their throat the beliefs and the rights of LGBTQ or free sex or protected sex or evolution theories or attacking religion because all of this falls under the freedom of speech. But when it comes to expressing Islam, oh this is an act of terrorism. This is hate speech. SubhanAllah. So who in his right mind would jeopardize the upbringing of their own children and I have hundreds of counseling sessions with folks from Europe and from North America where they're crying their tears because of what happened to their children who ran away or who started doing weed or who took off the hijab after memorizing the Quran because the fitna is overwhelming. So no woman in her right mind would ask Allah to take her to such country. Having said that without any doubt, the UK is one of the best if not the best Western non-Muslim country on earth that I know of. The amount of tolerance and and respect to the Muslims is unmatched with any European country at all. They're, you know, miles and miles ahead. Nevertheless, you do not have the right to leave your Muslim country to such a non-Muslim country let alone make dua for them. you"
