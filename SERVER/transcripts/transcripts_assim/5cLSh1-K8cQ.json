  "transcript": "Ashish I want to be a Sheikh inshallah when I grow up where what type of books should I I read knowledge why would you Ariza why would you want to be a Sheikh so I could guide people to Islam and because I I think that the Obama will be like more uh they won't be close to Allah so I want to guide Muslim back to Allah and I'm 12 years old do you have any advice for me Chef okay first of all being a Sheikh or white wanting to guide people to Islam is a very noble cause however this is step three or four before that you have to go from the bottom of the ladder from step one two three and then you may reach that stage which means that at first you have to focus on attaining the knowledge for your own benefit so that you get closer to Allah regardless of what others May benefit from that or not so stage on step number one is to acquire knowledge for the sake of Allah secondly to implement this knowledge in your life as Allah stated in the Quran first begin with knowledge then act upon it afterwards when you have walked the talk you can focus on Guiding people on spreading this knowledge you have and sharing it with others where to begin the sky is the limit the first thing you should focus on is memorizing the Quran knowing the meanings of it and the Sciences surrounding it which May necessitate that you in parallel study Arabic because you cannot be a Sheikh you cannot give fat words you cannot teach Islam without understanding Arabic otherwise you'll be depending on some other people's translation and this is not proper or even allowed for someone to give such verdicts without him himself mastering the Arabic language and knowing the Quran himself also you have to study Akita and you start with the basics so after going through a program of studying the tafsir of the Quran knowing the vocabulary of the Quran and when and why such verses were revealed what is abrogated in what is not abrogated and the likes and memorizing the Quran you should focus on issues of Akida so you study the basics of akhida the beautiful names of Allah azzawajal and his attributes also you study the also you can study uh the book of The three principal fundamentals and as you go up you study you start with a particular school of thought and you take one concise book of that particular school of thought regardless of what school you're studying and then after you finish it then you grow up to something bigger and then you go up to comparing schools of thought together and then you go to books like where you can take the most authentic opinion from the Hadith directly so that you can filter all what you've studied throughout this methodology and so on but you cannot do this on your own you need a Sheikh a tutor a scholar who would Mentor you and guide you throughout the way insha Allah"
