  "transcript": "'How long can a man stay away from his wife?   Does this impact their nikah (marriage)?' A lot \nof the people, especially from the subcontinent,   think that, if a man does not meet his wife for \nlike three years, four years, then the marriage   contract is dissolved automatically. And this is \nbaseless. Once the managed contract is conducted   then it cannot be broken, unless one of \nthem dies, unless there is a divorce,   or separation, forced separation by the \nMuslim ruler due to one of the spouses   committing apostasy, many reasons - within the \npower of the Muslim ruler or the Muslim judge.   Which means that, if a man marries a \nwoman and he goes to a foreign country   and stays there for 20 years without \nthem communicating or coming to contact,   without the woman seeking Khulʿ (divorce) from \nthe Muslim authorities in her country, without   the man divorcing. And they come after 20 years, \nthey're still man and wife without any problem.   So this concept of a marriage being broken or \naffected if they don't meet one another or they   don't have any intimacy is totally baseless. \nAnd Allah, Azza wa Jal, knows best."
