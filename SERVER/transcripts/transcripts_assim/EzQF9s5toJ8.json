  "transcript": "muhammad from the emirates his parents do not allow him to grow up his beard they say you're still young in high school and it's not even it should be trimmed and there is no obedience to anyone other than to allah no one can obey humans while disobeying allah likewise when a girl reaches puberty wants to wear the hijab her mother says you're too young wait until you go to college and she forbids her from covering her hair or wearing decent clothes she asks what do i do the answer is do not obey your mom she gets angry she scolds me she shouts let her hit the roof who cares about your mom who cares about your father if he tells you to disobey allah azzawajal he's not worthy of being obeyed yeah but he's my father she is my mother there is no obedience to any creature while disobeying allah azza this is a rule of thumb this is why we are muslims because we've submitted our will to our creator what allah tells us to do we do it now the the general question we ask people do you want to follow sharia or your whims and desires even if you ask your parents do you want to follow sharia or your whimsy desires they would say who doesn't want to follow sharia then ask them the second question in shaving my beard or trimming it are you ordering me to follow sharia or your whims and desires they would not have the audacity to say sharia because they know that this is against sharia against the rule of allah against the quran and the sunnah and who are they so that you obey them in disobeying allah azza definitely it's a no-brainer you"
