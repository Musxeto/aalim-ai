  "transcript": "a lot of the Muslims think and believe that Israel is the name of the Angel of Death Allah mentioned the name of the Angel of Death in the Koran as medical mode the Angel of Death and so did the prophet alayhi salaatu son the hadith never ever they we were told that the name of the Angel of Death is Israel we know that the name of the arc angel jibreel peace be upon him the name of the angel who's supposed to blow the trumpet is is revealed the name of the angel who is appointed with rain and the growth of plantation is Myka ill so some folks would say ok it rhymes it sounds good Israel sounds good no it doesn't we do not say his name is not Azrael yet we do not confirm that his name is Israel and hence we call him as Allah has called him in the Quran and Sunnah as Malik Elmo would this is what we are supposed to do so I think this answers your question in regards to the stories we hear about the prophets their ages and the sons names which comes from the Israelis stories or from from the sons of Israel but Israel we refrain from falsifying it or believing it if it does not coincide with the Quran and Sunnah and it does not go against the Quran and Sunnah and Allah knows best"
