  "title": "Can we embrace Teachings of Sayyid Qutb?",
  "transcript": "Liuziang from China Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Is it permissible for a Muslim to embrace the teachings of Sayyid Qutub or is it Haram? Teachings of Sayyid Qutub. Sayyid Qutub has no teachings. He was not a scholar. May Allah have mercy on his soul. Sayyid Qutub is a person of poetry, a person of nice writings, and he never claimed to be a scholar. So the teachings that you're talking about has no place for us. The teachings we get from Qur'an, from Sunnah, and from scholars who follow the teachings and understanding of the three favorite blessed generations of Islam. And anything else has to be cross-referenced and studied through that, and Allah Azza Wa Jal knows best."
