  "title": "What is the definition of Sunnah? Wearing a cap, topi, or kufi for prayer Sunnah? saah",
  "transcript": "what's the definition of sunnah like people say that since the prophet was to cover his head so wearing a cap is a sunnah he used to keep long hair so it's a sunnah etc can you kindly explain the exact concept of sunnah first of all the scholars say that sunnah can be defined in two ways so we have the five rulings which are mandatory obligatory known as wajib then we have musta or recommended or voluntary or sunnah then we have permissible then we have macro which is not recommended disliked and finally we have prohibited which is haram so sunnah comes in the second level which is something that is recommended if you do it you reward it if you don't do it you're not sinful this definition goes in line with the process of the jurors while the fundamentals of they say that sunnah is the way of the prophet saw so whatever the prophet did is considered to be sunnah so the prophet prayed five times a day jurors say this is fart also scholars say that this is sunnah this is the way of the prophet isaiah others say um that the prophet performed once hajj in his life this is sunnah because he did it so by this definition they say sunnah can be anything that the prophet said or he did or he approved in front of him being done and he approved it and fourthly they say anything that has a description of himself this is how usually scholars define and uh um describe to us what sunna is now what suhail is asking about this is what the scholars say is divided into two different definitions of sunnah sunnah ibadah and sunnatul whatever the prophet did alas as a form of worship so he prayed two raka's after this is sunnah ribada he when performing tawaf did ultra where he uncovered his right shoulder with his when for example entering the masjid you enter it with the right foot for those who say that this is part of the sunnah and exit it with the left this is a bada now ada means culture custom habit and this is not related to islam this is related to traditions so if we say that the prophet hassam used to commute from point a to point b on a mule or a donkey would anyone in his right mind say ah this is a form of worship tomorrow i'm going to wall street or i live in manhattan or whatever i'm going to take my mule to work or go to the gym of course not the prophet used to sit on the floor so you don't go to a five or seven star hotel and leave the table and sit on the floor because this is sunnah no this is not sunnah this is a tradition a cultural thing that the prophet used to do because his people used to do it likewise prolonging the hair likewise braiding the hair to some of the arabs this is how they used to do not part of religion likewise when wearing a waist wrapper or an apron like that people wear under it's like a skirt like a kilt but it's on your waist you don't go to the office or to the masjid wearing this because this is customary this is according to what your people wear if i wear this and i go to the friday khutbah to deliver the friday they will pull me down they say what are you doing this is not our customs i would say oh this is sunnah i said no it's not sunnah otherwise where's your mule where's your donkey where's your camel that the prophet used to ride at his house and so on so wearing the cap is from that type you're not rewarded for it and especially if you only put it on when you go to pray like some of the brothers in the subcontinent do some of them even just place a handkerchief and they tie it on their head for prayer and afterwards they fold it and put it in their pockets i've seen this in uh turkey in in bosnia herzegovina when we go to the uh to the masjid and they throw to us uh a head caps to pray with when we don't want to wear it i don't know what's in it uh uh what kind of of diseases or fleas in it i don't want to end up fleeing my hair so this is all customs and it has nothing to do with the sunnah of the prophet was"
