  "title": "Are Hands & Feet part of a womanâ€™s Awrah? Hanafi Husband says its not necessary assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "isis says are hands and feet part of a woman's aura my husband follows the hanafi medha he says these are not women's aura hence no need to cover while going out there's a difference between a woman's aura while praying in a woman's hour while going out either way the most authentic opinion and this is the opinion of the vast majority of schools of thought unlike the hanafi school of heart the vast majority of the other schools of thought state that the women's feet are aura both in salat and when going out so this is oh this opinion is backed by the evidences from the quran and from the sunnah therefore one should not follow a minority that has no backing for what they're saying from the quran from the sunnah and should follow the vast majority of opinion of scholars and it's always best to be safe rather than sorry as for the hands during prayer they all agree that it is not aura so a woman is required to show her face and hands during prayer and cover everything else as going out it's an issue of dispute i'm inclined to say that a woman's hands are our as well as her face when going out and allah knows best you"
