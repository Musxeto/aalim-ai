  "transcript": "she's adult she has her own intellect so Allah says in the Quran what more allocable celerity was doable Aleya and instruct your family to pray and you have be patient you have to be patient and tolerant so as a husband it is your duty so many times you see men with their wives and they're not covered the properly hey why don't you shake Elijah I told her so many times she refuses Halas no it's not Hollis you will not leave until you cover you will not leave home until you cover you not go out until you cover you have to do this yeah are you crazy I told her this and she said who'll stop me and I was afraid cos and she left you have to be a man at heat you have to be a man in order to have a happy married life this is the norm huh this is the normal as an 18 years old Englishman was interviewed after having more than 55 years of happy marriage he was asked what's the secret of your marriage you know Englishmen are very cold and you know mashallah they speak in a very nice way he said it all started in our honeymoon we went to Cyprus and we had a tour where we had to climb up the mountain so we rented two mules and my wife's mule was very stubborn so he didn't move my wife looked to him in the eye they said one and we went up in the way in the middle of the way there was a very short passage the mule was reluctant because it was afraid so my wife got off him looked him in the eyes and said - and while we were coming a climb he made strange noises and started to do bad things she came out and shot him in the head and I was outraged it cost money and this is an animal so I told my wife why did you do this she looked me in the eyes and she said one and he said I never repeated that again for fifty five years they've been living happy now who's the man this is a very big problem you have to protect your wife from Hellfire even if she counts up to three it's your responsibility so it is not an excuse sure I told her not to do this and she did it no you have to show how a man and a strong leader you are now if you're not then your marriage has to have marriage counseling you have to sit with a share or a brother and your wife sit together and speak and try to solve this problem because marriage cannot go on like this the second okay that is is there okay secondly one of your wives right over you is that you provide for her and you give her her allowance you give her food you give her shelter you give her clothes you cannot simply marry and have an easy ride Church is rich her father is rich her mother should give her money her relatives should give her this and that no this is on the attitude of a leech you know leeches it's an insect that cleanses to your body and sucks your money this is the husband if you have a husband like this always instead of saying oh honey say Oh leech to him because a man does not tolerate this Allah explains this in the Quran clearly men are the protectors and maintain errs of women because why does a man have the P wama over women Allah mentions the two reasons one because Allah has made one of them to excel the other who is to excel man now sisters say no we're equal no you're not equal yes we have equality in Islam we do not have equality in Islam my wife said we have equality in Islam I said the only way I see equality in Islam is that next year I become pregnant this is there's no equality in Islam there is fairness and there is justice but there is no equality if I say that a woman should work and I would sit home this is equality she you said yes this is equality and no this is unfair what is fair that they use at home and I work so this is fairness and justice and Allah says well they said Vacarro can enter and males are locked unlike females so Allah excelled man over women this is a fact at the side of Allah in Jannah this is different because your deeds are different than our deeds like but in this life no one would say that a woman is better than a man in general men are better than women now there can't be a woman who is equal to a thousand men like Aisha for example may Allah be pleased with her there are a lot of women who are much far wiser than their husbands their sons their fathers but in general terminology generally speaking men are better than women that's why men lead the prayer that's why men lead countries that's why men have double the inheritance of girls when they are brothers and sisters sometimes no the women have more but I'm talking in the offspring so that they would assume their responsibilities their excel the other and because they spend to support them from their means so if a man does not pay if a man does not support his family some scholars say that he does not deserve to be obeyed because he is not the Guardian he's not the protector and he's not the maintainer so how to provide for her what is meant by providing for her sisters food basic needs shelter no well providing is now this will come afterwards a Sharla this is part of the rights I'm talking about provisions and maintenance so it is financial support and this in totality usually is identified by food shelter and clothing the essentials mahalia they've been hiding me allah be pleased with him said to the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam what are the rights of a wife over us he said and this is the answer to a specific question so know your rights but at the same time understand this as limitation of your rights so what are the rights one the prophecies feed her when you feed yourself so I eat you eat I don't eat you don't eat I eat an apple you eat an apple but when I eat an apple don't tell me that you would like to eat a cow so ya knee be realistic in what you request feeding ok if I close her when you clothe yourself so I have to buy clothes I'll buy you clothes of course women's clothes are far greater I think than men is it it yeah we wear those we have five six tops that's it you my man here suits and trousers and blouses and so alhamdulillah we much easier than you ok and you do not say to her may Allah make your face ugly and that you do not hit her now this is not part of providing it's part of living and we will come to this inshallah later on so the prophets mentioned four things these are her rights the two the first two is financial the second two or the last two points are mental our way of living so you don't abuse and at the same time you don't physically or mentally mentally by saying may Allah make your face ugly and then he retracts this and says uglier than this it can't be you are not allowed to say anything about your physical about your wife's physical appearance that hurts her feelings and you may not also hit her but hitting her has conditions and we will come to a shala hitting the women not coming and it come to hit them but we will mention sha Allah when it is permissible and when it is not and I believe I think it's in the next slide any questions regarding this comments like it goes without saying that it is charity to put food on the table no matter what you spend on your family you will be rewarded even for the morsel of food you put in your mouth and your wife's mouth well I our religion is great if we understand it if you have the good intention everything you do is for the sake of Allah and you reward it if I drink coffee so that I would clear my throat and be able to speak loudly loudly and people would understand me this is my intention when I'm drinking coffee I'm getting reward if the brother making the coffee now I see the brothers going out if the brother making the coffee makes it with this intention he is rewarded and that is why intention is extremely important in our religion the Prophet says solution an arrow you know an arrow three enters Jannah because of the arrow the one who makes it so he is in the factory you know sharpening it making an arrow straight he's in the factory he's in his hometown he's not at war the one who handles it - the archer his job is collect giving the ammunition and the third one is the archer himself three enters the general so imagine when you cook food to your husband though he does not deserve it though he's ugly he never showers and his mouth smells but I'm doing it for the sake of a large diversion when you do this well I hear two or three hours in the kitchen is all for the sake of Allah a soldier and you reward it for every minute but when you do it because you're forced why do you cook my mother-in-law will start nagging in complaining I just don't want to listen to her voice you're not doing it for the sake of Allah you don't have any reward for that one of the most important financial rights of the wife is to give her the dowry it's not in the Arabic I don't know how you put it okay it's not in the Arabic so probably I did this because I had a question and UK about the dowry again we spoke about this anyone has any comment on the man instructing to be given so and so and so before the marriage like the jahiliyyah the dowry any of the brothers sisters don't worry and you voice your opposition if you don't like this you can say sure it's not fair all of my brothers got so much money when they got married now when it comes to me because I'm a Salafi I'm have a bid now I don't get any any rupee Haram if you have any doubt raise your hands kamila okay good so this is one of the most important financial rights this is Islamic one of the most financial rights of a wife is to have her own separate house like it or don't like it this is your problem I know a lot of you especially in India and Pakistan I have tons of emails of complaints chair I have to live with my in-laws I'm their servant if one day I wake up and I don't cook my mother-in-law he treats me very badly and she complains to my husband and my husband comes and shouts at me this is not your right she has the right of her own house whether you like it or not chef I cannot afford it why did you get married seriously why did you take her from her parents house where she was honored and she was respected and brought her to your family's house if you can't afford it you don't need it so what do I do share one of two the first one which is the best option move out even if to a small room and a bathroom it's her own house second option take her approval and consent with pleasure even if you have to kiss her feet beg her please stay my mother is wrong I know you are the queen of my heart you are this and that please stay and tolerate yes Manish there might be a third option which is if you can isolate her in a chamber in the same house of your your father with a separate entrance with a separate kitchen so that she can be completely isolated from the house this is permissible and she has no reason to refuse she cannot refuse because this is her special private quarters I know this doesn't go down well with the gents this is your problem this is Islam you have no right and it is completely Haram for you to live in the house and your brother's around her well la hey I got an email I could show you emails tons of emails a sister says that I live with my in-laws and my brother-in-law and I'm wearing the hijab this hijab which is accepted in so many countries not to me I say this is the proper hijab but we will not go into this discussion she says I cook with my mother-in-law but my brother-in-law also cooks and he comes to the kitchen with me and my mother-in-law to cook with us and I said to my husband this is not acceptable I'm wearing hijab and he insists on coming he spoke to him so many times and he still comes he stops for a day or two and he still comes not evil so he thinks he wants to help he likes to cook but this is evil and she said what to do what do you think I should sell her gents what do you think I should tell her she has to ask her hand right now I know a lot of I'm not going to ask for who has his wife living with his brothers and in-laws because he will be forced to lie but I know this happens ok no matter how life difficult how no matter how difficult life is you have to give her her own separate chamber or house or place to live in the hadith said do not hit her do not say may Allah make her face ugly so this is only happens with the worst of people no way a proper man would say this no matter how ugly his wife is on the contrary the uglier she is the more respectful he is the uglier she is the more respectful he is because he does not want to if if I if my wife is Miss Universe 2008 she's the most beautiful woman on earth so they say and I say how ugly you are will she be offended she will not say you think I'm ugly a hundred million person think otherwise but if she is a little bit or extremely ugly and she is aware of that and I say may Allah make her face ugly and this does not come out except from the worst type of men this hurts a lot because she knows and she acknowledged is this it is forbidden to beat the wife and unless it's the last resort before divorce and demolishing the Muslim house before we go to this let's stay a little bit men gents do you abuse your wife mentally cursing saying you're not beautiful criticizing all the time raise your hand please okay okay no no they're not afraid they're women cannot see them but they are ashamed we're not afraid of this we are ashamed and this is problematic to be ashamed of the people than to be ashamed of allah azzawajal you have to fear allah you have to know that you are not allowed to mentally abuse your wife either by criticizing how she looks how she smells criticizing her actions in a bad and negative way unfortunately a lot of the husband's a lot of the brothers only see the shortcomings and they always criticize and this is an manly you have to avoid any criticism and as mentioned yesterday always try to compliment always to try to look at the bright and positive aspects if you wish to have a happy marriage and happy ending now coming back to physical abuse who among the sisters approve of some time in the marriage in order to protect it a man is entitled to not beat until he breaks her bone or I need to spank to reprimand physically his wife who approves the wrist raise your hand please one two three four five six seven eight nine ten and everyone is thinking a little bit huh and the rest do not approve of it who disapproves of it okay we have seven so we have 17 sisters only and the rest are passive either they did not understand the question or they understood it but they're afraid to comment on it either negatively or positively men let's see now who approves of resorting to physical reprimand as mentioned in the Quran in order to save the marriage in order to as mentioned in the Quran yes okay masha'Allah we have like 20 almost 25 who is against completely in any term in any way hitting the woman you raise your hands twice the first one the second one so in the Quran we is mentioned but you still you don't want it okay okay good good now I can say this because I'm not in Europe ah I'm not in America if I say this in America they will arrest me unfortunately we say things and we have to be diplomatic but this is online also they are can still be arrested our problem this is Quran Allah says as a soldier while at eat ha ha una Luz ahuna one fellow Hoonah to watch your novel malaga 3 what rip ohon beat them now if you look at this sequence those who have no Islamic background even if they're Muslims those who are influenced by the media by equal rights by women are equal to men by this and by that they would say I do not accept this they even go a little bit further and look and dig in the Arabic dictionaries to find and to try and find something that does not have the same meaning of bar-abba meanings to beat so they invent a new word I think someone did this and and they said no Baba in the Quran does not mean to beat it means to console to anything why do we do this because we are under the influence of the West they come to you and say this is not human rights yeah who said who gave human rights who put the human rights individuals this is the creator of the human rights allah azza wajal so he knows who he has created more than anyone else and besides human rights is something yeah I need so funny we would need a lecture to talk about it so we have animal rights and animal rights have more rights than the humans look at the Syrians they are being tortured deceased killed annihilated completely from the face of the earth what did they do what is happening nothing they will not do anything so where is the human rights where is the human rights when you come because of a terrorist attack that 2,000 and 3,000 killed though I believe completely that no terrorists were involved I have two brothers of mine captain's airplane captain Saudi Airlines professional with more than 30 years experience"
