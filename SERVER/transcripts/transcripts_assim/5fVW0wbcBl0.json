  "transcript": "so you have people speaking like this with piercings in their tongues and something is coming out of their chins and yes it's so ugly but they say this is my body I can do whatever I want wrong says can we get belly button piercing or nose or nose piercing piercing the nose is very common in the subcontinent so is it okay it is a custom for women to Adorn themselves this is only a natural thing however such a dormant has to be governed by Islamic rulings so piercing the ear is something that is commonly used by women all over the world recently they started piercing it again or three times or four piercings in the ear and Scholars disputed but generally speaking this is still permissible because the ears are a place of adornment and piercing as for the nose as Bushra said it is quite common in the subcontinent some Scholars did not like it and prohibited it because they considered it a form of Mutilation of the face and the face has it's place in Islam to be honored so it is prohibited for a man to curse his wife's face or criticize how she looks just totally prohibited for a man to say oh you have the face of a monkey or you're this fair or unfair or your color is this or your nose is this this is totally Haram and it is prohibited for a Muslim to strike any person on the face let it be a son a a foe a an enemy striking the face is prohibited and this is why we say boxing MMA martial arts in general when it includes striking the face this is prohibited in Islam when it comes to piercing some Scholars say that this is part of honoring the face others say no this is something that is common and men consider it to be a beautiful on their spouses and it's an issue that is probable so I personally do not like it but it's not in my customs and at the same time a lot of the Muslims are doing it so I would say it is permissible insha Allah but it's according to your preference now when we try to expand this and Cascade it to other parts of the body then we have a problem piercing the nipples the tongue the belly button all of these things were not found among the Muslims only nowadays with the feminist movement and the increasing number of wackos all over the world that they're coming up with this thing so you have people thinking like this with piercings in their tongues and something is coming out of their chins and yes it's so ugly but they say this is my body I can do whatever I want wrong it's not your body it's an Amana it's something that Allah entrusted you with I don't have the right to go and say to a doctor hey chop my hand I don't like I don't I'll chop my left foot he says why I said well I changed my car from manual into automatic transmission so I don't need the left foot I can't do that he cannot obey me I cannot take my life I cannot allow someone who's on a bed who's bedridden and he's suffering to end his life and euthanize him for example this is totally Haram it's not your body so cascading the ear piercing and the nose piercing to other spots and areas of the body is not permissible and Allah Knows Best"
