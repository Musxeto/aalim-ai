  "transcript": "foreign part of the morning and evening with kaar is what's known to all of us as sayyiduras and this is the master of asking allah for forgiveness in the sense that this is the best format of asking of allah for forgiveness you say it in the morning and you die allah admits you to jannah you say it in the evening and you die allah would admit you to jannah as the prophet said ali so what is sayed you are my lord none has the right to be worshipped except you you created me and i am your servant and i abide to your covenant what covenant the covenant that allah took from all of the humans not to worship any other than him so i abide to your covenant and promise as best as i can what promise the promise of whoever obeys that covenant and dies upon it will go to jannah i take refuge in you from the evil of which i have committed now i'm confessing i acknowledge your favor upon me and i acknowledge my sin so forgive me for verily none can forgive sin except you now this beautiful hadith said is something that we should maintain saying every morning and every evening over and over and over again until you meet allah azzawajal with such way of seeking forgiveness from him as a wajal the following hadith this hadith was graded weak by al-sheikh al-bani so we've excluded it from the authentic atkar however again and again why would the sheikh include a hadith where sheikh al-bani has graded as weak simply because other scholars may have authenticated it or at least graded it as hassan such as sheikh ibn baz maybe in some other hadiths may have authenticated it so he followed that it's an issue of delicate difference of opinion and these hadith do not include anything that impact your akida or haram it's in what is known as the virtues of good deeds so there's not much at risk when following it but as we usually prefer to follow only what is authentic and leave what is weak we will not take this hadith except in a very short way by reading it so that we would not neglect or we would not be neglecting any hadith allah and call on you the bearer of your throne so the bearers of the throne we know that allah azzawajal um have eight great angels carrying his throne not that allah needs them or any of his creation but this is something that allah has willed and they are among the greatest of all allah's creation so o allah verily i have reached the morning and call on you i make you my witness and i make these angels who carry your throne my witness and all the other angels and all of your creation to witness that you are allah this is the conclusion all of this is to testify that you are allah none has the right to be worshipped except you alone without any partner and that muhammad sallallahu alaihi sallam is your servant and messenger it is supposed to be said four times in the morning and in the evening but as i said earlier the hadith is not authentic and the following hadith is also a weak hadith weakened by sheikh al-bani and we will go through it just for the sake of reading the whole booklet what blessing i or any of your creation have risen upon is from you alone without any partner so for you is all praise and unto you all thanks whoever says this in the morning has indeed offered his days thanks and whoever says this in the evening has indeed offered his nights thanks and again this is not authentic the following hadith is authentic and was greeted hassan by sheikh al-bani grant my body health so you ask allah for what is known as to be exempted from all types of harm so you ask grant me my body health o allah grant my hearing health o allah grant my sight health none has the right to be worshipped except you o allah i take refuge with you from this belief okay this is very important that you seek refuge in allah from disbelief and from poverty and i take refuge with you from the torment or the punishment of the grave none has the right to be worshipped except you so all of this is to be said three times in the morning and the evening and it shows you that you're afraid of these things and that there is no one to shelter you and to give you refuge other than allah the almighty this is all the time we have until we meet next time i leave muhammad [Music]"
