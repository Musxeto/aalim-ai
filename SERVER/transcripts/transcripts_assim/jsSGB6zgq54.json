  "title": "When to recite 3 Quls and Ayatul Kursi",
  "transcript": "we recite Ayatul Kursi in the morning in \nthe evening as well as with the five daily   prayers then we recite the last three \nQuls okay but we recited them after   Fajr Dhuhr Asr Maghreb and Ishaa yeah you \nrecited them once each but in the morning   And in the evening Adhkar - you recite them thrice each.\nقل هو الله أحد three times\nقل أعوذ برب الفلق three times\nقل أعوذ برب الناس three times in the morning and in the evening so \nif you manage to say that in Fajr or   in Maghreb there is no need for you to repeat \nthat once after Fajr prayer on Maghrib prayer   because doing it three times each would suffice \nfor that you've hit two birds with one stone"
