directly from our site www. rbrick media. co.uk my name is I don't think I'm going to get a chance to get all of your names and even if I do I'm not going to remember it I'm I'm I'm too old to remember names but they said that we have to sit with the youth and so you are the youth okay that's try to get the subject to talk about anyone of you feels that he is not wanted in the society in his school in his family in his neighborhood any one feels that he's not wanted raise your hands Mah so you all blend in you all love your families right anyone who does not love his family I don't love mine it's okay all is well at school anyone who has problems at school one good he's the only truthful person the rest are liars what's your problem with school bullying you around anyone is being bullied in school the only reason is they're the bullers they're the one who's doing the bully how good are you with your friends how good are you with other students why is it important for us to be good to people so that they would be good to us but if they're not good to us can we be back to them as well is it the right thing to do are we living in a jungle meaning that I have to be the oppressor I have to be the strong one I have to be the one who's doing the bullying otherwise people would bully you we are different are we different do we look different why we have two eyes they have two eyes we have two ears two arms two legs we're not different are we we look alike as humans but still we are different why or should we be different should we look like them should we act like them should we be like them is is there a sense about this what's the difference between me and them if I look like them if I speak like them if I live like them if if I have nothing to stop me from blending in and being like that what's the difference there is a difference shouldn't there be a difference between us and them in the F what do we say meaning guide us to the straight path whose path the path of Those whom you have guided huh and favored and blessed except except what not the path of the the M those who are you have um how do you translate it the one you've been angry with or and the misguided one so there is a difference or not the straight path that we follow is the path of the prophets Messengers Companions and the the path we not supposed to follow is the path of who are they the Jews and the Christians so now are we different or not we are different because when we behave when we Act what we do is not from our whims and desires it is from the Quran and the Sunnah so if I feel like let me take a quick look now okay none of you seem to have this uh Marines haircut you know the Marines haircut will you shave this bit and you keep only the top if I would like to have this one is it no why true because the whole side or actually the whole hair should be the same length but there's another reason changing changing what Allah has created okay if I shave it all it's still changing no haircuts is not part of changing what Allah has created because this has to be permanent temporary change is permissible that's why I trim my mustache though Allah created it to grow I I'm old I cannot hear you have to shout because the prophet forade to shave part of it and leave part of it you have to leave it all or shave it all but because it's also imitating the disbelievers and we're not allowed to imitate them so someone says she you're wearing glasses why are you imitating the KU is this a valid statement no because Muslims and cafir all wear it why are you wearing pants or actually trousers everybody's wearing it Muslims and non-muslims so there's no problem in in doing that the problem problem is with your identity now if you see me in Alaska would you recognize I'm a Muslim would you you can tell I'm a Muslim huh now if I see you anywhere can I sayam alayum or I'm hesitant I look at you and I analyze you and I say okay let's see what relates him to Islam externally I did not speak to you I did not talk to you to know that you're a Muslim or not I'm just visualizing so I look at the pants it's below the ankles I look at the beard it's shaven then I look at probably wearing the ring in here or here and this is not permissible in Islam I didn't know well now you know maybe waiting and eating Maybe maybe putting a small tattoo maybe wearing a necklace all of this is UN Islamic so if I see you I probably doubt that you're a Muslim because I have no sign until you come to me and sayum I'm a Muslim then I can recognize you what differs us from them is not a beard theik have longer beards you know theik you know the the guys with the turbans they have longer beards so are they better Muslim no it is not wearing this so that separates us it is what's in here in your heart so what is in your heart the love of Allah the love of the Prophet how much do you love the prophet a lot if someone curses your father or mother how would you feel angry but if someone curses the prophet or his companions how would you feel Ang it's okay then you have a problem and that is why your identity is extremely important your identity as a Muslim and this identity must show in your school in your neighborhood and in your house how can you be a Muslim if you abuse or disrespect your father and mother does anyone of you disrespect his father or mother nobody thereare say yes do you what kind of disrespect is there to your father give me an example lie to your father talking back to your father arguing no if it's a polite argument I don't want you to go to the school and you say yes but it has this and this and this and you talk nicely this is permissible it's not disrespectful but when he tells you go and put this in the kitchen and you say why me not him you're always pitting on me this is disrespecting what kind of disrespecting to your mother disobey talking back is same thing now there's something yes raising the voice very good raising the voice over your mother one of the Sal his name he was at one side of the house and his mother was at the other side of the house and she said my son and he said yes mother and she repeated my son she didn't hear him so he said yes mother and then he said I raised my voice and he freed two slaves just to compensate to expiate for that sin he thought it was a sin it wasn't unintentional one of the ways of disrespecting your mother is that dirty look you give to your mother when she says something you don't like do you guys do this huh I see people smiling you do this when your mother tells you your room is untiy you're always like this why don't you clean your room did we bring you from an orphanage did you bring you from the street what is your response a very bad look to your mom as if you are belittling her disrespecting him this takes you straight to H so this is your IDE identity in the house what is your identity in the school who among you does not curse or say foul words or foul language at school raise your hand okay that's good four five maybe and the rest it's all you know the blipper words I cannot say them so you know the words so why do you use them because everybody else is using them but you're not everyone else you are a Muslim I taught in my school I I years ago I was a teacher in Saudi Arabia and for 15 years at my school it was normal to beat children we can beat them with a stick yeah I never laid the hand on a a student I never said a dog or a donkey to a student in my life I never cursed or said a bad word to a student not that I'm afraid of them they're afraid of me you know like 20 years ago I had biceps double the size I was really huge and they were intimidated they were scared from me but I treated them as men I never curse not a single word not because I can't I would love to but my religion my identity my Prophet never did this and I would never do that so this identity of yours is one of the greatest means of Daw of calling people to Islam when you're a good Muslim student everybody is using foul language everybody is cheating in the tests and exams everybody is lying and you're the only one who does not lie who does not cheat who does not do something that people can say ah Dua what would this cause to the others it would call them to look at this person why is he like this why is he different in a good sense because he's a Muslim imine imine how many people would accept Islam few years later because they had a friend at school who did this and that you remember ab's speech yesterday what did he say he said something that one of his teachers every single day came to him and asked him what does Islam say about this what does the Quran say he was 11 years old why would the teacher come to him and ask because he had an identity no he not knowledge he was a Muslim he had an identity now when is it possible for people to come and visit you when people come and ask you in your school because you're a Muslim why do people come up to me they don't know me non Muslims and say you're a Muslim why do you grow the beard what would I say not of a goddamn business it's an opportunity so I say listen sit down let's get some coffee and I talk to them and I tell them what Islam is don't look at the beard look what Islam really is so your identity being different in a positive way not being different in the sense that youd put two horns here and say I'm Different no being different in your character being different different in being truthful being kind standing up for the truth always trying to be generous and a good Muslim this is what or this what separates us from them and likewise in the society in your neighborhood do you listen anyone do you listen do you yeah every oh why isn't this your country or is it it this is your country you're living in it it's your country if it's not your country then you should go somewhere else but if this is your country you have to take care of it and not only that if you throw something what will the cafer say look at the Muslim he's literally if you're in your car and you're blowing the music you don't have cars do you if you're in your BMX maybe on your bicycle and you have a studio at the back or whatever and you're blowing music what the CF would say ah respect he's one of us a Muslim doesn't do this so a Muslim is always under the microscope whatever he does people interpret this to be his religion so that is why when I'm on the streets I drive well in accordance to the speed liit I never make any traffic violation I always give way to the people it's my way someone wants to cross the road someone wants to come in I would just say because this leaves an impression in the hearts of disbelievers of in the hearts of non-muslims that Muslims are kind Muslims are generous Muslims are Cooperative are you like this oh are you like this hello people are sleeping so as a responsibility of those who live in Great Britain in the UK it is your responsibility to give DAW and the best way to give Daw is to have your identity as a Muslim and to express Islam in your actions by obeying the law by abiding by it by being kind and generous if you see someone in need help them if you see someone who's hungry feed them if you see someone doing something bad advise them and always remember remember that you are representing this religion always remember that you are representing Islam if you do something bad it's a sin but it's a double sin because you're sinful for doing something bad and you're sinful for giving the wrong impression the wrong picture about Islam here is where you have to fight and crush the bad desires you have and the bad feelings you want to express have 9 minutes to go if you have questions questions about identity questions about Islam go ahead and ask otherwise we call it a day five more minutes okay how easy can I have my coffee questions you have a question and that's why you came seriously if you don't have questions I'm going to ask you can I ask you questions yes there's no restriction for you to grow beard at school no grow beard see the problem is growing a beard is mandatory in Islam if it wasn't I would have saved it immediately I'd love to be like everyone else you know blend in no one would give me that strange look few months ago I was flying and the captain of the plane was a friend of mine so he said come into the cockpit so I was wearing the Saudi dress and everything and I went into the cockpit just you say hi and the guy say said sit down watch your take off and after half an hour go back to your seat so I did and I was going coming out of the cockpit I looked at the faces of the people in the first class lounge and there was a until I came out they thought that was going to to hijack the airplane so wherever I go whatever I do this is the impression I get because of my beard because of how I look now I would like to look like anyone else unnoticed but Allah will not be pleased with me so I could care less about what people think I do what Allah loves and I try to try my best to make people understand whenever you want to do something don't ask what would my father say what would my mother say what would the people say if Allah tells you to do it you should do it without any questions do you think that it would go unnoticed meaning like third fourth week M your skin is fair so probably you're going to have a good beard so do you think that the fourth week people say mashallah masallah good for you nice beard no they will criticize you they say are you and what is this becoming a even the Muslims will criticize you so okay come give us a lecture they're trying to put you down don't worry you're doing it for who Allah as long as Allah is pleased with me I could care less but the problem is it's a very thin line because my cell tells me to do a lot of bad things not only that the society is encouraging me to do bad things yet the only source of encouragement I get is from the Quran and Sunnah and this I rarely touch this I rarely go back to for guidance so you have to work hard you have to do it for the sake of Allah and believe me in no time everyone would become supportable but it needs some courage for the first like 3 4 months and then it's normal questions uh what's the name of the Liverpool footballer famous one no Manchester United Okay you guys Mah know your football well right what's the name of the 10 heav heav bound Companions of the Prophet the 10 Heaven bound the prophet said these are in heaven and he named 10 of them I'll give you a hint four of them is abak and Ali so you have six left you have to get the six you have to have the six right or we will uh uh uh um cut your F no this is too harsh um you have to you have to get the permission first you know them one of them only you know Gerard you know uh whatever Andre used to play here right the French uh Muslim what's his name huh no no there was a Muslim uh player French not re or Henry or Henry and Andre or whatever okay let's see six of them if you look there we will torture you no no what is that listen when you go to paradise will you know the people in Paradise they will tell you this is abak I don't know him this is T who great companion of the Prophet I don't know him this is you kidding no he's a great companion of the Prophet I don't know anything of him you don't know anyone in Paradise but if you take a tour to hell you know everyone in there Lady Gaga I don't say that she's in hell until she dies not not yet maybe she becomes Muslim Allah Allah knows best so you have to know your history in order to be proud of your identity if you don't know the companion if you don't know the the 10 closest companions to the prophet then you have a problem of course you all know the wives of the Prophet right a khad khad AA uh Fatima no no oh sorry so who knows the wives of the Prophet AA this is what I said khad do you know a wife of the Prophet my namea have heard the namea yes may Allah be pleased with her who's saying Asma Asma no s you telling me yes Asma is a sister-in-law of the Prophet the sister of of is the daughter of Omar the daughter of Abu sufyan good who else sua Su B I don't know no Sumaya is not Sumaya is the mother of who was martyred in meca so she's not the wife of the Prophet she was a slave what else who's else um Sal rings the bell Sophia rings the bell no sopia was a Jew and then she accepted Islam she became the mother of the Believers you see where we are having a problem with the identity we know if I say like uh Ice Age one Ice Age 2 everybody knows about it if I say mka what is it whatever everybody knows of it I love to move it move it use it whatever huh he knows it so we have a problem of identity these people if you have them in your heart in the back of your mind you become a good Muslim because every incident they did was representing Islam but we when you don't have a history you don't have a future if you don't know your history if you don't know your companions if you don't know the biography and the SE of the Prophet you have a problem of identity so I think that we should wrap it up for this boring for this interesting talk and inshah looking forward for another one me"
