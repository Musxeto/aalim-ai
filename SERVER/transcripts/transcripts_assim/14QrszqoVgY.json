  "title": "Can we wear or sell Nike that says Goddess Of Victory or has God like figure? #islam assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "as well. Uh yeah, so I've had a look at some of your videos related to wearing Nike brand and when it's a doubtful matter, yeah, I will just stay away. The only reason I'm asking this question is I've got some um for related to business stock related to Nike and the other day I came across uh where they're starting to sell the night product where it says goddess of victory and also like a logo with the like a like a god type figure. Something recently I came across. So, I just thought I'd run it past you because obviously I won't wear it, but I've got stock to sell. So, just thought, should I stay away from this or is it still okay to wear this in spite of it because it's not really well known anyway, but I thought I'd double check. Thank you. My video is crystal clear in what I think and believe. So, if you've watched it, it would be illogical to ask me again. My stance is the same. I personally wear Nike shoes and shirts and caps and the likes and I don't have any problem with that because nobody believes in the goddess of sports or whatever they think it is. Nobody even knows about nobody knows about it nowadays and nobody worships such a god or a goddess or whatever. It's just a name. It's just a brand. So I have no problem in that inshallah."
