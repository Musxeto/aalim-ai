  "title": "Are we rewarded for wearing White? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "there's had this right the prophet said that you're white foreign it's very pure and cleaner and short you're dead in it so my question check is if one wears a white garment or for example a white soap or shirt the hadith if i understood your question speaks about the recommendation of wearing white and if one does wear white to follow the hadith of course he would be rewarded for that and it is something that allah would reward him for it because the prophet ordered us to wear white in the state of being alive and to shroud our dead in white cloth when they die so this is part of the sunnah and if you do it you are rewarded for it and allah azzawajal knows best"
