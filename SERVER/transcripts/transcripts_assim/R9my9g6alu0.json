  "transcript": "Adam from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum. Walaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. If somebody borrows a book from like a school or a library during Jahliyah, should he give a book back if he has like inappropriate images? If there are a lot of images like as in every single page, should he give back the book? Yes, he has to give back the book and it's not his responsibility to, how do you say, monitor or edit or do anything as such, because this is the book that he borrowed, he has to return it as it is, and Allah knows best."
