  "title": "How to know if a hadith is authentic or unauthentic? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "most of the scholars say that the particular hadith is authentic and another is unauthentic would like to ask what is this criterion that makes the hadith authentic or unauthentic this is like asking a doctor a neurosurgeon how is he going to operate on a patient and what are the procedures he's going to follow a layman like me and you can't understand this you may not be able to understand how a neurosurgeon work and a neurosurgeon may not understand how you as a professional mechanic work on a car engine so each one has his expertise his knowledge and this is his bread and butter so you cannot understand this unless you study from scratch the science of masala hadith and then go and study the different types of men El Mirage al al jar what a deal and all of these things that require lots of books lots of time and tutoring you need a juror to come and direct you how to walk and move between these mazes that you will find to understand such a huge and beautiful science"
