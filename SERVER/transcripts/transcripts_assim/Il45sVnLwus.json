  "transcript": "Sufyan from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh How are you Sheikh? I'm fine Just a quick question. I have a question in regards to Jumu'ah and work in the West. I know you answer this question sometimes, but basically my question is If a person works in the West, has the intention of making Hijrah somewhere along the line, but at the moment he works at a job and he asks his boss or his manager Am I able to leave for Jumu'ah? And he refuses and he doesn't find any Muslims to pray with. Is the excuse from the Jumu'ah prayer? And also assuming he does find people that he can pray with, I've never understood how exactly does that work? Because what if there's nobody who can really speak Arabic or have knowledge to do the Khutbah? Is the prayer itself necessary? First of all, those who work in a Kafir country and they, as stated before, the bread winners, and they have to work to feed themselves and their families. If it is time for Jumu'ah prayer, they have to try to reach a settlement with the management, either to make them up later on, on the same day or during the week. And if they agree, Alhamdulillah, it's a win-win. If they don't, they are exempted from praying Jumu'ah. Because in the books of Fiqh, if a person has merchandise or goods, and the time for Jumu'ah is due, and he cannot take this merchandise with him to the masjid, and there's no one else to keep an eye on it, no one says, leave it, go to pray and come back, because it would be stolen and taken away. So, jurors say, this is a legitimate excuse for you to skip Jumu'ah, because you are unable to protect your earning, your business, and likewise with your job. So, there's no problem in doing this, Insha'Allah. Now, you ask a second question, and the policy says that we shouldn't answer your question, so you may ask it on a later time, bi-idhnillah. Al-Fatiha."
