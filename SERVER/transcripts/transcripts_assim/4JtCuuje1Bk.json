  "transcript": "foreign after inaugurating the prayer saying bismillah reciting the fatty harry saying a short surah afterwards then in prayer we go to record what do we say in rukur what is the roku position it's the bowing position it's when you bend your back and it's parallel to the ground and this is where you express glorification of allah azzawajal worship to allah azzawajal and showing that you praise him subhanahu wazida you say three times as the prophet used to say ali subhan how perfect my lord is the supreme or glory be to allah the great either way it's not that easy to translate what does subhan mean or the concept of saying subhana rabbi al-adhim is to glorify allah to purify allah to exempt allah from anything that does not befit him so one says allah is like this allah is like that we say subhanallah this is not befitting to allah so anything that relates to attributes that do not fit allah someone says allah gets tired allah sleeps allah dies subhanallah from death from being tired from sleep all of these are not attributed to allah and we exempt allah azzawajal purify him from such things this is what we say when or what we mean when we say subhana rabbi the basics is to say it once in rukur this is mandatory this is obligatory if you add then you may say three and some say the sunnah is to say it ten as per the hadith of anas may allah be pleased with him when he noticed um he's praying and he said that this man prays exactly similar to the prayer of the prophet and they counted that he says subhanallah ten times is that all no there are so many athkar in rukur among them is to say this beautiful kalahuma glorify be you o lord and praise and i praise you o allah forgive me this is found in surat nasr and the prophet when this surah was revealed he used to interpret the ayas into his rakuwa and into his sujud so we should also add this when possible what else the prophet also used to say this vikr so and venturated uh um the lord of the angels and of the rooh who is jibril what is subbu these are two of allah's beautiful names subbu is the purified and venerated one azzawajal meaning that he's so perfect kudos is similar in name which is purified nothing can reduce his perfection and this is why we call it baital makthis the purified and the holy uh um [Music] masjid in al-qudz and jibril is known as the purified one as well so these are two beautiful names of allah and you watch and and notice that these two names are adjacent and joined with the lord of the angels and of jibril why because in surat al-baqarah allah mentions this is what the angels do all the time they glorify allah azzawajal make tasbih and takadis to allah all the time so it was suitable to combine these two together now we go on to a longer version of vikkir in roku the prophet alaihis salatu whenever he used to make roku he used to say the following islam is unto you i have bowed okay and in you i have believed and to you i have submitted now are you telling allah allah knows everything this is cementing the belief in your heart that your bowing your belief your submission is to allah repeating this makes you live on it and die on it not be on shaky grounds this cements it deep down in your heart my hearing my sight my here it says mind where it should be a bone marrow what's inside the bones themselves then bones and tendons and what my feet carry are humbled before you are submissive before you wow wow seriously when you say these words and you believe them in while in rukur you won't make us you say it with conviction with belief with wanting to get closer to allah this is where you get your reward the most and you benefit from your prayer the most this is all the time we have until we meet next time i leave allah foreign foreign"
