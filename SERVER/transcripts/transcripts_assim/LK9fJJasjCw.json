  "transcript": "[Music] my Creator oh Allah fulfill our AIMS in life Allah forgive our sins yeah Allah oh Allah the most gracious oh Allah the most gracious y [Music] [Music] alhamd we're still studying the minor signs of the hour and there are 10 major signs that I believe inshallah if Allah prolongs in our lives that we will be discussing them next week there are so many minor signs but I'm trying to collect and share with you those that are related to our lives and that people can relate to for example one of the signs of the hour was mentioned in the Hadith of the Prophet Alat wasam when he said the time will be short meaning the periods of time will come closer to each other would be short knowledge would be extracted and uplifted and tribulations and tests will appear widely and will prevail and people would be stingy and misery they will all hold back their fortunes and their uh giving uh charity and being kind to people and killing would be spread all over the place so this is a sign which is time becoming shorter this is very apparent we can all feel that and relate to it we always complain that there is no time there isn't enough time to do things and not only that the prophet Alam told us in an authentic Hadith that the hour would not be called it would not be day the day of judgment until time is so short that a year feels like a month and a month feels like a week or a Friday and a week or a Friday feels like a day and a day feels like an hour and an hour feels like what the time takes to ignite a a match or to start a fire so the look at the match when you light it and it soon is extinguished this is how an hour would feel nowadays it's the same thing Subhan Allah ask anyone about last Ramadan and they would tell you Subhan Allah as if it was yesterday ask the people about this Ramadan and when it was announced that today is the beginning of Ramadan and they say Subhan Allah as if it was moments ago today is the 13th of Ramadan yet people Subhan Allah feel as if it's the first or the second day so time flies and as stated before a lot of the people complain and they say we don't have time you have time then why do we feel like this well Scholars say there are a number of reasons for time to be so short and things happen so fast one of them Scholars say that it is due to means of transportation a distance that you would cover in a month now you cover it in less than an hour by plane due to mass communication means such as the internet the phones now you can talk from Saudi Arabia I can speak to someone in Canada through a Skype and I'm supposed to give a lecture uh uh after Eid in the UK through Skype as if I'm there attending questions and giving my lecture so it made the whole world a small place so time runs so fast we cannot catch up with it other Scholars say well this is clearly an indication that at the end of the time Allah would take away the blessing from our lives and from our times and this is noticeable when I read for example in the biography of the IM nawi and see that that the scholars calculated the number of pages he wrote throughout his life adulthood life and they found that it is approximately 40 pages a day imagine someone writing for compiling and writing something that is completely new 40 pages a day the whole of his life this is the average which means that sometimes he would uh uh write like 200 Pages or more what time did he have to sleep and if we know that he used to pray night prayer most of the night and he used to fast a day Al and skip a day he alternates and he used to recite the Quran and finish so manyas and he used to teach in the Masjid in the school and he used to have like many students and he would write these 40 pages a day and if you look at us nowadays we can barely find time to do any of one of these things why because Allah has taken the blessing the Baraka from our lives and whenever you talk to anyone why don't you do this I don't have time why don't you visit your nextkin I don't have time why don't you take your kids here or there I have no time it was reported that a businessman in his 40s and his father was in his 70s and there was an appointment together that the son would come to pick up his father at 12:00 just before and the sun did could not make it due to business and meetings and so on and he was carried away until it was 1:00 and when he remembered he rushed to his father's house to find his father standing outside the house in the sun in the middle of the summer and and he tried to apologize but the father was so mad and angry he would not talk to him he would only tell him get in the car so the son got in his fancy beautiful uh uh uh luxurious car and the father rode next to him and he told him go straight and the son's trying to ask ask where said don't ask just go so he goes right left according to what his father is telling him to drive and then they reach the Cemetery so the father said stop here get out and the son started to feel scared why he said just get out and walk so he took him to the middle of the cemetery and the boy was sheving he thought that his father is going to kill him or do something and bury him and then the father looked at his son and said my son look around you what do you see and he looked around him and he saw thousands and thousand thousands of dead people Graves nothing and the son and and the father told his son my son look at those in these Graves all of them died with work still unattended and this is a fact there will never come a time that we would say alhamdulillah now I'm free I don't have anything to do every moment carries some work some responsibilities so no one would die die would actually die with his desk clean with no papers to sign with no project to complete with no debts to pay with no duties to uh carry everyone would die being short from completing what he wanted to complete and that is why a proper and wise Muslim would prioritize his tasks you cannot finish everything at the same time so you have to put your priorities and set them and follow them accordingly only then you will find the blessing in your life in your time and you would find something that you can utilize the Baraka has been extracted because we don't have knowledge because we have no problem in consuming Haram and abandoning mandatory things such as prayers fasting we do lots and lots of things that please us but we always neglectful about the things that please Allah and that is why the Baraka is only in the hands of Allah and the issue of Baraka is very vast and big this is not the time to speak about it but it is essential to know that Baraka comes only from Allah seeking it from anyone else would be uh uh uh disastrous among the signs of the hour the widespread of riba and what is riba riba is what is known as Ury and it is the interest incurred over a loone and this is one type of it because there are different types and talking about it also would not be suitable for this signs of the hour it would be probably uh uh good in ASA or in any other uh classes but generally speaking what the banks are doing now is considered to be RBA they give you 100,000 you pay it 120,000 this is RBA clear RBA money for money there is a extra because of the loan what does the prophet tells USB abdah may Allah be pleased with him the companion of the Prophet Alat wasam said that the prophet saidat wasam just before the hour riba which is interest will appear and also Al fornication and consuming intoxicants these three have already appeared so we know that the hour is soon Allah knows when but we know it is uh approaching and I'm talking about the Muslims now if you look at the implication of riba you can look at what happened in 200 I think in 8 the credit crunch 2007 2008 the credit crunch crunch the foreclosures the people that lost their houses the people that lost their businesses the people who are homeless not in uh uh uh Thailand or in uh uh Sagal I'm talking about people in Europe and in America why did they lose everything because everything was based on riba I'm not talking about these people I'm talking about the Muslims when the Muslims start to deal with RBA then you have have a problem and I do not know Muslims who do not deal in ribba most countries have their Economy based on riba if not all countries most countries don't have Islamic banking they don't allow Islamic Banking and some of them do allow it but they are so little of course alhamdulillah with the grace of Allah the Islamic banking is on the rise and even the non-muslims are headed to Islamic banking because of the low risk and the sustainable profit and the Islamic way of dealing with it there is no extortion there is no handling of intoxicant smoking uh uh arms or entertainment all of these are Haram in Islam that's why you find the Islamic banking away from it the prophet said Al there will come a time and this is in theah there will come a time time when people do not care whether they get their money from Halal Oram and this is exactly what's happening nowadays in the Muslim world you find people working in Haram you find people working in uh uh Banks and they deal in riba and they give clear riba and they sign these contracts knowing that the prophet had cursed those who deal with RBA giving and taking and those who write and document it and those who witness it all of these are cursed and the prophet said they are all the same in the Sin Subhan Allah you would find people working in things that promote promote fornication Pro promote being distant from the Quran and the Sunnah people working in OSN for example uh um networks that publish video movies entertainment everything that is Haram they publish it and you pay money to get the cable or to get the receiver or the the coder in your house and watch it as if Allah is not watching you those who work in these companies don't they know that they have a day of judgment in Allah would hold them accountable my Reckoning is they don't otherwise they would not have worked some of them do they pray they fast but at the same time as the prophet said there will come a time where people do not care whether they're in inome is from Halal or from Haram this is exact what we are seeing at the moment everywhere now a lot of the ignorant would be impressed by the filthy wealth of these multi-billionaires who own Banks who own entertainment companies and they are astonished by their lavish style of living like karun and his people when they said we wish we were like him Subhan Allah however don't be impressed because this wealth is a mean of Torment to them as Allah St stated that twice in Surah atba verse uh uh chapter n where Allah says that do not be impressed by their children Offspring and their wealth merely Allah wants to torture them it's a means of Torment for them and this life and they are disbelievers this is about the Hypocrites and these people have a share of that so no matter how billions and millions you have as long as you are investing it in Haram don't be impressed maybe they will take 1% definitely it would not even reach 0.1% of their wealth and give it to the poor give it to the Beggars give it to whoever come to them and extend their hands and they give it and they think that okay this erases that but it's not like this do not be impressed the prophet tells youat that do not be impressed by the magnitude the amount of RBA because no matter how huge it is eventually it will be reduced into nothing so this is actual if you have billions of dollars in your hands and if you have these riba based in financial institution institutions Banks and whatever and you're lending people with RBA and you're taking RBA and you're depositing your money in riba and you're collecting all of this do you think Allah is blessing you because you're a good Muslim Allah is enlarging your wealth because you are one of his favorite uh Pious righteous servants no Allah is giving you away so that you would increase in sin when you go back to him you will find what you were fooled with with this glamorous life so we have to stay away from these uh uh interest based institutions one would say alhamdulillah I don't have any problem yes you have a problem don't you have a credit card Visa Master Card American Express they all charge you riba you sign a paper you sign a contract that if the grace period is over whether it's 40 or 45 days and I don't pay what I have bought by credit then they will charge you 4% % 7% and it accumulates until you are enslaved for them signing the contract though you did not borrow in riba signing the contract by itself is an approval and agreement that you agree and approve of riba and this is a major sin so look at the people in the west those who bought their houses on mortgage this is Haram this but we're living in America we're living in UK we have to buy you don't have to buy you can live your entire life on but when you buy a house on mortgage on riba then you have made RBA Halal and the rate uh uh uh fluctuates meaning that the house I bought is £100,000 10 years down the line I would discover that it went up to 120 why they said well uh the inflation rate is gone up and going down so we have to charge you this and you keep on paying interest until you die this is this Isam Allah made this one of the major sins in Islam moving on to a third sign of the hour the prophet saysat wasam at the end of the time there will be landslides stoning from the sky and transmutation into animals or disfigurement or deformity when would this happen the prophet says when stringed instruments and female singers will will be widespread and wine will be permitted two things and these are the signs of the hours one of them wine would be permitted we spoke about that yesterday and we know that the majority of Muslim countries serve alcohol freely and sell it and buy it no problem so we have to ask those doing this is it Halal if if they say yes it's Halal to buy it and S it in this case they're not Muslims they have committed an act that nullifies uh uh their Islam and if they say know it's Haram we know that it's a sin but we have to do this then it's a major sin and they will be punished but they're still Muslim the second sign is telling us when the uh uh stringed instruments and female singers will be white spread open any TV station in the Muslim world you will find it dominated by women singing and this is Haram in Islam you will find music stores widely spread open the radio turn on the radio and listen to it you'll find music Around the Clock turn on the TV stations you'll find music Around the Clock what is this and they say ah it's an issue of dispute no it's not an issue of dispute the Hadith is Crystal Clear in no one can doubt this and whoever doubts this has no knowledge of uh uh this Dean in the science of Hadith the Hadith is authentic in and the consensus of the four schools of thought you have to be a follower of one of them Abu hanifah Malik shaf and Ahmed they all agree that music musical instruments are forbidden the hanafi school of thought went to a little bit more extreme and they said whoever enjoys listening to music is a cfir but this is Extreme the most authentic opinion is it's a sin but when I say it's a sin people think oh alhamdulillah it's a sin okay we can do it it's not a major sin so we can do it yeah let me tell you something the least person to be punished in hell is a person that the prophet told us about so let's assume you fornicate you drink intoxicant you smoke you don't pray on time in message but you pray you're a Muslim but on the day of judgment let's assume that Allah forgives every single thing except smoking and Allah Wills that you are punished for this single sin everything else Allah forgave you except smoking what is the punishment the prophet tells that the least person punished in Hell on the day of judgment is a person who has a firey uh Stone a stone of fire placed in his sandal in his foot and his brain boils from its heat so his body is conducting Heat this is the least one to be punished so when it comes to a sin and you say listening to music is okay it's a sin be careful because if Allah wants it wanted to take you with this sin you are doomed and one would say why is music Haram music is beautiful music brings Joy to the soul I when I go to bed I listen to Bach sometime I listen to bethoven or modart and I feel nice when I go to an Oprah I feel sophisticated when I go to a a ballet I feel that this is a beautiful uh uh portrait of art so why is music Haram you Muslims don't like music you have heart hearts hard hearts and you don't have a taste no no it's not this at all it isn't a question of being independent and depending and relying only on Allah a brother came to me in the Masjid after f a couple of days ago and he was asking me about so many questions and among the questions he said I pray I fast I do everything but I just love music and I love to break dance and I was shocked because the man is praying the young man is praying f with us so I told him it is Haram he said is it haram or Mak I heard that it is Mak and after talking to him I found out that his b his his religion his Islam is based on I heard and I heard he doesn't know the Quran nor the Sunnah he doesn't read so what and the majority of Muslims are like this I heard that this thing is halal and this is not sufficient as a Muslim you have to take your religion from the Quran and from the Sunnah so I told him that music is bad that music does this to you it controls your life Allah stated in the Quran speaking to Shan to the Devil he's telling him provoke them with your sound muah says his sound is musical instrument it's singing and you can find this the power you get when you work out in the gym if you do your arobics if you are working out and you're listening to music you find so much power Once you turn it off 40% of your power is gone why because your power is not coming from Allah asael this is driven by shatan meaning that Shan is giving you this and look at the music we have whether it is uh uh punk rock whether it's heavy metal whether it is jazz blues whether it's uh uh uh green grass or whatever they call it a blue grass well I'm I'm color blind blue grass or whatever look at the lyrics is it promoting the love of Allah is it promoting piety or or or righteousness is it promoting that you do good things it all it all promotes love desires lusts will wom killing violence drugs so it does not go side by side to Islam the brother said to me well I'm addicted to it I cannot leave it and I told him this is Ramadan and Ramadan is the month of anti- addiction and that is why the Halal things food and drink and uh uh uh intimacy with the spouse all of these become forbidden during the daytime of Ramadan why it's good to eat yes but Allah wants you to clean your system wants you to kick the habit for his sake and he wants you not to be addicted to anything even halal food so your addiction to music your addiction to Hip Hop your addiction to whatever this is an indication that your slavery is not 100% to Allah and that you have a problem so the prophet is telling us that when we see these musical instruments when we see the women singers and we have them in the hundreds and the thousands with lousy voices but beautiful uh uh makeup so they look good when you see them on screen when you see them on the satellite channels you look at them but you don't listen to them because they look more than or better than they sound this is is a sign of the hour what will happen the prophet is giving us a die warning a very serious warning when this happens when you have this then there will be three things that will come to our umah to the Muslims and that is line slides or Earth collapsing so this is not earthquakes only and you have to have the land slides and you'll find towns and people and and and things collapsing and you will have have also stoning from the sky over a people as a punishment and you will have transmutation into monkeys into pigs as took the things that took place uh with the Jews before it will come but this time to the followers of Muhammad who refused to follow him and follow their lusts instead we have a short break and then we will take your phone calls stay tuned fulfill our AIMS in life Allah and there is an American sister who's very active in da in Egypt told me personally that she traveled between Buddhism Christianity and different sex and when she came to read the Quran she started by reading from right to left F she said I swear once I finished it I fainted I could not believe myself that there is such book that people were so negligent and ignorant about this is that has to be the book of Allah subh and she said I accepted Islam simply after reading and knowing the first chapter seven verses seven verses the Arabic itself which is the Allah spoke the Quan so this is by itself is a medicine it is a word of it's a word of Allah subhana tal it goes into the heart he was cre rather Allah SP May Ramadan nights Beed with w and forgiveness Ramadan Ramadan [Music] Ramadan can't do that because you do not know what to say to them sometime at least you raise up your hand and ask Allah oh Allah please give guidance to this brother of mine the importance of following Prophet Muhammad sallu alh wasallam to follow our Prophet sallallah alhi wasallam means you must understand his Islam is a very easy religion simple religion so don't make religion difficult to yourself I believe this Hadith is very common to all of us but the beauty part of this Hadith number one it started by Omar saying now again I'd like to share with the brother and sister to understand the beauty of this say of the [Music] [Applause] companion oh my Creator oh Allah fulfill our inam alaykum and welcome back uh the lines are open and I believe that you'll find inshallah the numbers at the bottom of your screen if you have any questions related to the topic and until we get your calls um we go move on to one other sign and this sign is very visible and it's a specific sign the prophet told usat that at the end of his umah which means close to the hour there will be naked or there will be clothed women yet naked so how can you have this well let's listen to two hadiths and if time permits the prophet says that at the end of the time there will be men riding saddles as big as tents or houses which is an indication to cars so the prophet is telling us that there will come and not only that he says and they will come and Dismount at the gates of the masjids and this is exactly what we're doing we're driving until the Gate of the Masjid and we park our car and leave and the prophet is further describing their women he says their women are clothed yet naked and on their heads it is like the hump of a camel and I've seen this in the Emirates and I've seen this in a lot of the Gulf States where women wear their Abaya but they put they wear their hair as a bun on top of their heads and when you see them it's exactly like the prophet described uh Aisha from Nigeria yeah yes yes sister what can I do mute mute your television and listen to me from the phone mute your television listen to the M from the phone okay

like to add a little bit more to the amount of zakat yeah yeah actually my amount is maybe 300 approximate but just to be on side 400 okay and the third question is jagat in fact I don't know anybody in libia so can I give jagat also in India and is it immediately before or I can right from now maybe after 5 to 10 days I will answer your question and sir I love you AZ from Dubai hello uh I have a question actually I taken a loan from HSBC Bank four years back uh which they claim this is an Sharia compliance section they say it is a profit based not interest based did I do sin by taking this loan can you clarify this please I have I always think that I committed a s from this brother I cannot tell you whether it's good or bad unless I know exactly what the transaction was about so did they sell you something have a certificate from the Sharia Court it is a Sharia complaint yeah everybody has certificate now you have Halal fish it tells you Halal fish as if we Slaughter fish everybody laughs and and and jokes about this but what is the actual transaction did they sell you something and then you're paying it in installments yeah did pay it in the installment yeah but you did not buy anything from them uh I I I took the car from that loan okay I will answer your question inshallah i'mna from from I'm Nigeria from Nigeria yes sister Amna what can I do for you t Amna sister Amna listen to me from the phone not from the TV hello well I think we've lost sister am AA had uh two questions one what's the ruling on a woman leading other women in prayer or in the answer it's completely permissible and the woman stands in between them not in front of them like the men so the woman stands in the same row with other sisters and she leads them in prayer into no problem in that alhamdulillah she's asking about attaching something to her hair if that thing she's attaching is like ribbons and when I see it I know immediately it is cloth okay amra from Nigeria my first is my question is in my watching place we form a Cooperative Society okay in our Cooperative Society we contribute money and at the end of the year at the end of the month we loan out that money to ourselves and we do put interest and that interest we do share it for our that's my number one question how how what what do you do with the money Amina Amina what do you do with the money yes when you when you collect the money and do you invest it in something col when now what do you invest it in when we collect the money we share it to our okay so why do you do thisam why do you do this why do you collect the money why do you collect the money among yourselves well I think I think we' we've lost uh sister Amina so attaching something to your hair a female if it's something that is made of cloth or ribbons or colorful Brown yellow red people know that these are ribbons so this is no problem the problem is when it may deceive someone or a lot of people thinking that this is your hair or this they know that it is not your hair but it looks like hair this is Haram the prophet cursed those who do this to women like the hairdressers when they make them wear uh uh attachments that of natural hair or of artificial hair and th those women who allow this to happen to them the prophet cursed Botham a wig also shares the same ruling a woman wearing a wig this is also forbidden because anything that is related to the hair or looks like hair and you put it on your head this is uh uh forbidden Al from Libya he's saying putting the right hand on the left on the chest how is that there are two forms one either you hold your wrist like this with a fist you hold it like this and put it on the chest or you put your hand you place it on the the hand the back of your hand the wrist and part of the of the arm and the chest can be from here until the nav and there are hadiths stating that the hands would be put under the navl but they're not authentic there are a lot of AAR about the companions about some of the scholars but they do not reach the level of authenticity which theith Alani authenticated uh I think it's about narrated by may Allah be pleased upon him or may Allah be pleased with him that the prophet used to put his right over his left on the chest so the chest is from below your neck until the naval all of this is your chest you can put your hands there without any problem uh secondly he says that our zakat is like $300 plus can I pay $400 you can pay $1,000 it's no problem this is the limit you must pay if you want to add to that the sky is the limit because this is all for the benefit of the Muslims the poor the needy so you give them the money this is permissible and you are rewarded for that what's not permissible if the zakat is $312 and you say ah the $12 I will skip it and I'll just pay 300 to make it even this is Haram uh he's asking that on we have to pay Zak and as he is in Libya he doesn't know one anyone in Libya so he can can he send his zakat to India the answer is yes but I doubt that you don't know anyone in libia Libya there are lots of poor people in there you can give it to them if you don't know any organization or any person to to take it you may ask your people your family to give zakat providing they give it two to three days before your actual Eid prayer in uh Libya if you prayed Eid and after half an hour they paid the Zak this is not acceptable each uh brother Al Froman brother Al hello or sister yes sister I wanted to ask two questions okay one is that um is regarding the supplication of starting eating the food is it or just okay and the second question is is regarding Salat is there any authenticity in this Salat ha okay or we just have to play to okay I will answer your question insh uh Amna from Nigeria is back I'm is gone okay so AZ from Dubai he's saying that he got alone from HSBC in Dubai and he bought a car with it and he's saying that four years ago and is still confused whether what it was Halal Oram 4 years is a lot of time for you to be doubtful why is it we are always doing something and then asking about it and not the other way around you never see someone going to the pharmacist and taking lots of antibiotics and drugs and and and and medication and then going to your doctor and say listen I had this pain and I took all of this is this okay no one does this you go to the doctor and then you take the medication like likewise but it what's done was done so he's asking is it Halal or Haram I cannot tell everyone nowadays produces a piece of paper and say listen this is Shar compliance I have a fatwa from the Shar committee I have this and that you have to look into their transaction because a lot of these Banks and this was part of the signs of the hour that we talked about we said that the prophet told us that there are to come years of deception where the liar would be believed and the truthful would be accused of lying and where the trustworthy would be accused of treachery or treason or or betrayal while the one who is worthy of being uh treacherous or betraying people people will trust him nowadays banks that deal with riba are they a place of trust definitely not the they are fighting they are Waging War against Allah and his Messenger as mentioned in Chapter 2 in the Quran those who deal in riba it's one of the greatest sins and major sins in Islam so how can we trust them and say yeah yeah okay as long as you got a piece a piece of paper I'll believe you you have to go to the scholars and ask them is it applied as they have given the fatwa or it's just only a certificate and they can put under it everything they wish it's like now noways we find in our markets fish that have certificate saying that it is slaughtered Halal fish sometimes you have chicken with their heads connected to their body and saying slaughtered Halal the head is there what what kind of slaughtering is is it finger clipping what kind of slaughtering is this so they we trust the people of betrayal we trust the people of treason and people of De deceit so we should not be fooled easily like this now if they owned the car I went to a bank and the bank has a showroom they have a a garage filled with cars that they own and I wrote a contract with them with a final and uh unchangeable price tag so the the the car in cash it worth it's worth 1,000 uh 100,000 I bought it for 150 installments over 5 years years and 150 cannot go up no way even if I'm late in payment whatever 150 is 150 and we signed the contract and I took the car this is Hal one other means is that when they sell you something they own for example they you want 100,000 r a loan to buy a car and they say we don't give loans but we can sell you stock market shares the value in cash is1 ,000 and we'll charge you 120 in installments so you say okay you buy it from them you sell it on the market for 100,000 not to them of course someone else definitely because this is Haram if you sell it to them again and you you take the money and you buy the car this is halal you buy iron you buy precious stones you buy something the bank owns before you came to him not afterwards before any commitment from your side other than that I cannot answer whether it's Halal or har because I don't know the transaction um from Nigeria from Nigeria yes thank you very much I asked two question before the first one I'm very very clear with you but the second question you maybe remember to answer that one the the painting of finger if it's permissible for the first question again you know the attach I told you is not human hair is this pain that is like attached but the one of color is it perishable I want to be clear with you explain explain it again I did not F I did not understand what do you mean by attachment okay is this hair extension hair extension okay it it looks like hairir extension of colored is not the color of the hair but it looks like a hair okay okay then the painting of finger nails with different colors okay is he also permissible Salam and we have Asia from Saudi Arabia Asia Asia from Saudi Arabia Shake I just wanted to ask uh who is collecting money in Saudi Arabia for Burma uh I'm from geda so from where we can give money for Burma people okay okay insh I will answer your question okay um am I think her question was what's the ruling on collecting money and then sharing it among ourselves I couldn't understand why would people do this unless if my understanding is correct this is what some people do I cannot collect 24,000 R in a year so I meet with 12 other people and we decide that 12 months each one of us would collect the 24,000 Real by donating or giving 2,000 real per month so I take number first month the first month they get their paycheck each one gives me 2,000 11 of them this is 22 and with my 2,000 this is 24 I have 24 I can do things with it and throughout the whole year sec second month I give 2,000 the 3D the fourth the fifth until the 12th I'm the one who's giving the 2,000 to other people who took their order within the full uh year length this is Hal there is no there is no interest actually it's like me putting it in a wallet or in a safe 2,000 R every month and at the end of the month I collect 24,000 and instead of doing this I'm having it in the first month or the second or the middle depending on it so if this is the case this is halal inshallah okay okay brother Abdullah from Morocco om Abdullah om Abdullah from Morocco from yes yes what can I do for you sister and to you too as well please I have one question okay um can I travel with my 8 years old my son is 8 years old can can you be my mam Maham yes okay I will answer your question inshallah from Saudi Arabia AA okay uh from he's saying uh what is the supplication that we should say before we eat the Hadith of uh may Allah be pleased with him and with his uh father the stepson of the Prophet Alam he said I ate with the prophet alham and my hand was moving around the plate not from in front of me so the prophet said to me oh boy say and eat from in front of you and eat with your right hand so what you're supposed to say is is it permissible to add to that there are some narrations I'm not sure at the moment of their authenticity but what I'm sure of is that all Scholars say that if you say this is enough do I say I don't know any authentic Hadith that backs it up uh and it would become an innovation unless there's a Hadith to back it up other than that it is not permissible so what you should say is bmah and this is sufficient uh also asking she's asking about all the hadiths uh related to it are not authentic and therefore it is not authentic when you have something even in your F prayer in your prostration ask Allah for it and Allah would respond to you from Nigeria again called what's the ruling on nail polishing the nail polishing is permissible whether you put uh uh uh any color you want providing that you don't go out of the norm providing that people would not look at you in your country and say what is this this is not good this is strange this is uh attracting so for a woman for a woman she's not allowed to wear nail polish if non Maham men would see her if she's in her community among the women among her mams brothers husbands this is permissible but you have to know that once you wear it you cannot perform wood so if you want to pray and you did not perform woodoo and you have your nail polish performing woodoo is not accepted you have to remove it because this this nail polish or manicure uh makes a layer that prevents water from touching your nails and that means your woodo is not accepted so women usually make wear them on when they have their menes she's asking about attachment of the hair but different color so if my not me of course if a woman uh uh you never know if a woman's hair is black and she wears like brownish or or uh uh blondish uh attachment of hair is this permissible no it is not as long as it has the feeling and the looks of Hair It Is forbidden even if the color was different Asia says that uh who collects money for Burma in jeda unfortunately the issue of Burma is not getting enough attention not because of race not because of color not because of different of langu language but this is the norm unfortunately the media focuses only on on on Syria and what's happening there and atrocities are taking place in Palestine by the Israelis atrocities is taking place in uh uh Burma in Thailand fatani in uh uh all over the Muslim World you'll find in in China uh where the Muslims are being heavily oppressed and no one cares about them and nobody highlights what's happening to them so for bur Burma to my knowledge wami collects for uh Burma which is the world uh Association of Muslim Youth and their location is at the intersection of ctin Road and Palestine Road and finally last question Abdullah from Morocco she saying can I travel with my O8 can we travel or can she travel with her 8-year-old son can he be her Maham and the answer is no one of the characteristics of the Maham that he is saying and he's adult so though he is aware of what's happening but he's not an adult and he cannot be treated as such adulthood is known through three one of the three characteristics one of them is enough either he reaches the age of 15 or he ejaculates through an eternal emission or what is known as wet uh uh dreams or the uh uh um heavy and not soft hair that grows around his uh uh uh pubic area if this happens then he has reached the age of puberty and he is treated as an adult this is all the time we have until we meet you next timeat oh Allah fulfill our AIMS in life Allah forgive our sins yeah Allah oh Allah the most gracious oh Allah the most gracious y oh my Creator oh Allah fulfill our AIMS in life Allah forgive us s yeah Allah oh Allah the most gracious oh Allah the most gracious
