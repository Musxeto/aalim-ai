  "title": "Is routinely doing a certain Ibadah an innovation? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Abdul Rahman from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Sheikh my question is we know that it's from the Sunnah to have a secret between you and Allah but what if like let's say my secret between me and Allah is just an example is to pray around a certain time two rakahs between Zuhr and Asr let's say but we know from the descriptions of an innovation is something that is done routinely so would that make it an innovation or not? If the routine is done because you believe that this particular time or place is blessed this is an innovation but it is if it is convenient for me to pray at this time because this is the only break during the daytime at work where I can pray the two rakah of Duha for example I have only a break from 11 to 11.15 where I can go to the toilets and make my wudu and pray every single day does it make it an innovation no if someone is it's more convenient for him to pray at a particular time of the day or to do a particular ibadah for example every single year on the 5th of August he goes for Umrah this is his annual vacation the only time slot during the year that he goes for Umrah. Every single year if you ask him is there anything specific in the 5th of August and no why are you doing it why not it's more convenient to me this is where I get my annual vacation before I go a couple of weeks to my home town and then I go another two weeks here or there and this is the time in between I always drop by and make Umrah and go there's nothing wrong in that and I hope this answers your question."
