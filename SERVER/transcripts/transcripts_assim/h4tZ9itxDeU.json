  "transcript": "uh I have a question about if husband allows you to take or give Zoom classes Zoom Quran classes but he says that you will not take the fee like you can give the classes free of course but you cannot take the fee is it permissible for her to take the feedback of him knowing it no he is not allowed to restrict her from taking money so if he allows her to give the classes she can give the classes and she must not tell him about her collecting money because this is none of his business so she can give classes and she can charge for that without any problem inshallah Sami from the U.S"
