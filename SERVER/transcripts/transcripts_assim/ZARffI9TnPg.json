  "transcript": "from the uk what is the ruling on celebrating the maulit the birthday of the prophet and is it a bidder and what is a buddha or innovation is something created invented in islam to get closer to allah azzawajal which the need to do it at the time of the prophet hassan was there and he did not do it so you want to mimic forms of worship and you can want to get closer to allah azza now the question is it permissible to celebrate the birthday of the prophet point number one all muslims agree that the prophet is islam died on the 12th of rabbi al-awwal no doubt about that among any of the muslims however they differ whether the prophet was born in the 12th of or in the ninth as author clearly stated that this is the most authentic opinion that he was born the ninth so by celebrating his mauled every single year on the 12th of rabir you actually are celebrating his death and not his birth secondly the prophet never celebrated his own birthday nor the birthday of ibrahim peace be upon him or musa or isa or any other prophet neither did the companions may allah be pleased with him who loved him the most and were the most knowledgeable people at his time and after his time nor did the tabula in nor did anyone of the tabi taving and the prophet said that the best of generations is my generation that is of the companions and that which follows them the taberine and that which follows them that is a tabula tavein so if these favorite generations which is which are the best of the best never celebrated his birthday do you have the love they had to him for him do you have the knowledge do you have any basis to do something they did not do other than being an innovation from shaytan now what happens during these birthdays or mawlid is not something to be proud of the free mixing the singing the innovation and the shirk there is blatant shirk in it especially when they recite these poems such as and uh they say things that o prophet of allah if you're not taking my hand on the day of judgment then i will be among the losers it is from your generosity that this whole world and the hereafter is created his generosity and from your knowledge is the knowledge of the preserved tablets and the pen subhanallah what did you leave for allah azza if this is all in the prophet sallam's and generosity and this is where people of shirk come when they say that the prophet in his grave is hazard and he controls the world as he controls the palm of his hand from his grave and they take allah's beautiful names and attributes and give it and award it to him when they say to his grave so without any shred of doubt those who celebrate the maulid are innovators if they loved the prophet they would have honored his sunna they would have honored his akida they would have honored the way he lived and honored it throughout the whole year 360 days not only one day in a year like the christians do and they celebrate christmas and they do all heinous things that they claim that that night would forgive all of their sins so that they have a carte blanche for the next new year this is all not part of islam it wasn't done by the companions nor the the tabernae nor the tabi tavern all four imams of schools of thought say it's an innovation never celebrated themselves so now you know all more than all of these people that you have a different version of islam i can't help you no one can help you if people say that the heavens is blue the sky is blue and you say well i think it's pink or it's green celery no one can do anything for you"
