  "transcript": "nimrah says i did istikhara before getting married and i felt good about the whole thing so i went ahead for the marriage but my marriage failed and i got divorced why did this happen even after doing this tihara wasn't it allah's decision that i marry him then why did it fail first of all as believers there are certain fundamentals that we embrace without doubting principle number one everything was predestined fifty thousand years before allah created the creation so whatever happens this is something that has been preordained way way back before the universe was created and there's nothing you can do about it and this gives you a lot of peace of mind it makes you surrender to whatever happens which you had no control over the second principle of foundation is that whatever happens to a believer this is for your best the prophet said that in an authentic hadith islam [Music] how astonishing how wonderful the affair of a believer is if something good happens to him he's grateful and praises allah and it's good for him and if something bad happens to him he's patient and he praises allah and this is good for him and this happens only to the believer that is being grateful and showing gratitude to whatever happens because he trusts and relies on allah's judgment and whatever allah chooses for him this is for the best so these principles and many more throw tranquility and gives you the peace of mind estihara is asking allah azzawajal to facilitate what is good for you at that particular moment it is not logical that i want to buy a car and i pray to allah azzawajal and i make it and i go to the showroom i pay for the car and i get the car it's not logical to expect that for the coming 20 years i wouldn't have any accidents it won't break down no child would come and scratch it from front to back this is not logical my estihara was in buying the car yours the hara was and getting married and that was a good thing for you and allah facilitated it what happens afterwards is your choice is your course of action is a result of your own decisions is your lack of communication with your spouse is how you behave all of these are not included in your first initial estihara the marriage as a marriage was good for you but what happened afterwards is a consequence of your own actions and behaviors and allah azza knows best"
