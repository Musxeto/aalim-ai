  "transcript": "today's topic that I want to talk about is a beautiful Hadith where the Prophet sallallah alai wasam tells us and shows us how to clarify or if you wish to say how to purify our hearts and indeed purification of the heart is one of the most important tasks and missions in Islam so many people focus on different things some focus on making a lot of a lot of forms of worship which is by itself Good Deeds others focus on for example making a lot of VI or paying money for charity which is also good deed you may find people focusing on seeking knowledge and again this this is indeed one of the greatest um tasks a Muslim does but without any doubt one of the most important if not the most important thing is to clarify the heart and why is that because the prophet told us that Allah the Almighty does not look at your body and he does not look at your wealth so Allah doesn't look if you're black or white if you're tall or short if you're fat or thin Allah does not look if you're old or young and he doesn't look as well if you are rich or poor if you have a good business going on or if you are an employee with a small salary the prophet says Allah looks at your heart and your deeds and Allah me mentions also in the Quran that no wealth no nor offspring would benefit a person on the day of judgment except those who come in or who come with pure hearts healthy Hearts called say that the characteristics of such a heart is to be pure of eny pure of hatred pure of associating others with Allah and it would be pure from desires as well the Hadith at hand which I would like to talk about is a Hadith that was reported or narrated by an IM Muslim in theah and it was narrated by Abu may Allah be pleased with him he says that the prophet sallallahu alaih Al wasallam said do not envy one another and do not bid one another out for raising the price and no don't nurse hatred or enmity and don't give your back to one another and don't enter into a transaction when the others have entered into the transaction and we as follow brothers and Servants of Allah the Muslim is the brother of another Muslim he does not wrong him let him down or look down upon him tawa that is piety or the fear of Allah is here and he pointed to his chest sallallahu alaihi wasallam three times and then he said it is sufficient evil for a man to look down upon his Muslim brother every Muslim is sacred to another Muslim his blood his property and his honor in this beautiful Hadith the prophet is telling us how we should deal with one another and if you look at this Hadith you would find that it has a lot of lessons that can be learned yet they are difficult lessons in the sense that you'll find a lot of the brothers and the sisters would probably think that this is too much it is too difficult I'd rather just pray and maybe wear the hijab and that is all I cannot have all of this and I cannot treat people in such a fashion well tough luck brother and sister because you have to have this within you to be a real and True Believer and as we know that the branches of Iman are divided into few and 60 or 70 branches the highest of them is and the lowest is removing obstacles from the road of the people and bashfulness or is one of the branches of im as the prophet said now this Hadith stated before it is report or it is narrated by with him and it is reported in Muslim the first sentence in it or the first instruction do not eny and envy is the first sin ever to take place in the heavens when Allah instructed all the angels to prostrate to Adam and they did accept Satan who was from the Jin and he refused and when Allah asked him why did you not prostrate to Adam as I've commanded you and he said I am better than him you created me from fire and creaded him from clay so this is why he refused to prostrate to Adam because he was envious how is it that someone who was just created can come and be in such a position as Allah gave to Adam and it was also the first sin ever to be committed on the ground and that is when Allah accepted the sacrifice of one of of Adam's sons and did not accept the sacrifice of the other son so he killed him and also we know what the brothers of prophet Yousef Prophet Joseph peace be upon him we know what they did to Joseph by throwing him in the well and leaving him to die uh and the Muslims feel and sense this amount of hatred and Envy in the people of the scripture Allah the almighty says many of the people of the scripture wish that if they could turn you away as disbelievers after you have believed out of Envy from their own selves even after the truth has become manifest unto them there is a lot to say in regard to Envy but I'm afraid that there are people at the door and the mobile this is um okay give me a couple of minutes and I'll come back I apologize so there are a lot of issues that can be um discussed regarding this issue and that is we will inshallah postpone it to the next time we meet the issues are as follows the kinds of Envy permissible kinds and the Forbidden kinds and among the permissible kind there are kind that are not recommended and uh kinds that are recommended also we would like to speak about when or what is the difference between envy and evil eye are they the same and what is the remedy and few examples of that uh if Allah the almighty allows us to do this next time we meet inshallah and we can uh open the floor for questions if you wish"
