  "transcript": "Ibraheim says please shed some light on zodiac personality treats not horoscope that predicts future but zodiac personality that categorizes people according to their zodiac most Muslim youth now follow this not as a future prediction on people's lives but as a way of understanding their personality kindly research it how it's used by the youth and shed some light why Ibrahim I have no time to search for this thing I don't have time to do research but if I understand your question there are 12 zodiacs as they say and they claim that the month or the zodiac you born under has impact on your personality now the mushriks say that it has impact on your future so if you are a scorpion or a bull or a donkey or whatever zodiac see you you are born under then this impacts your future so you will have this and that happening to you in the month of December in February et cetera according to your a study of your zodiac and this is total jerk this is claiming to know the unseen and to know the rabe which only Allah knows and it is illogical that if on this particular day five million people were born it's illogical that five million people would have the same fate and the same prediction of their future it's totally illogical likewise claiming that because you were born under the particular zodiac this means that your personality is a soft-spoken person that is easily touched and people can take advantage of your kindness as this and that and people believe this imagine that all five million who are born at the same day on the same day at the same time must share the same treats as they say this is illogical it is Una's lamech and to believe in it it would be like fortune-telling and the people don't only stop here they come and tell you that okay through your handwriting we can predict your personality through your fingerprints we can predict your personality through the way you choose your clothes and the decoration of your home all of this is part of fortune-telling and sooth saying and it's totally prohibited only people with low IQ and little intellectual powers would believe in such nonsense"
