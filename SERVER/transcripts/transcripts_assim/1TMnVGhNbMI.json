  "title": "Can I build a website for halal business & accept Cryptocurrency as payment? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so my question is is it permissible to make a website for a Halal business that uses cryptocurrencies uh to receive payments from their users alongside the PayPal and credit card I believe as many scholars have stated that crypto currencies and these digital currencies are still Haram to be used and circulated and we have seen last month the Abduction of one of their Mongols who embezzled a lot in in the billions through his company dealing with one of these currencies and it is still unstable unauthentic unreal so for you as a Muslim you must not deal with such currencies until it is authenticated and approved by the central banks of the majority of countries only then we can look into it and see if it can be permitted or not and Allah Knows Best"
