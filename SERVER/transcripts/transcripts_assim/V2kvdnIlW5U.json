  "title": "Should he get married to someone in the UKðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ or to someone from a Muslim country? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Sh, my dream is to move out of the UK um to a a Gulf country, preferably Saudi, but if not, I'm willing to consider Egypt or Morocco. My question is, do you recommend someone like myself to get married to someone in one of those countries, Morocco, Egypt, and work sometimes here and and go there like every couple of months until I can get more money? Um or do you recommend I get married to someone here? Uh because yeah, sometimes you get married to someone here, she might have the same goals. And please pray for me that I find a sexy righteous spouse. Please. First of all, it is something that you have to answer for yourself. It's not one size that fits all. people who want to migrate to a Muslim country and they have to have independence independency in in in their financial affairs because unfortunately no Muslim country would take you for who you are regardless of that Muslim country either you have a lot of money so that you can invest and live there comfortably and the country would allow you to do so because you've got the cash or you have the expertise and the knowledge that the country would benefit from you. So you can work there, earn money and at the same time continue to live until you are no longer needed to go on and off to marry someone there and to come back to the UK earn a little bit money after 3 4 months and go back to that country. This means that you're not financially independent and I doubt any Muslim family that would accept you as a husband to their daughter while marrying in the UK someone from your own country without any problem in spouse visa and the uh bureaucracy that follows usually when you want to get married to someone like that from abroad and whether they'll give you the permission and the visa or not. It's much easier, a faster solution. Someone who knows the culture, someone who knows the country, someone who knows how to get by, and someone who shares the passion of moving out. I think that would be a better solution for you and Allah knows best."
