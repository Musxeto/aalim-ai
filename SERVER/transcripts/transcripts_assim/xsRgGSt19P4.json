  "title": "Discount for paying early & late fees for paying late Riba? | AssimAlHakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "jawad says they have a policy in ireland and this is that if you pay on time we give you 10 or 50 percent of your electricity bill but if you become late we take a late payment a fee this is riba but if they say to you if you pay on time or before time we are giving you a discount of 50 because the normal bill is 100 so if you pay on time or before we will give you 50 discount but if you're late a month or two we will charge you the normal fee which is a hundred percent there's no reba in that so this is a better solution for some islamic schools that have a late payment policy and they say that we don't benefit from it we take it and we give it to charity this is still riba instead say to them that the fees for the first year is 10 000 whatever currency there is if you pay before december 30th we will give you 25 discount if you pay afterwards the fee still remains the same 10 000. everybody would pay before or on time to get this and there's no reba in that inshallah [Music]"
