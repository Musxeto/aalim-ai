  "title": "Is it permissible to pray before the appointed time? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Nicola says yeah she please tell me what to do in my country are fast closes and the van begins at 2:45 a.m. however the Imam says we can pray at 2:00 a.m. for those who go to work school college before the event begins including both men and women people close their fast and pray at different times is it permissible to pray before the appointed time well I I don't know what to tell you a club it seems that either you did not explain yourself correctly or there is something fishy going on with this Imam if it is as you claim that people refrain from eating and drinking at 2:45 this means that this is the time for the break of dawn which means that this is the time that one can begin to prefetcher to claim that the Imam says due to your school work etc we can pray at 2 o'clock this is unimaginable and no Muslim would ever say this whether scholar or a layman no one permits people to pray before the time is due especially if it says that we prefetcher but we can eat afterwards this is not logical at all so I think you have to reassess the situation but if it is as you have mentioned you definitely cannot pray at 2 o'clock and definitely not accept this man to lead you or to be any man because this is out of the boundaries of Islam having said that you must first of all make sure that the fire breaks at that specific and unfortunately as so many people are confusing others by saying that no the time for Kaja prayer is 1 a.m. when the calendars say at 3 a.m. in UK for example and they come and confuse people you say you refrain from eating and drinking at 1:00 but you pray just to be safe at 3 what is this either we refrain from eating and drinking and pray at the same time or delay and refrain from eating and drinking and pray at a later time so they are confusing people now with the Sun rising at 18 degrees or whatever and lots of talk where the major scholars of Islam stated that such calculations are wrong and confusing the people and burdening them like this is wrong and the most accurate calendar or timetable for prayers is umm al-qura timetable and for all the four prayers it is accurate and insha'Allah it is true except for Asia prayer ratio prayer timings is wrong because they always fix it at one hour and thirty minutes except in Ramallah and Ramadan they make it hike up to two hours and this is totally wrong and not true this is cultural but the other four prayers are accurate so you refer to that okra and inshallah we'll be in safe hands"
