  "transcript": "so it's just a general question that I have um so we know that the prophet wasam was especially Brave and the best of all role models in his character and conduct so how should one balance between evaluating their own self without arrogance as in their level of religiosity their sins and mistakes maybe their character without destroying their own confidence maybe exaggerating their own thoughts and letting that affect their bravery I have no idea this is too philosophical for me it's way above my pay grate all what I know is I go through the S of the Prophet Alat wasam I go through his which I made a series of few months ago it's being aired on Huda TV and inshallah soon it will be aired on Z TV as well and I follow the footsteps of the Prophet alai wasam I know I have a limit I cannot be as generous or as courageous or as uh uh truly believing and trusting Allah as a Prophet this is way beyond our ability because he's the prophet and we are who we are however he was sent to us to be a role model and we were ordered to follow him in to the best of our ability so we do the best we can and hope for uh uh the rest from Allah and Allah Knows Best"
