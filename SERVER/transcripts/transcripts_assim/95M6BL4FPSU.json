  "transcript": "Al-Rahman from the UK, Arubi from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh All our sins will be forgiven, but if we cannot keep complete focus, then won't all our sins be forgiven? I don't understand you Noor, you're talking about the two rak'ahs of wudu and you're combining it with the two rak'ah voluntary prayer that if you were to make a perfect wudu and pray two rak'ahs without speaking to yourself or being neglectful about concentration for Allah Azza Wa Jal's sake and Allah will forgive all your sins. Are you talking about these two prayers? Arubi? No. Okay, I think we've lost Arubi. Anyhow, the answer is yes, you can combine many intentions in the same prayer, voluntary prayer, as long as these intentions do not clash. So if you pray two rak'ahs with the intention of duha prayer and with the intention of forgiving all of your previous sins and with the intention of wudu prayers, all of this is valid and counts for you inshallah."
