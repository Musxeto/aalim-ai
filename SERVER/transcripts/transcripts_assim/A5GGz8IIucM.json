  "title": "Ruling on playfully touching awrah of a female friend (same gender) #Assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "what's the ruling on touching my Mah's so for example can I touch my friend's baby belly or grab a friend by her waist or give them like a slap why would you do such a thing um for fun like me and my friend we it's like like if you're playful like we we do this like a lot and this that's why like this question comes up a lot though no this is inappropriate because such playful and joyful touching may lead to something that is Haram generally speaking if there is no FNA and there is no lust or desire which Shan may not utilize for his benefit this is okay we do wrestle with one another we do fight and we touch these areas not with the intention of touching it but it happens and there is nothing of ill intent behind it there is no problem in that but when people just touch certain parts of the body specifically and the likes out of joyfulness and playing around this may lead to something worse and it's inappropriate"
