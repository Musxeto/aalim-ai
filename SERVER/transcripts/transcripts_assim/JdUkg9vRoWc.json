  "title": "What is the personal life of a Scholar or Daee? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "well brother Mohammed squares is crystal-clear he says that we always hear from dairies scholars students of knowledge about their motivating motivational talks about their religious advice about things that are related to Quran and Sunnah but we rarely hear about their personal activities about the other side of their lives and usually people when they ask me about this and they say share where did you learn this where did you learn that how did you do these things what are the other activities in your lives I would usually joke with them and say if I tell you I have to kill you there is always this dark side to each and every one of us and probably most days are not proud of what they have suffered in the past or have gone through in the past so they usually are not very proud of it yes you see some Diaries fall into the trap of Shaitaan of exposing their previous sins in order to advise people this can be understood when that there is a celebrity so for example a rapper whom was a kafir Allah guided into Islam and he wants to address the youth so he may say that I used to do so and so and so until Allah guided me there's no problem because everyone knows that he was a rapper likewise if a person was a womanizer that was well known exposed to people there's nothing wrong in that other than that if a person was known to be at least concealed no one knows about him it is totally prohibited for him to go and expose his sins now you may say well I'm not actually addressing the issue of sins I just want to know what is your daily routine how do you go about I'd like to know about your personal life your travels your hobbies your aspirations etc some may feel okay to do so others may have reservations not that it is haram rather because such info may not be that helpful to individuals for example I'm sort of a person that does not like to speak a lot about my personal life I remember five years ago in Birmingham they had a child you know tea it was a chit chat program and Green Lane Masjid in Birmingham and they asked me about my daily routine and I opened up a little bit which usually I don't like to do so this is not important for the public yes maybe if they come to my Masjid if it's a one-to-one issue maybe I would talk about it but to do so in public or to brag about the things that I can do about the medals I have etc I think that this is not so relevant to the Muslims well-being in hence it's best to keep a low profile on that analyzer Jen knows best"
