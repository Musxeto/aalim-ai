  "title": "Despite owing me money, my father went for Hajj & bought a new car, can I stop visiting him? assim",
  "transcript": "Alright, Assalamu Alaikum, my father asked me to make a bank loan and promised to pay me back but he obviously didn't and now he owes me 50,000 Ringgit, in the meantime he went for Hajj and bought a new car. It made me very sad, hence the question is, is it okay if I stop visiting him? He's who? Stop visiting his father, because of the loan that he didn't pay. First of all, this is very very sad and unfortunate. When my relationship to my father, whom the Prophet said Alayhis Salatu Wassalam, the father is the middle gate of Jannah, meaning you will not enter Jannah except through your father. It's very sad when my relationship to my father is affected by money. When the Prophet said Alayhis Salatu Wassalam, you and your wealth belong to your father. And over 50,000 stinking Ringgits, Ringgits or Dollars? Ringgits for now. I would have second thoughts. No, 50,000, they come and go in seconds. Who gives it? Who takes it? Would you like to give 50,000 to your father and he goes for Hajj and buys a new car? What kind of a car is this? Anyhow, would you like to give it to your father in this way? Being dutiful, being respectful, showing him your generosity and paying him back some of what he had given to you all of these years? Or, would you rather have cancer and pay all of this for your chemo and radiation therapy? Think with your head. Allah has given you so much. You are allowing Shaitan to corrupt the relationship between you and your middle gate to Jannah. Over 50,000 Ringgits? I don't know where these people come from. Kiss his feet every single day and obey him and give him everything more than what you need. Seeking Allah's Thawab, seeking Allah's pleasure and Wallahi you will find this in your children. Remember, you boycott your father, your children will come and boycott you one day. And Allah knows best. Al Fatiha."
