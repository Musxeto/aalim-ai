  "transcript": "Question is from brother Osama. Is it allowed to meditate using apps such as and he gives an example head space? I've never been to space so I cannot answer your questions. But most likely you're talking about listening to uh ocean waves or uh birds chirping or uh the wind etc. And this is not meditation. This is just listening to natural sounds. And I think there's nothing wrong in that. Meditation which is prohibited is the same as the what the Hindus do or what the people practicing yoga do. These are related to other customs and religions that Muslims should not do. Our meditation is to look at Allah's beautiful creations and wonderful miracles in the universe and praise him as not to just sit there and say what are you doing? I'm meditating. What kind of meditation is this? No, this is something for the Buddhist, the Hindus, the whatever. And this is not permissible."
