  "transcript": "while watching the new moon sighting it felt like a good lighting this day is all right as the first start we here tonight with family around the nice meal we're making do I night feel how nice it is to be so near to those I love oh dear brothers and sisters in Islam and welcome to this new episode of Virtues of fasting we have a number ofth today and it is from the chapter of fasting from the book by may Allah have mercy on his soul however these some of them is authentic and some is not and as stated earlier that may bring these weak Hadith just to indicate that some of the jurors some of the scholars use them in their books and their literature to verify a verdict they teed thinking that they were authentic hadiths and this shows us the importance of having Scholars of Hadith and people usually make the common Mistake by asking people who are not qualified about things they have no knowledge of so this would be like someone going to a dentist asking him about his heart problems both are doctors but this one is not specialized in this field and this is why a true scholar has to have a combination of both maybe he's not an expert in The Sciences of Hadith but at least he's got sufficient knowledge that enables him to distinguish whether it is authentic or not because based on that he would base his ver ICT whether to say Halal Oram whether to say go or do not do that but if a juror or a scholar of f does not have such sufficient knowledge in Hadith then he has a big problem when it comes to justifying a verdict he is giving likewise a scholar of Hadith should have the minimum requ requirements of f of Juris Prudence of Theo of f of the F of the different schools of thought so that this would enable him to use this knowledge when he is reporting a Hadith because if he doesn't have this knowledge he would probably take one of the hadiths that is considered to be authentic but because he does not know why this Hadith was said and what is the meaning of this Hadith he may G give the wrong verdict so a real scholar should have a combination of two the first Hadith is Hadith number 41 and this Hadith was report narrated by Abu Hur may Allah be pleased with him he said that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said when it is the middle of shaan do not fast until it is Ramadan and this was related by the five imams now this Hadith is an instruction from the prophet Alam not to fast after the 15th of Shaban and Scholars have different opinions in regards of this Hadith some of them said that this Hadith is weak and we should not apply it and some of them said that it is authentic those who said it's week like Al IM Ahmed hbal may Allah have mercy on his soul they Justified this by other authentic hadiths that are stronger and are found in the books ofah for example in this Hadith the prophet says do not fast after the 15th of shaan meaning that from the 15th till the end of shaan we should not fast however AA tells us may Allah be pleased with her that the prophet Alat wasam used to fast the majority of Shaban no month of the year the prophet would fast more after Ramadan except sha so this is an indication that this is not correct not only that the authentic Hadith that we've mentioned in the beginning of our Series where the Prophet forbade a person from preceding Ramadan by a day or two so you're not allowed to fast the 29th and the 30th of shaan unless it is something that you used to do before coinciding with with Thursdays or Frid uh and and Mondays or coinciding with a day that you're making up for Ramadan but this Hadith means that if you precede Ramadan with four or five days this is permissible which means that the prohibition from fasting after the 15th of shaan does not apply here again so this is what the people say and they claim that the Hadith is not authentic for these two reasons those who authenticate the Hadith they say yes what you have said is right but we don't see it as being a Prohibition rather it is not recommended for people who did not fast from the beginning of shaan till the middle to start then and it would become prohibited for someone to fast the second half of Shaban if this would cause him to find hardship when fasting Ramadan but again the Hadith is not authentic and hence we should not uh uh um rely on it the following Hadith Hadith number 42 this Hadith was narrated by B may Allah be pleased with her she said that the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam said do not fast on Saturday unless unless it is an obligatory fast do not fast even if you do not find anything to eat except for or some grape peeling or the branch of a tree and this Hadith as uh uh it's stated related by the five imams and its narrators are reliable Imam Malik disapproved this narration and Abu daud said that this narration is abrogated now this Hadith the prophet Alat is telling us that we should not fast Friday let me rephrase that the prophet is telling us that we should not fast Saturday period and he didn't make any exception except in other narrations except in when it is mandated upon you meaning in Ramadan so this is permissible or when you are fasting uh consecutive uh uh months due to experation Etc and obligatory fastings now however Scholars again differed whether this is a weak Hadith or an authentic Hadith those who say that it is not authentic they say because Imam Malik said this Hadith is sh this is abnormal this is a Hadith that does not fall in line with the other hadiths so he disregarded it Imam Abu da may Allah have mercy on his soul said that this Hadith is abrogated that it is permissible to fast uh um Saturdays Imam shaani wrote a long research stating that this Hadith is not authentic and if you look at the other hadiths you will find that this is quite true because the prophet Alam said do not fast Saturdays and he did not make an exception however in the Hadith of Jia which we discussed yesterday mother Jia was fasting on a Friday and the prophet came Alam and said did you fast Thursday she said no he asked her again are you going to fast tomorrow which was a Saturday she said no the prophet told her break your fast which means that if you are not going to fast Saturday with Friday in voluntary days then you should not do this and we spoke about isolating Friday with fasting yesterday this means that fasting Saturday with a day before or after is permissible yet the Hadith we have here of she said that the prophet said do not fast Saturday at all and he didn't leave any exceptions besides the prophet said even if you had to eat a branch of a tree or uh uh uh something else to break your fasting and we know that to break your fasting if you don't have food or drink all that you have to do is just intend it you don't have to eat a stone or something that is uneatable just to break your fasting so the whole text of the Hadith the mat alongside with the isnad this is what caused the scholars to say that it is not authentic and this is the most uh um correct view that it is not authentic and one can fast Saturdays whether it is to be fasted for voluntary days that are highly recommended such as as such ASA you can isolate Saturday with arafa alone without any problem in that inshallah but just to be on the safe side if there is no legitimate reason do not isolate it with fasting other legitimate reasons would be for example if a person is fasting the fasting of David peace be upon Him D the prophet told us that it is the best fasting he used to fast a day and skip a day so he used to fast every alternate day and this means that one week he would fast Friday Sunday Tuesday Thursday and the following week he would fast Saturday Monday Wednesday and Friday so this means that he would skip days but he would isolate Friday in one week and then isolate Saturday in the other week and this is permissible because he's not doing this for Friday itself or for Saturday itself but rather for uh following Prophet David peace be upon him in fasting alternate days the following Hadith Hadith number 43 um may Allah be pleased with her said that the prophet sallallahu alaihi alhi wasallam used to fast more often on Saturdays and Sundays than on the other days he would say they are the eids of the polytheists and I love to act contrary to what they do now in this Hadith again the Hadith is weak yet some Judas used it to indicate that it is recommended to fast on Saturday and Sunday and probably this is the Hadith that Abu daud may Allah have mercy on his soul said that it abrogated the previous Hadith not to fast Saturday but this Hadith again is weak um Sal asked the prophet why do you fast Saturdays and Sundays he said because they are theid they are the weekly uh Festival or or or celebration or Feast for the Jews and the Christians the disbelievers so I'd like to go against their teachings and and against their religion and fasting the these two days as a sign of sh my gratitude to Allah but the Hadith is not authentic so what's the ruling on fasting on Saturdays and Sundays it is permissible if you want to fast go ahead if you don't there's no uh problem in that but we understand also from this Hadith though it is weak that the prophet Alam and this is a well established fact used to do a lot of things in order to go against the Jews and the Christians and the idol worshippers even in things related to customs and traditions so that a Muslim would have his own uh uh dignity his own uh personality and identity rather than follow the disbelievers in other things uh as well we move on to Hadith number uh 44 and Abu Hur may Allah be pleased with him narrated that the prophet sallallahu alaihi Al wasallam forbade fasting on the day OFA for the one who is actually atafa now this Hadith again the scholars graded it as weak but the meaning is accepted and we all know that the prophet Alat on the day OFA he recommended highly the people to fast it generally speaking and he said that fasting the day of arafa expiates this year and the coming year so these are the experation of the sins of two years for those who fast however he himself when he was in Haj in the pilgrimage on the day of araa he ordered a glass of milk and he drank it while he was on his camel so that everyone would see that he was not fasting and the scholars say that a pilgrim must not fast when he is Ona because it would give him more energy and dedication to supplicate to Allah to invoke Allah and to be capable of utilizing the time in these great forms of worship rather than fasting and we discussed this couple of days ago that fasting of uh uh the days of T which includes also because is not from the days of T but it is permissible for for a pilgrim who is unable to find money to buy a sacrifice to slaughter if he is offering Oran it is permissible for him to fast the day ofafa as it is permissible for him to fast the three days of so the Hadith as stated is not authentic but the meaning is true moving on to Hadith number uh 45 and 46 Abdullah Omar may Allah be pleased with him narrated that the prophet of Allah sallallah alaihi Ali wasallam said may He Who perpetually fasts without a break never fast and this was agreed upon the following Hadith Hadith number 46 Muslim narrated on the authority of abuat may he not fast or break his fast and this uh uh was narrated by Imam Muslim as reported earlier now what do we understand from these two hadiths La is an article either can be used for negating or for prohibition for negating like you say he whom his neighbor cannot be safe from his harm is not a Believer so this is a negation he's not a believer and prohibition is when the prophet for example says one should not sit when someone enters the Masjid he must not sit until he prays two ra so so this is a Prohibition so now this Hadith the prophet says it can be understood in two ways one way is what the translator understood it in by saying that he who fasts the D what is the d d is the whole year in the Hadith dahar is also referring to time but here it refers to one full year the prophet tells usam that he who fasts the whole year without breaking it so every single day he fasts and break it break his fast after Sunset then he continues to fast the following day and the following day for a whole year one understanding of it is that the prophet is supplicating is invoking Allah against this person he says may Allah Asel does not make him fast or accept his fast so this is a Dua from the prophet Alat wasam and in another narration that he neither fasted nor broke his fast the other interpretation would be understood as a Prohibition so it is in the form of negation but what is embedded is a Prohibition so it means that it is not permissible for you to fast for the whole year without breaking and this is the most authentic opinion that it is not the prophet invoking against those who fast but rather him prohibiting for them to fast the whole year and we remember what happened with alal and how they wanted to continue to fast the whole uh uh three four days in a row without breaking at all or eating and the prophet forbade them from doing this this Hadith tells us that it's a Prohibition why does Allah asael not want us to do good deeds the answer is definitely yes Allah Asel wants us to do good deeds but Allah is more merciful over us than what we would care for our own selves so Allah Asel knows us better and hence he told us do not fast the whole year Allah doesn't want us to do this and there is no point un burdening yourself with something that Allah Asel did not oblige upon you if you insist then you become sinful then how can we reply to those companions who did Fast actually most of the year if not the whole year for a long time we would say that this is an individual choice of the companions but because it went against the instruction of the Prophet Alam we do not approve of that they made the choice they had their reasons they made their but we are not allowed to follow them because follow them following them would mean that we would disobey the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and this is not permissible hence we have to follow what the prophet saidat so if someone says listen I love to fast for the whole year I want a lot of reward my time is limited on Earth and if I don't gain a lot of good deeds I'm going to be poor and needy on the day of judgment which is something I don't want so I'd like to do a lot of good deeds and I find it easy for me to fast for a continuously this happened to a lot of the companions Abdullah for example may Allah be pleased with him when he was newly wed his father went and check his wife so he said how is your husband she said he's the best of men fasts all day and prays all night was a smart man he understood that he didn't have anything to do with women he did not consumate the marriage because he was engaged in so he complained to the prophet Alam and the prophet brought Abdullah and told him Abdullah how do you fast and Abdullah said I fast every single day not missing and skipping one single day so the prophet told him no fast three days of every month he said no I can do more okay fast Mondays and Thursdays fast the white days fast 10 days when he said I can do more he said fast a day and skip a day and there is nothing more you can do than that so this is the fasting of D and this is the best fasting anything more would be transgression would be choosing other than the Sunnah of the Prophet as in the Hadith of the three men who came and asked about his form of worship and one of them said I will Fast and it would never break my fasting and the prophet when he heard this he said whoever chooses a Sunnah other than mine is not from me so you have to go and check yourself are you choosing Sunnah other than the prophet or not we move on to the following Hadith and maybe uh we will conclude uh our first uh part of the show with it the Hadith number uh 47 and this Hadith was narrated by Abu hura may Allah be pleased with him Abu hura says the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said whoever prays during the night in Ramadan out of sincere faith and seeking its reward from Allah will have all of his previous sins forgiven and this Hadith was agreed upon this is a beautiful Hadith like the rest of the hadiths of the Prophet Alat wasam they're all beautiful they are all rich in meaning and they are all inspiring what do we understand from this Hadith we understand that the prophet is highly encouraging the Muslims to pray and to dedicate the nights of Ramadan for night prayer and what is the reward of that well if you do this with two conditions Allah the almighty will forgive your previous sins and this is a lot to have all of your previous sins forgiven this is a lot and it's worth paying hundreds of thousands millions of dollars or Euros or whatever just to get your sheet your record book cleaned restore it white again as it was what to do you don't have to pay a lot you don't have to do a lot all what you need to do is to pray night prayer during every single night of Ramadan but there are two conditions one that you are sincere Im so you do this out of your sincerity out of believing that it is a Sunnah that the prophet did and so did all of his companions afterwards believing that night prayer is the honor of a Believer as in the Hadith the honor of a Believer night prayer and his dignity is in not looking at what people have in their hands so if you do this first condition that you're sincere and that you believe that Allah Asel has given us this opportunity to get our record books cleaned and you do this with the second condition which is which means that you are anticipating the reward on only to be from Allah you're seeking the reward and anticipating it from Allah so sincerity you're not praying for anyone else you're not praying so that people would say oh masallah he prays or he stands all night in prayer for the sake of Allah as some show off would do because you have to be sincere Allah have mercy on his soul says that I went once late at night with a friend to a mosque in Bagdad and there was a man praying so we looked at him and we said to each other mashallah look at how beautiful and submissive this man's prayer is apparently they spoke a bit loud and the man heard this so he wrapped up his prayer in a quick fashion and he came to them with a big smile on his face saying as if he's saying to them that I I've heard what you said he said to them how would you feel to know that I am fasting for the past 30 years every single day so look at what showing off does to an individual this man interrupted this prayer and he exposed his Good Deeds by telling them that he did this form of worship or Good Deeds which is fasting for the past 30 years for the sake of Allah now he exposed himself and he used it to boast about it and to show off so if you pray night prayer during the month of Ramadan for the sake of Allah in this case Allah would forgive your previous sins but praying from is to F is very difficult well Allah had made this easy for us and he told us that if you pray in the congregation with the Imam until he finishes his prayer that is Witter so if you pray then you pray the whole with him or the night prayer with him until he offers Witter then this would be counted for you as praying the whole night so imagine if you succeed in doing this every single night of Ramadan at the end of Ramadan Allah Almighty will forgive all of your previous sins what sins major and minor or only minor it's an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion is that the minor sins are forgiven but if you pray with the intention of repentance and you feel remorse over the major sins that you've committed and you repent to Allah from them then Allah would forgive your major and your final and your uh uh uh minor sins as well we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back for them happiness let us bring Ramadan Ramadan Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala commanded Us in the Quran saying hasten to the Forgiveness of your lord and to Paradise the width of which is the heavens and the Earth prepared for the righteous and Pious

should not fast on Friday and uh not pray the night of Friday uh this Hadith is little bit confused to me so please can you explain this in short okay I will inshallah okay is asking about the Hadith we spoke couple of days ago that the prophet forbade us from specifying so someone does not fast the whole week only to come on Friday Friday and says oh Friday is a beautiful day I'm going to fast today because it's a day of great uh value to Allah this is Haram this is not permissible to specify Friday just because it's a Friday of a week and also not to pray the whole night and decide of the week and decide only to come Thursday at night which is the night of Friday and uh uh fast this is not let me rephrase that fasting has it's uh influence on me not to pray to decide only to pray on the night of Friday this is prohibited by the prophet wasam because doing that means that you're giving something of a or form of worship that the prophet did not doam so this is not permissible if you pray alternate day Thursdays Fridays maybe Monday no problem but to specify only Friday this is not permissible Amar from Saudi sham uh she first of all I like to request you if you would continue your show Even after Ramadan because it's so uh educating and uh we learn a lot so I would really want you to please um continue this effort of yours and uh I have a few questions first uh people say

safia safia from Emirates Salam alikum sh um I have one question on behalf of one sister her husband is a school teacher in uh working in UAE and as you know that they are not very highly paid or highly salaried and uh I she wants to know whether she can accept zakat from her brothers uh if that is permissible because she has no other the disposable income for uh attending to her medical bills or her children's education and can her father also give her give the zakat to her as such that is one one more question if I may be allowed yes uh that is um when the men go for the in the night the night prayer that time uh the women have to also start at that particular time or can they just pray before that around 12 12:30 before the mosque the prayer in the mosque has begun okay that's all thank you sir thank you and we have uh sham from Saudi no Alum yeah sorry I want to ask a question concerning the straightening of R um during Salah yes I just came back from um and I noticed that whenever we are standing and I put my leg beside some people they drift away from me that according to the Sunnah that it's not good when they say straighten up a blind it's only I pertaining to the shoulders and not to the legs so I want to know the Islamic ruling understanding concerning this okay yeah thank you so much you're you're welcome okay um says that uh We've addressed her uh issue of um fasting isolating or specifying jum for fasting Amar says that we wish that this program continues after Ramadan I'm afraid that this is not a a possibility because yeah U Ramadan is a season and if you see a person like myself every single day you will be saturated and bored and that is why one should not uh burden people with this and I don't think the the channel has the capability she says that we have an uh understanding that whoever dies in Ramadan goes straight to paradise this is wrong understanding and it's not a part of the Sunnah we don't have any uh um Del or evidence uh saying it uh or proving it otherwise we would have loved that it would be true from Kuwait can I say my first question yes my first question is in in the in the in the third the third D Dad D didn't raise the hand and uh pray uh say loudly is it allowed not they didn't even have also okay second question no only this question okay I will answer you for answering for asking we have uh Alisa from the Emirates I have a question because as a this a month of Ramadan me and my sister I'm 37 years old and my sister is 36 and we are not married until now so is there any specific Dua we can make in this month and ask Allah to accept I will answer your question inshallah thank you you're quite welcome and uh Amar says that she wants to go for she lives in with her mother-in-law this means that she's traveling without a and the prophet Alam answered this uh question by saying that it is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah in the day of judgment to travel without a and hence you're not allowed to do so Muhammad from the Emirates M yes muham uh I have question regarding zakat I have been sending my zakat to India to one of my relative and they are Distributing zakat to their family according to them the the the Distributing people are really deserving people but I have never seen them I only believe to what my relative have told me and I trust because they are very good practical Muslim so I trust what they said told me true and uh based on that I'm sending my zakat to them and this is the only survival of the family in India okay is that okay for me to do that I will answer your question inshallah that is one question and the second second question is Zak and these are two terms I've heard here in UAE so what is the difference between them do I have to pay both of them according to UAE I need to pay 15 Dam Z and 20 if both are applicable please answer my question I will answer your question from Saudi alikum uh sir I want to ask one question MH about my wife she has found in wi Islam lots of things bad about Islam and Sunnah and Quran in English so we need to defend this our English speaking English understood ulas uh can do something about this so that it harming other people's shaking other Muslims belief so so many things I can point out but if somebody see Wiki Islam Wikipedia Islam huh okay will answer you another question sir what the relation of praying five obligatory Salah and IM somebody Muslim or not Muslim deliberately if somebody abandons one one walk of prayer does he or she gets out of Islam or not okay I will answer the question in uh Aran from Saudi alikum sh sh my name is Ari a RI okay okay she I have two questions the first question is about sacrificing animal on the day of AD like uh in India what we have the tradition that we sacrifice one sheep for Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam in the name of Allah and also we sacrifice animals for the people who are no more like my father we do it for our father and some relatives so is it okay I mean what is the ruling behind this okay and my second question is like uh whenever I'm traveling to Madina man my family my relatives and friends they tell me to convey Salam to Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam but in one of the article uh I couldn't find the reference in sah bukari actually I'm asking this question that they tell me to convey Salam to Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alhi wasallam but in one of the article I read that this is like a kind of B because uh wherever we are anywhere like in America India or anywhere we recite D then directly we can send our Salam to Prophet Muhammad sallallah alaih wasallam we don't need any mediator to do that okay so I want to ask about that you're welcome uh Toba from Saudi I have only one question okay what is the least timing for making for men and women okay I will answer your question inshallah thank you sir you're welcome okay we will uh try to answer these questions um second or third question for Amber she says that we have booklets that tell us that on the first ta you should do this and the second ta you should say these are these authentic the answer is no the authentic Dua is known that from the or from you say the rest you can say whatever you want and in when you raise You supplicate by saying the rest of the Dua and you ask and supplicate to Allah Asel and that is it in between you say whatever you wish you read the Quran you make you make you make all of this is is permissible and also if you want to make General Dua oh Allah give me this forgive my sins uh pay my debts uh restore my health guide my children Etc this is permissible om ABD from Saudi alum uh regarding someone saw on peace TV uh the in Surah yusf Ayah number 76 the end of the Ayah 76 we raise to degrees whom we will but over all those endured with knowledge is the all knowing Allah this it was is it was told that uh if we want to find a job or any promotion we have to recite this 70,000 times I just wanted to confirm is this can be can this be followed you saw you saw this on P TV yes that is why I'm confused because on P TV usually they show they don't show for stuff like this someone told me from India they called me from India and they told me to ask so that's why particular specifically I'm asking you is it the English English Channel or uh that I don't know because there are two pie TVs one is in Udu in India okay I will answer okay uh okay we move on uh what is the best way to inaugurate a house or a business there isn't any such thing in Islam to inaugurate a house or a business there is what is known as wakira which is a meal that you invite people to eat in but again this is uh some say part of the Sunnah some say that it is not anything uh the best thing for you to do in your house is to recite Surah Al Bak this words off Devils from entering for specific period of time and the business that you ensure that it is halal and that you don't have any Haram thing Associated to it abdad from Kuwait says that we came to a Masid where they pray wi three like so what to do you follow them you join them if there is no other alternative another Masjid that follows the Sunnah this form of praying W as is found in the and the prophet forbade this the majority of Scholars say that this is not permissible to pray it like you have to in the second ra stand up without sitting for tah and continue the rest of the prayer normally if you could not find accept this mid pray with them and inshallah your prayer is valid uh he's asking about zakat when to pay it it is or the deadline for it is when the Imam starts the prayer forid then this is it it's it's over so you can pay it up till that time and may Allah be pleased with him he used to give it earlier a day or two so if you give it on the 28th the 29th this is also permissible inshallah om says well performing Gul and just before washing the feet someone passes wind does he have to repeat the Gul the answer is no he does not have to do this he has to repeat the woodo though but other than that no problem uh raising the hands uh am me asked so many questions about raising the hands I don't have time to answer it now raising the hands after every mandatory prayer is a b if it's once every blue moon because you have an urge or a need no problem raising it between thean and is permissible raising it in the middle of the night or at the last third of the night after praying there is no problem in that uh inshallah raising it when before when you're waiting for uh uh the sun to set and you raise your hands and and ask Allah this is also permissible coming from Saudi Arabia says that she is confused she has not performed her Hajj and she heard something about sacrifice this is Sunnah it's called those like us who do not go for Hajj they're residing while the pilgrims are in the Holy shrines we are recommended highly recommended to slaughter a sheep so every father in the house or or the husband or um the head of the family in the house for those who live under his roof and eat from his food he Slaughters one sheep and this suffice uh and does the job she says that she prayed with the Adan of jida if you know that they pray couple of minutes before time or let me rephrase that if you know that they call for the aan couple minutes ahead of time so that people would yeah seize to eat and drink away or ahead of time then you prayer is invalid and that is why we recommend that you do not pray until the MU has finished his aan completely give a couple of minutes and then you may uh uh pray if you did not do that and you prayed immediately I recommend that you repeat your prayer um safia from the Emirates says that her husband does not have uh enough salary because he's a teacher in the Emirates and they are not uh uh well paid so is it permissible for her to take money from her brothers as zakat for uh medical bills and for uh tuition fees of her children if you are labeled as poor or needy you don't have enough funds or money the salary is not sufficient this is permissible can her father give her from the zakat the answer is no the father can give her husband direct but he cannot give his own daughter because it is his obligation to provide for her she says those who are in their homes when should they pray night prayer or whenever they want after they have no relationship with the Masjid so if the Masjid prays at 2:00 they can pray at at 9 at 10: at 11: whenever they wish they have no connection uh uh with the masjids shamin from Saudi she he says that the people in omah they uh when he went for omah in prayer the the Sunnah of attaching one's leg or foot to uh uh the other person's foot when straightening the row is not found and whenever he tries to get close to someone they run away from him or they take their feet away from him so he's asking someone told him that it's only by the shoulders you should uh uh stick to the one next to you not with your feet this is wrong the Hadith of the companions of the Prophet wasam that they all used to stick their foot with the the feet of those next to them their shoulders their knees everything they're so tight with each other because their hearts were filled with Iman nowadays people run away from you because their hearts are filled with arrogance with the love of this dun that's why they don't want to uh uh be close to you or you being close to them so no worries inshallah Allah would reward you for that T from uh Kuwait I think he says that doing Dua in Witter loudly is this part of the Sunnah the answer is yes it was the prophet who gave us the prayer of when he prayed three or four nights so this is legitimate and he's the one who taught Ali what to say in in of wit so if you combine both then it becomes inshallah part of the Sunnah Alisa from the emance she and her sister are not married and she says during the Blessed month of Ramadan what do we licate you ask Allah you raise your hands and you praise Allah and you offer salutation to the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam and you ask Allah to send you someone who fears Allah who is practicing and who would make you happy in this life and the Hereafter and there's no problem in my point of view to register your name as well in Islamic websites matrimonial websites that would probably help you matchmaking inshallah through the Islamic ways not with chatting or direct communication but through your w we pray to Allah that he makes things easy Muhammad from the Emir says he sends his zakat money to his relative whom he trusts this is permissible as long as you trust him you have done your job inshallah he says that in the Emirates they take 15 Dirhams for zakat and 20 for Kwa I don't know what they're doing over the Emirates this is not part of the Sunnah in the Sunnah it's only to feed 20 Dirham this is this might be an extra thing from them but to oblige people to do it or to associate them this becomes an innovation yes if you give a 100 dham to help the poor this is extra not only to K means to buy him clothes okay then you add another 50 Dirhams for uh his shoes and maybe another hundred for his perfumes and all make all of this part of the dean no this is not part of the de the f is the food that you give which is a 2.5 or 2.25 kilog of rice and this is it this is for Zak anything extra should not be related it should be part of the charity and it says that there are lots of wrong information in Wiki Islam or W Wiki whatever who goes there a these are cfer websites and you should not try trust them and they're open so anyone could write whatever they wish uh uh can't Scholars um dedicate time to respond a there are gazillion websites uh out there that are attacking Islam uh spreading pornography and who is there to reply to them you reply to one another 100,000 next day would emerge so don't waste your time by replying to them if every dog barks at you and you throw him with a a rock rocks would be more valuable than gold let the dogs bark you have no problem with that inshallah uh Ari uh says that what's the relationship between um no that's not Ari the second question of says that what's the relationship between mandatory prayers and Iman if we leave one prayer does this take us out of the fold of Islam no it doesn't but if a person is labeled as not praying he doesn't pray at all and for a period of time then he becomes an apostate and he nullifies his Islam AR she says that uh we have a custom in India we Slaughter in theid of Hajj one slau one sacrifice for the prophet Alam and one for the deceased well slaughtering for the prophet is an innovation clear Innovation you should not do this because whatever you do whatever you Slaughter the prophet will be accredited because he's the one who sallallahu alaihi wasallam told us and taught us what to do and how to worship Allah so he gets credit for that so there's no need and if you do it's an innovation slaughtering for the decease this is per missible but if someone is not financially strong he could Slaughter one sheep for the whole of his family and include in intention all those deceased of of his loved ones uh whenever we go to Medina people say convey your Salam to the Prophet this is a clear inovation Z or someone else from the descendant of the Prophet Alam saw a man coming to the window next to the grave of the Prophet giving him Salam and he told him my son don't do this because by Allah you and the people in Al Andel in uh uh uh occupied Spain you and the people there are the same your Salam would reach the prophet Alam through the angel appointed by Allah so no it is a evation to say convey my Salam to the prophet and he should not respond to that Toba says what is the minimum time for it's an issue of dispute some say a day and a night some say no half a day and some say even a minute and Allah's grace and favor is a lot so inshallah as long as you go to the Masjid and you intend to make Allah would accredit you for that OMD says that she heard someone say that if you say inahf 70,000 times then you uh uh things would happen you get a job or something this is complete fabrication this is totally untrue and it's a lie and I very much doubt that it was aired on P TV because I know brother Dr zacher and I know the people working on p p TV they are very uh uh vigorous and and and strong and and and tight when it comes to what is authentic and what is not they filter all programs like six times just to ensure that nothing uh uh that is unauthentic is AED on their Channel and maybe they make a mistake here or there but this I'm sure that it was not on peace TV and Allah knows best this is all the time we have until we meet next time while watching the new moon sighting it felt like a good lighting this day is all right as the first start we here tonight with family around the night meal we're making do I night feel how nice it is is to be so near to those I love whenever we think of rad all the good things that we need to do and plan it's not always easy but we'll do the best we can oh"
