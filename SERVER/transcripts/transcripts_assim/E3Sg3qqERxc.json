  "transcript": "Peyman Iranian Domini slark Megrahi al hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu salaam / kadhai Abdi he wore a suit he nabina muhammad in wada early he was happy in my bag assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh today we will begin with the grace of Allah Azza WA JAL to look into chapter 79 surat an-nas e hot and generally speaking the surah begins with a lot almighty swearing by the Angels and talking about them and different tasks then Allah moves on to speak about the two blows of the trumpet where people are annihilated and then resurrected again and how they would be and what they would talk about and then allah azzawajal tells us about what happened to some of the nations before the prophet alayhi salatu salam Allah tells us about Moses peace be upon him Musa and what he did with throne with Pharaoh and Allah Azza WA JAL asks those who worship others than him would give them an eye opener to look around them and ponder upon his great creations and Allah would show them some of his favors and blessings and then he would remind them of their inevitable destination whether it's heaven or hell and then allah azzawajal concludes the surah by talking about how people wonder when the day of judgement would be when the hour would be and that they should ponder on the fact that when the hour comes they will reflect on the previous life and they would estimate it to be few minutes rather than hundreds of years now this surah is a mckee surah and we spoke about this before but it is important to know that there are certain characteristics of the Mackey sewers and scholars say that the Mackey suitors focus on purification of worship and having the full toe head of a large division so the 13 years that the Prophet spent is awesome in Mecca he would focus on purifying the people's hearts from associating others with allah and in implanting injecting the beautiful names and attributes of allah azza wajal this is what builds Iman and faith in the hearts and that is what we lacked most when we were asked about the beautiful names and attributes of allah so JAL we have no idea but if one of us is planning to travel to a new country for a couple of weeks on holidays he would definitely do his due diligence and he would do his research and he would know the places to go and the places to stay away from also among the characteristics of the maquis auras is that it establishes belief so it talks a lot about the day of judgement about angels about the passengers about the books about the destiny and the preordainments or gel builds up in the hearts of the believers and this is the foundation that people's belief should be based upon and that is why it's called pillars of Eman likewise we find that the Mak asuras establishes a system of morality and they focused on the general concept of forms of worship generally not in detail so they said pray give zakat do this do good deeds not in details because the details came afterwards in Medina we find that the Maki Sora's focus on the previous nations that the Arabs had glimpses off so they know her had they know some would they know what had happened to the earth at the time of Noah and the flood they know about what the Jews say about Moses peace be upon him and what the Christians say about ISA peace be upon him so they reflect on those stories the highlight what had happened to those who disbelieved so that the people would learn a lesson from that and finally among the characteristics of the maquis warez that they are short in verses and wordings so it's only few words and then another verse unlike the mud any sewers where you have long verses with lots of rulings and verdicts and etc so this is in a nutshell how you could differentiate between the mecha-suits and the medina sewers verse number one in chapter 79 and Nazihah allah azzawajal says when a CIT car and this translates you by those who pull out with great violence now this is not sufficient information to some and say so what is those whom Allah is swearing by and why does Alice where C in Arabic when I say what law he I will do this this is a form of taking an oath or swearing to confirm that I'll do something so by saying by Allah I'll do this thing I'm emphasizing that I'll do it and that is why I am taking an oath and in Arabic there are three letters that are considered to be an indication of an oath what back and tap so if I say wallahi or billahi or tell ahi all of these are forms of making an oath now as Muslims we are not allowed to take or make an oath except by allah azza wajal or one of his beautiful and attributes so I can say wallahi where is that Allah all of these things are considered to be an oath and if I make an oath with other than Allah or his beautiful names I would be committing an act of shirk so if I say by the prophet alayhi salatu salam or by the Kaaba this is because whoever makes an oath with other than the names of Allah so that he has committed chip now when it comes to the Quran Allah the creator of all creations the owner of what you see and what you do not see he has the right to make an oath well whatever he wants and no one could object to that because he's the owner he is the legislator and that is why allah azza wajal makes or takes an oath or swears with whatever he wants and usually he has given us an indication to the honor and the status of the things that Allah is swearing by so here the most authentic opinion is that Allah in the first five ayahs of this surah allah is swearing by the angels so when as the IT raka allah is wearing by the angels that pull out in violence the souls of the disbelievers and don't be intimidated you should be but don't be intimidated at the moment you have to understand this fact and reality on the day of judgment there are either believers or disbelievers there is nothing in between so it's either hell or heaven there's nothing in between and that is why this is something that you have to realize before you die what are you a believer or a disbeliever one would say in my religion I'm a believer well in the sight of Allah are you a believer or a disbeliever how would I know well you have to look into your religion is it accepted by Allah or not because if you look around you'll find a gazillion religions on earth only one is accepted in the side of Allah why is that because this is the logical thing you say right I say left you say day I say night so what is right at the side of Allah this is what you have to do this is what you have to apply that as it tests on so if you confirm that your religion is the religion of Allah if you confirm that the book you have is the authentic book and the word of Allah then you are in good hands but make sure that you are as a Muslim I claim and I can back up my claim and I stand by it that my religion is the only religion accepted by Allah and my book the Quran which we're interpreting and giving the commentary on is the final revelation of Allah the Almighty the creator of the heavens and the earth so disbelievers wait until your souls would depart your bodies because then you would see the light and you would see the truth but it would be too late unfortunately now you have the chance to think it over take a day off just put yourself in seclusion and think for Allah say think before it's too late when a Seattle car the Angels that pull out in violence the souls of the disbelievers verse 2 when a she thought in a spa and by those angels who gently take out the souls of the believers not the disbelievers so we have two types of angels angels that take the souls out of the disbelievers violently and those who take out the souls of the believers gently and why is that we have a break we'll discuss this after insha'Allah so stay tuned welcome back when a CIT haha when a she taught in a spa a lasagna is swearing by two types of angels one that takes out the souls of the disbelievers violently while the other takes the souls of the believers gently when nasha taught in a spa meaning that it's a description in Arabic when you take a ribbon and you tie a knot and the simple type of knot is when you hold one part of it and you pull it and the knot is untied so it is almost the same when the nashit part they will untie this knot and take the soul of the believers in a gentle way a long hadith by the Baba as it may Allah be pleased with him where the prophet described a little of Salam how the angels of death take the soul of a disbeliever as if it's a grill or a rod of iron with different thorns coming out of it is put into wool that is wet and then extract it from it because when they want to take the soul of a disbeliever the soul is so terrified that it goes in each and every part of the body and this is how they take it out of it while the soul of a believer comes out in a gentle way as if it is a drop coming out of a water bag so people think and say I've seen so many Muslims suffer so bad and then they die what I had seen a lot of disbelievers Christians Jews Hindus whatever they are on their dying bed and they died so peacefully and nicely so how do you explain this there is a difference between what people faced before their actual death and the actual exiting of the soul from their bodies the soul when it is exiting the body the terror and pain and agony is not seen and what happens before that is not an indication of anything see our prophet alayhi salatu salam suffered before dying and he used to put his hand in a pot with water and wash his face and say la ilaha illaallah in almaty chocolat he would say that there is no God worthy of being worshipped except Allah Azza WA JAL death has its toll and this happened to the best of Allah's creation muhammed sallalahu are you insane and that is why I shall have peace with her his wife said I would never hate suffering before death to any of my loved ones after what I had seen with the Prophet or a sorcerer because this is an indication of Allah's love to them how would that be how would a lot love people and make them suffer before they died you don't see the whole picture the Prophet told us a little salaam that calamities in suffering and pain would remain with the servant of allah until it leaves him without a sin walking on earth meaning that this suffering he raises his sins the more you are suffering the more pain you are feeling and undergoing this means that Allah Allah is forgiving you since so when you die you actually die without any sense to be held accountable for so this is different than the actual extracting of the soul for a believer all this pain and agony the minute they come and take the soul the soul comes so gently without any problem as if it is swimming and this is the following iowa's a Behati sever while the soul of a disbeliever is extracted in a very painful way though you see that he's dying and passing away in a peaceful manner externally but actually internally he is in hell literally suffering from all of this and Alonzo Jewell says in the third area was savvy hottie somehow he swears with those that swim along and this is indifference to the angels again of course there are other interpretations it is the planets in their galaxies it is the Stars going around but this is the most authentic opinion these are the five types of angels Allah is wearing with fasabi party Sbrocco and by those that press forward as if in a race and the angels are like this they're racing they're fast they're faster than lightning what Allah commands them to do something when Allah ordered them to do something they do it immediately no hesitation no slowing down whatever Allah tells them to do they do it as Allah described the angels of torment in hell that they never disobey Allah and they execute whatever Allah ordered them to do and finally fell muda Bharati and Marah and by those angels who arrange to do the commands of their Lord so there are angels that do what Allah tells them to do and these angels do not help Allah and be careful Allah does not need anyone or anything Allah surgeon does not need help there was a law and nothing was with him nothing he is so independent subhana Allah when he created the throne when he created the kursi when he created the heavens and Earth's when he created the angels in their billions and billions of number when he created everything he did not create all of these things out of need because he does not need anyone he does not need the throne to be over he does not need the angels to carry the throne he does not need anyone to do anything but it is his majesty and power subhana wa ta'ala that he created all of this and he ordered it to do whatever he wishes to do now there are numbers of angels we have the ark angel jibreel and we have the angel is sloughing and we have Myka in these three angels are appointed for things related to life so gibreel is appointed to carry revelation and this has the life of the hearts to the believers is revealed is appointed to blow the trumpet where he would resurrect with the grace of Allah the people from their death and from their graves so this is life again and mikail is the one appointed with the rain to fall and plants to grow and again this is life there is an angel of death people call him Israel but this is not his name his name is the angel of death there is the angel of Hell appointed for hell and he is the hell keeper his name is Malik and there is angels for protecting the individuals there are angels on your side writing the good deeds and the bad deeds there are angels of different types and forms these angels it is a pillar of Eman to believe in their existence it's an honorable form of the creation of a larger we don't see but we believe in Allah created them from light unlike the jinn who were created from fire and it is a well-known fact to most of the people that angels are attributed or always remembered with beauty while Devils are always remembered by ugliness and they never sinned they're so pure they never sinned we're told in the Quran that they have sets of wings into threes or fours the Prophet told us a sum that gibreel who is the greatest of all angels in the biggest and the strongest and the closest to Allah he saw him with 600 wings blocking the horizon and they do not have a gender we cannot say they're male or female that is why it is totally prohibited to call a female your daughter with a name of an angel or to say that she is an angel this is totally prohibited because this is what the disbelievers said that they made the Angels daughters of allah azzawajal they made them daughters females and they made them to allah azzawajal and this is all nonsense when children laugh when infants smile they say oh look at him an angel is making him laugh and this is nonsense this is baseless and they would describe the nurses to be angels of mercy and this is Haram and they would describe someone who sings beautifully to have an angelic voice they are so huge some of them the Prophet Isis ant said that I was given the permission to speak about one of those who carry the throne of allah azza wajal the distance between his ear loop and his shoulder is the distance of traveling for 700 years imagine how far that is they pray for the believers whenever they are in the Masjid or gathering in a circle of knowledge they protect the individuals from what comes before him or behind him or on his side they are related to the humans since they were born so they write their provisions their age whether they're good or bad they write all of their good deeds and bad deeds and they're bashful of the believers they are away from bad things and they're always in your house protecting you supplicating to Allah and asking Allah for mercy for you and that is why Allah loves his angels and that is why Allah honors them and Allah swears by these five types of angels this is all the time we have until we meet next time via Manila Salaam aleikum from Wahiawa like anybody you and you but a solo"
