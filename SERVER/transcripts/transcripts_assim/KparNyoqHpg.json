  "transcript": "while watching the new sighting it felt like a good enlightening this day is so bright as the first start always the night with family around a nice meal we're making the one i feel how nice it is to be so neat to those i love that deals with fasting it was narrated by ishmael be pleased with her she said that the prophet of allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam applied to his eyes while he was fasting this hadith was related by ibn maja with a weak chain of narrators according to a tirmidhi nothing authentic has been related from the prophet concerning this issue sallallahu alaihi now this hadith of isha may allah be pleased with her is telling us that the prophet used to apply or known as eyeliner and it's from ithmid it's a it's sort of a rock that is grind and crushed and it is used as an eyeliner it has so many benefits for the eyesight and for the health of the eye itself so aisha may allah be pleased with her is telling us that the prophet used to apply this while fasting so what do we understand from this we understand that it is permissible to apply in the state of fasting however ibn maja who reported this hadith reported it with a weak chain of narrators and imam tirmidhi himself said there is nothing authentic on this issue whether in applying it while fasting or prohibiting applying it while fasting both sides are totally not authentic and one would ask why would al half of ibn hajjar me allah have mercy on your soul bring in his book a hadith that is weak a hadith that everyone acknowledges the fact the fact that it is not authentic why would he do such a thing well the reason is that he usually gets the hadiths regardless of their authenticity so that the student of knowledge would know whether an opinion of an imam or an opinion of a school of thought was based on evidence rather than own desires and whims so when someone says it is not permissible to apply eye drops in the eyes why is that because of the hadith of so-and-so or someone says that it is permissible to apply eye drops because aisha reported so and so so these are evidences that scholars used to justify their verdicts whether they are authentic or not this is beside the point and that is why imam al-hafiz may allah have mercy on his soul brought this hadith so that you would know as a student of knowledge that this is the basis where the scholars base their opinion in regards to eye drops applying them or not now when we say not authentic what does that mean it means that the hadith has a defect whether in the chain of narrators or in the context itself of the hadith because we have isn't and we have mutton isn't is the chain of narrators so and so hurt so-and-so heard so and so heard abu huraya allah please with him that the prophet said islam this is a chain of narrators and it has it's a science and it has lots of conditions that govern this chain of narrators so that the hadith would be studied thoroughly and then classified as sahih or hassan so both the first two are accepted so they are accepted we can take them and apply them and the likes of it whether it's moldur whether it is whether it is moonkar whether it is shad all of these are classifications of the hadith these we cannot apply and scholars differ some of them said in hadith or in hadiths that are not authentic but they're weak they're not fabricated because fabricated is a lie so we cannot even look into that a weak hadith is a hadith with a chain of narrators but maybe one of them or two they are not accused in their piety and the righteousness but rather they when they became old forgot so they used to mix authentic hadith with non-authentic hadith that is why they avoided such a person and classified him as weak not because he's a liar no but because his memory is not intact or wasn't intact at a particular time or he used to read from his books and then his books were burnt so he relied on his memory and he made mistakes etc so when it comes to weak hadiths or baif some scholars say that we can apply this providing it is not pertaining to apida and it is not related to halal and haram so if it's something involuntary acts things that are in the deeds of virtue meaning like prayers of nafil prayer fasting of fasting something that has nothing to do with akida with the interpretation of the quran with uh rulings of sharia law and they say that we can take this this is there's no problem in that others say no allah azza has revealed the thicker which includes the quran and the sunnah and he has pledged to protect it so allah protected for us the sunnah and by protecting the sunnah he protected the sahih hadith so we judge the hadith in regards of authenticity either by looking at the chain of narrators and this is the general it's like 90 to 95 percent of our grading and judgment over the hadith and there is a 5 or 10 percent that the chain of generators is okay but the methane the text itself is not okay and this is in many well not so many in few cases where the scholars would look into the hadith and say now this is not correct because it goes against the quran it is something that is not known as in the example of salatu the chain of narrators is perfect but the met in itself the prayer itself and the actual thing that no one ever reported this hadith or had ever done it or prayed the narrator of the hadith this indicated that this hadith is not authentic so going back to our hadith says may allah be pleased with her that the prophet salallahu applied this while he was fasting this is a weak hadith so should we go on and discuss the things related to it or because it's weak hadith we do not do do not do so see the hadith says that it's okay but there are scholars who said that it is not okay so what's the ruling we have to go back to the basics in the quran allah forbade sexual intercourse eating and drinking during day time in ramadan but nothing else is mentioned so we have to go back to the general principles the verses of the quran and the sunnah so that we can have an over view and give the right answer so when we look at all the evidences around we find that the things that void your fasting are mentioned in the quran sexual intercourse and we spoke about that before and said that masturbating also falls under the category eating and drinking and also whatever takes the role of eating and drinking such as the ivs the glucose uh that people take and they can remain alive without the need of eating and drinking now also and we will we spoke about that scholars some of them say that cupping nullifies fasting and we discussed this in a previous episode so when we come to the general hadith we find that the prophet islam is indicating to us that whatever goes into your stomach whether it is from your mouth or from your nose this invalidates your fasting because the nose is a normal passage to the stomach that's why sometimes you find patients in hospital they insert a tube in their noses where the food goes directly to their stomachs through that and in the hadith of it may allah be pleased with him he said that the prophet isam told him to sniff water up his nostrils and not to exaggerate when he's fasting but if he's not fasting he should do that it clears his sinus it clears his nostrils and and cleans them but in the case of fasting there is a possibility that he may get some water down his stomach through his nose so we know that these are the two normal passages to the stomach now the ears and the eyes are not so if you swim in a swimming pool and you open your eyes underwater and you remain doing this for a couple of hours you would never ever feel that you're not thirsty anymore because the eyes and your ears are not a normal passage to the stomach so you would not have any benefit of that and that is why if you put eye drops if you put ear drops if you put kohl and one would say can men wear kohl or is this only for women no this is acceptable for men because the prophet used to do it allah the companions used to do it and it's a form of medication it's healthy for the eye nowadays if someone wears this probably they would think that he is like a a member of a heavy metal group or something like that but again this is a sunnah if you want to do it no problem in doing it in sha allah azza so in short eye drops ear drops they are permissible eye injections are also permissible and will say wow who would get an injection in his eye unfortunately some of the uh diabetes uh patients diabetic patients do in severe cases get may allah cure them all injections in the eyes so that they would not lose eyesight and this is a very advanced stage of this illness may allah cure them all so they may get this and this would not affect their fasting insha allah we move on to hadith number 20 and this hadith is narrated by abu hurayrah may allah be pleased with him says that the prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam said whoever forgets that he is fasting and eats or drinks it was as it was allah let me read that again i lost concentration i apologize whoever forgets that he is fasting and eats or drinks is to complete his fast as it was allah who fed him and gave him something to drink and this hadith was agreed upon and similarly hadith number 21 the following hadith al-haqim in his mustadrakh transmitted on the authority of also abu hurairah may allah be pleased with him he said whoever breaks his fast during ramadan due to forgetfulness is not to make up for the day later or perform an expiation and this hadith is also sound so both hadiths were narrated by abu hurairah and they all revolve on things that nullify fasting due to forgetfulness so the first hadith the prophet allah highlights and tells us about eating and drinking out of forgetfulness he should continue to fast because allah has fed him and it was allah who gave him the drink how would that be meaning that allah azzawajal had mercy on him and due to the fact of forgetfulness then this is exempted and allah says in the quran don't burden us if we err or forget if we make a mistake or we forget in sahih muslim allah responded to their invocation by saying i have done so meaning i will not burden you i will not hold you accountable if you make a mistake or if you forget and if you recall earlier in the month we said that the things that nullify fasting they have to be done providing three conditions are fulfilled so if i eat in order for eating to void my fasting it has to be done knowingly it has to be done while i'm remembering it it has to be done by my own choice so this means that if i do not know the ruling in this case it doesn't void my fasting if someone eats chewing gum and someone sees him in the day of ramadan and says what are you doing he said i'm eating chewing gum gum so this is not permissible he said why because you are eating it i thought only food and drink are not permissible in this case do we tell him to make up for the missed days the answer is no because if he genuinely did not know then this is exempted likewise a person who just accepted islam and during the month of ramadan he used to have intimacy with with his wife intercourse and he did not know he thought it was only food and drinks again this guy is exempted secondly he has to be remembering and this hadith is the perfect example so if a person eats or drinks out of forgetfulness then this is from allah a gift from allah because it gave him a a boost to go on for three four more hours without the need of eating or drinking though he's fasting but he didn't remember at the time one of the brothers called me a few months ago and he said i'm uh today i'm fasting and this was like eight o'clock in the morning nine o'clock in the morning he said i i intended to fast i had my suhur my pre-dawn meal and i went to work and during work for one reason or the other i went back home about eight o'clock 8 30 and i went without thinking to the kitchen and i prepared a big fat sandwich with turkey and lattes and mayo's and pickles and a big toast and it's a nice club sandwich and i ate it then i drank a big glass of milk and then when going back to the office i remember that i was fasting so what to do i said no problem fasting is intact here is allah azza who fed you and gave you drink alhamdulillah and few hours later after lunch break about two o'clock he said how was it work and the boys brought some fried chicken and they invited me to eat and i ate with them completely forgetting that i was fasting so what's the ruling on that and i had goose bumps and see are you serious he said well i am serious i didn't know i just totally forgot i said well your fasting is correct because the hadith is obvious this is something between you and allah azzawajal few hours later i got a call from him i did not dare to pick it up because i thought that this guy is he's going to kill me for the third time he's going to tell me that he forgot and he ate like half a lamp or or or something like that well this is too much but again this is something between you and allah if you forget then this does not void your fasting and the third condition is that you have to be choosing to do so so if someone at gunpoint tells you either you eat or i'm gonna blow up your head in this case eat and feast until the threat is gone and your fasting is valid and it is correct now does this or is this limited only to eating and drinking or all the things that are supposed to nullify fasting are included the most authentic opinion it's an issue of of dispute of course the most authentic opinion is that all types of nullifiers of fasting are included and the is the hadith that followed which i read a little bit uh a while ago hadith number 21 when abu urairah said that the prophet said arahim whoever breaks his fast during ramadan due to forgetfulness is not to make up for that day later or perform an expiation so the prophet is telling us whoever breaks his fast and he does not mention eating and drinking this means that even if you have sexual relationship with your spouse totally forgetting that this is ramadan or that you are fasting you are totally forgot then again this does not affect your fasting because the hadith is uh crystal clear and also it does not require you to make up for the day nor requires you to give expiation now let us assume and this a lot of the people ask this question i go to my house i enter the kitchen and i find my father i find my brother i find my wife i find my son eating during the day of ramadan like the friend who called having a big sandwich and a big glass of milk and eating and enjoying it and what should i do some people say i should leave him because this is from allah it's a gift allah is he is feeding him and allah is giving him something to drink so i may even help him say would you like me to get you some ketchup or a mayo the answer to that would be this is totally wrong and prohibited you have to remind him you have to tell him that what you're doing is wrong one would say why is feeding him and giving him drink said yes but allah also told us to command and to enjoy virtue and to prevent and stop vice and evil and this is part of the things that you have to enjoy to tell him this is ramadan you forgot don't do this maybe he would become angry with me well let him become angry rather than allah azza becoming angry with you and it's like if i find my brother my friend my father my mother my son my daughter my wife if i find them asleep and the alarm clock goes off and they don't wake up or they turn it off should i leave them and say that has exempted them from prayer because the pen has been lifted uh over three and one of them a person who's in who's asleep until he wakes up so alhamdulillah is not sinful no it is your obligation to go and wake him up or wake her up and if they don't want to wake up or they shout at you or scold you in this case leave them you've done your duty but not to simply neglect the issue and say well it is from allah azza wajal the following question would be what is the ruling if someone remembers while he's eating and drinking by mistake by forgetfulness what would happen if he remembers that oops now i i just remember them fasting he should immediately throw whatever is in his mouth not throw up but if he's having a bite he should not swallow it he should throw it and if he does not he says like that uh um ignorant person who bought grapes a bag of grapes from the market and on his way he forgot he was fasting so he ate it one by one until he reached the home and his wife saw him eating the grapes and he had the last one with him and she said what have you done you fool you are fasting today and he said to her i did not know that i totally forgot anyhow if the whole kilogram i ate did not nullify my fasting i don't think that this last piece that this last great would affect my fasting and he ate it we tell this ignorant person that the whole kilogram that you ate did not nullify your fasting this last one of grape did void your fasting because you did it intentionally and this void your fasting now we have a time inshallah for one more hadith hadith number 22 and this hadith was narrated by abu hurairah again may allah be pleased with him he says that whoever is overcome and vomits is not to make up for the day but whoever vomits intentionally must make up the day and this is an authentic hadith what does this hadith mean it tells us that vomiting is one of the things that nullify your fasting but there are two types of vomiting both are gross of course i know but this is something we have to learn because this is part of our daily life this is part of the pillars of islam and part of our religion so the prophet tells us that whoever is overcome by it and he throws he vomits and he throws up unintentionally in this case his fasting is intact for example someone eats something that doesn't suit him and he's having problems and all of a sudden he just throws up while fasting we tell him your fasting is intact you have no problem this is different to someone who over ate and then he tried to sleep after fajr he couldn't and he felt suffocating he could not do anything about it and he's unable to throw up normally so he goes to the bathroom he inserts he inserts his finger down his throat and he throws up or he smells a certain medication that provokes him to throw up such action is done intentionally so because he had done this intentionally the prophet says ali saw some this voids his fasting and does such a case happen and the answer is yes there are people who exaggerate when they eat and they eat like wild beasts and when it's fajr time they can barely breathe and the prophet said as some said in a prophetic hadith that shows the excellence of his knowledge histolatu of the human anatomy and the human body he said it's sufficient for a human being to take few morsels that would straighten his back because when you're hungry you sort of concave and and you cave in but few morsels make you walk straight and then he gave the permission he said if you must eat in this case one-third is for your food one-third is for your drink and one-third for your breathing this is how we should categorize our stomachs when we eat unlike what a lot of the people do when they viciously attack the food as an enemy and consume more than what they can take so the ruling is if you throw up intentionally your fasting is void if you throw up unintentionally without your intention without doing anything to provoke this your fasting is intact we have a short break stay tuned and insha allah we'll be right back the forgiveness of your lord and to paradise the width of which is the heavens and the earth prepared for the righteous and pious brothers and

mother sister my mother sister that is my auntie whenever i go to india my auntie will give me many gifts but my father will say not to take all only one or two but my mother said there is nothing wrong nothing wrong if you take so i have to listen to my father or my mother can you please tell me any hadees but about gifts okay my third question is in for in fajr salah if i forgot to say with rasala can i read this do do i before completing salah uh we have sharif sharif do we have sharif we don't have sheriff okay alya's question first one is there any supplication to learn the quran well the general supplication would be you ask allah azza for knowledge oh allah increase me in knowledge and the hadith of may allah please with him he said that the best of you who teaches the quran and learns the quran so you can ask allah azzawajal to make the quran the spring of your heart and the light of your eyesight as in the long dua to the end of the about which some people usually associate it with quran you can ask allah azza for that and this would insha allah do the job we have sarah from jeddah i have two questions first a question is like in pakistan in india we have the um hatams at home we call people and we read the quran and do khatam is this right or not and the second question is this is from my husband that when the you said yesterday you must when you pray you must recite the words in your mouth but when you go for salah in the mosque and the imam is saying the prayer are you supposed to just keep quiet or are you supposed to uh say it after him the meaning the fatih not the whole prayer what what do you mean by yani i didn't understand your question like when the imam is saying the prayer in the mosque okay are we supposed to sit quietly stand quietly and not say it in a mouth how would you say it in your mouth would you repeat behind him exactly yeah do we repeat it or do we just stand quiet i will answer the question thank you so much you are welcome um alia says that her aunt gives her gifts and her father usually tells her don't take all of these gifts take one or two and her mother says no it's okay to take all of them so what's the ruling on that the prophet islam always accepted gifts so your father is wrong he should not restrain you he should not prevent you from accepting the gifts and you should try to explain to him that it is the prophet sunnah islam to accept the gifts per se but if he still insists then you have to obey your father and do not disobey your mother and you have to find a solution mustafa from nigeria yes mustafa okay my question is uh is it permissible for a footballer to drop his person because of a football match that is going to play in okay i will answer the question i have two questions one is uh some people tells me that there is a salah is it there or no okay and second is uh you told about few days before that there is no salat for so if i something good happens in my life or something good happens to me how do i show my gratitude to allah can he make it up later on in the prayer that says no this is the place of if you miss it then there's nothing wrong in missing it because it's a sunnah it's not mandatory so there's no problem in skipping it all together um sarah from jeddah says that it's a habit that we are accustomed that we bring people to our homes and they do and by doing meaning that either they recite the quran in the house for barakah for blessings and they uh or gather to make congregational dua they bring maybe a a priest or a sheikh or a shaman or whatever and he makes certain for them in the house is this permissible the answer is no this is part of innovation and one should not uh do such things her second question was what's ruling on listening to the imam when he's reciting the answer is this is mandatory you have to listen to the imam when he's reciting the surah and you're not allowed to move your lips repeating with him because uh uh allah says in the end of chapter seven surah whenever the quran is being recited you should listen to it and give it your attention so you may not read while the imam is reading kubra from saudi yeah i have two questions yes uh the first one is that people say we have to give vasila through nabi salah salam so that our prayers be accepted for this they give uh evidence that adam alayhi salam gave vasila through uh um like they said that adam alaihissalam said la la then only allah accepted his repentance okay when i said no it's not that it is another dua so they say no then tell us where it is the second question is that how many times of meal should be given to one person for as a fidya for not uh fasting for one day how many times of meal okay is it one time for one person or two times for one person okay i will answer your question inshaallah okay thank you you're welcome we have allah from saudi arabia welcome back after holiday we have to when praying for the disease we have to pray like this that to forgive to sorry sorry forgive them and also save them from the torment of the cover okay yeah yeah that's what i wanted to ask today i want to ask you every day sake i'm very happy that every day i'm about to i'm getting to ask you and here thank you it's my pleasure mustafa from nigeria says that it is is it permissible for a footballer or any athlete to not fast to skip a day of ramadan because he has a football match or a tournament etc the answer is no if he's residing this is totally prohibited so if i have a tournament in jeddah and i'm a squash player and i would like to play during the daytime and it's an important match maybe it is for the championship can i skip can i break my fast answer is no this is totally prohibited because this is not a necessity it's not traveling and it's not due to illness however if they travel to another country to play a tournament they are travelers and hence they can break their fasting if they wish because allah gave them their this permission yet some scholars analyze and say is this travel of theirs travel in permissible things or in sins so uh depends on how a scholar looks at it generally speaking if there is no sin involved and he's a traveler and he is making a living out of that and there's no haram being committed he has a permission to break his fast and allah knows best aras from uh kurdistan uh hello how are you i'm fine yeah uh thank you actually i've got a question um amulla in my city uh had a very strange qatar about the world football match like a brazil brazil world cup he said if you look at if you keep your eyes on the match on the game it's it just looks like a paganism it looks like you are you are worshiping a statue is it right is it possible okay yeah thank you you're welcome michelle okedoke um i mean from uh bahrain says is there anything as the salatu tawba or prayer of repentance the answer is yes the authentic hadith of the prophet islam that is whenever one of you sins and he performs a good evolution and prays to raka sincere for allah allah will forgive his sin so this is authentic and yes you can do that whenever you fall into sin as a a token or as an expression of your repentance to allah and then he asks about salatu sukran or shukur or whatever the prayer of gratitude or showing your thankfulness to allah what is the ruling uh on it and the answer is that there isn't any such prayer the prophet aristotle whenever he was given the glad tiding or he heard something that was very pleasant and surprising for him as a form of gratitude he would fall and prostrate and this is known as prostration of gratitude it is not accompanied by a prayer it's only prostration when you hear something that is not usually happening so if someone gives you your paycheck every month you don't fall and prostrate because this is something new but if you hear someone uh whom you love who had an operation was a serious one and then they told you mashallah it was a success and you fall and prostrate this is uh permissible insha allah we have um from saudi arabia actually while traveling if we are able to fast if the journey is easy like say four to six hours are we permitted to fast and uh secondly is there a reason of this program your program and uh thirdly does that i didn't wait wait wait i didn't get your second question your first question was this about uh fasting while traveling uh uh yes like if the traveling is easy like in india the journey is very easy four to six hours by plane and if i'm able to fast so is it okay if i fast and uh secondly is as a reason of this repeat of this program and thirdly uh the zakat to be given if for example if there is a gold i have to give zakat on and the the due date is before ramadan for uh gold and the due date for some other uh property of mine will be after ramadan or maybe on the zil hijab so can i give the zakat together before the due date or uh should i wait for different properties uh for their due date to be over okay i will answer your question inshallah mohammed from kurdistan we pay usually that's how we do the zakat of support we pay money instead of the food so i'm preaching is that permissible okay from saudi arabia she says that what is the ruling on asking for al-wasil through the prophet alaihissalatusam so invoking allah azzawajal through the prophet alaihis salam and she has uh talked to some innovators uh some of the deviant sects and they said that this is what adam said peace be upon him and the hadith where adam peace be upon him said oh allah i asked who by the wasilla of muhammad alayhi salaam and allah told how do you know about the wasilla of muhammad and he said that because i thought i saw on the uh pillars of your throne written rasulullah so i i knew that he had uh this was he with you so i asked you through him so allah forgave him this is all nonsense this is not authentic the hadith is not authentic and one should not apply it because it was the slightest uh uh something that we can do the prophet saw would have directed us directly in the bukhari in muslim in the books of hadith in authentic hadith but it is not there and it is innovation to ask allah azza through the prophet no one can be asked you cannot ask allah through anyone you only ask allah the almighty we have muhammad from saudi or okay and my second question is uh uh like um for us during ramadan the days which we cannot read our salah can we read the quran from the from our laptops or from the ipad can we recite them through it okay i will answer your question inshallah okay thank you so much ramadan i cannot hear you maharov can you speak claudia a little bit please okay have you found this see the mood for the process ramadan okay i can have a bit of fighting about that or you cannot give up with the first about that because we have a lot of problems about it sometimes they say we are a different time we cannot be able to fight in the salvation mode or we have to fear ourselves we don't know exactly what we need to do we have a lot of problem about that that's corruption i question marouf i understand any question any more questions or this is the only question okay i will answer you inshallah we have amber from saudi arabia uh sheikha i have two questions okay um the first question is about uh salat al-harjit um i asked you before also you said uh it's not allowed we cannot like if we um want to ask allah something you we cannot make salat alhajit correct um um i want to know some more uh i mean um explanation on it like on the nawaz how important print are like uh can i just offer navafuls for like now you said shukran also we cannot do what kind of waffle prayers can we offer okay and uh second question um regarding surah kahf can i is it a watchup to recite it on a friday and like surah mulk i hear prophet used to recite it before um sleep should be recited before sleep like that okay like are there recommended times for these surahs or we can just recite quran or i will answer inshallah thank you so much you're welcome ali from emirates yes yes yes i have a question yes um if what can i follow the imam if i yeah i will uh pray for isha then they're already praying for um do i have to follow the i have a remaining rakaat do i have to follow their next uh uh so do you tell me that you missed isha prayer totally yes yeah yeah so you want to join the imam in tarawih by praying isha for yourself and when he offers salam you continue your third and fourth rakah yeah i will answer your question we have fatima from nigeria because you have to answer the question yes fatima um i'm actually concerning excellent people from allah can you ask because of the love he has from prophet muhammad okay you want to ask allah azzawajal uh through through the love of the prophet yes okay i will answer you it's one question yes during a prayer is what is not allowed to tell him to laugh when he sneezes while praying i think we will stop receiving calls let me answer the questions uh kubra second question she says how many meals do we give when paying an expiation for someone who did not fast ramadan for example due to chronic illness or old age so when we feed a poor person how many meals one meal only and this is a half asar which is approximately 1.125 which is approximately uh 1.125 grams of rice so this is a half asar and allah from saudi arabia can we supplicate to the disease by saying oh allah forgive them and save them from the torment of the grave you can ask allah anything for the deceased you can say allah forgive them allah mercy for them allah expand their graves until it is as far as they can see make it a garden of jannah you can say whatever you want for them aras from kurdistan says that someone told him that watching a football match and staring at the tv screen is like worshiping or looking at an idol and this is baseless now i'm not recommending to watch it i did not watch even a single match with the pr grace of allah azzawajal and i hate football by the way but this is not non excuse it is something that is permissible not recommended but it's permissible providing that there is no haram involved so if there is no haram involved and the haram the list is you know the sky's the limit that includes chair leaders includes music it includes looking at crosses and and not paying any attention so you could find someone waiting across and you don't even feel bad about it you find people fully tattooed from head to toe and you feel there's a kafir it's okay no it's not okay for you to look at them and approve of this this is not permissible but in general cases if you just watch it without these haram stuff this is permissible um from saudi arabia she says that fasting while a short journey of four or five or six hours and it doesn't make us weary or tired is this okay yes definitely this is permissible and she's asking about the reruns of this program i have no idea believe it or not i did not even see one single show since since the beginning of ramadan there's no time uh and uh yeah i mean you maybe if you watch the adverts and in the beginning in the end maybe they will tell you uh i have no idea about the reruns um yeah zakat before it's time so she has property and she has money does the cat of the property is in the hijab the zakat of the gold or the money is in ramadan can she give the zakat of the hija three months earlier with ramadan the answer is yes preceding it or giving it ahead of time is okay delaying it is not okay muhammad from kurdistan he says we have a custom that we give money instead of uh food in the cattle future and this is the hanafi madhhab they say it's okay and the majority of scholars said that it is not okay the prophet alison instructed us to give the cattle footer in food though they had dirham and dinar yet the prophet haslam only specified food so we must pay food it is like when someone says that in adha we have to slaughter a camel cow or sheep someone says i have a farm of chicken i'm going to slaughter a thousand chicken this is not permissible this is not what allah told us to give uh muhammad from saudi arabia she says tarawih is it true the answer is yes the prophet prayed with his companions taraweeh for three or four nights and then he refrained because he was afraid that allah would obligate it upon the ummah and he didn't want to burden them after he died the fear of being obligated has gone because it cannot be obligated except through the prophet isaiah so it went back again and this is the sunnah of and right guidedly can a woman in her menses recite the quran through her pda ipad laptop et cetera the answer is yes she can uh fully do that maroof from gambia says we have a problem every time we begin the month of ramadan do we begin with saudi do we begin with egypt or whatever in gambia look at the muslim body who is the organization that runs the muslim affairs and people go for them for fatwa and for questioning and for answers and for islamic rulings they are the one who dedicate and decide when ramadan begins and when ramadan ends and you have to follow them uh amber says salat is not authentic so what are the nafil prayers that we can offer you can offer as many novel prayer in the permissible times other than after us after fajr and five minutes before other than that you can pray thousands of of raka's with without any problem and this is called nafl you can do that surat al-kaf friday it's an issue of dispute the majority say it is part of the sunnah surat al-mulk before sleeping yes this is a prescribed sunnah it saves you from the tournament of the gov of the grave also surat as well it is a sunnah to reside before sleeping ali from the emirates says that uh if i miss a prayer and i come to the masjid and i find that the imam is praying the two raqqa of tarawih the first two rakaas so can i join him intending to pray isha and when he finishes the two raka's and offers salam i stand up and pray the third and the fourth missed rakaas of isha of mind the answer is yes this is what you must do you should not join another congregation you should only join the imam fatima from nigeria says that can we ask allah azzawajal through our love to the prophet saw the answer is yes asking allah through your good deeds is permissible it is acceptable so if i say o allah i ask you through my loving to reciting the quran or through my helping to this poor man or through my not doing fornication this is totally permissible and acceptable and one of the great deeds is our love to the prophet so you say oh allah through my love to your prophet islam do this and that for me this has been permissible uh saying alhamdulillah through or during salah this is not prescribed except when you are supposed to say this when he says this is not prescribed and it's an innovation this is all the time we have until we meet next time i leave you always tonight with family around the nice meal we're making the one i feel how nice it is to be so neat to those i love whenever we think of ramadan all the good things that we need to do and plan it's not always easy but we'll do the best we can"
