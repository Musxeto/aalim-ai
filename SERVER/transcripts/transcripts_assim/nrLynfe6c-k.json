  "transcript": "Suppose there is a sheep which looks beautiful but it has cracks in its horn. It has wound mark on its body which has healed but has scars. It has one tooth broken and slitted ears. Can I buy it for sacrifice? Also please specify what should I, what should we look into? You are entitled for one question only Suleiha. The answer is these defects that you've mentioned are not something that renders your sacrifice invalid and hence yes you can buy it for Qurbani but it is not the best. You should look for something better but if you do it is fine and valid Inshallah."
