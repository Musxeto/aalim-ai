  "transcript": "foreign I have attended iftar Gatherings um that have a separation between the men and the woman uh recently um I've been invited to an f-star that has been specifically advertised to host single Muslims in the community so I know the host through a premarital course that I took so from your past videos I have learned how it's not advisable to attend marital events and how people have used different ways to make it halal so is it okay for me to just go when I'm strongly intended to just break my fast hang with the brothers for a couple of minutes and then leave for Isha soon provided that there is a separation between the men and the woman and I'm only there to break my fault fast and enjoy good food without any other ulterior motives so do I understand that the men and women will not be dating or having interviews during that event yes no I mean it's just for breaking the fast and I mean I'm also a reserved person I only keep with the brothers so there's going to be a separation yeah this seems this seems to be permissible there's no problem in that inshallah exactly"
