  "transcript": "suale from India shum sh my question is that sh I was in a relationship with a girl she's from Pakistan I'm from India we tried to convince our parents for the marriage her parents agreed uh to this but my parents uh resisted because of the political issues so her parents you know they were ready for me settling in Dubai and Maring there but my mother after hearing this She fainted a few times and she didn't want me to leave leave her so at the end the girl got married a few days back sh I had promised her that I would marry her but since I couldn't keep the promise am I sinful for not keeping the promise and will Allah you know hel me accountable on the day of judgment because of this sin or I did the right thing for being my mother okay first of all you are sinful for communicating with the this woman in the first place let alone your promises and the rest how do you communicate with an UNAM girl like this and having premarital relationship even if it's platonic as they say by phone or messages and no contact it's still Haram so this is the main issue that you have to repent and ask Allah for forgiveness as for your promise no you're not sinful for that because such a promise is not binding if she was proposed to by someone who's far richer and more handsome and more religious than you she would have chosen him in a heartbeat which she actually did so don't engage yourself with trivial issues which Shan is messing up with your head and leave the core of the issue which is your lifestyle and how you were engaged in a Haram relationship that was uh not permissible for you in the first place and this form of misjudgment and the way of failing to weigh the gravity of matters at hand a lot of the Muslims fall into they tend to think of trivial things and ignore the major things like those in Haj season who came to abdah from irq asking him about the ruling of the blood of a mosquito on the hand of aim someone is in the state in and he kills a mosquito andar said to his followers look at these people they killed Al Hussein Ali may Allah be pleased with him and with his father the grandson of the prophet Alam and shed his blood and now they're asking about the blood of a mosquito for a or that person who came to the Sheikh asking him about the ruling on aborting his child out of wedlock so his girlfriend is pregnant and he wants to abort the pregnancy and the Sheik says Subhan Allah a Haram relationship and you fall into it and you impreg impregnate the the the girlfriend why didn't you use a condom or contraceptives and the man says because they told me it's Haram Subhan Allah using condoms is Haram but falling into Zena and making her pregnant is halal so this form of imbalance in measuring issues like this a lot of the Muslims fall into may Allah protect us all we have a short"
