or the by the Ric he says or by the things that go in his heart and and among the greatest forms of worship that we do with our hearts is what is known as it is depending on Allah Allah the almighty says in the Quran and to Allah belongs the the Unseen of the heavens and the Earth and to him return all Affairs so worship him and put your trust in him your belief is not complete without completing a Allah the almighty says and put your trust in Allah if you are believers indeed which means that if you do not have full trust and Reliance on Allah then you are not not a True Believer and the Beautiful word we usually say a lot of us may say it without understanding the meaning of it of it a lot of us would say it when someone does wrong to you and you say and thinking that this is a supplication against someone else and it is not it is the beautiful word that ibraim peace be upon him said when the pagans threw him in fire it was narrated that jel the Archangel came to him and said do you have anything from me do you want anything from me and he's about to be thrown in this fire that burns everything dead or life and ibraim said from you I need nothing all what I need is from Allah and he said when they threw him in the and Allah instructed the thing that naturally would burned and kill to become cold not only that and peaceful because if Allah said become cold he would have frozen to death Allah said be cold but at the same time peaceful to ibraim and he stay there for a couple of days and the people thought that he was gone forever it's the same word that the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam said after the battle of when 70 of his close companions were martyred when he himself sallallahu alaih wasallam was injured and one of his tooth broken and he was bleeding someone came and said that the pagans thought that they did not do enough harm to you they're coming back to annihilate the whole Muslim um this did not throw any fear in his heart nor in the hearts of his companions because they had full Reliance on Allah what did they say Allah alone is sufficient for us and he is the best disposer of Affairs he is whom we have our full trust and Reliance this is what a True Believer believes not only say and to have actually you have to truthfully rely on Allah on attaining the benefits and preventing the harm from reaching reaching you not only in this life also on the day of judgment where it is needed most Allah the almighty says in the Quran and whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to him he will make a way for him to get out Subhan Allah any Calamity you're in any distress any tribulation that you go through Allah tells you Allah promises you if you have an utumn weight of belief in your heart Allah tells you that he will make a way out for you not only that he will Pro divide him from sources he never could imagine you have your monthly allowance you have your benefits you have your salary still you're in need Allah will provide you from sources you could never had imagined not only that Allah Almighty says and whosoever puts his trust in Allah then he will suffice him always in times of trouble put your trust in Allah do what Allah wants you to do and Allah will suffice you w no one on earth can cure your illness no one on earth can pay off your debt no one on earth can make you happy except Allah put your trust in him and he has everything in his hands and that is why some of the salaf used to say it has been decreed Allah mandated upon himself that whom soever relies on him Allah would suffice him and whoever believes in him Allah would guide him and whomsoever lends Allah subhanahu wa taala the ever Rich if you lend Allah does Allah need you does what you have belong to you it's Allah's but Allah is asking you Allah is telling you if you lend Allah if you pay for the means of charity Allah the almighty will make you rich and whoever trusts Allah Allah would save him and whoever calls Allah if you call Allah don't call others don't call aah don't call the prophet in the middle of the night when everybody's asleep raise your hands and say Allah he will answer your call you have to believe in him and whenever you recite the Quran and you will find a lot of verses encouraging us instructing us to have on Allah and also if you go through theith of the Prophet you will find a lot of hadiths determining that this is one of the essence of our religion to depend to R to have on Allah the prophet told his companions once that there will be 70,000 and I pray to Allah that he makes me and you among them there will be 70,000 of the umah of the Prophet who will enter Paradise without any accountability or punish punishment so all what you have to do is be resurrected and you'll go to paradise so the companions differed among themselves who are they are they the ones that were born in Islam are they the ones who were martyred are they this and that and the prophet came out again and and heard them disputing and he said they are those who do not catch your eyes and this is a form of medication in Arabia maybe it's here when certain illnesses are difficult to be cured they bring a piece of metal and they heat it until it's red and then they put it on certain areas of the body and this is one of the forms of medication in Islam but the prophet does not recommend it and he did not like it because it included forms of torture but it is an approved way of medication yet those who avoid this though it's an illness it has to be cured but the prophet says among the 70,000 their characteristic is that they do not catch your eyes and they do not ask others for R they don't go to people to righteous people and say give R to me I have a Jin I'm possessed I have an evil eye I have black magic give R to me because this shows that the Reliance though it's permissible yet their Reliance is not on Allah it's on that individual because I believe that he is the only one with the grace of Allah who can cure me and this is wrong A True Believer who relies on Allah does not go even that way the prophet also saysat and those who do not believe in bad Omens so if I'm going to the university in the morning and there's a c accident in front of me I would not go back and say today is a bad day it's not my day I'm not going something bad something evil is going to happen to me they do not believe in bad Omens the prophet also concludes this and says and they have their full trust in Allah and how would we achieve this beautiful level of worshiping Allah and having our full Trust on him you have to do two things you have to connect your heart to Allah and you have to follow the steps that Allah had made permissible for you to do so if you depend and rely on Allah without doing the necessary means you are insane if someone sits home and says oh Allah grant me children offspring of my own and he's not married and he's not doing the means to do so he's insane if he sits and says oh Allah prepare a good meal for me then he is insane unless he goes to the kitchen and Cooks likewise those who depend entirely on the means and neglect Allah so they say no I'm not going to ask Allah to do anything for me I'm not going to depend on Allah on anything I'm going to do it myself it is I who do things this would be considered shik and a form of blasphemy because you're not depending on Allah you're depending on someone else and even if that person was you Shan has managed to fool a number of the Muslims groups of Muslims who depend so they claim on Allah so you'll find them in masjids not working not being active not benefiting themselves nor their communities and whenever you tell them brother you have to work you have to do something no no I have a full trust in Allah I am I have the on Allah and if I work this means that I do not trust Allah the prophet saidat if you put your trust in Allah in the true sense he will grant you provisions and how is that he says as he grants to the birds who go out in the morning hungry and come back full the birds don't have degrees in University they don't have physical capability above us yet they go out they look for food Allah grants them they come back full so in this Hadith the prophet is telling us if you want Allah to Grant you you have to have full trust and on Allah and this does not come without you going out of your home to work and to bring food and put it on the table and this is why you will find always in the Quran and the Sunnah a lot of examples on this depend on Allah but you have to do some work you know maram peace be upon her the guardian of maram was Zakaria every time Zakaria would enter the which is a place designated for worship in in the old uh Nations every time he entered the m to bring her food he would find a lot of food that he did not bring and he was only one allowed in where did you get this from she said from Allah when she was healthy when she was capable when she was young food came to her without her asking or doing anything but when she got pregnant with Jesus peace be upon him when she was weak and vulnerable Allah told told her to shake the trunk of the palm tree so that dates would fall upon you and you would eat from it Subhan Allah now she's needy Allah is telling her telling her work and if anyone of you strong people would go and get hold of the trunk of a palm tree if 10 of us tried to shake it it would not Shake yet this pregnant poor woman Allah tells her that listen you have to work though I can give you dates without you working but this is to show us that Allah wants us to work likewise MSA peace be upon him with fleeing pharaoh and the enemies he reaches the sea if Allah wanted it it would have split open he would could have walked no Allah tells him strike it with your stick strike it with this pole you have in your hand and Subhan Allah it opens if Allah wanted it it could have happened without him doing this all of this is to show us that we must do things in order to have full Reliance and on Allah our Prophet himself on the Battle of bad 300 plus men against 1,000 fully armed men it is not fair and they have no choice no chance yet the prophet takes a handful of dust and he throws it in the face of the army and says and Allah tells him in the Quran it was not you who threw when you threw that it is Allah who threw it Allah could have blinded them with with with his grace without the prophet throwing anything yet Allah wants his Prophet to have a say in it and to follow the proper means while having the full concentration and the full Reliance and Trust in Allah ald people nowadays and when I say people we should look into our eles don't look at the one sitting next to you because Allah will only question you about your own Deeds so we have split it into a number of Divisions some of the Muslims as stated earlier depend on Allah so they claim without doing the necessary means that Allah instructed us to do and this is not logical and this is not part of the Sunnah when the prophet was in an Expedition once half of the Expedition were fasting the other were not so at the middle of the day those who were fasting were completely exhausted so those who did not fast they're traveling they're allowed not to fast they started to serve them to bring them uh uh their needs to erect the tents and so on and the prophet looked at them and said those who did not fast took all the reward because they are serving those who did which means that you have to do things in Islam in order for you to get rewarded and on the opposite side you'll find Muslims that do not rely on Allah some of them even refuses to supplicate to Allah I have a business transaction tomorrow I need Allah to help me complete it yet I will not supplicate to Allah why say I'm I'm relying on myself and most of the Muslims are like this most of the Muslims rely on their ability not on Allah so many times in business meetings when I go I find Muslim Brothers some of them practicing brothers when they make a presentation they say when uh I managed last year in the third quarter to achieve the Target and I exceeded that and I did so so and so and my plans were so and so and he attributes all the success to his own knowledge and ability and this is part of the shik I Abbas may Allah be pleased with him the cousin of the Prophet Alat told us about a scenario when a person at night a burglar came to break in but the duck that bird that belongs to his neighbor quacked I don't know if the verb is right or not but the bird quacked so the burglar felt afraid and ran way Abbas says whoever says in the morning if it were not for the my neighbor's duck the burglar would have broke in he committed shik because he attributed this to the duck rather than saying it's the grace of Allah it's the blessing of Allah everything you enjoy at the moment it is from Allah your health your wealth every single thing every single favor and blessing it is from Allah if you attribute it to someone else you are committing an act of sh therefore those who say no we depend on ourselves we're not going to call Allah we're not going to make any Dua we not we're not going to have any they are not proper Muslims and unfortunately a lot of us are like this the prophet himself when he fought he had full trust and Reliance on Allah is that true nobody doubts doubts this yet he fought in his armor he didn't go without any Shields or armor and said I'm going to rely on Allah Allah is going to protect me when he migrated from mecah to Medina he didn't have any GPS's he took a guide who was a mushk to guide him to Medina and he didn't say no I'm going to go and inshallah Allah will guide me so this is the true and Trust in Allah the almighty and this is what we most our trust in Allah look at our lives what do we focus most on on things that are important but they are not only Islam we focus on growing the beard and this is of course for the gents not for the sisters and the sisters focus on the hijab and this is good we focus on having short THS and not exceeding the ankles and this is good because this is SA you from Hell Fire and that is it and some of us and the good ones of us may Focus entirely on prayer in the Masid and this is also part a great part of Islam but is it only Islam without relying on Allah without everything would be in vain even if you pray if you have a long beard and you wear the hijab and everything mallah looks perfect without the full Reliance on Allah without believing that Allah is our creator and our provider without believing that Allah is the giver of life and death without believing that Allah is the causer of harm and the bringer of benefit no one can do this except Allah without believing that Allah is the honorer who honors people and is the humiliator who humiliates whom he wishes subhana wa tala without believing that Allah is the one who brings people down and he is the one who exalts them when he wishes without believing that Allah is the giver and he's the Constructor the one the one that gives and the one that prevents subhah wa ta'ala without this you cannot be a true believing Muslim because once you have this once you know Allah once you believe in him and trust him only then you would have performed the true and complete onel and this would Cascade this would show on your Deeds if you have full on Allah you will not find one single Muslim cheating in exams do Muslims cheat in exams big time if you have full on Allah you would not find anyone lying to get benefits from the government do they do this a lot if you have full Reliance and on Allah your your heart would not be begging people for money your heart would not looking for a position in that company through that person you would have full Reliance on Allah if it comes it comes and that is why he was asked how do you have full he said I only realized that my provision that my risk no one else can share it with me is that true Allah is the giver and the provider can anyone take something that Allah had written to me no so I went and rested because I know that only me can take what Allah has given and therefore nobody else can do this if we have full Reliance on Allah you would not find Muslims I don't know about here I'm talking about Saudi Arabia you would not find Muslims coming and knocking the doors of every sheh or IM Masid asking him to give R she my son is possessed my wife has black magic I I have an evil eye I was kicked off my job sh sh why don't you go to the source what don't you raise your hands in humility in submissiveness in showing and expressing your poverty to the king of the Kings to the lord of the Lords if you do this Allah will answer you but you have to go to him he promised us that if you go to him if you call him he will answer you and if you rely on him he he would suffice you nowadays we depend on our knowledge you depend on your tongue and the power of convincing you depend on your money someone else depends on his health or strength or position or nationality or origin or tribe all of these will be in loss the only True Believer and the only successful among them all is the one who depends entirely on Allah the Almighty I seek Allah's guidance and help that we all become among the M upon Him subhah waala Allah grant us the the true on you and make our hearts connected with you Allah grant us the Halal means to have a successful life in this life and on the hereafter for"
