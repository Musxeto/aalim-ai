  "transcript": "andreshmika says my sister does Russell sometimes three days after she's done with her period out of laziness then she takes it and prays she feels guilty about it but due to her low Iman she is reckless does this Behavior take her out of the fold of Islam and does she need to make up the prayers she was supposed to pray right after her period ended first of all it is a major sin one of the major sins to delay or to postpone a prayer from her from its time so if you skip a prayer until the time is over you've committed a major sin according to the vast majority of Scholars a group of Scholars said that doing this deliberately takes you out of the fold of Islam for one prayer but the vast majority of Muslims say you've committed a major sin for your sister to abandon Salat for three days just out of laziness she is in severely great Danger and whether she left the fold of Islam or not as I said earlier is an issue of dispute among Scholars one should not mess up with such issues one should fear Allah azzawajal and acknowledge that the first thing the people of Hell answer when the people of Jannah of paradise ask them why are you in hell the first reason they give is we were not among the worshipers we did not pray so to postpone a prayer and then feel guilty well that's good for you if you are sincere in your remorse not just shrugging your shoulders and moving on with your life as if nothing had happened the question is should she make up for the prayers missed in these three days the answer is no and even if she praised them a thousand times Allah will not accept it from her because each prayer is prescribed to a specific time has a beginning and end you can't pray it before the time and you also cannot pray it after the time has ended so she cannot offer them back and may Allah have mercy upon us all"
