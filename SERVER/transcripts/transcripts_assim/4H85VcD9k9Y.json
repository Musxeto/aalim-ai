  "transcript": "I wanted to ask what's the ruling on a woman who doesn't want to get married for married for no legitimate reason she is going against the Sunnah and she is the one who will regret this when she's maybe 35 years old or more and there are so many unmarried women is she sinful it depends if she has no desire to be married no natural inclination to be fulfilled and there is no FNA or Temptation upon her no she's not sinful but this is not natural nor normal and I know a lot of women who are dying to get married and are unable to do so some of them because they've raised the bar so high until they are too late they're in their 60s now before they said no he has to be my age no he has to be in the same level of my financial uh status and social status then they said okay he has to be with five 10 six years difference he has to be handsome he has to be this when they reach 35 and 40 years of age those proposing are 10 or 15 years older and they still were defiant when they're 50 years of age those proposing are in their 70s not looking for a wife rather for a nurse to take care of them and still they're defiant now they're willing to marry anything but the demand is far far less than the supply who would marry someone this old when they can get a 17 or 18 years old young and beautiful and healthy woman demand and Supply it's the same thing with men and women don't think it's only favoring uh men over women no it's the same thing demand and Supply but the demand over women is far less than the demand over men and Allah Knows Best"
