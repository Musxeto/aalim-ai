  "transcript": "she uh do Arabs come from Jews and if yes then is it from the story of ha and is if yes then please for me just that I did not understand your question do Arabs what come from Jews okay and what's the second question uh if yes then is it from the story of haar and is if yes then please Nar for me just that part okay you asked many questions then we only answer one but for the benefit of the doubt Arabs are definitely not from the Jews and the Jews are not from the Arabs ibraim peace be upon him had two sons he had is whose mother was hajar and who was born in Mecca in the Arabian Peninsula and he had ishak whose mother was Sarah from ishak there was yob Jacob who's also a prophet and from Jacob was YF and from the descendants of ishak or Isaac were the sons of Israel the Jews as for Isel peace be upon him who was a messenger and a prophet his descendants were the Arabs and among them was our Prophet Muhammad sallallah alai wasallam so they are cousins but not uh from one another they are different uh branches so anyone who says anti-Semitism when he attacks the Arabs he's anti-semitic as well when he attacks the Jews because they are from the same root which is ibraim peace be upon Him is not ha hij is has nothing to do with the Jews at all because the Jews had nothing to do with Mecca so your question is irrelevant and Allah Knows Best"
