  "transcript": "Tahmina from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Okay, so my question is about menses. So I normally have normal menses but the past three months it's been a bit off. The first month I didn't have one. The second month I had what I thought was my menses but it was very light. And I watched a few hours about menses on YouTube and I found out you wouldn't actually consider that as menses. But it lasted eight days, eight, nine days and my period is normally eight days long. And this month I started my menses but at Isha time it will come up to 15 days. And I read on Islam Q&A if it goes over 15 days then you just take the days that you would normally be on your menses for. So for eight days and then you have to make up the rest of the days. So from the eighth day to the 15th day I have to make it up. So that's my question. Do I have to make that up if I go over the 15 days? And the time where I thought I was on my period but what I learned is actually spotting because it doesn't come under menses the way it was. Do I have to make them nine days up as well? As for the second month and if you did not see the flow of the blood and it was only spotting, no you don't have to make up for these days because you should not have stopped praying. And I hope I understood you correctly and you did not stop praying and you continue to pray which is the right thing to do. As for the third month, due to the fact that the bleeding, the flow of blood continued without you seeing your purity till you've reached 15 days, the answer is no, you don't have to make up from day 8 till day 15 because you thought that this was your menses. After completing 15 days now it is obvious to you it is istihada so you don't have to make them up and you simply take your ghusl and start to pray until you see your purity and then you know the time of the month where you get your menses and you should consider that to be your menses if the bleeding continues all that time and Allah knows best."
