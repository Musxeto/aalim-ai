  "transcript": "we go to the next question from the WhatsApp assalamu alikum Dr nikum Naas an officer at an NGO in Daka Bangladesh I recently been doubting Allah and need your help according to the Big Bang Theory the universe came to being from a hot dense Point called initial singularity some scientists say before that it always existed how did initial Singularity come to being did Allah create it if so what was Allah doing before that what existed before initial Singularity please help me out this question is making me struggle with faith I wish to return to Islam this brother noas from Bangladesh from Daka seems to be in turmoil and he's saying he's struggling with his faith and he's saying that today scientists have found out about initial Singularity and this is Hot D Spot from where we had the big bang and who created this is it Allah and if Allah created what was he doing before that brother let me be very clear to you that if you're a student of science I don't know whether you are or not you should understand the difference between a scientific fact and theories Big Bang today has been considered to Big Bang Theory it started as a theory but there are so many proofs that have come that today Big Bang Theory is considered to be as a fact and Allah says this in the Quran inia chapter number 21 verse number 30 do not the unbeliever see that the heavens and the Earth were joined together that we clothe them as under they were joined together and we clothe them as under so this part about the Big Bang today science has established especially the discovery by Steven Hawkins that the universe is expanding as is mentioned in Surah Dar CH 5 verse number 47 that we have created the vastness most the vastness of space and various evidence about relativity and various things now regarding big bang the Big Bang has been established there are various scientists are trying to what was there before big bang and at present all of these are hypothesis one of them is singularity initial singularity in Singularity there are various different types of Singularity there's initial Singularity there is singularity expanding there is black hole different types besides Singularity there are other things some people are talking about Loop Quantum Loop quantum gravity talking about M Theory there are various theories so I'm asking you you as a Muslim why are you so much bothered H says that the Heaven and the Earth were joined together we CL them aund science has proved it Kal now why why are you so much bother what is there before Big Bang Allah doesn't have to mention everything in the Quran neither is the initial Singularity proof to be correct it is a hypothesis then there is singularity of expansion okay now this The Singularity is expanding and it's proved by the expanding universe so I'm baffled that you are a Muslim and you're doubting because you read something about initial Singularity I doubt whether student of sence and why should you st doubting Allah because you read about this initial Singularity nothing but hypothesis and tomorrow even the initial Singularity says that there is mass that is energy it's created so Allah created it yes who else can create it so what's the problem okay if Allah created what was Allah doing before that absurd it's absurd question anything you what was before what was that what I'll ask you what were you doing before so these questions are all absurd and waste of time so I'm shocked that when there's so much of knowledge in the Quran Quran is the only book which has got so many scientific facts and it spoke about when the science hadn't discovered it hasn't established it and not a single false now you're talking about something which sence hasn't established so you're wasting your time brother and unnecessary you see you're saying that your faith is at turmoil what faith is at turmoil anyone if you hear my talk on is the Quran God's word here my talk on Quran modern science and you hear it with a common sense a normal sense inshallah your faith has to increase if you're a student of science you should have more faith you're talking about hypothesis and based on hypothesis you saying your faith has gone what do this go to do and Quran is not a book of science as I told you so please brother concentrate on the Quran know the difference between a scientific fact and a hypothesis and every scientific fact is not mentioned in the Quran as I mentioned earlier so you'll ask me tomorrow where does the Quran says 2+ 2 is equal to 4 no does the Quran say 2 plus equal to 4 so just because Quran doesn't say 2+ 2 is equal to 4 does it mean not the word of God it's absurd does Quran have to speak about everything no what you have to realize that there's nothing in the Quran which is against scientific fact and Allah subhana wa ta'ala he's our creator he is the creator of the whole universe the scientist may know or may not know so Allah subhah wa ta'ala is the create everything in the universe is dependent of him and he's independent of anything and everything hope this clarifies your misconception"
