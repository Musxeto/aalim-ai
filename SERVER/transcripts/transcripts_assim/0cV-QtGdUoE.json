  "transcript": "shake so actually uh I've been diagnosed with a problem health problem and there is no cure for it the doctor said there's no cure and it's actually affecting my life and actually know I make lot of Dua and and uh like you know after I make Dua like you know things are getting more worse and I'm not able to take care of my family and all so like and I get questions like is Allah punishing me or is it because of my earlier sins that I committed so in this case like what can I do and then like I get really depressed sometimes I get suicidal thoughts and all first of all first of all Zan when you ask yourself is Allah punishing me because of my previous sins now what are the possibilities for your question number one yes he is number two no he isn't either way what can you do nothing my previous sins I've repented from them I've quited them I have deep remorse and I'm asking Allah for forgiveness so if Allah is punishing me there's nothing I can do the second option if Allah is not punishing me rather Allah is testing me Allah is elevating my status in Paradise by cleansing me from sins and adding more more Good Deeds to me what can I do nothing what you're suffering from is something that Allah has predestined 50,000 years before he created the universe so it is already written 50,000 years before Allah created the universe gazillion years ago that you will fall sick what the doctors say is a total complete lie because if I have the doctors in one hand saying to me there's no cure for your illness and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam himself saying to me oh Servants of Allah seek healing and medicine for your illnesses for Allah has not created an illness without creating an a cure for it but some may know it some may not so I believe in what the Prophet saidham that there is a cure you have to look further and among the best forms of cure is the r when the night is the darkest this is an indication that the morning is just around the corner and the break of dawn is soon to come up when everything is hopeless and the doors are all closed you have only one door open and that is Allah's door do a lot of Dua do as prescribed in my website and my YouTube channels very easy very convenient you can do it for yourself however your heart has to be connected to Allah knowing that he's your Lord he's your owner he's the fa facilitator he's the provider he's the sustainer he's The Giver of life and death he's the one who's self-sufficient and he does not need you you need him so you make R you make Dua you express your poverty and humility to him seeking his Mercy not demanding it not saying what is this I've been calling and making Dua for six years and nothing happened things are becoming worse I'm getting suicidal why is Allah doing this hey wait wait hold your horses you have no proper no no I know this is theoretical you don't have the actual meaning of these three beautiful branches of in your heart which means that you have to empty your heart and fill it with the love Allah fill it with the content fill it with the tolerance and patience whatever is happening accepting that Allah has divine finally written that long time ago and whatever Allah pre-ordained will happen so you have no other choice but to embrace it and to be content and to make a lot of Dua and and that Allah uplifts it if he does it's a win-win if he doesn't you will die whether now in five years time in 50 years time you'll die but you will end up in Paradise for eternity knowing that all the Dua all the tests all the patience that you've expressed is now paying off may Allah make things easy for all of us"
