  "transcript": "from spain the issue of having ria what is ria ria is showing off it's a feeling that you get or sometimes you do it on purpose so that people would say good things about you so i usually pray the sunna in a minute and a half but if my boss comes if my uncle comes if my spouse or someone whom i would like to impress comes in i prolong it into five minutes now what is my intention for the sake of allah no to impress people this is riya and this invalidates the good deeds now shaytaan has used this as a key to infiltrate people's thinking so whenever they're sincere and doing something for the sake of allah he comes and say maybe you're doing this to impress people maybe you're getting close to the one next to you to impress him and actually nobody does this nobody gets his foot next to someone's else foot to impress rather to annoy maybe yes this is a sunnah but nobody does it to impress people so shaytan tried to mess up with your head you're opening the door for him maybe should be thrown in the dustbin because it's doubt so i can open doors and doors of doubt maybe abdullah from spain who is married maybe your marriage is not correct maybe your children are born out of wedlock maybe you were born out of wedlock because your mom and dad were boyfriend girlfriend and they did not conceive you un before marriage maybe they conceived you before marriage you never know this is nonsense we cannot base our lives and our religion on maybe this is why it's one of the most important legal maxims in islam one of the most important ruling major ruling which is certainty is not affected or impacted by doubt certainty is not affected by doubt is not removed by doubt it's removed by other certainties so whenever you get these feelings in salah ignore them ditch them and throw them in the dustbin"
