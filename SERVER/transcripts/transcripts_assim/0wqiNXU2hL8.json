  "transcript": "we know that smiling is a sunah so what is wrong with a woman smiling at a man doesn't my Nia count now not everything in Shar has a specific evidence from the Quran the Sunnah and this is why Allah asael says in the Quran you may ask the people of knowledge if you do not know so so many things that are not mentioned in the Quran and Sunnah yet Scholars with their knowledge and with what Allah has granted them with can obtain the ruling from various evidences from the Quran and from the Sunnah as well logically speaking when a woman Smiles at a man what is this no one doubts even the disbelievers themselves they would say that's an invitation so it is an invitation when she smiles at a man regardless of her age regardless of uh uh her her uh Beauty regardless of her social status whether married or single if you look at the vast majority of evidences in the Quran and the sunah you will find that this religion is based on segregation between men and women to the extent that clear evidences in the Quran that prohibits women from revealing their Beauty it obliges them to wear the hijab as in verse 59 chapter 33 alab so this is a clear indication also in the Sunnah the prophet saysat the worst raw the worst line in the Masid of men is the last and the worst line or raw of women in the mid is the first so these are the worst the further they are from one another is best and in the Sunnah the prophet tells usat a woman who leaves her home wearing her perfume and nah men find the scent of her perfume she's like an [Music] adultress it is not permissible for a man to touch a n woman and to be stabbed in the head with a needle of iron is better than to touch a woman that is not Halal for him in the Quran Allah tells us that women must not walk and make a sound with their anklets so that that would not attract men's hearing an anklet so if all of these combined and among other evidences they all indicate that Islam's promotes and endorses the segregation between men and women for the benefit of men and women so after all of this no one in his right mind would say what's wrong in me smiling in a man's face this is a clear invitation and this defies the purpose of hijab and Allah Asel Knows Best"
