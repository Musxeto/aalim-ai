  "title": "Doing good deeds out of fear of people kufr or shirk (riya) | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "sunders says if someone does good deeds out of the fear of people and he has the thought what would people think about me if I don't do it is this Co for now a lot of the brothers and sisters send me tens of questions every single day doubting what is go for doubting what is shared to the extent that people ask I wouldn't say silly questions but questions that are silly so someone says share if I eat with a fork instead of a spoon and I smile inside of myself I don't show it to people would this be considered hypocrisy or covered because I'm walking the NEMA and the blessing of allah azza wajal what kind of questions are these so definitely people have a problem the problem lies in two things one their lack of knowledge because knowledge erases all doubts number two they have opened the door to Shaitaan to Satan to mess up with their minds so he is making them too careful to the extent that they go to extremes so everything to them is Cofer or shirk had they had the proper knowledge that defines what cover is what shirk is had they done some reading that would increase their knowledge about a peda they wouldn't have fallen in such traps of Shaytan so going back to go for cover is disbelief you can reject something of a large loss you can have the arrogance to not accept a loss commands rejecting anything from the Quran which is in black and white rejecting anything from the law of allah azza wajal that is undisputed this is kufur disbelief satan when he was ordered to prostrate to Adam he knew Adam he knew allah azza wajal he saw all the angels around him his disbelief was out of arrogance and defiance so this is disbelief shirk is associating others with allah whether in lordship rubia or worship hulu here or in a las beautiful names and attributes so just before the break we were discussing Sunday's question which is if someone does good deeds out of the fear of people and he has the thought what would people think about me if I don't do it is this go for this is not go for doing something for the fear that people would talk negatively about you if this thing is a form of worship in this case this becomes react and this is also known as minor shirk because what caused you to do it is the people not the pleasure of allah azzawajal and why do we say form of worship because for example if I solve my homework and I do it on time so that the teacher would not reprimand me is this Cofer oh sure no these are things that are normal in life doing them has nothing to do with Cofer oh but if I for example we're to give charity and my motive is not to please allah azza wajal rather to not be embarrassed of Tom Dick and Harry then this is - shik the prophet alayhi salaatu Sam was asked once o prophet of Allah a man fights out of jealousy meaning that he is jealous for his people a man fights to be described as brave and a man fights for the booty of war which one is a martyr in the cause of Allah the prophet said Alice awesome the one who fights to uphold Allah's name the highest which means that all of the three are not for the sake of Allah also in hadith Oliva a Muslim which was narrated by Abu Hurairah may allah be pleased with him the Prophet said are against Allah - Salam the first three to be thrown in hell on the day of judgement are and he mentioned one of them well actually he mentioned three but let's quickly go through them one is a charitable person a person who gives his money in charity another is a scholar and a third is a fighter in the cause of Allah all of them after being shown the favors and blessings of Allah upon them English life were asked these are unless favors upon you what have you done they all claim to have been charitable been knowledgeable died in the cause of Allah just to please Allah social and Allah tells them you have lied you gave in charity so that people would say you're generous you taught people so that people would point fingers and say he's a scholar and you fought in the cause of Allah so it appeared so that they would say you are brave and it has been said take them and throw them at help therefore the most difficult thing in this life is sincerity to be sincere in what you do it's extremely difficult and nowadays it is more difficult because of the media social networks where you get people having followers and snapchat Instagram Facebook Twitter you name it they've got it and people all what they seek is Fame to be known to be acknowledged and this throws a lot of the Muslims straight to hell because these platforms are what define them the urge to be famous people come up to celebrities of Islam of Dawa not of the arts and they say share pray for me that I become like you why do you want to become like the share he says I'd like to be famous I'd like to come on TV and I'd like to do this and do that this is wrong your intention should be to please allah azza wajal if pleasing Allah behind the scenes if pleasing Allah result behind the curtains no one knows you this is the best but if you must be exposed due to the nature of your work such as an imam or a scholar in this case we have no control on this and we pray to Allah that he make our hearts steadfast on Islam Imam Shafi may Allah have mercy on us all said I wished that the whole of this population every single person I wish they would benefit from my books without attributing any of it to me subhanAllah he means that he does not want to be famous he does not want to be known but he wishes that people would benefit from his books and from the knowledge he gave to the people we are quite the opposite we would like to be known we would like to be famous whether people benefit from our knowledge or not it's beside the point and this is very dangerous so sunders yes it is quite wrong to do something out of the fear of the people however this may open the Pandora Box if you listen to these whispers and doubts this is where Shaitaan utilizes these things to his advantage meaning after what you have heard most likely whenever you want to do something Shaitaan is gonna question you ah you're going to pray why are you going to pray so that people would not say sunders does not pray so what to do this is minor it's best not to pray sit down this is how he works he knows what goes in your into your mind and he manipulates you and you should not do that with proper knowledge you can defeat him easily as Allah mentioned his plotting in the Quran as weak verily the plotting of Satan is weak so you can easily defeat him how the Salif used to always refresh their intention so it was reported that two of them were walking once two scholars and they saw a funeral passing by so one of them told the other let's go and follow it you know what great reward is in following a funeral praying on it and then burying it great huge amount of reward so the second scholars second person said wait a second and he paused for a second and he said let's go so the first one said what did you do he said I fixed my intention Subhan Allah what does that mean it means that when he told him let's go and follow the funeral his intention was okay let's go because his friend told him to do so but when he wanted the true reward from Allah he needed sincerity so he said to his friend wait for a second so that I can change my intention instead of following you rather to follow the funeral and seek the rewards from Allah and this was done in a second so whenever Shaitaan comes to you and says to you oh there's a person who needs money and he's begging or he's asking or he's sitting when we know that he needs money and people say let's give our friend some money so that he could buy food for his family tonight and they give him money I'd like to get some money from my pocket and then Shaitaan comes to me you're showing off you're doing this so that they would not point fingers at you and say that you didn't pay true this is a possibility but my course of action would define my future and how Shaitaan would be able to utilize this or not so I would ask myself is there's a is there a possibility that I'm doing this because of the fear of the people the answer is yes there is so what to do I could care less about the people I'm gonna give it whether they are looking or without them knowing I'm gonna give the money for the sake of allah azzawajal so i force myself to fix my intention and by doing this Shaitaan is in trouble and this is why scholars say when you start to pray Shaitaan comes to you and says are you prolonging prolonging your prayer so people would comment and say Oh Masha Allah he is a good worshiper what you do make it quick scholars say whenever Shaitaan comes to you with such a thought make him depressed and angry by saying no I'm gonna prolong it longer than what I was intending in the beginning just to make you eat your heart out if you do this once or twice Shaitaan will take his distance he will keep his this for a couple of weeks maybe a couple of months maybe a couple of year until you put your guard down and then he will attack again this is how it does it it goes and it will continue until the day we die we are in continuous struggle with our enemy and this is ongoing until our souls depart our bodies so insha'Allah this answers your questions send us"
