  "title": "Ruling on Plucking or Threading Eyebrows | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "the authentic hadith which abdullah i haven't mastered may allah be pleased with him narrated and it's elsewhere that the prophet has some cursed two types of women a hairdresser that plucks the the hair of the eyebrows and the customer the woman who allows her to do that to her to beautify her in such a fashion so there's no difference of opinion that plucking the eyebrows is prohibited in islam the hadith is crystal clear"
