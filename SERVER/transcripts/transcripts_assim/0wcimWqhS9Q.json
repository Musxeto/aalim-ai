  "transcript": "Sahil from India. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu. Sheikh, is it permissible to pray behind a Mushrik Imam and then repeating the prayer? And if not, what is the correct way if sometimes a Mushrik Imam leads the prayer? Okay, first of all, the concept of going ahead and saying that, what's your ruling on praying behind a Mushrik Imam, means that you've already concluded that this Imam is a Mushrik, as a fact. And this is difficult, if not impossible. How do you prove that he's Mushrik? Oh, I heard him say something in a khutbah that is shirk, a belief shirk. I saw him go to dargah. I saw him do this or that again. In order for us to take someone out of the fold of Islam, there are conditions that must be fulfilled and obstacles that must be avoided. So maybe he's ignorant. Maybe he did it by mistake. Maybe he was misinterpreting things and he thought that this is fine. You can't just simply shoot from the hip and consider a person a Mushrik. However, this is a general rule for you to understand. Let's hypothetically assume that, no, this guy is a full-fledged Mushrik. And there's no doubt, none whatsoever in him being a Mushrik. It is totally prohibited for you to pray behind him. End of story. Someone who says that, I don't believe in the Day of Judgment, immediately is a kafir. He says, I don't believe in this or I believe in reincarnation. I believe that there is evil and good controlling the world. This is essential things and parts of Islam that immediately takes a person out of the fold of Islam. So such a person, you cannot pray behind him and then pray again. No, this would be mocking Islam. You should not do that at all."
