  "title": "Intended Witr as 2+1, then 1, forgot & got up after 2nd rakat, what to do? | Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "uh while praying with your prayer yes sir we truly so um i intended my ninja was to play uh three rockets two rakaats to sleep and then world record this was my new year but uh after the second record uh i was supposed to sit for the shahood but i forgot and i stood up okay so what am i supposed to do i will answer what thank you so much his second question was i intended to pray with your two raka's with salam and then one rakah with salam but in the second raqqa i forgot and i stood up to the third rakah i didn't sit for the teshahut so i got confused should i just combine all three together as if i'm praying three raka witcher with one salam not sitting in the second rakah or what should i do well actually because you intended it before salat you should immediately sit down from the third rakah going back to the tisha and offer you to shahada and salutation upon the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and then offer two prostrations of forgetfulness then offer salaam again because you intended to pray two so if you add one more this one is invalid if you add two more or five more or whatever it is all invalid because your main intention was to pray to and allah azza knows best"
