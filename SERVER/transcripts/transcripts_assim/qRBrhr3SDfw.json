  "title": "Women Around The Prophet ﷺ‎ / Part 10 / Safiya Bint Hu'yay / - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "and welcome to this new episode of women around the prophet alaihis salatu in today's episode we will talk about a different category of women because she was a jew all of her life and we know the enmity and hatred of jews to the muslims so by default she was a woman who hated the prophet alaihis salatu and islam and not only that the prophet alaihis salatu in battle killed her ex-husband then killed her current husband and her father and her brother who were all hostile enemies to islam and specifically to the prophet allah they devoted their entire life for attacking the prophet personally and collaborating against islam so you can tell by this environment this woman grew up in you can tell the amount of resentment and hate to islam and to the muslims she is and she is from the offspring of her great great grandfather ibn imran peace be upon him the prophet of allah the brother of musa ibn imran peace be upon him the prophet of allah as well and she was married earlier to salaam ibn mishkam known as the jew who was ordered to be assassinated by the prophet allah due to his abuse and harassment and plotting against islam and the muslims then she was married to canaan was killed in the battle of khaibar the jews had a strong connection between the one one another between themselves so there were three or four tribes dominating the financial sector in medina and in arabia because they as usual it's part of their culture to deal in riba it's part of their nature as a minority to dominate and control whatever they can control and this is why they control the media this is why they control the financial sector nowadays so in the beginning when the prophet came to madinah he stretched his hand to them to coexist to live in peace not to cross the line against one another and they signed treaties on that were the first to break this treaty when they attacked and sexually harassed a muslim woman who was abiding by the hijab and then killed a muslim man who tried to defend her in the gold market and this is when the prophet salam made them leave their village and where they were then few years later it was whom when the prophet was there in the village trying to communicate with the leaders they plotted to assassinate the prophet islam by throwing a big rock from top of the building that he was sitting in the shade of it allah told him about their plotting so he went back to medina and then came back and also kicked them out it seemed that it became a habit for the jews to try and plot if they fail they can leave and if not they've succeeded so the third attempt and that was the third strike when banu quraida collaborated with the tribe of ratafan and the idol worshipers of quraish to besiege medina in the battle of the trench wasabi and for a whole month they intimidated the muslims showed their true intention to annihilate islam in the muslims while collaborating with the jews of bani korea and when allah azzawajal granted the muslims victory and sent the blazing winds and his angels to disperse the enemy forces then the prophet allah invaded bani koreva and the ruling was to assassinate to kill to execute which is a better word all of their warriors and to enslave their women and children because if their plot were to succeed the opposite would have happened exactly to the muslims so it is the punishment for what they had intended now benue and benue and some of those who managed to fled from banu korea all went to haibar which was a town a village a fortress out of the outskirts of medina and they kept on plotting against islam and the muslims led by a number of people among them the father of safiyah even and her brother and her uncle and her husband so once the prophet allah conducted the treaty in hudabia between the muslims and the idol worshipers and the treaty was there so that no one would attack one another the prophet allah felt that this was the right time to go and get it over with the jews once and for all and this is not anti-semitic as they say anti-semitism because the arabs are semitic tribes so these jews are their cousins so there's no racism none whatsoever then what is it it is simply as stated in the quran the divine book and it's also stated in the sunnah of the prophet that their hatred to us is caused by envy because the messenger of allah they were anticipating and waiting for to follow and to fight the arabs with they were expecting him to be from the sons of israel a jew when they discovered that he was an arab they declared war and they clearly stated that we cannot follow him some of them acknowledged that he was a messenger of allah and that he was a prophet of allah but only for the arabs not for the jews so they declared their enmity against islam and the muslims in such an environment sophia was born and raised besieged it and conquered it without a fight he sallallahu alaihi al-islam ordered the execution of the enemies of islam who were plotting beyond their ability and they went out of their way to harm the islam and the muslims in any way they can so they went and tried but failed and when islam took hold of them they were executed for their atrocities and for their plotting against islam and the muslims sophia fell in the share of in that she was allocated to him as a slave girl some of the companions came to the prophet and said to him o prophet of allah safiya is not befitting of she is the daughter of the leader of the jews so she has attributes that do not allow her to be a normal slave and she cannot be except for a person like you so the prophet alaihis was proposed to her and gave her a choice and he asked her if she is willing to be set free and marry him or that he would set her free and she goes back to living with the jews so he actually gave her her freedom back if she was willing to take it so when she entered upon the prophet alaihis wasalam he said to her in the beginning your father was among the strongest in enmity among the jews towards me until allah killed him so she apologized and said o prophet of allah allah says in the quran and no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another my father's burdens are not mine so i'm not to be blamed so the prophet said to her choose for yourself if you wish i will marry you and set you free and if you choose judaism then i will set you free so you can go and catch up with your people so she replied by saying oh prophet of allah i have fallen in love with islam and i believed in you before you called me to islam and i don't have any interest in judaism i don't have a father in it i don't have a brother i have nothing and now you're giving me a choice between this belief and islam by allah allah the almighty and his messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam are more beloved to my heart than being set free and going back to my people so the prophet alaihi salatu kept her for for himself in the beginning the companions did not know whether the prophet is keeping her as a slave girl a concubine or a freed woman and marry her so they said to themselves if the prophet saws make makes her wear the hijab then definitely she is the mother of the believers and soon she came out wearing the hijab the prophet alison sitting next to her camel putting his knee so that she could put her foot and climb over on top of that and then go and mount her camel so they knew that the prophet salallahu salaam took her as a wife the prophet made a walima and his willima was very modest he collected dates and made a special plate of dates with ghee in some flour which is known as hais it's very sweet very nice very filling and he ordered ana malik to gather all the companions around so that they can feast on that the prophet alaihis salat was acknowledged that she was among those whom were born and raised to hate islam and the muslims and therefore he would not be intimate with her as a wife until she herself accepted him as a husband and therefore in the authentic hadith authenticated by albani safiya says the prophet alaihis was used to be the most hatred person to my heart for he killed my husband and i was a newlywed wife and he killed my father and he killed my own brother so the prophet kept on giving me justifications and he would say your father used to do this and used to do that and he used to talk to the tribes of the idol worshipers to come and attack us and try to assassinate me a number of times and he did this and he did that she said he kept on opening my eyes to the truth until all that hatred departed my heart and was replaced by extreme love to the prophet imagine the execution of her father husband and brother in one day the execution or the killing of her ex-husband what she has lost her first home banana and then her second home haibar being captive and enslaved all of these circumstances that are capable of not only depressing a person a normal person but rather demolishing a whole mountain all of these negative feelings the prophet saw salam catered for and allah azzawajal tested her with so many calamities only for her to come at the end as a winner as a mother of the believers as one of the wives of the prophet also in this life and in paradise what more honor could any person want therefore there is always light at the end of the tunnel and never think that calamities can break you down even when you are drowning and falling down eventually once you hit rock bottom all what you can see is the top so always have hope always believe in allah azzawajal always be confident that allah azza will not leave you alone after all these calamities and hardship she became the wife of the prophet the mother of all believers and she set the prophet set his knee for her to climb and mount her camel among her attributes may allah be pleased with her that she was from an honorable lineage a tirmidhi reported that ana malik may allah be pleased with him narrated that safiyah once heard hafsah been to umar may allah be pleased with them said that she was the daughter of a jew and we know that safiya hafsa isha they are not infallible they are human beings and sometimes in times of jealousy at times of anger people say things that they may not intend or they may intend this does not exempt them from being sinful but after all they're humans and whenever they sin they come back quickly to allah azza and repent abu one of the first to embrace and accept islam in islam so he was among the first to accept islam was arguing with bilal the muradin of the prophet isam once and he said to him you are a son of a black woman of course he's the son of a black woman he is from abyssinia so what is wrong in that i didn't say anything wrong his mother is black yes but it wasn't said as a fact rather it was said to insult and hurt so the prophet when he heard this said there is still pre-islamic arrogance in you so this is not something to be ignored it's hurtful and it's intended to insult likewise hafsah a co-wife of sophia made a mistake and she said that safiya is the daughter of a jew and sophia is and was the daughter of a jew her father was jewish no one is to claim that he wasn't and i am sort of astonished when riverts accept islam and they feel shy to say that my father is a christian or my mother is a jew or my ancestors are hindus it doesn't matter what matters is you if you're a muslim say as salman al-fatiha may allah be pleased with him said when they started some of the companions started to hint that he was a non-arab and that he was persian he said islam he boasted with the fact that my father is islam and i have no other father than it so be proud of your conviction not of your lineage nevertheless it's hurtful when someone says it as an insult so the prophet saw sophia crying and she and he asked her why are you crying she said because hafsah said i am the son of a jew i am the daughter of a jew so the prophet alaihis made this statement for history and he said to her sallallahu by allah you are the daughter of a prophet referring to harun and your uncle is a prophet referring to musa and you are married to a prophet referring to himself so how dare she speak like this and sees herself over you where correctly you should see yourself over her because of all of these prophets in your family then he looked at hafsah and said hafsah fear allah this statement should not have come out of you so fear allah azzawajal the prophet wasallam knew that his co-wives were jealous of her because she was a woman of lineage she was a woman of beauty and status so they were envious they were jealous the prophet was when he got sick at the end of his life his women all gathered around him to visit so safiyah said by allah of prophet of allah i wish i was the one who was sick and not you now we often say this to our loved ones though it is haram it is not permissible to wish the illness or the calamity of a person to be on you instead of him because this is not part of believing in the destiny of allah and making dua against yourself is prohibited in islam but this was a word or a phrase that came out of her mouth so the wives of the prophet salat was salaam started chit chatting and gossiping and as you know women talk so they said look look what she's saying what a liar so the prophet saw them at islam though he was sick in pain and agony he told them go and swirl water in your mouths meaning you've said something that polluted and tarnished your the purity of your mouth so they said why would we do that o prophet of allah and he said because of what you were chit-chatting about your friend meaning safiya and by allah she's saying the truth and this was a testimony for safiyah may allah that by allah what she was saying was the truth and she sincerely wanted the pain of the prophet to be on her rather than him feeling this pain and the suffering which meant how sincere and truthful she was she was a wise woman as all the books of sira say she was a calm woman and she was a righteous woman she died on the uh 25th we're actually on the 52nd year of hijrah at the time of muawiyah may allah be pleased with her and pleased with muawiyah she was one of the mothers of the believers and despite her upbringing despite what was done to her own closest relatives she loved the prophet salaam from all of her heart and the prophet sallallahu salaam made that as a fact and he said that she is telling the truth may allah azza will be pleased upon mother safiya and all the mothers of the believers in today i'm going to talk about the book interactions of the greatest leader abu hurayrah radhiallahu said that a man came to the prophet of allah o messenger of allah poverty has struck me the prophet of allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam sent a messenger to one of his wives to bring something for that man to eat but she said by the one who sent you with the truth i only have water he salallahu alaihi wasallam sent to another one of his wives to bring something for the man to eat but she said the same until all of them said the same thing then allah's messenger sallallahu alaihi sallam said who will take this one as a guest in exchange for allah's mercy a man from the ansar said i will o messenger of allah so he took the man to his home and said to his wife treat the guest of messenger of allah well she said by allah we have nothing except the meal for my children he said get the food ready and light the lamp and put your children to sleep if they ask for dinner then when the guest enters dim the lamp and make it seem as if we are eating and when he reaches for the food to eat then stand up to the lantern and turn it off she got the food ready turned the lamp on and put the children to sleep she then went to the lamp as if she was fixing it and turned it off then they pretended as they were eating and they both went to sleep hungry in the morning the man from the ansar went to allah's implying his acceptance to the deed from your actions last night then allah revealed his saying which means and they give them preference over themselves even though they were in need of that reported by al-bukhari and muslims and welcome back you can alhamdulillah now officially try to call us through skype at zad space tv zad then space then tv and inshallah you'll be connected and we can answer your questions if you have any till you call nasiba is saying how should one calculate zakat if they have the nisab value and have a debt that they're owning um the amount they have doesn't cover the amount of the debt we were told that one should subtract any amount that they're owing and add any amount that is owed to them is this correct the answer is no if i have 200 000 euros debt i bought it from someone i spent it i bought something with it and he wants his two hundred thousand of me and i have a hundred thousand in my bank account and my zakat date is due tomorrow today i have one of two options either either take the hundred thousand cash and give it to pay part of the loan so instead of having two hundred thousand i have only one hundred thousand left so there's no zakat on me if i wait till tomorrow then the cash money i have i have to give 2.5 2 500 euros for zakat regardless if i have 200 000 loan or 2 million loan this is a different issue as long as you have the threshold for a whole lunar year or a whole hijri year you have to give zakat on that ad hell says there are some duas we have to recite before sleeping are these do us only meant for sleeping in the night only or whenever we sleep do we have to recite these the most authentic opinion is that if you go to sleep at 10 o'clock 11 o'clock p.m you say the dues of bedtime if you wake up before fajr and then pray fajr and then want to go back to sleep you're not obliged to make these duds again because you have done it for the night if someone wants to do it just in case more of goodness uh benefit of the doubt there's nothing wrong in that but we do not oblige people to repeat it once or twice or uh or more when they go back to sleep again juarez says could you please tell me how to do tasbih on fingertips according to the sunnah the sunnah did not tell us how to do that so some people would do this on the three parts of the finger the pinky three parts subhan allah subhanlah subhanlah subhan allah subhanallah subhanallah and some would just do it normally subhanallah subhanallah subhan these are five and you can do whatever you feel comfortable with without any problem insha'allah a brother says is it permissible for okay before we take this question we have ahmad from bangladesh uh mike yeah my question is regarding the national anthem can a can a muslim country is a muslim country allowed to have a national anthem that is free of musical instruments and free of  and that it could make it that contains and sunnah but also talks about the people that inhabits the land so on and what how does islam view nationalism in general no music yeah no music no no no musical instrument but a national item that that has to have in sunny but also talks about the land and the people and so on okay how islam views nationalism in general okay no problem uh niaz from saudi which is so i just shared this with one of my colleague relatives and there in that it says the benefits of this is to reflect this and show a tree for yourself in jannah the prophet sallam said whoever resides his dua will have a palm tree planted for him in the paradise and reference it was giving as al-kirmidi three four double five says that um the national anthem national anthem generally speaking has music it is played usually when they're raising the flag or saluting the flag or in national events and the national anthem without any doubt has no relation to islam meaning that did the prophet have a national anthem or the companions the answer is definitely not now having music in it is haram without a doubt as well the ayahs of the quran and the authentic hadiths in the sunnah and the consensus of the four schools of thought so old school uh schools of thought their consensus is that it's haram the school of abu hanifah malik shafir and ahmed which means it's haram full stop we don't have to elaborate anything more but they do this there and they do this the here we are muslims we follow quran and sunnah end of story now if brother ahmed is claiming that there is a national anthem that has no shirk that has no music that is filled with tawheed and praising the country we live in that i see no problem none whatsoever in doing it this is a nasheed and it's a nasheed with a good meaning and a sheet that connects me to my country and no one in islam says hate your country especially if your country is calling for tahit and calling for islam definitely you have to and you must love your country and this is not nationalism nationalism is to love your country whether it's against islam or not so it doesn't matter with it whether it is with islam or idol or against islam you love it despite of all of that and this is wrong such nationalism is wrong we don't love the country because it's soil we don't love the flag because it's a piece of cloth we love what the country calls for so if my country calls for tahit it calls for righteousness it calls for establishment of salat and dawa to allah azzawajal and purifying the akhida and memorizing the quran and spreading the word of allah this is a country to be loved and to be defended but if your country is against islam and hates muslims and puts them in jail and fights islam and the muslims definitely this is not a country to live let alone to love nya says about hadith subhanallah i know that from memory that this is a hadith that whoever says it or whoever says will have a palm tree grown from for him in jannah whether the hadith of subhanallah is authentic or not i recall it's authentic but i have to check it back so i would appreciate it if you can send it to my website there i have references i can uh look for it old age does not permit me with the grace of allah to remember a lot of things so uh insha allah if you write to my website i will be able to answer you muhammad from sudan now yes mute your television please listen to me from the phone i yes what can i do for you okay uh kindly those who call us please mute your television and listen only to us from the phone a brother says is it permissible for a grown up son to sleep in the same bed as his mother or a grown-up daughter to sleep in the same bed as her father the answer is no this is not permissible the prophet said order your sons or do your children to pray when they're seven and beat them for not praying when they're ten and separate between them in their beds so separating between the children when they go to bed when they're children this is far less than having a grown-up man sleeping with his mother when they're asleep and on the same bed they don't have control over what they do and heinous things can be done so definitely this is not something to be uh promoted and allah knows best munir says is there any dua to recite in suhur before keeping the fast the answer is no there is nothing prescribed in the sunnah for us to say before eating shahor or intending to fast the following day you just simply eat your pre-dawn meal we have fatima from nigeria okay i woke up this morning my sister woke me up and then i didn't check the time i went to the kitchen and i took my sahur and everything after i came back to the room i realized that was called 20 minutes ago but i had a feeling that adan has been called but she just woke me up and told me it was the whole time so i took my tahoe and then i realized that then was being called 20 minutes ago okay do i have fast is it valid i will answer you insha allah okay her sister woke her up she didn't check the time she was under the impression that it's not time yet so her sister confirmed that so she went and had suhur and after finishing and looking at the watch she realized that she exceeded the time of adhan by two or three minutes so is her fasting varied the answer is yes as long as you were not certain that the adhan was called if you had just a feeling then this feeling is to be ignored because in order for you to stop you have to be certain uncertainty is done either by hearing the adhan or by seeing the brick of dawn but when you don't have this and you don't have any other evidence to support that it is fajr time then i hope inshallah that your siam in your fasting is valid ahmed says what will be our age on the day of judgment and in jannah the authentic hadith i recall is 33. all the people that will enter jannah will be at the age of 33 years of of age muhammad okay we have salma from libya hello how are you i'm fine um i wanted to ask about uh uh breastfeeding during the month of ramadan okay and what is the how come and what is the thing of after when you for example if you broke your fast because of the breastfeeding during the month of ramadan what is the outcome of making up the days after okay any more questions no thank you selma from libya says breastfeeding during the month of ramadan a mother who's suckling is one of two either she's fit strong and patient and there's no fear over her life or the well-being of her child in this case we tell her it's best for you to fast if she says well when i fast my milk dries so my child doesn't find milk and when i fast i feel so thirsty as if i'm going to die and it's very hard for me alhamdulillah allah gave you an exception you have the concession to skip fasting ramadan while suckling but after all the obstacles are gone you are instructed to make up for these mistakes okay do i have to give fidya do i have feed anyone no so one year i'm fasting i'm i'm pregnant one year she's uh breastfeeding she's pregnant breastfeeding after five six ten years and you have no obstacles you can fast now you have to make all these previous days make them up and you don't have to feed anything at all and allah azza knows best muhammad says if a person does not have any major ritual impurity meaning that he doesn't have janaba can he still perform russell or does he have to take a normal shower and if he can perform russell not having major ritual impurity would he be in the state of evolution after russell is a ritual bath which can be performed in a sunnah way and it also can be performed in an unsunna way so the non-sunna way is to simply stand under the shower get all of your body washed swirl water in your mouth and uh pull water up your nostrils and push it out that's it this is non-sunnah but it is valid now if i don't have janaba or a ritual impurity and i perform the sunnah way of russell there's no problem in that by doing it you actually perform a normal wudu then you pour three scoops of water over your head then you wash your whole body and you leave so by doing this your shower is done it's not a ritual impurity uplifting but you have performed so you can pray now but if you perform a normal shower without the sequence of wudu you don't perform the wudu in sequence as a separate wudu in this case you cannot pray you have to specifically and individually offered alone muhammad from sudan yes muhammad hello muhammad i cannot hear you can you repeat aha here you hear me now you can hear me yes you can hear me yes okay i will uh i'm asking a sheikh one's watching okay hello yes i'm listening yes hello i think we have problems with muhammad sister says my period are over but i'm unable to perform as i am sick can i fast and pray once you see your purity before the atlanta fajr this means that you are permitted to fast if you intend it so being in your major impurity whether due to intercourse or whether due to uplifting the state of menses does not impact your fasting if you saw your purity from your menses before the adam the russell can be performed after the then without any period without any problem praying on the other hand cannot at all be done without having your major ritual impuri uh uh impurity uplifted through having a hustle so whether you are on your menses and you saw your purity or you had an intercourse before fajr in order to pray you must perform but your fasting is not affected by it because it took place before the adhan and allah azzawajal knows best milan from usa how are you how are you doing i'm fine doing well miranda how are you yes what can i do for you so i have a question chef if my throat uh there's a lot of mucus and a lot of congestion and i constantly have to clear it in order to recite properly and so that uh do i if i don't fully clear it and i enter the salah and then in the middle of it i clear it you know is that does that invalidate my prayer in any way clearing it is by spitting or by swallowing it uh by is usually swallowing it yeah no problem in that no problem in that even if you do it intentionally there's no problem none whatsoever and this is something you cannot clear before salat and he said you can't say okay i'll have like four minutes of salah this is something that comes without your controller or management so there's no problem in swallowing it because what's inside is inside so no problem in that at all a sister we answered this i think yeah sadafiyah says i just wanted to know that while reciting surah in salat if a person forgets some of its ayahs does he need to repeat this surah again or recite other surahs what is the ruling for this if you forget an ayah so you're reciting uh for example allah i forgot i don't know what the i afterwards one alternative is to recite another surah ash the other easier alternative is allahu akbar and you make ricor so you have ended what you had started without any problem in sha allah nabila says is it allowed to open the quran app in the phone while praying taraweeh prayer at home if you're alone or leading someone yes you can open the app and read from it during tarawih too is it allowed to switch on the recitation too so we have the text of the quran in front of us and are also listening to the recitation specifically if someone is not very fluent in reading the quran the answer is no why not also watch the news this is not befitting for you to be praying and reading which you have to do and then now you're listening to the quran and maybe someone else says okay i read the quran but i also read the translation and i read the commentary why not read as well no this does not uh fit praying you can hold the mobile phone or the quran you can read from that but you should not listen and follow that and allah azzawajal knows best this is all the time we have until we meet tomorrow same time i live in you"
