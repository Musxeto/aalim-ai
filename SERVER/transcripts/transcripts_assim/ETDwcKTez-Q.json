  "title": "He is in bad financial condition so can he take MORE Riba Loans to pay it off? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu And you are? Adil from India Yes Adil, what can I do for you? Sheikh, my question is if someone's financial condition is very bad and there is no good amount of business and in a few days he has to pay debts like loan, credit card bills, etc. He took that loans and credit cards before because due to financial conditions and still the conditions are very bad and he took the previous loans by intending that he will be returning back and not taking the loans again. But Sheikh, now he has repenting back to Allah. And Sheikh, the question is again the financial conditions is same as before. Now, in this case like if he did not clear the debts, then there will be serious issues and there are no one to give him money. So Sheikh, in this situation, is it permissible to go into loans which can touch Riba? JazakAllah khair. Jazakum. Akhi, no matter what, it is like quicksand. You are already up to your knees in it. So you said, no I'm going to try to shake myself out. You're going to sink more. So it's not logical. If you have $10,000 in debts that are interest based and haram. In order to save yourself from some consequences of it, you're willing to take $5,000 on interest again to pay some of it but you still be dealing with Riba and paying Riba and instead of paying for $10,000 you're going to be paying for $13,000 or $14,000 or $15,000. This is not logical and it's not permissible. Look for another alternative and may Allah make things easy for you."
