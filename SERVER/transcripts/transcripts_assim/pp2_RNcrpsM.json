  "title": "Do we say the Dua between the 2 prostrations in ALL prayers (rabbighfirli) | Assim Al Hakeem - JAL",
  "transcript": "uh okay so muhammad from the u.s he was asking about the dua between the two prostrations when we sit between the two prostrations in prayer we say fairly robust repeat it or we say the longer do our birth so he's saying that do we say this in fault prayers in sunnah prayers in witcher prayers in qiyam al-layal prayers the answer is yes the prayer is one so you say it throughout the prayers and it's an issue of dispute whether it's a pillar to say it or it's simply recommended sunday you can drop it or it is mandatory not a pillar but it's mandatory and i'm inclined to the third and last opinion that is it is mandatory to do it if you skip it intentionally your prayer is void and if you forgot it you have to prostrate to prostration of forgetfulness and allah azza knows best you"
