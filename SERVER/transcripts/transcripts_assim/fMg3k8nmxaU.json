  "transcript": "Vienna muhammadin wa ala aalihi wa sahbihi ajma'in um back assalamu alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh we begin with the Grace and blessing of Allah Azza WA JAL in today's class studying the chapter that deals with a soul that deals with fasting and as we know that fasting is one of the pillars of Islam and the definition of fasting linguistically is to refrain linguistically you could fast from talking as mentioned in the Quran in Nina dirtily Rajamani Solman falen O'Kelly maluma insigne i have pledged today that i fast from speaking so I will not talk to any human being but we know that the linguistic definition is not what counts but rather what counts is the Islamic definition or what we call the technical definition and fasting is defined by to refrain from things that nullifies your fasting from the break of dawn till sunset with the intention of worshipping Allah and this is very important that you have this last phrase with the intention of worshipping Allah because I could fast and a lot of the non-muslims fast from things that nullify their fasting but the intention is not for the sake of Allah the intention is for dieting the intention is for losing weight the intention is because the doctor told them not to eat or drink so is this considered to be fasting know the proper fasting is to refrain with the intention of worshipping Allah Azza WA JAL and Roma Bahn is known as the month of patience because fasting is an excellent display of patience and the pillar that is fasting it's only fasting of Ramadan so it is not fasting of Ashura or Arafah or the white days or the Monday the Thursdays it is only fasting the month of Ramadan this is what's a pillar upon every Muslim and muslima so it is the month of patience and scholars divide patience into three types and they say that all of these three types are found in fasting the month of Ramadan so when they say patience they say that you have to be patient in not doing the sins and you have to be patient in doing the mandatory things and you have to be patient when the calamities of Allah befall upon you these are the three types of patience and whoever attains these three types he is considered to be the patient one in fasting Ramadan you have all these three displayed so you fast from haram you fast from things that are sinful the Prophet tells us Allah is Allah to Sam that he who refrains from eating and drinking but does not refrain from false testimony and saying false things Allah does not need him to stop eating and drinking meaning his fasting is not accepted if you continue to do bad things and since especially testifying falsely or saying false things this means that your eating and drinking did not change anything also in fasting Ramadan we have patience on doing what Allah instructed you to do and by stopping eating and drinking is an excellent display of obedience to Allah and of your patience on doing things that Allah commanded you and of course the greatest type of patience would be to be patient when the calamities of Allah befall upon you and hunger and thirst is a calamity not being able to do halal things such as having intimacy with your wife is a calamity but your patience is highly rewarded by allah azza wajal and it is a training session from a bond is a training session because anything that is considered to be addictive is Lomb tells you not to be addicted to it is LOM only wants you to be addicted to worshiping allah and remembering him and striving in reaching allah pleasure for example your addiction to food and drink which is allah allah tells you you have to take a break so that you would not be enslaved to halal things such as intimacy with your spouse such as eating and drinking be free because when you are able to control yourself over halal things it goes without saying that your control over her on things would be even stronger if a person does not drink water because allah tells him not to drink water do you think that he will be able to drink alcohol he would have a stronger will than any other person and that is why Islam forbids you from being addicted to things especially Haram things so those who are addicted to smoking in Ramadan they display their obedience to Allah by quitting for 16 hours which means that if they have full confidence in Allah and Trust they will be able to stop the 24 hours all what you need is to believe once you believe Allah Azza WA JAL will support you and Allah Almighty would guide you and who is it that fasting is mandatory upon it is mandatory upon every Muslim who is sane who is or has reached the age of puberty and who does not have any restrictions from fasting and what do we mean by restrictions of fasting for example a woman in her menses or a woman and her post-delivery bleeding is she obliged to fast is she permitted to fast no she is not so this is something that this tricks are from fasting a traveler and this depends on the traveling but it's a permission from Allah that a traveler may skip fasting and to make it up when he's capable a sick person likewise and so on so these are the types of people that have to fast and we know that we have to fast the month of Ramadhan but we have to also go through the process of identifying that Ramadhan is do or not and this is done by observing and sighting the birth of the new moon so we will come in shala to the hadith that explained some of the previously mentioned topics hadith number 177 yes the brother there it is related from a book greater Rosella and that the prophet sallallaahu Selim I said none of you should fast at a or two before Amazon except a man who custom early asked he should fast that day in this hadith the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam is forbidding us from fasting a day or two before Ramadan why is that scholars say that there is something that is known as the day of doubt and the day of doubt usually is the 30th of Shaban and why do we call it doubt because if today is the 29th after sunset what will we be doing will be observing and trying to sight for the new moon and that is the crescent if we cite it this means that tomorrow is the first of Ramadan if we don't cite it for a reason or the other if we don't cite it because it's not born yet or if we fail to cite it because there are clouds or a lot of wind and dust what should we do the Prophet told us Ali salatu salam to assume that tomorrow is the 30th of Shaban and not fast so there would be people who would come and say well it's an issue of doubt is tomorrow 30th or the 1st of Ramadan just for the sake of argument I will fast tomorrow just to be on the safe side the Prophet says are a solid Salam this is not permissible do not proceed Ramadan by fasting a day or two why because then you would allow Shaitaan to come into your thoughts into your life and start to always tell you to be on the safe side you perform model I washed my limbs three times just to be on the safe side wash it once again you prayed raesha with the congregation just to be on the safe side maybe I did not have full for sure or maybe I did something wrong in the Salah Altria navigation by this you will destroy your life you will allow Shaitaan to play with you like children play with football such thoughts and whispers of Shaitaan destroy your life so you should not allow this however the Prophet Allah saw Selam made an exception and this exception was for those who regularly fast a particular date such as Mondays and Thursdays so if it happens that today the 29th of Shaban is a Wednesday and tomorrow the 30th of Shaban is a Thursday and I have the habit of every Monday and Thursday I fast what should I do tomorrow I should fast because the Prophet gave me the permission RA his salat wa salam likewise those who fast the fasting of the would peace be upon him which is fast the day break the next pass the day in break the next so if I did not fast today and tomorrow is the 30th is it permissible for me to fast the answer is yes because by this you would be complying and following the prophets instruction adding his salat WA Salam we have a short break stay tuned and sha Allah will be right assalamu alaikum and welcome back hadith number 178 this hadith was narrated by Abdullah Umar may Allah be pleased with him that the prophet salallahu alaihe wasalam said do not fast until you see the new moon and do not break the fast until you see it if it is cloudy then you must calculate it the hadith falls in line with what we've mentioned before Muslims know the beginning and the end of the month by observing the new moon so you do not begin Ramadan until you sight and observe the new moon at the end of Shaban and likewise you continue to fast until you sight the moon at the end of Ramadan or until you finish Ramadan to be thirty days and the Prophet gave us a lot o Salaam an easy solution out if there is cloud and we're unable to detect a new moon on the 29th of the month then you have to calculate it in the sense that calculating it would be that tomorrow is the 30th and there is a hadith clearly stating that for atomo a shark complete their month meaning that it would be 30 so do you have only two options after the 29th day of the month you either sight the moon or if you are unable to cite it or you don't see it due to the presence of clouds you have to complete the month to be 30th there is no other third alternative okay then what is the ruling on what Muslim countries or some of the Muslim countries do they depend on astronomist to calculate to them the birth of the new moon astronomers say that tomorrow definitely is the beginning of Ramadan can we go ahead with what they had said even if we did not cite the mode and the answer is no the prophet alayhi salatu salam he clearly stated that we are a nation oma that we do not calculate we are on oma that does not read and the month is either this or this meaning is either 29 or 30 days you cannot have the month being 28 and you cannot have the month being 31 it has to be either 29 or 30 so how do we know by observing the moon if we did not see the moon on the 29th then definitely tomorrow is the 30th and that is it and you find that even if you were wrong it will be rectified the following month by citing the moon ahead of time or it would be 29 or 30 days and this goes on throughout the whole year fast Ramadan if one of them cited the moon or not it's an issue of dispute what is practiced nowadays clearly states that every country has its own sighting and this was the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salatu salam in the authentic hadith when Corrib and he was one of the Companions of America's came from Syria where the halifa was mahalia it better be Sofia and may Allah be pleased with him and with his father he came at the end of Ramadan so I've been a bust asked him when did you see the Crescent and they said on Saturday so even Abbas said well we did not see it on Saturday we saw it on Sunday so he told him are you gonna do and apply the sighting of mahalia he said no we're going to apply our own sighting and this is the Sunnah which indicates that each region has its own sighting but scholars differed in regard to what do we call a region so if I see the Crescent in mumbay the people of Delhi would fast or they say no we depend on our exciting it's an issue of dispute most likely a region is a one that is governed by a ruler and the ruler is the one who dictates whether to take the sighting of the adjacent region or not some scholars say that a region is what is approximately to be in the diameter of two thousand kilometers and these approximately 2,000 kilometers will have the same sighting what is being practiced today that each country each government has its own sighting usually when we sight the moon in Saudi Arabia we have all the Gulf countries following us so they believe and they depend and they follow the sighting of the same Arabian Peninsula which is quite huge likewise other countries each country has its own ruling but the $100,000 question or a million dollar question a little bit less or more what is the ruling if the country I'm in the governor or the ruler does not believe in the sighting and he believes only in the calculations of astronomist so he says that tomorrow Saturday is the first day of Ramadan whether people side the moon or not what is the ruling on that scholars say that you have to follow that ruler if he's a Muslim ruler you have to follow him because the announcement of the month is only known through him so if he's following the Sunnah and he cites the morning hamdulillah if he doesn't as Muslims you're obliged to follow what he says and any sin or burden would be on his back because the Prophet said that is salatu salam fasting is when you all fast and breaking the fast is when you all break the fast as we will come to study in sha allah do you have any questions to them my question is regarding last time when we met we talked about the execution of maybe on the Hajj that when we sacrifice so that can we eat the meat of that sacrifice the answer is no wherever you pay an expiation you cannot eat from the meat of the slaughtering but if you are offering a pica for example you may eat if you're offering walima you may eat but when you are offering Hadi you should eat when you offer over here you should eat because all of this is part of the synonym the expirations and the oath the nether you do not eat from them at all with the exception of nether if you intended it so for example if someone makes an oath and this oath is not recommended it is makrooh the Prophet told us not to do it but once you pledge yourself to do it you must do it so if someone says oh Allah if my child passes tomorrow's exam I will slaughter a sheep he made it general now what is your intention he says my intention is to give it to so vaca you must not eat anything of it if I ask him again what is your intention he says my intention is to slaughter it and to call my relatives so that we we eat from it then you can eat from it it depends on your intention so I hope this answers your question any more questions yes brother Shaikh supposing if someone makes ode to Allah that he wouldn't do this and he breaks the oath you feed ten people then does he have to continue with that oath or that means that oath and now if it is continuous he has to fulfil his pledge the prophecy that some men never IOT ilaha failure who who ever pledges that he should obey Allah in doing something that is form of worship he must fulfill that so if someone says if this thing happens I will fast every Monday he must fast every Monday and if he misses one Monday intentionally he's lazy he should continue this does not affect the coming Monday's so if this is your question then I hope this and says it though we know that it is not recommended to have such a yes brother so our question is regarding loss topic when we met last time what is the ruling about zakah on the money people have in their accounts of government Provident funds or private property and can you explain government Provident Fund if someone is an employer somewhere in a government service government deduct some money and keep it for Provident Fund and once retirement yes okay I will answer this question Shah aalam the money that the government deducts from your salary this is not something that you can use or utilize you cannot go to the government and tell them give me my money they will not give it to you it is the scheme that after you complete 25 years they will give you this retirement money on installments once every month and in this case it is completely different than your own savings so this money is not your saving likewise the end of service indemnity if you finish ten years or 20 years if you resign usually they calculate something and give you the money and this money is also is not Zeek a table unless one year passes because during your service you were unable to cash this money it was not in your possession you're not the lawful owner of it I'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time via Manila assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
