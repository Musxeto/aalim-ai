  "title": "How to make up Tahajjud if I overslept? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "second question is it okay to pray to hajjut in the morning if i overslept it won't be called to hajjut it would be making up for the not for the missed night prayer and mother aisha may allah be pleased with her uh if i'm not mistaken tells us that when the whenever the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam overslept due to illness or any other reason he would make up his night prayer by changing it from odd numbers which is 11 into even numbers which is 12. so if you have a habit of praying seven raka's every night for 200 and you overslept when you wake up in the morning you pray it at the time of buha so it is after sunrise by 10 minutes or 15 minutes till before the adhan of the by 10 minutes or 15 minutes and you pray instead of seven you pray eight two by two by two by two this is what the sunnah stated"
