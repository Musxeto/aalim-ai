  "transcript": "uh in France unfortunate unfortunately some people don't pray on time or combine multiple prayer uh they just don't know this is Haram so for example they pray f as soon as they wake up regardless of the time and because of work of school they combine the two prayer like d and us up to four prayer like M and they make up two or four some claim that this is because of theik so I want to help them can you explain why this is har thanks thanks the prophet prayed every prayer on time Allah says prayer was prescribed upon the Believers at specific times so it has a beginning and it has an end and likewise when jiel peace be upon Him came to the prophet Alam over the duration of two days to teach him how to pray he prayed five times of the day and at the beginning of the time and the following day he prayed the five prayers at the end of its time and he said to him Muhammad the prayer is between this and this the beginning of the time and the end you cannot pray it before and as well you cannot pray it afterwards because the time is over and it is prescribed at specific times so those who pray and at 9:00 p.m. at the end of the day their is invalid they should not pray it it's gone it's over even if they pray 100 it's not going to be counted only is is valid because it's prayed on time combining the prayer without a legitimate reason is the maab of the Shia not of the Maliki they combine without any specific reason and they pray three times a day some sects of them that is and this is not permissible these people in France they are playing with the religion and this is why unfortunately the vast majority a lot of the imams of the Masjid that people take Knowledge from have no knowledge there are people they bring them from North Africa or from here from there they know few suras they have beautiful voice they lead the prayer and people consider them to be sheh to be and they ask them for fatwa and if you look at how they behave how they act how they cross red lines in Islam you can easily say that these guys are not imams I don't know what they're doing this is not ISL what they're doing so it's very wrong to take Knowledge from such people or to follow such people we have great Scholars baz Alani and the likes whom their Publications and their teachings and their lessons and lectures are widely spread and you can take pure knowledge according to the Quran and the Sunnah most likely these people in France and elsewhere don't want the Quran and the Sunnah and this is why they fight against anyone who calls for Quran and the Sunnah this goes against democracy these are going against the Republic beliefs and that's why they kick them out because they don't want Quran and Sunnah who wants Quran and the Sunnah except people who want the truth and who want what pleases Allah and definitely they do not"
