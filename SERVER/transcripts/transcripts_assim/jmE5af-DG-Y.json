  "title": "A Christian woman wears the hijab & vlogs about Islam, is this permissible? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "as for the Christian lady who Vlogs about Islam and pretends to be a Muslim and people mistake her for a Muslim I don't see any harm as long as what she's doing is constructive and true if she's saying good things about Islam so he's propagating good things about Islam even if she is not a Muslim I don't see any harm in leaving her to do what she is doing and at the same time try to call her to Islam try to be kind and nice and diplomatic with her so that she would be able to embrace what she's calling others too but if she is pretending to be a Muslim yet putting poison in the food and trying to tarnish the reputation of Islam by her actions wearing the hijab and the likes and then doing hideous things she has to be exposed wherever she is so that people are not deceived by her actions and Allah Knows Best"
