  "title": "Can a woman wear loose pants & clothes or must she wear an Abaya? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question is is it permissible for women to wear loose pants instead of the Abaya or is it only permissible to wear Thea first of all a woman has to conceal herself fully before going out so anything that may show the curves of a body or the bone structure is totally prohibited for her to wear if she's wearing pants or the likes or even a skirt that is not permissible she has to have a an outer garment like a Aba to go out with this is different from if she's praying home but we're talking about the of seeing so this is totally prohibited for her to leave the house wearing such trousers and Allah Asel Knows Best"
