  "title": "How to repent for being late for work? Hours i got paid for haram? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Ibrahimah from Guinea Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh May Allah reward you, you and your team and the admins and everybody Sheikh And you as well, Barakallah Feek Sheikh, my question today is about repentance. For example, I want to know if a person goes late to work, for example, the money that you eat that you have not been paid for is obviously sinful for you. So if the person, let's say, goes late to work, how to repent from that, for example? Do we have to go to the person who is paying us and tell them this and that, apologize every time it happens, and then repent to Allah? Or what is the correct way to repent? First of all, this is too generic. Some companies have a policy of 15 minutes forgiveness. So if you have to punch in your card at 9 and you come at 9.15, they're okay with that. Anything more than that, they will hold you accountable. Some companies don't. So if you come late, and this happens on a regular basis, of course you're sinful and the money you're taking is haram for these minutes or hours that you're late. If you can compensate your company or your employer by working after working hours, or working on weekends, or coming other days early to fulfill your task and do it, if you have unfinished business, then that's inshaAllah fine, it would be good. But if you actually don't work more than four hours or five hours a day, and the three hours are free, still this does not entitle you to come late or leave early. So you have to either speak with your employer about it, and to fix it, or to pay the money that you've taken unlawfully for these hours that you did not show for, and give it back to the company, and Allah knows best. you"
