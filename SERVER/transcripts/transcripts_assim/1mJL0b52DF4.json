  "transcript": "says that you stated in one of your answers few weeks ago that when talking about novels that allah would speak about things that did not happen i didn't say that allah would speak about things that did not happen i said that allah would give us examples and tells us things that are an example not an actual fact and every time you read the quran and you you hear or read allah gives gives the similitude of a man who's mute who cannot speak and he who does not know where to go when his master tells them where to go while the other one is a sane and an intelligent person who enjoins virtue and forbids evil these two allah gives them as an example so when writing novels scholars say that these two did not actually happen we don't have ahmad and abdullah who are we are being told about allah is telling us about in the quran these are two that allah is giving us as an example likewise writing novels would be in the same path when you write something that is fictional with the intention of guiding people or giving in dawah or developing moral ethics this is permissible insha allah"
