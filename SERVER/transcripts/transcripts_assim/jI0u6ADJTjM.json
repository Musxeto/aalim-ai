  "title": "Unity & Brotherhood among Sahaba Companions of Prophet ﷺ‎ How to achieve that status assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "used to migrate to make Hijra to Medina so they went to Medina in Medina in order for the Islamic ummah to be raised there has to be a very important aspect and this important aspect is to have Brotherhood because those who came from Mecca did not have money did not have property did not have anything at all so the first thing to establish in the ummah is Brotherhood to cleanse the hearts and you cannot cleanse the hearts except if you have the same Akida and this is what binds you and me together not the nationality not the complexity of the skin not the language rather the apida and this is why Allah azzawajal tells us in the Quran about Prophet peace be upon him and no call to his Lord and said my Lord indeed my son is of my family and indeed your promise is true and you are the most just of judges when did this happen After the flood subsided and no sun drowned he tried to have him come on the ark but the sun refused so now Noah is trying to beg Allah azzawajal for his son Allah said to him oh no indeed your son is not of your family indeed he is one whose work was other than righteous so ask me not for that about which you have no knowledge indeed I advise you lest you be among the ignorant what does this mean it means that the Brotherhood can only be based on Islam it can only be based on correct apida according to the Quran and according to the Sunnah we cannot follow different things and have Unity so the first thing that the prophet did was to create a Brotherhood Bond so when the companions went he made abubakar may Allah be pleased with him the brother of from Medina he made aroma the brother of atuban IBN Malik from the answer he made him the brother of sad he made him the brother of Salama foreign he gave them to 90 of the ansar to do what to be brothers if one dies the other one inherits him so he made them brothers to one another this Brotherhood was not fake this was real Brotherhood so one of the companion Abdullah and he's one of the ten heaven-bound ashram he made him the brother of sat in when he heard the news that abdulrahman is your brother he went to him and he said to him my people know that I am the richest of the people of Medina now why would you say such a thing if you gave him some money he would be happy no he says no now you are my brother I will tell you my bank account I have millions and because I am the richest man in Medina half of my money is yours whoa that's a lot so if you have two cars here is one car and here's one car for me no he has more than one car he has a lot of cars half of the cars are yours not only that I have two beautiful wives and they are from a very reputable family let you look and see which one you like you are a better man than me you are from the 10th Heaven bound so you're closer to Allah I will divorce her for you because she will be marrying someone better than me now this is what sad from Medina said to his brother this is strange if you look at it realistically logically that is very strange but this is how Allah described them in the Quran in suratul Hashem Allah azzawajal says about the people of Medina and also for those who were settled in the home of Medina and adopted the faith before them they love those who emigrated to them and find not any want in their chests for what they the immigrants were given but give them preference over their own selves even though they are in privation and whoever is whoever is protected from the stinginess of his soul it is those who will be successful this is how Allah described the people of Medina of being successful of being saved from any wants of this Dunya they will share it with their brothers so sad did the unbelievable half of my wealth is yours my two wives I'll divorce one of them for you now this is very strange and mind-blowing but sad did not want to squander and waste his money he wanted an investment he wanted to invest his money for so the money you have what will it do for you how many cars do you have five how many cars can you ride at the same time what how many clothes do you have in your cupboards so many clothes dresses how many can you wear one open your refrigerator how many chicken how many beef how many mutton how many food and vegetables how can you how many can you eat only one small portion so sad was investing his wealth with Allah azzawajal and this is mind-blowing what is more mind-blowing is the response of abdulrahman if someone comes to you and says half of money is yours take one of my wives what will you say okay and I like two of their wives why did you divorce them both I'll marry them no Abdul Rahman is one of the ten Heaven bound he's one of the best 10 people ever to walk after the prophet Allah 10 best so what does he say may Allah bless your wealth and bless your wives you don't want anything no nothing shukran but you're poor you don't have a penny you don't have money yes yes show me the souk where is the marketplace what are you gonna do you don't have money I'll manage I'm a businessman what did he do he went to the marketplace and he saw something he said huh okay how much is this they say one dollar he said okay I'll buy it from you I'll bring you the dollar at the end of the day he took it and went around 1.5 1.5 dollar very cold very nice very very barakash Hassan very good so some says I'll buy it is 1.5 took the dollar and a half put the half dollar here took one dollar to the man said Bismillah this is your dollar win-win now he has capital half a dollar and he kept on doing this doing this doing this business until the prophet saw him once and he was dressed nicely putting perfume the prophet said you look different what's wrong with you a new suit and you have a good look is it all prophet of Allah I got married wow from one dollar and he said okay very good mashallah how much did you give dowry he said this much of gold so the prophet said it's a lot of money okay then slaughter a sheep and invite us for walima to Feast on it later on became the most richest of all companions he became a multi-billionaire one day Medina shook and the people said what is this they said this is a caravan coming from Syria and from Yemen with Goods foreign 700 camels filled with gold and and silk and grocery everything Caravan so the merchants came and they said we want to buy it he said how much you're giving me prophet they say we will double one dollar will give you two dollars he said no I have more this is triple four five he said no one can pay more than us said Allah can pay more than this this is all for Allah 700 he gave it all for Allah if someone comes and says Chef give me some money [Music] and I don't have change sorry I look for change I will not give something big these people had a clean heart and their heart was cleaned towards their brothers and this is Allah in their life in their wealth put Baraka in their knowledge whenever you hear the name you say may Allah be pleased with him a man of dignity of Honor now if we want to reach this level of Excellence is their place in our hearts for such Brotherhood do we have the love the mercy the kindness towards one another you can see this in Salat when you stand for Salat ULU and there's a small Gap and someone comes how do you do [Music] why no no it's too small it can fit him yes yes but I will not be comfortable throughout the Salat I want to be comfortable where is the love and compassion and kindness in Salat when you differ with me in an opinion you say right I say left why do we have to be so aggressive so violent why do I I have to insult you in order to prove that I am right this is not how the prophet Allah raised his companions he raised them on being fair on being just on being kind on being compassionate and loving towards one another he raised them to check on one another do we check on our brothers if we don't see them if we don't hear from them may Allah be pleased with him and this shows you why they were great one day after Salat al-fajr what time is people say let me take the app when was The Last Time You Prayed Fajr or Ramadan this is not possible Abu Bakr after Fajr prayer was sitting with the companions the prophet he said who among you is fasting today abubakar raised his hand I said okay who among you has fed a poor person raise his hand hmm this is and he did this a while ago who among you visited a sick person raised his hand then the prophet said who among you followed a funeral until it was buried and abubakar raised his hand four great huge Deeds Done before Fajr the prophet said whoever does these four things in one day he will enter judgment immediately so this shows you how the companions dealt with one another they used to check are you sick I will visit you are you dead I Will Follow You To Your Grave if you need food I will feed you but I will not forget my relationship with Allah today I'm fasting today I'm praying night prayer today I'm doing this I'm doing that this is how the companions lived 360 degrees fulfilling everything in themselves and also to those who are with them among their Companions and loved ones so if we benefit today from our talk number one how to check on our brothers and sisters number two how to purify our hearts and accept them for who they are without judging without being aggressive or offensive or abusive if we learn from this how to be a muslim with honor and dignity not every time someone gives you something please please give me give me give me no I have dignity have honors exactly I have money I remember once a few years back we had zakat money and it was on the 27th of Ramadan they told me that about two and a half hours away from Jeddah there is slum area very very very poor they live in tin houses no running water no electricity I could not believe this you know this is not possible no no we don't have people like this so we took a caravan maybe seven eight cars filled with Goods with food with clothes and we drove for about two three hours just before Maghrib and we knocked on the doors one house I went in myself and I saw firewood not on butane gas or like firewood like in the jungles is in Saudi Arabia and there was this old woman 60 70 years old cooking I don't know what it looked like milk but water with something in it she was doing this so I we brought her some dates we brought her some food she said no no no thank you I have food food this is our neighbor don't have anything please go to them look at the art and dignity if I were in her place and said um okay do you have some steaks maybe yeah yeah no she said I have food we went to the neighbor and we gave her this you know a box of dates 27th of Ramadan 27 days has passed we gave to the old woman these days he said Marshall more dates wallahi I have not tasted dates yet since Ramadan till they they did not receive dates and I was telling to myself do we have people like this yes but they are so dignified they don't ask they don't pick so many people around you are like this you think that they're well off you don't know how much debts they have you don't know if they had dinner if they had lunch if they had breakfast I didn't have breakfast because I don't want to eat breakfast nothing Alhambra anyhow so you have to check on your brothers on your sisters purify your heart and give a helping hand and insha Allah you will be with the companions on the day of judgment what is Muhammad"
