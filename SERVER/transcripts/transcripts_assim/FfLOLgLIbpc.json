  "transcript": "so I read that it is Haram to eat insects but what I want to ask that what about like the tiny insects and food such as rice like some of them remain after the food is cooked so will the food become Haram to it because uh it was cooked along with those insects insects are prohibited to eat either because it is something that is disgusting to humans in general or due to the fact that it may be harmful medically no one goes and buys insects in his sound mind let alone buying cooc roaches or uh uh lizards or mice like some weird countries do which illustrates how filthy and degenerate they are may Allah protect us Islam protects the well-being of a human being and we've heard of the Corona virus and the origin of it from so many theories and tales but among them that it was due to the fact that people ate bats and the likes of rodents anyhow by insects is totally prohibited in Islam because it it has no use and eating it is prohibited if as stated before but if something unintentionally is found in your food like an ant or a small bug or uh the likes and rice and taking it out would be next to Impossible if not yeah it it is very difficult if not possible therefore randomly eating it unintentionally is no problem at all no one says it's NIS no one says it validate invalidates your W or the likes and Allah Knows Best"
