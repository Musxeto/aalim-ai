  "title": "Wash clothes with dog saliva in washing machine with other clothes (7 times? Utensils? assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "first of all what's the ruling on washing clothes that were licked by dogs or that contain dog's saliva the Hadith talks about utensils that dogs may eat from or lick so the prophet said if a dog eats or licks food or drinks from a utensil then you have to spill what's in it wash it seven times and dust it once so in the beginning you wash it with soil or dust then you wash it seven times with water some Scholars cascaded this even if the dog were to lick lick your hand or your trousers but this is not what the prophet said in the most authentic opinion is that washing seven times and one with soil is only when the dog uses the utensils a plate a bowl a spoon this is what we have to use seven times as for normal clothes or when a dog comes and licks your hand it just happens in kaffir countries a dog can just come and lick your hand so what should I do is just wash it normally without any problem so coming to your question there's no problem in washing these clothes in the same washing machine as it will be overwhelmed with water um"
