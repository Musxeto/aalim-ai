  "transcript": "two question no only one please okay so uh the question is about Brotherhood in Islam but the prophet s Alam used to make brother like ties between the an and M correct to the extent that they uh started to add the new brothers to The Testament and Etc so the question is uh does the F have any rulings on this uh in the modern days or are any literature among the scholars on this topic can we as regular Muslims do the same thing or is it only for the khif or the IM to do that no no no this was in the beginning of Hijra when the muhajirin migrated to Medina and they were Stone broke they did not have anything so the prophet selected one from the mahaj to become a brother of ansar and they he assigned each muhajir to his brother from the ansar and he even went to the extent to say that they are as siblings so if one of them dies the other one inherits him and this went on for some time until this ruling was abrogated as mentioned in chapter uh eight Surah Alan at the last verse of it that no the inheritance should be between kinship and this type of inheritance between this type of Brotherhood was dissolved and abrogated now what remains of it is The Cordial feelings between us brothers so yes if I have a dear brother of mine a neighbor a friend a colleague we have this bond between us to the extent that I may lend him money he may lend me money if he's in need I would give him money I would uh uh make let him borrow my stuff and car as a brother but there is nothing that goes above that to the extreme amount of Brotherhood that the companions had uh uh in their beautiful stories that were narrated and Allah Knows Best"
