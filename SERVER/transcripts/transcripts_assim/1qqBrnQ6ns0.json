  "title": "When to bring in arbitrators to resolve a failing marriage & who should be appointed Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "italy he says that there is a couple and they have been married for five years no children and they're having lots of fights so in the ayah there is a um a command from allah azza 2 when things go really south to bring an arbitrator from his family and from her family so that they can sit and discuss as outsiders their point of view and try to reach a reconciliation now this is the last stage after we've tried everything and we have talked and talked without any use and benefit and it seems to us that divorce is the only remaining solution this is when these arbitrators come in to try to fix things who can it be usually it's the brother of the uh wife the father of the wife or whatever and someone who represents the husband from his side maybe a brother a father a cousin someone who can talk and put some sense into this situation i would personally recommend that they sit with a marriage counselor and i'm not advocating this for myself but this is something i've been doing for a while and i find a lot of benefit out of it alhamdulillah because you could choose anyone in your locality who is known with his wisdom and islamic knowledge to sit with you and hear from both sides so many times you hear women complain and you say to yourself this husband has to stand in front a firing squad but when you hear the allegations of the husband you say that the wife should be hanged and when you put them together after listening and learning exactly how their character is and what's their mindset you can easily point out and say sister this is right brother this is wrong you guys have to do the following if you want to continue because this is un-islamic from an islamic point of view so i would highly advise them to sit with a marriage counselor who would listen to both of them"
