  "title": "Does washing or carrying deceased corpse break Wudu? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "and finally washing the dead person this was abrogated and some people even go further and say that the hadith was not authentic so the vast majority say that you don't have to perform Woodill if you wash a dead corpse and you don't have to perform you do if you carry a dead man's corpse because they report the hadith that if you wash a dead man's body you have to perform also yourself and if you carry a dead man's body you have to perform Moodle but this is not true"
