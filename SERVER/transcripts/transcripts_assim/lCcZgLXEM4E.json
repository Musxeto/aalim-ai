  "transcript": "Janam um I just wanted to ask you um is it permissible to play Among Us it's it's like a game where um you have to pretend to be a murderer and you like kill people and you're like a Susy impostor and basically um people have to try to guess who the Killer is and it's based on lying so usually I don't like commenting on video games and games that are online as such because the amount of Haram is a lot in it and the people are so hooked into it that your answer might be quite weird to them now to me there are Essentials and important things and priorities in life are video games part of them no now when we are asked about video games and people say she there's a game that is based on hijacking or stealing or uh hotwiring a car and running away from police it's fun she can we play it I said these things in real life are they Halal or Haram it's Haram okay what about killing one another she We Are teams and we kill and shoot it's a shooting game and we kill one another and we hide in a maze and when we find our opponent we kill him and he has a name and we know him what's the ruling on killing in Islam she it's a game so if there's a game based on rape and you can keep on raping people is that fun it's a game no Haram in real life is Haram also in Virtual life because this is how you're brainwashed this is how you're set why do we say Allah Akbar more than 300 times times a day why do you say praise be to be be to Allah why do you say glorified is Allah this is heart washing not brainwashing because it elevates you and gets you closer to Allah the opposite is the same when you only listen to rap music that Praises killing and looting and drugs and women or you play Such games that legitimizes such Haram activities then this is what you end up doing and Allah Asel Knows Best"
