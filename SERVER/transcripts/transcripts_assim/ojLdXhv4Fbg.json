  "title": "Should I keep bothering my husband to pay Zakat on my Gold, and is he sinful for delaying",
  "transcript": "Udma from India My question is, if the wife is unable to sell her jewelry for any reason, some of it was stolen or sold, and it would cause her loss, and the amount of remaining zakat for earlier years may be more than the entire jewelry itself. So a family member who handles the house expenses speaks to the woman's husband who agrees to pay, but it's a big amount. And due to fear of mixed wealth, it was decided that he would pay monthly from active salary rather than collectively from account, as mother's salary won't contain interest, thus this would take very long. So if the relative, after guided by his scholar, later realizes that collective payment should have been finalized, but if anyone restarted the discussion again with the husband, he would get very frustrated and disturbed. So, due to fear of mixed wealth, so now should he be insisted on collective payment again, or is there any sin in monthly payment in this case? The zakat is over what? Gold? Yeah, gold. Where is the gold? Gold is there, but for the past few years, they had not paid that gold. Okay, this is not the husband's responsibility, the gold belongs to the wife, and she's the one who's being held accountable on the day of judgment, whether to go to hell or heaven, regarding not paying the zakat. So, she's not to go back to her husband and ask him for money, because it's not his responsibility. If he needed money, he would not take the gold and sell it and use it for his own needs. This is the wife's possession. She's ordered and instructed to go and sell some of the gold and give whatever is due for the previous years without him knowing about it, and Allah, Azza wa Jal, knows best. This is the wife's responsibility. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website, and you will find counseling sessions, and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session, and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So, come to me, and let's speak about it, inshaAllah, within the following two days or three days, and bi-idhnillah, Azza wa Jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
