  "transcript": "sam from france they give us a condition not to earn more than a certain limit a week or a certain limit a year if this condition is there sam usually it applies to either one not one of them so if i earn a hundred pounds a week instead of forty that's okay with them as long as the x the total over the year does not exceed x amount because sometimes i can earn 100 pounds a week and two three weeks i don't earn a thing so the total at the end of the year fits their requirements there's nothing wrong in that inshallah"
