  "transcript": "can you please explain how to wash the leg in W uh pouring water over it and thinking the water has reach most of the parts of the leg enough because it's specifically takes a bit more time for me to wash the leg in h it is totally unacceptable and inappropriate for me to put my leg up here my stretching ability is not as it used to be no stretching anymore so I I'll probably have a cramp or pull a muscle but if this is my foot little water in my hand washing my foot like this with the water would do most of us think that we have to overwhelm the water under the tap water uh we have to overwhelm our foot under the tap water so we open the tap and we just put the foot and twist it and do this and do this and do this and probably lose couple of gallons in the process and this is not from the Sunnah at all the pro Prophet used to perform woodo with something equivalent to this the whole limbs including the two feet so just putting this much water and doing this rubbing with that water you would say oh she but it covered only this this the underneath no this still wet it will cover the underneath and the sides and between the uh uh toes well enough inshallah this is sufficient now doing it three times is part of the Sunnah so if you need another scoop and to do it to repeat it that would definitely be more than sufficient and Allah Knows Best"
