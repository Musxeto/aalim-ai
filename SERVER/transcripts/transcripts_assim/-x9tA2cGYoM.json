  "title": "Do I track my monthly salary for zakat & do I pay zakat every year on savings (That I paid last year",
  "transcript": "I paid the cut on my savings last year uh so I receive a monthly salary and I added to my savings uh when calculating Z cut should I track each month's salary separately and do I need to pay Z cut again on the amount I already paid for last year it is difficult if not impossible to calculate the income on monthly basis especially for those who receive salaries or an allowance therefore the most safest opinion of all is to dedicate and designate a particular date in the hijri year so let's assume the 1 of rajab every year on the 1 of rajab depending on when you started to save and the money reached the threshold if it is the 1 of rajab you calculate what you have in your bank account and your savings and the likes the zable wealth and give 2.5% of whatever you have and sleep over it until the next year on The 1 of rajab you will do this again to all what you possess and some people think that if I have $100,000 and I give 2.5% 2,000 $500 zakat next year I don't have to give zakat on this amount because I gave it last year no the zakat is renewable every year you have to give zakat on whatever possessions that are zakat that you have"
