  "title": "Can I pray in Barelvi Masjid where Imam believes Prophet is created from Allah's Light (Noor)? Assim",
  "transcript": "hamza from pakistan there's a masjid that is run by brillvis and the imam says that the prophet is a light from allah's light and he does not pray there he prays in another message which is two kilometers away and he doesn't hear the adhan so what you're doing is totally right and correct you must not pray behind those who believe that allah created the prophet alice islam from his light this is kufar allah's light subhannah is one of his attributes and the prophet islam was created like every other human being from a father and from a mother and the origin of that is clay like our father adam peace be upon him so what you're doing is correct you should not you must not pray behind anyone who commits shirk or believes that the prophet has islam is a present in the whole world and he controls the universe like he controls the palm of his hand he moves things in this universe that what some of the extremists may think and they say that he's hazer nazer so he knows what we're doing he watches what we're doing and they're making him similar to allah's attributes this is shirk no no doubt in that so you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out that these people thinking are thinking of the prophet hassam as an allah subhana wa and then they reached this conclusion that well if he knows everything he controls everything and he predestines everything in this case he is from allah's light created from allah's life then he is allah at the end of the day um this is not a right thing to do so keep on walking the distance to that salafi masjid or to that muslim masjid it shouldn't be a salafi it can be a hanafi message it can be any masjid that the people or at least the imam has the correct akida doesn't commit any kuffur or shirk and allah you"
