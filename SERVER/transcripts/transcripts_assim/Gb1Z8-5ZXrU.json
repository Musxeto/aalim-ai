  "transcript": "oh [Music] Lord during the day we may hear things that please us and we may hear things that may not please us so what is the Sunnah well chapter 106 deals with this Hadith number 218. whenever the prophet Islam used to receive Pleasant news he would say alhamdulillah and remember we have to say the vicar in Arabic as this is what Allah will reward us for Allah prays or all praise is for Allah by whose favor good works are accomplished alhamdulillah but upon receiving this pleasing news the prophet used to say alhamdulillah all Praises for Allah in all circumstances so what's the difference the first one we praise Allah that such good Works were accomplished by his favor azzawajal while when receiving bad news we still praise Allah azzawajal over all circumstances whether good or bad and this by the way is a very delicate difference between praising Allah al-hand and thanking Allah a sugar so many people say What's the difference you thank Allah as well as others when they do good things for you so someone gives me money I say thank you Allah and he has the highest example grants me provision or blesses me with a child I say thank you o Allah this is shukur or showing your gratitude al-hemmed to praise is not done and said because someone did something for you something good rather you're praising a person or above all you're praising Allah due to his attributes due to his characteristics and beauty so it's regardless whether Allah gives you something or not he's always praised on all circumstances and this is a very delicate difference that we should pay attention to the following chapter deals with the Excellence of sending prayers upon the prophet Allah whenever you hear his name offer salutation say Allah now Hadith 219 the prophet Allah said whoever sends a prayer upon me Allah sends ten upon him what does what does it mean when it's from Allah because here Allah sends 10 prayers upon you you you individual when Allah prays or usually this means that Allah mentions your name upon the Angels the congregation subhanahu wa ta'ala which is a sufficient honor for you and when the angels pray upon you or upon the prophet Islam they make Dua so this is the prayer that is intended whenever you say Allah Muhammad Allah will mention you ten times and he will pray upon you ten times Hadith 2 20. the prophet said Allah do not take my grave as a place of Habitual ceremony the Arabic word is read and I'll come to explain this send prayers upon me for verily your prayers reach me wherever you are so two parts the first part do not come frequently To My Grave why the prophet Allah is protecting to heed what's wrong in visiting his grave what does the hate have to do with visiting his grave there is no connection yes there is a great deal of connection read by the way in Arabic as we know it is something that returns either time-bound or location bound time bound we know we have we have idle filter two reads two celebrations events that we celebrate annually as Muslims so this is time bound but also we have location bound which is a place that you on and off visit frequently and this is what the prophet Isis on prohibited us from doing he told us do not take my grave as a place or a location that you come and visit frequently as people do why people think that if you're closer to the Grave the closer you are in delivering your Salam and this is wrong because the other part of the Hadith where the Prophet isab says and pray over me wherever you are because your prayer will reach me means that if you're in China if you're in the U.S they who are in these remote areas when they offer salutation upon the prophet Salaam it will reach him exactly in the same fashion as that of a person standing next to his grave because this is something of the Unseen it is not something that we can relate to and this is why we don't have to shout we just say Allah and it would reach him so this is a very delicate issue that many people Overlook they think that no I have to fly all over to Medina to visit his grave and offer my salutation not only that people even convey their salaams oh you're going to Medina please convey my salaam to the prophet is this is an innovation you wherever you are offer salutation it reaches the prophet Islam you don't have to convey it through others as this is not from the Sunnah and it is a clear innovation this is all the time we have until we meet next time I leave you here [Music] here"
