  "transcript": "um Miriam says is it from the Sunnah to perform two units of prayer after which tell BIA is recited three times loud signifying the entrance into a Haram some of you may hear this and think this is a puzzle what is it I'll tell you a Haram is a state which means that I with my intention enter in in order to perform Umrah or to perform hajj and how is this done it is done by the Sunnah having a ritual bath and then wearing for a man the two towels the upper and the lower garment and then make the intention in the heart that now I am in the state of a Haram the Sunnah is to verbally say that tell via Lebec allahumma Umrah but this is not obligatory this does not affect your ROM so I said it now verbally does this mean that I'm a mother I'm no Lebec ilaha mama no problem it's just liquor the Sunnah is to do this intention after a prayer and when people read in the books of trip that the Sunnah is to make your Haram after a prayer they say ok we prayed as her and I did not make my harm I went back home I took a shower I wore my clothes for harm I'd like to make a hump there is no sooner after a sir so what to do some people advised one another pray to soon a voluntary and make your harem afterwards yes but what is this - sinners they say these two rehearsin of Haram so they've invented a new prayer and called it solitude ROM or ricotta le Haram and there is no such thing in Islam so what you do well simply if you are leaving after the you wear your garments don't make any intention go to the Masjid pray over her then pray Sunnah if you want to present if you don't want to present after the her prayer celibate Elohim Umbra and intent with your heart that I'm in the state of a harem now Oh Miriam said that we should recite this three times lebec Elohim Umbra loudly in order to signify the entrance in the state of a harem and this is an innovation it's not part of the Sunnah first of all saying it is a Sunnah so if I don't say it no problem your Army's valid saying it three times definitely is out of the question because there's no hadith stating this saying it loudly it soon and so that you can hear yourself and maybe let others know about it however the state of a Haram is an intention so I can have a shower I can wear my garments of a Haram and I look like a mushroom but then I said hmm tell you what I'll postpone it to next week take off my hump wear my normal clothes no problem it's an intention the moment I put Rahman is not does not mean I am wearing the minute in my heart I said okay now I'm in the city of Aram which signifies that if someone comes and said share put some rude some perfume I said nope I'm in the city of ashram why don't you clip your nails I'm in a city of a Haram why don't you put a cap or something I'm in a city where um these are all prohibited in forum to do in this case yes you are in the state of a Haram so I hope this answers your question"
