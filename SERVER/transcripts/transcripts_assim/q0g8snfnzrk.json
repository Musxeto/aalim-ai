  "transcript": "Questioner: Umm Hamza from Bosnia-Herzegovina: \nCan you demonstrate how to recite in loud prayers?   Well I'm praying at night prayer and \nI'm praying alone and I say like this   Allahuakbar, Alhamdulillahi Rabbil ‘aalameen, \nAr-Rahmaanir-Raheem, Maliki Yawmi-Deen so I hear myself, those in the room \nhear me, outside of the room they don't.   What is not permissible is to say: \nAlhamdulillahi Rabbil ‘aalameen (LOUD VOICE) You'll wake the whole \nneighborhood. No, this is not   recommended and it's also not recommended \nto just go like (reciting silently) because you have to raise \nit and make it in between   so Alhamdulillahi Rabbil ‘aalameen, \nAr-Rahmaanir-Raheem, this is perfect."
