  "transcript": "Ibn Naeem from Pakistan So I have this question written down, I'm going to read it out. No don't, come on Ibn Naeem, you're going to read it, it's going to consume the rest of the time of the episode. Just say what's on your mind without reading it. Okay fine fine Sheikh. I had a dream some time ago and during the ghusl, I found clots of semen on my leg hair, not the skin. So during the ghusl, I poured water over it and assumed that it was like you know washed away. After the ghusl, I found out that the clots of semen, they're very small, they're still on the hair. It might wasn't valid. It is valid and it has no impact and Allah knows best."
