  "transcript": "foreign Ty of eating at McDonald's or Burger King in the west and this has caused a lot of controversy among the laymen in which uh reputable dies even have been put on the spot to try to refute this fatwa in which they claim that they have had actually seen in slaughterhouses how animals were being killed and which they claimed that they saw with their own eyes that chickens were being killed with a nail gun and that this is dead meat and this this meat goes to various fast food chains now the question is um and many of the laymen in the comments sections and there's people making videos of this you know they're saying that America is not even a Christian country as they separated the state from church and majority of America are atheists so again what defines a Christian country I mean we don't even know the religion of the butcher or how the animal was slaughtered okay I I got your question inshallah and I will answer it but unfortunately this may take a while and unfortunately people have the tendency to jump the gun and this is not wise and this is not logical if you don't know you should ask well this goes the same for you if you did not know you should also ask okay I agree so let us look at the meats the meat of animals that we're allowed to eat now we're not talking about pork because this is known to all that is Haram we're not talking about dogs or Lions and the likes because we know this is we're talking about the normal uh beef mutton and buffaloes and camels and the likes how can we eat such meat one it has to be slaughtered two the slaughterer the butcher has to be either a Muslim or someone who's a Jew or a Christian only these three denominations nothing else three we have to make sure that or at least we have to not know whether the name of other than Allah was mentioned or not so if we look at these conditions we will find that number one Allah azzawajal mentioned in the Quran in Ayah number five chapter number five that today foreign were made Halal for you and the meat that was slaughtered by the people of the book as even Abbas may Allah peace with him and his father made gave the tafsir of so we know that whatever meat that is slaughtered by the people of the book is halal for us to consume another verse says do not eat from what the name of Allah was not mentioned over so people say ah we don't know if the name of Allah was mentioned over this slaughtering or not no problem there's an authentic Hadith where the Prophet is asked by a group of his companions there are people who send us meat and we don't know whether they mentioned the name of Allah or not clear Hadith we don't know the prophet said Allah you mentioned the name of Allah meaning before you eat you say Bismillah and it the prophet did not ask them to go and check that would have been the easiest thing to do you don't know they mentioned the name of Allah ask them no the prophet did not ask them to ask so this is the name of Allah now when Allah tells us that the meat which was slaughtered by the people of the book the prophet did not ask them to investigate did you Slaughter or not some would say he should we don't have to ask Sheikh this is the default people of the book they meat they eat it should be slaughtered whether they slaughtered it or not we don't have to ask and this is what I mean stated may Allah have mercy on his soul either we know that surely this was not slaughtered and it was killed through other means of slaughtering other than slaughtering such as if we know that a country like Belgium for example they have a regulation that no slaughterhouse can Slaughter they have to Electrify until the animal is totally Cold Stone dead or bang it on the head with a hammer until it's dead not alive and this is a regulation a rule in the country no one can defy it in this case eating meat there is Haram because we know but if there isn't such a law and some may do this some may not should I investigate says if you know for certain that this was not slaughtered it's Haram for you to eat if you know for certain that it was slaughtered by a Muslim a Jew or a Christian it is halal for you to eat if number three you don't know whether it was slaughtered or not but the country you're in is predominantly a Christian country then you eat without asking why don't I have to investigate says no because the prophet did not order us Allah to investigate when the companions came and say said o prophet of Allah there are people whether Muslims or people of the book that bring us food and we don't know whether they mentioned the name of Allah on it or not he said you mentioned the name of Allah and eat so now we come to problem number one Sheikh there are slaughterhouses that hit the animal on the head before cutting it into pieces and I've seen this with my own eyes I'll say okay number one can you testify in front of Allah that all slaughterhouses in L.A or in New York City do not Slaughter that they all kill the animal called dead before cutting it and and chopping it can you testify in front of Allah I said no I went to 10 of them how many left or maybe a thousand chick so you cannot generalize in Islam we can't generalize by assumption this is point number one number two there are many slaughterhouses in the states and elsewhere where they would Electrify the animals so that it would stun it not kill it it can be handled it makes it drowsy and they can Slaughter it without a problem this is halal it's not that yes if it was electrified until it was dead totally then slaughtered this is Haram if it was a hit on the head with a needle over there and a hammer and it was killed then slaughtered this is Haram I agree but this is not the default the default is whatever Christians come and present us with is until proven otherwise okay one other doubt which the sister mentioned these countries are not Christian how do you say this because so many of them are atheists in the Constitution that the president has to be Christian whether Catholic or Protestant doesn't make a difference so this is what's mentioned in the Constitution and the they are predominantly Christians yeah yeah but they say they're Christians but they're not Sheikh I'm not supposed to give a placement test for each and every slaughterhouse answer these questions to verify whether they're Christians or not what are they Christians ask anyone the UK the US Europe they're Christians there are huge amounts of atheists but that does not reverse the rule Allah says it's permissible for you to eat the meat that was slaughtered by the people of the book he didn't go and say ask and make it a a survey whether they're Christians or not likewise if I go to Pakistan predominantly Muslims there are non-muslims deviant groups mushriks without calling the sex and cults grave worshipers kafir so hmm what about turkey a secular country 10 15 Alois atheists don't know the Quran don't know even the direction of the Qibla I can't eat in Turkey oh no no it's a predominantly Muslim country um they're Muslims okay how would I know that they're practicing Muslims or grave worshipers or non-muslims again the default is they're Christians they're people of the book and the Beautiful Thing is verse 5 Surah 5 mentions two things the meat slaughtered by the people of the book and the women of the people of the book and in both it says we are allowed to consume the meat slaughtered and we're allowed to marry women from the Christianity and Jewish beliefs now are you going to say the same thing when a man comes to you and says Marrying an American woman or a British or a German would you say no they're not Christians or would you ask him to make a placement test or would you say okay yeah they're Christians it's okay touche it's the same thing same concept okay but they did not mention the name of Allah Scholars said that what was meant by the Ayah is that you do not hear other than the name of Allah mentioned in the name of Jesus in the name of Buddha in the name of this and that oh now it becomes Haram for sure because likewise all meet slaughtered in Muslim countries I do not go to slaughterhouses and say let me hear you say the name of Allah or I'm not going to eat the meat I go to any restaurant in the Muslim world and I eat in there without saying oh I didn't hear them say the name of Allah maybe the guy is a Muslim but he forgot or he said in the name of Ali Hussein I don't know so I'll refrain you are making life difficult after all of this I don't know if I missed anything but after all of this if you don't want to eat good for you I have no problem actually I haven't been to the states for 40 years and to tell you the truth McDonald's is not neat to me it's Plastics but that doesn't mean I'm endorsing you to eat there if you feel that no I'd rather be safe rather than sorry there are so many Halal Outlets good for you eat there but don't look down at people who follow Scholars and I'm telling you I didn't I don't shoot from the hip this is the fact that I mean and they said that you go and eat in these countries without asking this is Islamic verdict according to the Quran and to the Sunnah the prophet himself was invited by a Jew woman and she prepared a ram for him and he ate without asking her about their income or about whether it was killed by another a blow from another Ram or she it fell from a mountain or a drowned the prophet just said Bismillah ate one would say oh because the Jews are known to eat kosher meat and they have to have rituals Etc this is what you say what about the Jews who are not practicing Jews would you eat I said most likely it's kosher most likely we don't act like this we have defaults Islam is the religion of ease and simplicity now you want to eat halal food good for you I'm not telling you no you have to go to KFC or to Burger King no keep on going and eating Halal but if you see me or someone else following the factor of Scholars and following the thought process that I've just explained to you in black and white it's so easy you don't look down at them and say oh your Dua is not going to be answered because you're eating nunzabiha and Halal and it's with all due respect I don't buy this but again this is my stance and my point of view according to the scholars my Scholars show me what and who you're following according to the teaching in the Quran and the Sunnah according to the default otherwise remember turkey and Pakistan remember those who are grave worshipers remember marrying Christian women in these countries whether you're going to deal with it in the same fashion and if you deal with it in the same fashion we have a big problem not of takvir the people of the book but this would be cascaded upon the Muslims you will not consider to be Muslim until you give me a placement test let me check checks and this and that and that that's Houston we do have a problem Allah Knows Best"
