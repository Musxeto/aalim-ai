  "title": "Impurity on clothes AFTER washing, rewash all clothes?",
  "transcript": "bought from India actually right now I'm I'm confused my question is regarding Purity actually I found something like Mars that actually was Muzzy on my trouser which I watched two three months ago now I am thinking let's assume if it's impurity and it's not gone while washing so what about other clothes that I washed with that trouser in the machine do I have to watch them again or I have to watch that trouser only what is the cause of your confusion did you not wash off the impurity yes I washed it back in the washing machine for one hour 16 minutes but after I uh three months I found right now there is something much on my trousers okay this might be something else this might be the detergents themselves you know the soap used sometimes after washing it remains traces of the soap uh on your trousers or your underwears and they look white so people think that this is traces of methi and it's not so ignore this as long as you had washed it in the washing machine that purifies it because methi is not strong in impurity that's why we don't have to wash it thoroughly like we do with urine rather sprinkle water or just run water over it that would suffice insha Allah"
