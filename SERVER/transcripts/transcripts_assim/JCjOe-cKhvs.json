  "title": "Is it prohibited to look at the Kabah while doing tawaf? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Farha sent us a question saying I saw a YouTube video in that one a scholar said you should not look at the Kaaba while doing Tawaf is this right first of all a lot of the people think that looking at the Teta Kaaba and the Kaaba is the cubic structure the black cubic structure in the noble Masjid of al-haram in Mecca this is where every single Muslim direct their faces to wherever they are in the world when they pray it's a symbol of unity also every single deceased is buried in his grave on his right side facing the cab the direction of Kaaba so it is our direction when we are alive and when we die it's a symbolic gesture form of our obedience to Allah who tells us to face wherever he wants in the beginning Muslims used to pray facing Jerusalem and later on it was shifted 180 degrees and they were ordered to face the Kaaba we comply no questions asked this is a test a form of expression of obedience to allah azza wajal unlike satan he was ordered to prostrate to Adam he refrained why it's not logical I am better than him you created me from fire and you created Adam from clay and fire is better than clay I'm not gonna prostrate he is in hell for eternity so this is what the Kappa is now Muslims know that we do no one worships the Kaaba then why do you prostrate to it why do you pray to it well it's not a god it's just a structure it can be demolished and rebuilt it can be renovated like was done couple of years ago people can climb on top of the Kaaba they can walk inside it they can walk on top of it no one does this with is God so it is not a God that we worship but we were ordered to pray to our God to Allah in its direction that is it in Hajj and in Umbra we go round it seven times and this is a pillar in Umbra and a pillar in hatch it's part of the hatch has is invalid without it now the Sunnah and what is mandatory is when you go anti-clockwise you leave it to your left and this is what most probably for her misunderstood from that scholar she saw a YouTube and heard this information from looking at the Kaaba while doing Tawaf is permissible but it is it sooner the answer is no is it more rewarding the answer is no what do you mean she isn't looking at the Kaaba a form of worship answers no whoever claims that looking at the Kaaba is a form of worship must provide the evidence from the Quran the Sunnah so people say that it is equivalent to 70 pilgrimages baseless people say that looking at the faces of your parents and smiling gives you so much reward baseless though people circulate it but it doesn't mean it's authentic or true so going around the kaabah and Tawaf and looking at it is permissible but it's not from the Sunnah and it's not reward of what is not permissible is to totally face the Kaaba while going through it so I'm obliged it's mandatory to leave the Kaaba to my left while doing Tawaf if I don't leave it to my left and I face it then my Tawaf is invalid of course I'd be weird walking sideways like a crab but if you do this your power off is invalid because you're facing the kaabah while you should leave the Kaaba to your left but looking at it there is no problem in that and I hope this answers your question you"
