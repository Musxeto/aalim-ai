  "title": "Should a woman work to secure future in case husband dies or children can't provide for her?",
  "transcript": "Farooqi from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa'alaikumussalam I don't want to work. I want to stay home and earn a living. I want my husband to provide for me, but what if my husband is ill? Then I have nobody who will take care of me. I will be alone. So tell me to find a job concerning about future and I have to get a job now. Because after getting old, it will be hard to get a job. I want to get a job later. So should I start doing job now or trust Allah that will provide me and my husband long life? You have to trust Allah Azza Wa Jal and believe that everything has pre-written, has been pre-divinely decreed by Allah Azza Wa Jal. Your rizq is pre-prescribed, pre-decreed. Everything has been written down. Having these anxiety and panic attacks, what if my husband dies? What if my children can't provide for me? And building and basing things on that is not logical. So if you are living now in your father's home, Alhamdulillah he is well off, he is providing for you, you don't need to work, don't work. Because if work means that you go and free mix with men, compromise your hijab, chit-chat and socialize, and be forced to use the public transport with all its evils and demons, then definitely this is not something halal. Once there is a need and a necessity, you trust Allah Azza Wa Jal and you minimize the sin to the best of your ability and work. Because there is a necessity. You don't have someone to provide for you, your father, your siblings, no one. Then you are forced to do this. But don't start to put obstacles when there are no need for such obstacles. Trust Allah Azza Wa Jal. Once you get married, ask Allah that your husband is a real man, and not like those new so-called men who insist on their wives taking a job. Not only that, in sharing the expenses of the house and the marriage, which is unmanly, let alone un-Islamic, and Allah knows best."
