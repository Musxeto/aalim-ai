  "transcript": "[Music] and we continue in the books that deal with the food what is specifically forbidden to eat and we talked last time about general things that are permissible to eat and we limit now the things that we're not supposed to eat which is much easier than saying what are we allowed to eat the things that we are allowed to eat are so many with the grace of allah azzawajal that are beyond our ability to calculate because everything that allah has created is halal to us and what is haram is very limited so when a non-muslim asks you what can muslim eat the easiest answer would be everything except whatever allah has prohibited that's it but if you're going to mention just the fruits there are hundreds of them and it will take you ages so when we come to speak about what allah has specifically prohibited as a virgin we will find a verse in chapter five verse number three where allah azzawajal mentions to us in details some of the things that are prohibited for us to eat allah says prohibited to you are dead animals blood the flesh of swine and that which has been dedicated to other than allah and those animals killed by strangling or by a violent blow or by a headlong fall or by the gorging of horns and those from which a wild animal has eaten except what you are able to slaughter before its death and those which are sacrificed on stone altars so these are ten types of food that allah has prohibited for us muslims to consume so the first one is the dead animals the carrion and this refers to any animal that has died without us muslims slaughtering it of course the people of the book take the ruling of our slaughtering as well or without it being hunted if it's a game so any animal you would find that if it's not slaughtered by the people of the book or a muslim and if it is not hunted as a game in this case it is a dead animal carrion that is not permissible for us to consume and this is the general rule and trend except for two types and that is seafood and the locust so the prophet himself ali his also said to us it was made prohibited for it was made permissible for us two types of dead and two types of blood so the dead he mentioned to us seafood and the locust we know that hunt that fishing is permissible and that is when we throw our nets when we throw our hooks and we fish a fish there's no problem in that the problem is what if the fish was floating on the sea or it's on the shores and it's dead by itself the hadith clearly indicates that this is halal for us the second type is the blood and what is meant by the blood this refers to spilled blood blood that comes out of an animal allah azza says in the quran i do not find anything forbidden to eat unless it be carrion or blood poured forth and lots of the people may know and may not know that there are people there are nations there are tribes such in mongolia and and elsewhere where they slaughtered the goat or the ram or the any animal they want to eat and they collect the blood in a vessel and they either cook it or drink it or do whatever they want with it this is totally haram it's najis it's prohibited in islam and this of course excludes two things as mentioned in the hadith earlier and that is the liver and the spleen these two are internal organs of an animal yet they consist entirely of blood nevertheless the prophet said these are halal for us to consume now a lot of the muslims get confused sometimes so when they eat steak and they cut it they find that there is light blood coming out of it and they can see traces on their plates so they ask is does this render our food haram that is no what is haram it was what gushes from the slaughtered animal and this is nudges what remains in the veins what remains in the meat itself when it's cooked when it's cut and comes out this does not impact it this does not affect it it is pure and it is halal to consume number three the flesh of swine and anything that is from a swine is haram whether it is its flesh its milk and the majority of scholars would consider it to be haram as well to use it's lard and other things because this is part of the meat itself so a swine a pig a pork all of this is haram and it is prohibited for the muslims to consume reasons many scientists have proven that it is one of the most dangerous meat to consume and there are so many illnesses in it as muslims we don't even have to look into such evidences because it's simply mentioned in the quran and the prophet has mentioned it number four that which has been dedicated to other than allah so if an animal was dedicated to other than allah it was slaughtered for jesus christ it was slaughtered for prophet muhammad it was slaughtered for the jinn there are practices that people may do without noticing maybe they do but it's in the back of their minds that is when people start to build a building and they dig down an earth to set the foundation while setting the foundation a lot of the laymen come and slaughter a sheep and they put the blood of the slaughter sheep on the pillars of these foundations not knowing that this act by itself is a sacrifice for the jinn the people do this so that the jinn would not in fast not haunt this house not harm the people in the who are to live in this house and all of this is major shift because slaughtering can only be to allah azza for the sake of allah so if someone says that i'm slaughtering for the sake of the prophet muhammad he says or for the sake of jesus christ peace be upon him all of this is shirk this particular animal is dead meat we cannot eat it we cannot use it we have to throw it in the dustbin or better more we can feed it to the dogs and to the beasts but not suitable for human consumption number five the animal that has been strangled and this is called so if an animal dies through being suffocated strangled not able to breathe then this becomes a dead animal did meat it's haram to eat and in some nations they use this form to kill an animal i know uh of some of the non-muslims in i think korea or in the philippines when we had a lot of them working here in saudi arabia we had a lot of stray dogs and all of a sudden no dogs at all in our streets which was good but then we discovered that they consume it they eat it and they consider it as a delicacy and what they do is they catch the dog they tie a string of metal in one pole and then they bring the dog and they tie it around each neck and then they pull as strong as they can so it snaps i think maybe the neck and at the same time it strangles the animal and then they can feast on it so this is of course done by non-muslims because we don't eat dogs to begin with it's haram for muslims to eat dogs but at the same time this way of killing the animal if it's a halal animal it makes it haram if you place a bag over the head of an animal until it dies and suffocates this is considered to be number six i think is by violent blow or beaten to death and this is known as and this type of killing is found nowadays in butcher houses around the world so when they get a big animal such as a cow or a bull they would strike it on the head on a specific area with a hammer and this would kill the animal and then afterwards they cut it they slaughter it this is known as and it is haram for muslims to consume and after that an animal that was killed by a fall and this is known as so if an animal fell of a cliff and it died then this becomes haram for us to eat because it died by itself by such a fall or by a blow or by suffocation it was not slaughtered so this is called an uh al-mutarat and this is haram for us to eat then an animal gorge gourd to death by another animal and dies and this is called an natija so if two rams started a fight over a female during the mating season and one of them is severely injured we cannot eat from it unless it is still alive and we managed to slaughter it mentioning the name of allah before it dies if it's dead then it's dead we cannot touch it consume it or eat it after that we have an animal which a wild animal has eaten or savaged by a beast of prey so we are at the wild we see a herd of zebras and then we see one wild cat a lion a leopard attacking it consuming some of it or just killing it and running away when it saw us can we eat this zebra answer is no this is prohibited because it was not slaughtered unless of course if we come and find that there is life in it still then we can slaughter it and we can eat it and this is mentioned in the quran and i think finally or the number 10 animals which are sacrificed on stone altars so what's the difference between this and number four which is animals that has been dedicated to other than allah it seems to me that animals dedicated to other than allah can be slaughtered anywhere by mentioning other than allah's name so if you say in the name of freedom in the name of solidarity i slaughtered this sheep in the name of unity of our country in the name of jesus christ in the name of muhammad in the name of so-and-so this becomes dead meat but animals that are slaughtered as a form of sacrifice or at stone altars even if you mention the name of allah it becomes haram because the area itself is where people offer their sacrifice to such gods and being there with them and doing their action renders your meat that you had slaughtered of this animal haram as well in sahih muslim a man came to the prophet and he said o prophet of allah i vowed i made a pledge to slaughter a camel in the area known as bowana so the prophet asked him i some two questions so the prophet said to him is there any idol that is being worshipped and i said no the significance of such a question is that if there is an idol if you slaughter there the vast majority would only think that you are slaughtering for their idol and hence this is haram so this is the difference that seems to me and allah azzawajal knows best so this is type number one of the things that allah has prohibited upon us type number two as per the um the book food or drink that are harmful these are haram so you cannot consume poison you cannot consume wine or any type of intoxicants or narcotic drugs because allah says in the quran do not with your own hands throw yourselves in ruin and allah also says do not kill yourselves [Music] so killing yourself harming yourself is prohibited in islam there isn't any such thing as i'm free i can do whatever i want no you're not you can't if you want to commit suicide it's your body but you are not entitled or permitted to do so in this life we'll throw you in in jail in the hereafter you'll go to hell so there isn't anything as such i'm free in other countries their ceiling of freedom is pretty high but your freedom ends when it intrudes and trespasses on my own freedom so you want to take off your clothes be my guest do that in the vicinity of your own home if you do it in public you are intruding and transgressing and trespassing over my own freedom because i'm free not to see such heinous sceneries so you cannot harm yourself by consuming such haram substances number three it's forbidden to eat any part cut from a living animal so yes we have halal animals such as sheep cows and camels if someone does not slaughter these animals rather he amputates a part of it saying bismillah does it become halal that organ that he has amputated the answer is no and this is done to some animals like sheep for example and they have big tails with lots of um fat in it so they cut it off this is haram the prophet said that whatever is cut off when the animal is alive is maeta that meat is forbidden so this is torturing the animal without any justifiable reason and at the same time it is haram for us to consume that part number four among the things that are prohibited for us as muslims are predators such as lions tigers leopards wolves be pleased with them said that the prophet prohibited eating the flesh of any beast with canine teeth so any animal that has a teeth which attacks other animals with is prohibited for us to consume even if we slaughter or hunt with the exception of one particular animal and we will talk about that later on in sha allah so foxes wolves lions leopards tigers all of these are prohibited for us dogs cats are prohibited for us to consume their meat and its dead meat and its ninjas its impure similarly number five birds which catch their prey with their claws so predator birds such as eagles falcons kites olds all of these are prohibited for us to hunt and to eat well actually hunting is okay but it's not for eating so you may hunt it to use it while alive in catching other prey like in the case of eagles maybe falcons they're trained to be hunters like hounds that go and fish so in in such cases yeah this can be accepted but eating them is definitely out of the question number six scavenger birds such as vultures ravens and crows because they feed on what is unwholesome and also they have claws of their own as well some of these were instructed we are instructed by the sharia laws to kill such as the cross and cross some scholars said that this is only for a specific type of cross and others said no it's every type of crows so some said the crows that are totally black with white lines around their neck maybe or feet something these are to be killed and it seems that they should all be killed because the crows that are scavengers and eat that meat we see them in the streets where i come from and sometimes they may attack people when they see something glittering or just for the sake of fun and also the crows that feed only on vegetation which we usually find in farms and that's why we have scarecrows where they erect something that would make the cross afraid of coming in and these also destroy crops and destroy the hard work of farmers so it seems that both should be killed at allano's best either way they cannot be consumed we cannot consume their meat number seven any animal we are recommended to kill such as snakes scorpions mice and kite the prophet five harmful animals may be killed even in the haram and he mentioned the crawl the kite the scorpion the mouse and the predatory dog so these animals we are instructed in sharia to kill them hence we cannot eat them so the rule is anything that we're ordered to kill generally speaking we cannot eat and anything we are prohibited from killing we are also not allowed to eat such as such as uh the frogs and we will come to mention this in a while insha allah azza number eight domestic donkeys so donkeys in the beginning of time of islam they were like goats and cows we can slaughter them and we can eat them this ruling was abrogated on the seventh year of hijrah known as amuhiber and the prophet there prohibited the consumption of domestic donkeys number nine what is disgusting to eat such as mice well mice were ordered to kill snakes snakes we are ordered to kill wasps and bees bees we are prohibited to kill allah azzawajal says he forbids them all that is foul so this is an issue of taste some cultures might be okay in some cultures it might be haram so what counts is whether it's harmful or not some people consider for example um eating the desert lizard disgusting our prophet did not eat it iso did this render it to be harambe says so scholars mention that this type of prohibition is for things that are despicable such as ants such as roaches and we know that people in so claimed a region here or there because of eating bats or eating roaches and mice and other horrible reptiles such as snakes this is why we've got the corona virus and this is unproven yet but nevertheless islam is a religion of purity and such animals such insects are not [Music] suitable for human consumption number 10 any animal that feeds mostly on impurities and this is known as so whether it is a camel an ox sheep chicken or any other and even um used to confine such animals for three days before slaughtering so if an animal only eats impurities thesises this is all what it eats this some scholars say uh uh consider it to be haram to consume so we cannot slaughter it and if we slaughter it it's dead meat why because they say it its consumption is entirely over impurities other scholars say no we have to look whether the impurities affected and impacted that animal so the milk becomes impure the meat becomes stinking and disgusting that you cannot eat then it becomes haram but the vast majority of chicken would eat feces this is not their entire diet but it is included in their diet so it seems that only if the entire diet of such an animal was from impure filthy things and that it is affected and impacted the color the milk the meat of such an animal which would render okay what about when there is no ruling given so we see a raccoon for example i don't know what raccoons eat we see chipmunks what is the ruling on such animals well if this animal does not fall under the the guidelines the general guidelines of the ten types we've mentioned which are haram to consume such as being canines it says being among the things we were ordered to kill or not to kill etc if it does not fall under these general guidelines the quran says it is he who created for all for you all that is on earth it falls under the general guidance of it becoming halal so the default is it's pleased with him said that the prophet sallam said whenever allah has permitted in his book whatever allah has permitted in his book is lawful and whatever he has prohibited is forbidden what he has not mentioned is left to you so accept from allah what he has given you for allah would not forget anything he then recited the verse that says never does your lord forget anything and this is why it is an issue of dispute whether crocodiles and alligators are haram or not some scholars say it is haram because it has teeth i don't know if they can call it canine or not that attacks pray with and eats them others say no it is part of seafood in sea creatures and hence it's halal to consume because he sees that it is not clearly mentioned to be haram so it is part of what allah has not mentioned and has forgiven us so allah did not forget it we would accept what allah has given us so this is one of the ways of looking at issues of dispute and allah azza knows best and uh also um it's mentioned that uncooked onions or garlic uh that give bad breath are prohibited when a person is going to prayer so actually they're not prohibited they're halal all the way but if a person consumes it then going to the masjid for him would be prohibited because this would offend worshipers and it also would offend the angels as we were told in the authentic hadith of the prophet we move on to animal slaughter and muslims are not allowed to eat anything everything has to be done through a procedure so it's not any meat that we can eat and this perhaps not nicely it's not any meat that we can eat and the meat we can eat it has to be processed in a specific way it has been slaughtered and the one who slaughters it has to have specific characteristics and the tool he uses must be also following the procedures so in islam it is governed and this is only when it comes to meat so any uh veg food you have no problem with that whether the person cooking it is a hindu or a sikh or a buddhist it's a veg food no problem you can eat it so the one who plucks it from the tree is an atheist no problem it does not impact the food the one who cooks meat also does not impact the food so if the chef is a buddhist or an atheist agnostic without any religion if he is cooking halal meat his cooking is permissible what is not permissible is how you got this meat so was it slaughtered who was it slaughtered by how it was slotted etc so when we come to animal slaughter it has to be done in a specific fashion you cannot just slash the animal and make it bleed from all parts of bodies then you eat it this is dead meat carrion so these conditions or ways of us to consume an animal is one to slaughter it that is by cutting the throat and the jugular veins and this is done by the usually saying bismillah and you slaughtered the neck of the animal number two is known in arabic and anahar means the neck and the upper chest area this is called anahar you can't see it because of the beard alhamdulillah and this is usually done with camels you know camels have long necks and then the necks their neck is connected with the chest this area here a specific area the way of slaughtering such animals is to tie its uh front leg one of them and we say this and we stab the animal in this area this is four camels and this would make it die swiftly and quickly while most of the blood in the body would come out gushing like a fountain and the third way that is halal to kill an animal is when the animal is either wild or it is uncontrollable so we will talk about the wild animal when we speak about hunting but for example if we have a camel that is attacking everyone an animal on steroids so strong so powerful hitting and running and biting and well there is a hadith which was reported by rafael khadij may i love pleased with him as he said a camel went wild but a man hit him with an arrow which restricted his movement the prophet as some said some of these domestic animals run wild like beasts if any of yours gets wild do the same as you have seen so the man did not slaughter the camel he hunted it down so if i have a sheep in my barn and i take my six gauge shotgun and i shoot it and it dies can i eat it the answer is no because this is to be slaughtered not to be hunted down but if for example i unfortunately get a cow falling into a well or into a ditch and we cannot get it out of there and definitely we cannot slaughter it in this case we say bismillah and we try to cut it into pieces and take it and this would become halal because we are killing it in this way so that we can take its body out of the well at the same time not waste the meat so it has the same ruling of this wild camel that ran away and became on steroids attacking and hitting others so conditions for proper splattering i think we will we'll stop here inshallah and okay and try to finish the rest next week which is monday and we will take as many questions as we can we have very little questions or very few maybe 10 so hopefully the admins would send this for next week and much much more so that we may divide the extra class which was supposed to be dedicated for questions maybe we divide it into half after the session and half after the second session um zait says why an adulterer who was previously married is stoned to death so maybe what zade is saying is i understand that if a person is married and he commits adultery that he should be stoned to death i understand this but if a person is a widow or he's divorced why would he be stoned to death why not being flogged a hundred lashes like any fornicator because he doesn't have a wife so sort of he is trying to find justification or legitimacy or an ex excuse for this adulterer well this ruling is from allah and it may not sound logical to you but also it did not sound logical to satan to iblis when allah ordered him to prostrate to adam logically i am better than adam you created me from fire and created him from clay and you we know what happened to him afterwards because of his logic so i understand where you're coming from you may say to yourself okay a man who has never ever got married in his life yet he is an international playboy he fornicates with all women he meets if he's caught red-handed what to do the answer is flog him 100 lashes okay what about if a person married a woman and he stayed with her only for one night consummated the marriage and then she died or she sought divorce and they got separated the man stayed 10 years without any sexual interaction and then he fell into sin and had intercourse with a woman and was caught right-handed or confessed what should we do with him stone him to death so your question is is it fair an international playboy who had sexual encounter with thousands of women and only being flogged 100 lashes well this poor man only had a single night with a wife who either died or separated from him and after 10 years he fell into haram relationship and was caught we execute him the answer is yes some scholars say that the difference is that a person who was not married all of his sexual encounters did not fulfill the emptiness in his soul and it was all relationships that had no legitimacy while a person who got married in a halal way and had intercourse with his halal wife he tasted the meaning of marriage and hence opting for haram like the one he did is a major sin that can only be cleansed by execution this may sound logical and it may not either way this is the sharia law that has to be followed risa says can you help me with this question one of my friends said it is allowed in other schools of thought for a woman okay who married who got married previously and wants to remarry she does not need a guardian because according to the prophet salaam it's not valid without the guardian please help so his question isa is basically about some schools of thought that state that a divorced woman does not require the consent and approval of her guardian because she is not a virgin anymore and she is entitled for her own opinion and life and this is not true the hadith is crystal clear this is what the prophet saws there is no guardian there is no marriage valid without a guardian and he did not mention whether she is a teenager or over 70. the prophet did not mention whether she is a virgin or been married multiple times or a widow etc so what these schools of thought or school of thought say is not uh um true najib says does lipstick invalidate your abolution while not properly removed so applying lipsticks after being in the state of evolution has no impact on your uru a woman performs abolution applies lipstick makeup and goes to prey no problem the problem is when you want to perform ablution and you remove your makeup but the lipstick is waterproof and was not removed entirely or the foundation or the makeup you had is waterproof in this case your abolution your wudu is not valid because the water is unable to reach the area underneath says my question is on the day of qiyamah all women will be called by their father's name or by their mother's name no men and women will be called on the day of judgment by their father's name a person is called by his mother name usually is when he's born out of wedlock i say usually sometimes a person may be praised by being called after his mother because his mother is more famous more important more honorable than his father ahmad niyasi his mother was sumayya the prophet said so sumayya was known to be the first martyred woman in islam the prophet said allah learned the quran from ibn um this is his nickname the son of the mother of abdullah so we we just mentioned his name abd but this is a form of nicknaming him so on the day of judgment men and women will be called after their fathers not their mothers okay this is zahra and she says my friend asks if the marriage was valid while she was pregnant the answer is no any woman who gets married while being pregnant her contract is void and not valid according to the vast majority of scholars shirin says i would have deposited some money in islamic sharia bank they give me profit after every three months so my question is am i allowed to use this money for my daily livelihood or pays the cat with that money and do charity the answer is yes if this is a real islamic bank with a sharia board overlooking and governing its transaction the answer is yes you can use that inshallah zenat says can a person in his lifetime give his whole property feasibility yes i'm alive and i have my wealth in front of me a million dollars i've my children i've got my wife got my family and i decide to give the whole million dollars to charity to islamic satellite channels that propagate islam to building messages orphanages wells where people drink water from the my entire wealth this is permissible because i'm still alive and earning may allah be pleased with him gave all of his wealth three times in his lifetime to the prophet jesus omar gave half of it but is it the best scenario the answer is not necessarily if this would introduce hardship to your family and make them needy to people in this case no this is not a good thing to do and there's a difference between giving it during your lifetime and writing a will to be executed after your death such a will is invalid because you are only entitled to give one third of your wealth and not more than that zaid says i'm asking about how one should cope with the innovation someone who interprets allah's book and sunnah of the prophet with enough little knowledge and lack of qualification i don't understand the questions in but if there is a person an individual who does this with little knowledge and qualification he should be forced by the authorities not to speak knowledge is like medicine you can't have someone who's a rookie or someone who just comes and gives prescriptions and and diagnoses illnesses and operates on people without any proper qualification religion is far greater than medicine because medicine deals with the human body in this life while religion deals with the human soul and its connection to the hereafter risa says if a woman asks for divorce and the man accepts and pays the dowry back meaning the woman the wife pays it this is not divorced during the first month waiting period can it be revoked and if they want to go back together the answer is no once the money is received and the whole is granted they cannot revoke this they need a new marriage contract with the consent of her guardian with a new dowry and a testimony of two male witnesses samina says is it permissible in our dean to position or to poison the street animals or to trap and throw them in the desert the the this depends on the harm one gets from such animals so for example if i have a house where i raise or keep chicken and every night i get cats wild cats coming attacking the chicken killing them and eating them i tried my best to build fences etc it's not working so there's the only option is to kill the cats no problem this is totally halal because anything that is harmful can be killed but you try your level best not to torture the animal so if you catch a mouse for example in a trap you can't drown the mouse to kill it you have to actually kill it shoot it in the head slaughter it uh do something that is swift and lethal rather than torturing that animal and finally uh farzana says someone who married at the time of not praying was superstitious new minor shirk but now he prays regularly is the marriage valid as long as when he got married he was known to be muslim he claimed to be a muslim all around him knew him as a muslim and it was never brought up to court to prove that he was an apostate or a mushrik or a non-muslim this means that his marriage was valid in sha allah azza knows best and this is all the time we have until we meet next time i leave foreign"
