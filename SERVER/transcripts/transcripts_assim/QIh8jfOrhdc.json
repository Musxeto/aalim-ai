  "title": "Difference between doing Sujood as Sahu before & after Salam - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Mohammed says what is the difference between giving sujood to sell before Salaam and after Salaam can you please explain in detail first of all this is the first time someone says this is the first time I know that you can offer to do the sell after Salaam this is new for me well every day we new we learn something new the hadith that governs so you the say who are many Abdullah Abdullah Hina may Allah be pleased with him oh sorry the hoodie Abu Hurairah of the lovin masud may allah be pleased with them all they all narrated this and different scenarios and in a nutshell because we can't go into details first of all you have to understand that should you the so who is offered when you make a mistake in a pillar or a mandatory act in salat this means that any voluntary act you make a mistake or you leave it intentionally or you add it intentionally does not impact your salat to the extent that you have to offer to do the self so someone does not raise his hand so in the beginning I start my salat by saying Allah a kebab I didn't raise my hands my prayer is valid because raising the hands is a Sunnah but if I did not say Allahu Akbar this is a pillar my prayer is not conducted yet I haven't started yet I can't start the prayer without saying Allah Akbar so it has to be a mistake in a pillar or in a mandatory act which means that you have to learn what are the pillars of salat and what are the mandatory acts of salat to know how to do how to act and how to behave Kenley scholars say that there are two locations where we pray or offer to prostrations of forgetfulness before Salaam and another two locations or incidence or reasons for offering it after Salaam so the first one is when you drop a mandatory act when you forget a mandatory act so let's assume that I am praying the for Rakas in the second raka I do not sit for tisha hood I stand up for the third raka and after I'm fully standing someone says subhana Allah subhanAllah bringing my attention that I have not sit for the third Rock before the first shot what to do I have to continue my prayer I skipped the first a shout yes but this is mandatory and I skipped it out of forgetfulness continue my prayer as normal after the salutation before concluding my prayer I offer Allahu Akbar to salute the Sahu saints of handleable Allah as normal and then assalamu alikum - la semana con la la that's it assuming that I'm a trucker and instead of saying subhana Bobby ravine I made a mistake and started saying subhan allah by allah subhana allah subhan doorbell allah send me a law human Hamidah and then it came to my mind that what did I do I missed saying Shahada be loving I have to offer su Judas aho before Salam because I've dropped something that is mandatory now if I added something to the salat so for example I stood for the fifth Fraga and then realize that this is this is the fifth i immediately sit down I cannot complete anything now I have to sit down because this is a void raka if I added a third says de then I remember that this is the third I stand up immediately or sit down depending on my position but I had already added something what should I do continue my prayer as usual after the salutation is over and the door I say Salam aleikum assalam aleikum o Allah Akbar I offer to prostrations after the Salam so these are two locations one before one after capisci Shah aalam understood now we come to the third case or the third situation and this is when I am confused I'm in the middle of the prayer and I'm totally unaware of whether this is the third raka or the fourth raka so my confusion is in the fourth raka my confusion is did I prostrate one prostration or this is my second prostration so whenever there is a confusion and I am totally lost I'm not aware I don't know is it my second raka is it my third raka is it my fourth raka I'm not aware there is doubt the the Prophet said allah√≠s alot was salam when some of you praised and he's doubtful whether he prayed three or four he should based his assumption on what is confirmed so now I'm doubtful whether I prayed three or four where is the doubt definitely it's in four because three I am certain that I prayed them my doubt is in the fourth so the Prophet says base your assumption on what is confirmed so I neglect that I have prayed for and I consider myself have prayed three and continue accordingly and just before Salam I offered to salute of Sahu then of so when there is no balance no determination whether this or that it's totally equal in this case I base my assumption on the least number I'm Institute is this my first or my second sujood well I don't know then I would assume that this is my first session because this is the confirmed and I get and do the second session de and also performs through the cell before the salam this is case number three case number four is the same when i'm confused whether i prayed three records or four ACCA's whether this was my first suit or ii stitute but the difference is that i am inclined to one of the two I'm not totally blinded by confusion not knowing three or four no I mean client that yeah yeah this is most likely the third because in the third raka I usually recite called who Allahu Ahad after fatiha and I just remembered that I did that or I would say no most likely this is the fourth because I did this or I did that or I heard a sound or I had an ayah so you have a reason to be inclined to one of either you added or deleted or omitted either this or that you have a reason to be inclined to either one in this case after Salaam you offer to sujood of so to recap before Salaam you offer to do the self in two cases one either you omitted something from your mandatory acts to compensate that you offer to salute before Salaam or you are confused whether you did this or that and you cannot be inclined to any of them you base your assumption on the list the number that is the least and continuous a lot and offer to you the cell before Salaam you perform it after Selam when you have added something that is not part of the Salah a third to shout a fifth raka something mandatory in other than its place then you offer to salud after Salam or and this is the fourth when you are confused but you're inclined to whether you add it or omitted something from the salat you act upon that and you offer your salute after the Salam when we say after the Salam do we offer also another tashahud the answer is no you simply offer Salam then immediately to prostrations saying Subhan Allah Allah Allah Allahu Akbar assalamu alaikum assalam alikum warahmatu law so I hope this answers your question"
