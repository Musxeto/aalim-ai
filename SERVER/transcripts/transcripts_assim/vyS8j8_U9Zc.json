  "transcript": "rajab from Russia alayum uh I have a question is it permissible to work as a 3D artist in a company that makes games if the games of this company have elements of Halal and Haram but sometimes even elements of sh or kuu and the job description looks something like this some head of the company will tell me uh to make some model I make this model and give it to them is this considerate help in sin what do you think what what do you think rajab what does your gut feeling tell you I think it is Haram alhamdulillah this is what counts the prophet said sin is what itches you inside and you don't want people to know about it and your gut feeling in such things is your best guide when you don't have evidence the evidence is overwhelming Allah says in the beginning of chapter 5 and collaborate upon righteousness and virtue and do not collaborate upon sin and transgression and what is more sinful than participating in games that includes kufur shik and sinful things even if you're a janitor cleaning the floor that would be sinful because you're assisting them in maintaining a clean place to work so this is collaborating on sin and it is Haram"
