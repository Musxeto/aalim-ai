  "title": "The Prophet’s ‎ﷺ  wives not happy with current lifestyle assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "A relief from Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala. Not only that, as a human being, the Prophet ﷺ was frequently bombarded by his beloved wives. There were nine of them and they all demanded more money. Not to the extent that they wanted to buy Versace or whatever, they just wanted a normal life. We know the hardship the Prophet ﷺ and his family went through when Mother Aisha said that we would pass two months. Two months would pass upon us without lighting any fire in the house or cooking. And what did you feed upon? She says water and dates for two months. So you can imagine the hardship especially for women who came from rich families like those whom the Prophet had married to, Alayhis Salatu Wassalam. So when they came and complained, the Prophet ﷺ was angered by their consistency in demanding and demanding. So he took a pledge not to come close to them for a whole month and he took a small room in the masjid and kept himself in seclusion from all of his wives. And everybody was thinking that he's going to divorce them. After this month was over, he went, Alayhis Salatu Wassalam, as Allah has revealed to him and gave his wives the choice. And among them was Aisha. So Allah says, O Prophet of Allah, say to your wives, if you want this worldly life and it's adornment, come. I will provide for you and set you free. I will divorce you. But if you want Allah and his messenger and the hereafter, then know that Allah has prepared for those who do good among you a great huge reward. So the Prophet ﷺ said to her, listen Aisha, I'd like to mention something to you, but don't give me an answer before consulting your parents. And he recited the ayah. So he gave her the choice and she said to him, why would I consult my parents? I want Allah and the Prophet Alayhis Salatu Wassalam and the hereafter. So the Prophet ﷺ was so happy with that, it could show on his face because this is what he wanted. He loved his wives, but this is his mission in life. This is his lifestyle. This is how Allah made him and he cannot rest with the adornment of life coming to him like everyone else."
