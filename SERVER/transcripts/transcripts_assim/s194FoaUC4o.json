  "title": "What are the Qiraat? Iâ€™ve heard Atheists say there are 7 versions of the Quran, how to respond?",
  "transcript": "i've heard some atheists say there are seven virgins of the quran with extra words or different pronunciations therefore the quran isn't preserved is this true first of all there are seven and these are different from the ahrefs are the ways that the quran was revealed in where the some words may differ though having the same meaning or some words may differ having an alternative meaning that adds more value to the verse now the prophet himself said to us islam that jibril came to me the archangel and he gave me the quran in one half in one way it's not a a dialect it's not an accent it's a way like even masroad says when you say to someone uh come or uh get here it's the same meaning different words so these these ways in the beginning there were one the prophet said i asked him for more and more and more until he gave me seven now can we identify the seven the answer is no no one can why because the prophet did not tell us this these are seven and they were given to us as a lump sum port this is point one now the most important point is do you agree that the quran is a divine revelation from allah box number one checked do you agree that allah pledged upon himself to preserve the quran box number two checked do you agree that the whole muslim ummah for the past 15 centuries never doubted the quran and agreed upon the the quran that we have with the different in it the answer is yes and check for box number three now where is the fault here the fault is in our own understanding the fault is when we listen to the enemies of islam who are trying to cast doubts in our religion over something that is crystal clear someone comes to you and says your father is not your real biological father would you go and do a dna test of course not i wouldn't believe whatever someone comes and says to me which i'm totally confident of let alone about my own religion that is false proof it's perfect 15 centuries people are increasing facts are coming up to prove that it is the ultimate religion and its divine religion from allah azzawajal so i wouldn't allow these things to infiltrate my conviction in iman and cast doubt over my iman of the quran so how to explain there's no need to explain the prophet himself said that he requested seven ways of recitation it was given to him now at the time of uthman may allah be pleased with him he rewritten the quran compiled it on one way of these and that is the way of quraysh the dominant language which was prevailing all over the country and he made sure that there were no dots or vowels used to include and incubate the other six in it and the whole ummah agreed upon it and accepted it and the those who have knowledge those who the elite who have knowledge in the quran's recitations can tell you some of the examples which are like one in every 1 000 words or maybe more one word in every 1 000 word that may be written differently meaning the same or written differently with and different meaning that adds value to the ayah when you read the interpretation or the tafsir of it now the seven these are totally different than the af because this is what was compiled by seven scholars like two three centuries later on each one having a different accent or dialect in reciting the quran the most prominent that is worldwide hafsan awesome this is the prominent but there's uh an affair and there are different types which very few of the scholars of the know but it is all there it's documented it's different than the and i hope this answers your question"
