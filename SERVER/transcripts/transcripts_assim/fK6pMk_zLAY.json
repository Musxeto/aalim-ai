  "title": "Hell breathes two breaths in a year | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Emmett says I read a hadith which says that hell breathes to breath a year and that is the reason we see extreme heat during summer and extreme cold during winter but how can we understand this hadith because in some parts of the world summer and winter are in opposite times of the year like for example if someone or somewhere is somewhere it is winter in Australia how to reconcile about this and hadith first of all it is totally wrong for you to try to logic things that are unseen to you let alone understand the hadith wrongly because of the wrong interpretation translation or your understanding the hadith is it authentic definitely it is authentic it's agreed upon by Bukhari and Muslim what does it imply it simply implies that Hellfire complained to allah azza wajal there it is so extreme that I have eaten my own self I'm consuming my own self so Allah Azza WA JAL relieved hell by giving it two breaths and these these two breaths are a breath in winter extreme cold and a breath in summer extreme heat this has nothing to do with summer and winter per se because these are the effect found in summer and winter not the cause of it meaning that not when the Hellfire breathes this happens rather it is part of the impact of having such breaths throughout the whole year and we do not know maybe the breath of heat which comes out of hell is causing the Sun to become hot in summer and brings us this heat and it doesn't also mean that the heat and the cold is happening differently in hell so one time there is heat and one time there is cold no it is simultaneous it can happen at the same time therefore you should not logic this and you should accept it as it is because you didn't see hell you did not see how it breathes or speaks to alonzo gel so why is it that you're only finding it difficult to believe what the Prophet had told us how so son simply because we have winter and summer at the same time"
