  "title": "If I listened to music & my parents ask me about it, should I lie or expose my sin? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "The second question from Zaim says, if a person listened to music at night and next day his parents asked him, did you hear music? If he says yes, he will be boasting about his sin. And if he says no, he will be sinful for lying. What should he do? The answer is, he should dodge the question. Don't lie and say no, and don't expose yourself and say yes. Just when you're asked a crystal clear question, did you listen to music yesterday? Say, I was asleep. Or say, who would listen to music at this hour? People listen to music in the daytime. You dodge the question by any means possible without exposing your sin."
