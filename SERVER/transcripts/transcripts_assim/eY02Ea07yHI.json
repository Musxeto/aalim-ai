  "transcript": "from saudi arabia says what's the ruling on playing ludo as it involves dice one scholar said that this is okay this is his problem not mine if you ask me about the ruling i would tell you that the prophet sallallahu alaihi in an authentic hadith said it is best for a person to dip his hand in swine's blood rather than to play with the dice the prophet did not say because there is gambling the prophet did not say because it distracts you from salat he simply prohibited us from playing dice with the dice end of story full stop so if a scholar or a tom dick or harry come and say that this is because of this we ask them for justification give us evidence that it is prohibited due to gambling this is why the prophet prohibited it if they fail to bring this then you have a problem with the people you're asking"
