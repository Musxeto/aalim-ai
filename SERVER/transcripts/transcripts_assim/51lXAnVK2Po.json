  "title": "If I can't see imam & move with him 2 next pillar based on his takbeer, salah valid? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "sh we know that it is recommended to go to a pillar when the Imam is already settled in that bu and it is wrong to move with the Imam uh you said in a video that if we cannot see the IM then we have to move after the IM complet saying his of movement but my question is if I cannot see the IM and if I SN my movement with the IM saying of the of movement and I for the next fillar with the IM together would it have any impact on the validity of the TR there is nothing wrong in that inshallah because Allah does not hold us accountable to more than what we can bear if I can't see the Imam and if I don't know what position the Imam in the only thing I can do is to act like the scholars have said that you move after the Imam has finished the T if his movement is slow or he is saying it earlier before moving this is his fault not yours and there is nothing more you can do inshallah and I hope this answers your question"
