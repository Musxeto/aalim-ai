  "transcript": "your family as well. Sheikh I was in congregation in Salat Duha. They made me to become Imam and I was a little nervous. I forgot to say Rabbana wa lakum alhamdulillah. Is my Salat wrong? What did you say? You just rised from the Ruku' without saying anything? I said Sama'a Allah li man hamidah but I did not say Rabbana wa lakum alhamdulillah. This is mandatory for you to say and if you missed it, you should have offered Sujood As-Sahu. If you did not offer Sujood As-Sahu due to your ignorance or not remembering, your Salat is valid insha'Allah and there is nothing for you to do as of now."
