  "title": "Being a Judge or Lawyer in a Muslim country where Sharia is not practiced?",
  "transcript": "Arik from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. May Allah promote you to a split unit. Jazak Allah Khair. Sheikh my today's question is can the judge or a lawyer be employed in in the country where the judicial system is not practiced according to Islamic Sharia law even the country is a Muslim country. Jazak Allah Khair. Jazakum. Verses 44, 45, and 47 in Surah Al-Ma'idah clearly states that whoever does not judge with the rulings of Allah is a Kafir, a Zalim, and a Fasiq. And this refers to those who legislate such as the judge or the supreme court or those who write the constitution and put laws that go against the Qur'an, the Sunnah, whether they as they claim to be Muslims or non-Muslims. Now for a judge to look into cases and to give rulings definitely this is not permissible when he's forced to implement other than Sharia law. So even if he's in a Muslim country or a non-Muslim country if he's applying man-made laws over cases that the law of Sharia is crystal clear but he is not implementing it rather he's taking the other man-made law this is not permissible at all. A lawyer is different because a lawyer can choose the cases he looks into. So if a lawyer is going into trial over a case in a traffic violation or over a case where someone stole his client's money or embezzled him or forged his signature, all of this is Sharia compliant. There's no problem in asking for something or for justice to be served. But if he's suing someone for damages and these damages are exaggerated and not according to Sharia law, this is not permissible. You can only take what's permissible in Sharia and give the rest. So the blood money for example is the equivalent of a hundred thousand dollars for someone who killed someone else. You can't sue him for six million and if the country's laws approve of this and give you the right to do this you may do this and take only the three hundred thousand dollars that your client deserves and you give him back the rest. So a lawyer is different than a judge and Allah knows best."
