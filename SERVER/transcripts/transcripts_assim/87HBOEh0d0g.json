  "transcript": "Fatima says that I was listening to a lecture of Scholars and he's saying that when you want to word off evil eye you you don't say this doesn't work you have to say or Allah I use the word or the verb of being blessed may Allah blesses bless you may Allah make this thing blessed Etc so is this right the most authentic opinion is that the best of the best to word off your own evil eye is to say Allah or this prevents this blocks your evil eye from preceding so you cannot harm the person that you've you've seen what you liked however is mentioned in the Quran and some Scholars say that this does work as well so if I hear someone looking at for example my car and says wow insh this is enough I don't have to go say no you have to say you don't have to uh uh do this and the best is for him to say is said when I see something of my own so if I if I see one of my children doing well at school I wouldn't say I would say because he's mine if I see my car or my uh um house and I like it I say but if I see someone's else the most preferred is to say may Allah bless this for you but if I say this does the job inshallah uh"
