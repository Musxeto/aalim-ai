  "title": "Can we fast Arafah with Saudi Arabia? (Moon sighting) | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "and jannatul ferdel says i'm very confused about the arafah fast as i am from bangladesh here some people fast after the day of arafat that was held in saudi arabia and some people fast during the arafat in saudi arabia so what should i do though who fast during arafat said that it is haram to fast in a day because they follow saudi and also most of the mawlana from hadith do this and explain it logically to the people what that's why i'm confused well there's no need to confuse jannatul ferdowsi because if you look at the concept of the lunar months how do we know that a lunar month has started and has ended the answer is by observing the moon detecting the crescent when it disappears and when it re appears and reborn and arafat is on the ninth of dulhajja so as in ramadan people in bangladesh india start a day after saudi arabia due to their sighting hopefully of the crescent likewise during the month of the arafat is dependent on the ninth of the month and so is 8 it's dependent on the 10th of the month whether it's a friday as in the case in saudi arabia or a saturday as the case in bangladesh so you should not be fasting with saudi arabia on arafat simply because the pilgrims are in mount arafat performing their hajj because your ninth is a day later and it coincides with our eid so this is the permissible way of doing it each region in the muslim world has a different sighting of the moon and this was applicable at the time of the companions may allah be pleased with them and they all approved of it as in the case that each region has its own fajr timing maghrib timing so it is not permissible for people during fajr in bangladesh to wait until the people in makkah in haram are in the kaaba pray fajr that is a tuna out two hours difference and the sun is in the middle of the sky they have their own timings and you have your own timings and allah knows best"
