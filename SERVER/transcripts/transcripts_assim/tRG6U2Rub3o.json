  "title": "If a person changes his name, does he have to offer another Aqeeqah (Shayyan to Abdullah) assim al",
  "transcript": "My third question is that my son's name is Shayan and on this name his aqiqa has been done. But we call him Abdullah because it has a good meaning. So is it permissible that can we call him Abdullah at home? Is it okay? The aqiqa has nothing to do with the naming process. So if you called him Shayan and then two years later you wanted to change his name into Abdullah, there is nothing wrong in that. You don't have to sacrifice another aqiqa or the first aqiqa is void just because of the changing of the name. So these are two separate things. Can you name him or call him Abdullah? This is better a thousand times than Shayan because he's not an indigenous Indian tribe. And secondly, the best and most beautiful and beloved names to Allah, and this hadith is in Sahih Al Bukhari, is Abdullah and Abdur Rahman. These are the most beloved names to Allah. So definitely calling him Abdullah is A plus and Allah knows best."
