  "transcript": "Sarah says is a wife sinful if she does not cook for the husband what if she can afford a maate this is an issue of dispute is a woman obliged to serve her husband through cooking cleaning the house cleaning his clothes and ironing them and the likes or not and the most authentic opinion is that she's obliged to to serve her husband and children as the husband is obliged to earn and keep a roof on their head and put food on the table and take care of their medical expenses and clothe them and provide for them any imbalance would require something to fix it if the wife is financially capable and and she says I don't want to cook I'll hire a cook to cook excellent food for us and I'll pay for it there's no problem the husband would be more than happy if she gets a maid and this maid does not interfere with the privacy of the husband in the house so the maid works for example when the husband is at work and when he comes back she's in her room away from the husband seeing her or meeting her and he's fine and she's the wife paying for the mate totally fine there's no problem in that insh"
