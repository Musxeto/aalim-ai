  "transcript": "Chef my question today is um I've been struggling since childhood from something called hipersomnia meaning that uh my brain needs let's say around 10 to 12 hours sleep to be actually functioning correctly uh for example if I sleep like eight hours I might even at work like I I work remotely when I'm in front of my computer I do off sometimes I don't even know that I'm sleeping until I wake up uh it's called pernia Uh I've consulted many doctors for it and they said that like there's no known cure for it like I just have to learn to live with it I'm still trying to do more tests and uh trying to do other things but like uh unfortunately she when I do when I'm in this stage of my life where sleeping let's say 10 hours is a lot of time because because of it I have less time for doing I and many other things because it's very hard to how to to manage all this time and everything because if you compare for example somebody sleeping 8 hours and me sleeping 10 hours for example is having IIM ibraim I I get the the point what's your question yeah my question is in islamically speaking do we have do you have any advice for me in in this okay I I got your question now if this is a medical condition there is nothing you can do as long as the doctors say that there is no medication to be given and the likes then I can't help you with this now I'm not a physician I'm not a doctor but I believe that everything is according to what you train and condition your body to do so I feel that if you sleep six hours like normal people wake up for fer and attend your work the moment you feel tired you go and do 10 push-ups or do 10 squats or jump the rope and go and have a small snack and come back you will have fuel to take you for another two hours and you'll get a little bit tired do the same thing repeat it take a quick shower and come back if you manage to do these small small tasks at Short intervals in like 3 four weeks time your body biological clock would be accustomed to it and you will have enough inshallah give it a shot but if it doesn't work then this is your test from Allah and Allah Knows Best"
