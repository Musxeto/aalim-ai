  "transcript": "Ameen from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Hope you're feeling well I'm feeling great Alhamdulillah Perfect Alhamdulillah Sheikh I have a question in February I will become 30 Insha Allah and recently my hair is thinning and I'm becoming bald slowly but surely I wanted to ask you regarding the ruling on shaving one's head as I heard that it might be Makbuh Wa Jazakum first of all shaving the head is not Makruh the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam saw a man with a haircut that resembles the disbelievers where he keeps some hair and shaves some part of the head and he said to him shave it all or keep it all don't do such Mohawk haircut or like Mr. T or like the marines and the likes this is not permissible so if you have a need or you simply don't like to have hair on your head and you shave it all there's no problem in doing that the scholars that did not recommend it and said it's Makruh are those who said this to people who shave thinking that shaving is something that gets you closer to Allah and this is not true this is a sign of Khawarij who do this thinking of that their innovation gets them closer to Allah we Muslims shave our heads whenever we go for Umrah or for Hajj after we conclude our ritual we do Tahallul to get out of the state of Ihram by shaving yes we have an option of trimming and cutting short our hair but usually we want the higher level and reward so we shave it with a razor and Allah knows best"
