  "title": "Why should We Praise and Thank Allah?  - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "Allah says in surah fat chapter number 35 verse number 15 that Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala you are in need of Allah subhanana wa ta'ala Allah is free of all needs worthy of all praises so Allah subhananau wa ta'ala does not require anyone and anything but everything is dependent on him so he is asking us to praise him so that when we praise him we will follow his advice given in the Quran and it will benefit us. So he is asking us to praise him for our benefit not for his benefit. It will benefit us not him. For example, if there is a married couple, husband wife who does not get children for many years, they feel sad because they have no children. You have another example that a married couple they have a child and after a few years the child dies. So the couple to whom a child was born and after a few years the child dies he feels more sad than the first couple who had no children. Let me give you one more example. There is a couple who have a child. They bring him up with love and affection. Take care of him. He becomes adult. After he becomes adult, 20 years, 30 years, 35 years, he starts disres disrespecting the parent. Forget about taking care of the parent. When the parent get old, he starts disrespecting the parent. He starts using foul language against the parent. What will happen to such a parent? This parent will feel more bad than the first two parents. It is better not to have a child than have a child and he dies or to have a child and he become disobedient, disrespectful, abusive. Allah says in the Quran in surah Isra chapter number 17 verse number 23 and 24 we have ordained for the human beings that they should worship only one god and they should be kind to the parents and if one of them or both of them reach old age do not say a word of contempt don't say of to them Allah says if one of your parent or both of your parents reach old age do not say of to them but lower to them your wing of humility and pray to the Lord that cherish them as they cherish me childhood. So Allah is saying in the Quran in surah Sarah chapter 17 verse number 23 and 24 that after worship of Allah is respecting and being obedient to your parent and imagine that child is disobedient. Will you call him a good human being? The parents have taken care of that child from the time he was born till he becomes adult. Gives him all the luxury and later on he is disrespectful. He's abusive. Surely no one will consider him to be good human being. Now imagine we as human beings we are not thankful to Allah subhanana wa ta'ala who is million times better than our parents our creator our Allah subhanana wa ta'ala who has given us this life who has given all these facilities he's our creator he deserves multiple time more respect than a parent so imagine If we do not thank him, we do not respect him, we would be the worst human being."
