  "transcript": "[Music] they get the award uh for uh they play the whole night so and then even uh in normal times the third whole year during uh on like the men get a big reward for like you know going to the emergency early and feeling uh imam uh doing the other uh things that are mentioned so my question is the line is not clear so i will improvise the hadith of the prophet islam whoever prays with the imam until he concludes his prayer as if he had prayed the whole night this is regarding ramadan taraweeh and nothing else so no one can come and say i'd like to pray like five months from now with the imam in congregation after isha prayer night prayers no this is an innovation it cannot be done if i understood this question of yours if i didn't and you meant to say that i am unable to go and pray with the imam the taraweeh prayer whether due to snow due to rain due to job in this case alhamdulillah allah did not restrict prayers of tarawih in the masjid rather you can pray in home even if you don't have a legitimate reason but the reward would be decreased accordingly if you have a legitimate reason that prevents you from going to attend the prayer and the congregation in the masjid and allah knows that you would have done so then you will get the full reward as allah is the most generous and most forgiving subhanahu you"
