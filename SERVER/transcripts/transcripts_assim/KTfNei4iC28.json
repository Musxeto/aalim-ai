  "title": "Joined imam late, came back up midway from sujood, is my prayer valid? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "he says i joined the prayer when the imam was in the second sujud of his first rakah as i was going down to do sujud he said allahu akbar and standing up i was ignorant of what to do so i came back from midway and stood up is my prayer valid the answer is yes because you had one of two options either to go to to perform sujud when he has already stood up and both ways your sajdah is invalid or let me rephrase that it is not counted because of the raqqa itself therefore there is nothing wrong in what you had done going up midway instead of continuing to do the sujud was the right thing to do inshallah you"
