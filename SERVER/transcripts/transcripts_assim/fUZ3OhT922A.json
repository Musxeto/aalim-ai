  "transcript": "Abdullah from Canada Alum last time I asked you about hunting rabbits without their appropriate licenses I want to ask if selling the F and profiting from it would be considered as Hal earning what are you selling the fur of the rabbits the what if it be the fur do you hunt these uh rabbits yes and license it's illegal I yes I asked you last time if I could H but uh now I want to ask you now I want to sell the F no most likely this is Haram because you are in a country that you applied for a Visa correct I was born here I didn't sign okay you are born there and you are obliged to abide by the laws of the country you live in yes you may not be committing a sin but if you weigh the pros and cons breaking the law in something that is halal for your religion which is hunting and selling the fur after hunting it this is halal in our religion but if it goes against the law of the country and the consequence of such an action would be that you will be called and laid abled in the news outlets as a terrorist as an extremist as breaking the law as Islam uh fobes would use this to highlight the fact that the Muslims don't abide by the law don't do this don't do that no this becomes Haram regardless whether the act itself was Halal in our religion or not and Allah Knows Best"
