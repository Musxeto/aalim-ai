  "transcript": "is whitter prayer obligatory or not this question was not asked but actually one of the companions stated that it is obligatory and abaddon may allah be pleased with him was outraged and he mentioned the hadith of the prophet was where the prophet said sallallahu alaihi wasallam there are five daily prayers whoever perfects their wudu their uh submissiveness their rukur their sujud etc then he would have a pledge with allah azzawajal to forgive his sins to admit him to jannah et cetera and this hadith and others indicate clearly like the hadith of the nomad who said to the prophet allah what is obligatory upon me and the prophet said the five daily prayers the nomad said is there anything more in the prophet said no unless you volunteer so the man said by allah who had sent you with truth i will not add anything to that and the prophet told us that he is a man of jannah if he abides by what he had said which means that witter is not mandatory it is a highly recommended sunnah but those who do not pray it are not sinful but they will lose a lot of reward"
