  "title": "Sujood as Sahu BEFORE Salam or AFTER Salam? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Mohammed says what is the difference between the jus-just sell before Salaam and after Salaam can you please explain in detail first of all this is the first time someone says this is the first time I know that you can offer to do the sell after Salaam this is new for me well every day we knew we learn something new the hadith that governs sujood sa who are many Abdullah of Nobu Hina may Allah be pleased with him a blue sari the hoodie Abu Hurairah of the lovin masud may allah be pleased with them all they all narrated this and different scenarios and in a nutshell because we can't go into details first of all you have to understand that should you the sell who is offered when you make a mistake in a pillar or a mandatory act in salat this means that any voluntary act you make a mistake or you leave it intentionally or you add it intentionally does not impact your salat to the extent that you have to offer to do the sell so someone does not raise his hand so in the beginning I start my salat by saying Allah a kebab I didn't raise my hands my prayer is valid because raising the hands is a Sunnah but if I did not say Allahu Akbar this is a pillar my prayer is not conducted yet I haven't started yet I can't start the prayer without saying Allah Akbar so it has to be a mistake in a pillar or in a mandatory act which means that you have to learn what are the pillars of salat and what are the mandatory acts of salat to know how to do how to act and how to behave secondly scholars say that there are two locations where we pray or offer to prostration of forgetfulness before salaam and another two locations or incidents or reasons for offering it after salaam so the first one is when you drop a mandatory act will you forget a mandatory act so let's assume that I am praying Lahore Caracas in the second raka I do not sit for two shall I stand up for the third raka and after I'm fully standing someone says subhana Allah Subhan Allah bringing my attention that I have not sit for the third Rock for the first shot what to do I have to continue my prayer I skipped the first a shout yes but this is mandatory and I skipped it out of forgetfulness continue my prayer as normal after the salutation before concluding my prayer I offer Allahu Akbar - salud sa Hussein soup and rubella as normal and then a Salam aleykum Selam aleykum la la that's it assuming that I'm a true core and instead of saying subhanAllah be ravine I made a mistake and I started saying subhan allah by allah subhana allah subhana allah send me allah who liman hamidah and then it came to my mind that what did I do I missed saying Shahada be loving I have to offer SuJu the zoo before Salam because I've dropped something that is mandatory now if I added something to the salat so for example I stood for v rocker and then realize that this is this is v I immediately sit down I cannot complete anything now I have to sit down because this is a void raka if I added a third says de then I remember that this is the third I stand up immediately or sit down depending on my position but I had already added something what should I do continue my prayer as usual after the salutation is over and the door I say Salam aleikum assalam aleikum o Allah Akbar I offer to prostrations after the Salam so these are two locations one before one after capisci Shah aalam understood now we come to the third case or the third situation and this is when I am confused I'm in the middle of the prayer and I'm totally unaware of whether this is the third raka or the fourth raka so my confusion is in the fourth raka my confusion is did I prostrate one prostration or this is my second prostration so whenever there is a confusion and I am totally lost I'm not aware I don't know is it my second raka is it my third raka is it my fourth naka I'm not aware there is doubt the the Prophet said allah√≠s alot was salam when some of you praised and he's doubtful whether he prayed three or four he should based his assumption on what is confirmed so now I'm doubtful whether I prayed three or four where is the doubt definitely it's in four because three I am certain that I prayed them my doubt is in the fourth so the Prophet says base your assumption on what is confirmed so I neglect that I have prayed for and I consider myself have prayed three and continue accordingly and just before Salam I offer to salute of Sahu then offer Salah so when there is no balance no determination whether this or that it's totally equal in this case I base my assumption on the least I'm Institute is this my first or my second sujood well I don't know then I would assume that this is my first session because this is the confirmed and I get and do the second says de and also performs through the cell before the Salaam this is case number three case number four is the same when I'm confused whether I prayed three records or four ACCA's whether this was my first sued or second stitute but the difference is that I am inclined to one of the two I'm not totally blinded by confusion not knowing three or four no I'm inclined that yeah yeah this is most likely the third because in the third raka I usually recite could who Allahu Ahad after fatiha and I just remembered that I did that or I would say no most likely this is the fourth because I did this or I did that or I heard a sound or I had an ayah so you have a reason to be inclined to one of either you added or deleted or omitted either this or that you have a reason to be inclined to either one in this case after Salaam you offer to sujood of so to recap before Salaam you offer to do the self in two cases one either you omitted something from your mandatory acts to compensate that you offer to salute before Salaam or you are confused whether you did this or that and you cannot be inclined to any of them you base your assumption on the list the number that is the least and continuous a lot and offer to you the cell before Salaam you perform it after Salaam when you have added something that is not part of the Salah a third to shout a fifth raka something mandatory in other than its place then you offer to good after Salam or and this is the fourth when you are confused but you're inclined to whether you add it or omitted something from the salat you act upon that and you offer your salute after the Salam when we say after the Salam do we offer also another tisha hood the answer is no you simply offer Salam then immediately to prostrations saying Subhan Allah Allah Allah Allahu Akbar assalamu alaykum assalamualaikum warahmatullah so I hope this answers your question you"
