  "title": "Can I download Hacked Apps or Software? (Copyright protected) | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "amen from germany says can i get hacked apps or software for free the answer is no this is copyrighted and those who hacked it or broke the code and giving it you to you for free are actually breaking the law and trespassing on other people's rights and this is haram now if this is something for personal use and you need it but you don't have the money to do to to to buy it and it's not for commercial use and it's found for free you didn't steal you didn't hack you didn't break any laws then i believe that if it's for personal use you can do that i wouldn't personally do it because the room of disobeying allah is greater than the room of being it permissible and anything that is dubious you have to stay away from"
