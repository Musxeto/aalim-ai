  "title": "Should we say Jazak Allah or Jazak Allah Khair? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "a brother sent us an email he says almost 99 percent of the people from the subcontinent always say jazakallah instead of jazakallahu ran what is the correct way okay now linguistically this is valid i know that the people may object and say what does jazakallah mean the answer is may allah reward you but in arabic jazak or reward can be for evil and for good so i can say jazakallahu khairan which translates to may allah reward you goodness or i could say may allah reward you with evil with torment with punishment so this caused some confusion with the brothers so when someone says jazakallah and he says okay what good or bad so they complain and object you should not say that without any doubt the best way is to say it full because the prophet salaam ordered us to reward people by making dua for them he said whoever says jazakallahu khairan to his brother then he had praised him and exceeded in praising him so the prophet is telling islam that the sunnah is to say but linguistically it is correct so it all depends on the circumstantial evidences around you if i do you a favor if i help you by opening the door or carrying a heavy box with you and you say to me jazakallah i shouldn't be angry because this is a situation where he is obviously thanking me anyone on the streets would say yes he's thanking you i shouldn't make an issue of it and say yeah but he didn't say hiran he didn't say in goodness he just said jazakallah this is sufficient the scholars say that this is acceptable but it's a secondary grading level the best of all is to say it complete jazakallahu khairan and elijah knows best"
