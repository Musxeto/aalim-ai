  "title": "The Peers that Pressure to Misery - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I was told to speak about peers and how they influence us and as humans we are social by Nature Allah created us that we have to mix with others we have to get acquainted and to know one another this is how Allah created us and it is a form of punishment to put a person in solitary confinement this is a well-known yeah fact unless he's married that would be paradise but this is not our topic and when we talk about peer pressure we find that as in so many many things there are positives and there are negatives so is peer pressure always bad well our Prophet was the first to draw the line and to explain this topic to us 15 centuries ago when he said sallallah alai wasam and the Hadith it is in bukari and Muslim the likeness of a righteous companion is that of the seller of musk either he will give you a gift or you will buy something from him or you will smell a pleasant fragrance from him and the likeness of an evil companion is that of a man who works the Bellows either he will burn your garment or you will smell an unpleasant odor from him so now the prophet Alat wasam is telling us that peer pressure can be positive and it can be negative as for the positive aspect a good companion has to influence you so either he teaches you directly do this and don't do that and this is positive because he's leading you where to Jenna what are you doing here what are you doing on Earth making money getting married having a good time no you are striving to reach Jenna a good companion by pressuring you to do well is taking you to Jenna either he would directly teach you or you would learn from him without him directly being involved involved in this or the least you could benefit with him or from him is that people relate you to him do you know so and so yeah yeah he's a friend of Sheikh so and so he's a friend of this Imam he's a friend of this Pious person mashallah then he has to be as good as his friend so the seller of musk either he tells you have some it's a gift or or you buy from him or at least you leave the shop with your th with your dress with a good smell this is a positive peer pressure and this is exactly what the people used to benefit from Imam Ahmed Imam Ahmed 5,000 used to attend his his D four five only 500 of them used to write the Hadith 4,500 would just sit there and and look at Imam Ahmed the way he speak his manners the way he teaches to learn from him so this is the positive thing and a positive impact of peer pressure is that when a righteous person takes you to omra how many times how many of you were sitting there idle not thinking and one of your friends says my heart is hard how about we going next week to and the other guy says yeah that's a good idea this guy says it's a good idea and you end up finding yourself in mecah raising your hand in front of the Kaa oh Allah forgive my sins because I have sinned a lot this is positive peer pressure and they always have their impact on you don't smoke it's Haram we you didn't pray F Allah doesn't like this a let's go and give charity a don't do this don't do that and this is why we sometimes hate them because they're always detering us from doing evil there's a concert close by a famous rock star is coming let's go said no no we have to come to the Pakistani um forum for listening to an old shikh speaking creepy things you hate this but he drags you this is a positive impact and this is why when you have this positive pee pressure you benefit a lot in this Dunya so many people have o c d obsessive compulsive disorder they have wias they have bad ideas Allah cures them when they are in the company of righteous people and these wisat increase if they are with the company of the the people of the dun fancy cars fancy wives fancy houses fancy jobs was everything going to hell this is why it increases your WIS it increases your depression and this is why our Prophet told usam that Allah's hand is with the JAMA with the Muslim majority and he told us that Shan would only attack a stray sheep he would not attack Like the Wolf the wolf does not attack the whole herd he waits until a stray sheep leaves and then he catches it if you have no positive peer pressure you are an easy prey for Shan to attack you a friend in need is a friend indeed he is the one who you immediately take your phone and look in your contact when you have a problem or you want to invite him to a wedding or to a pleasant thing he's the friend who you need and depend on him even in Hell A friend in need is a friend indeed one says a I don't want to see you in hell what would I do with you in hell what kind of friendship is this Allah says in the Quran now we have no intercessors nor a close friend to help us this is what the people in Hell say they say we don't have any close friend to help us in Hell on that day when people stand barefooted naked uncircumcised intimidated Afraid from the horrors of the day of judgment the friends let go of their best friends except the righteous Allah says friends on that day will be foes will be enemies one to another [Music] except may Allah make you and me among those who are the Righteous who fear Allah make our friendship for his sakeel yesterday I arrived from jida and I went to the mall to find a bite to eat I never go to malls in Saudi Arabia I never set foot in a mall because it hardens my heart and it takes time so I went there and I was shocked to waste half an hour of my time looking for a cheeseburger and then I thought Subhan Allah these people wasting hours after hours selecting a dress a shoe a watch some of them put so much study in selecting a car something to buy yet a friend who is much more valuable we can take them in seconds good or bad it doesn't matter we do not invest as such that is why this brings us to the negative side of the peer pressure the prophet gave gave us the example of the man working the Bellows the Bellows are these uh things that are used to make the fire start for a blacksmith who works on copper or on iron so he always has to blow uh uh the fire and to ignite it and keep it hot so the smell when you go to a place where they are barbecuing the the smell of the smoke and the and the coal and the cooking it sticks to your beard if you have a beard and to your thob and to everything around you which is similar the prophet tells usam if he doesn't burn your clothes directly with the Sparks and the fire the least you will get is what is the smell and this is why do you know so and so yeah he is with that singer he's with that actor he's with that fornicator he's a friend of that junkie who does drugs who doesn't pray this is the reputation you will get when you have such a companion befriending you so is there a negative aspect of peer pressure do we have this do we see this definitely and you can just look around and ask yourself who taught that person consuming intoxicants whether it is alcohol or drugs whether he's doing heroin cocaine amphetamines cracks myth whatever you know better than I do I hope you don't um who who taught him how to do these bad and evil things mallah he was born like this or was it his friends you're not a man come on try it it will make you happy it will make you feel good it doesn't do I'll I'll it's on me it's free first couple of days it's free then we will consume all of your money these are your peer pressure who led this poor youngster a teenager I get hundreds of questions wah hundreds of questions from teenagers complaining of pornography number one and number two masturbation who led them to this peer pressure you didn't see this well you're not a man and it goes on to prohibited and forbidden sexual relationships they go to the girl you don't have a boyfriend ah Subhan Allah you're not you're not whole you're complicated you have an issue you have a deficiency you don't have a girlfriend you're not a man are you gay why don't you have a a girlfriend Subhan Allah this is the normal type of dialogue to pressure you to bring you down to their swamp of Filth and sins when you go to women to girls who taught this nice young innocent girl how to lie to her parents ah we have a school project mother we have to stay late and she is you know where so I have so many stories about this W that would make you cry about the peer pressure on women on girls on 13-year-old girls going out with men and she comes to me and writes me a letter and gives it to me after Isa prayer she's saying I I I've done something major I didn't know who made her do this you know so the prophet told usat and you if you look also to so many women who were Mah committed on the straight path wearing hijab wearing Nik and the Agents of Shan were pumping them were trying their level best to whisper on them until they took off their hijab they took off their and now they are like everyone else peer pressure the prophet said s wasall man will be on the path of his close friends so pay attention to who you make friends with man will be on the religion the Hadith says on the religion of his friend you will take up from your friend whether you like it or not and this is why Allah the allmighty did not order us Allah ordered his messenger sallallah alaih wasallam to carefully select his friends imagine Allah ordering the messenger to select his friends Allah says every week on Friday we read this Surah Allah says and keep yourself patiently with those who call on their lord morning and afternoon seeking his face and let not your eyes Overlook them Allah is telling this to his messenger to make yourself all the time surrounded by righteous people who call Allah in the morning and the evening and don't overlook them we tend to do the opposite the prophet saidat in an authentic Hadith do not be friend with except a Believer your friends have to believer have to be Believers and why is that because they have a positive impact on you and this is why the first thing the prophet didat when he came to Medina was to make the Brotherhood bond between the ansar and the muhajirin so each one from the migrants they he assigned one from the muhajirin to be his brother and they used to inherit one another like siblings so he made uh Hamza and Z this is an exception brothers and then Abu and Sal and ABD and he made them brother 40 of the migrants with 40 of the people of ANS the peer influence is huge is great Abu Bakr the minute may Allah be pleased with him Embrace Islam what did he do six of the 10 heavenbound Embrace Islam on his hands this is why he's the highest in Iman and reward of the um of prophet Muhammad iban and so on all of them accepted Islam because of peer pressure positive Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him but look at the amount of people who deviated and rejected Islam because Abu jahal and the most famous one is who the uncle of the Prophet Abu Talib on his dying bed the prophet says oh my uncle say a single statement that I can intercede on the day of judgment with it I will ask Allah by it just say and Abu jahel is on the other side of the bed telling him would you leave the religion of your father ABD mutalib and he kept on influencing him until he died onur peer influencing if you sit with what do we call you know in Saudi the are those who have beads and short thobes regardless they they are known as M if you sit with a for a while after two three days without feeling it when someone does something to you you say even if you don't know what this means but because you've heard it so many times from them you start picking it up on the other side of the coin those who watch a lot of movies when they see a truck coming to kill them they're about to die what do they say holy fill the space why because they've watched so many movies this is the word that they always hear on everybody's tongue this is f good man Fe Allah what is this oh I didn't mean it I didn't mean it peer influencing if you sit with people who all the time backbite others what will you do you'll contribute you have to everybody's speaking yeah he's short he's fat he's tall he's thin he's stingy he's this he's that and you were sitting there Idle No I have to have some contribution you know some boxing efforts or a punch below the belt or above the belt whatever you backbite people muak somebody mentioned in his presence someone backbiting him he told him fear Allah did you make Jihad against the Persians did you make Jihad against the bantian the room the Faris the the disbelievers did you make Jihad against any of the enemies of Islam he said no say Subhan Allah the room the force the cafir they're all safe and in security from your attacks and your Muslim brother is not W it is not permissible for you to harm a dog it is not permissible for you to harm a pig how dare you harm a Muslim brother of yours like this so now we have a an issue and this issue is that what is the worst peer pressure one could find the worst peer pressure I consider to be available at the moment is the media where whether it is television radio whether it is printed newspapers and magazines or what is known as the social media this is the worst that has influence on you it changes your mind it changes your heart even your own personal home it changes your wife it changes your children it plays with their minds and also sisters it changes your husbands and you can tell my husband wasn't like this now he's picky why are you wearing uh uh uh 34 or 38 why aren't you 26 or 24 or whatever why aren't you doing this and why he's saying weird things and with all due respect but this is happening because of negative PE pressure this is what they see on the media my son wants to get married you give him a list of women nice girls no she has to be blonde blueeyed uh uh uh 51 weighing less than 60 kgs and she knows how to ski and to play the violin but now she's practicing and has the Quran memorized by the seven and knows the bukari and Muslim in the four books of Sunnah if I knew such a girl I would have married her this is only found in Jenna are you crazy where are they getting this from it's from the media and this is wherever you go the people are on their Idols Asam they're always on their mobile phones they call it smartphones I call it stupid phones because it deteriorate your IQ level whatever they they are giving to you are soaking it like a sponge and these are the worst things that you have to be careful what to do most of us and I'm one of youas I made the mistake and I brought my children in my home smartphones what you doas give up and just go to hell alhamdulillah no you have to fight you have to take the measures this is not the time to give Solutions because the time allocated is not for that it's just an eyeopener you have to remove the passcode from their phones so it's accessible to anyone if possible possible go back to Nokia 150 dham there is a very good type with a a flashlight that's good with a flashlight even in in in darkness you know electricians can use this very good okay so alhamdulillah the these are the things to be used for internet access the television or the the monitor should be displayed to everyone in the living room so anyone accessing it his back is not to the wall his back has to be to the people and the people should be looking and they can see what is being displayed so let us conclude with saying that souls are weak we have weak Souls don't we well are we strong w we have the weakest of All Souls and we change and fluctuate rapidly and in Arabic we have a saying means a companion sah means pulling you he pulls you so your friend pulls you and he has to have an impact on you and this is a social experiment if you are in a place not in a place where you get an SMS or a message with a video clip of a child of 5 months old doing something and breaking in laughter what do you do you laugh if someone next to you hysterically laughs what do you do you laugh because this is something that you catch out of another if someone next to you is depressed or crying you feel sad what is this I don't want to be here if someone in the room yawns you find three or four for yawning they have the impact you don't know why this is happening a fresh flower a fresh Rose or fresh water when you bring a corpse of a dead animal and you put it next to them 2 hours and they'll be rotten as well therefore you as a Muslim you have to be an Imam you have to be a leader calling people to goodness and have influence over them if you un able to be that at least be a follower in goodness so always accompany those who are righteous to have a positive peer pre uh pressure on you and influence and be careful not to be an Imam leading others to hell or following others to hell and what they usually say when you are in Rome do as the Romans do do not be an IM what is an if people do good we do well if people do evil we do evil always have your identity as a Muslim be proud of it and try your level best to call people to Islam and may Allah give us the best of Companions and make us the best of leaders and imams to the Muslims in ta"
