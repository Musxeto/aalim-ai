  "transcript": "uh in my country there are not many good options for segregate education and education is first on Muslims so again who says education is yeah when are you getting these rules we'll say this so people this is not taking the Islam religion from the right sources okay so how should we go about it see the problem is when you build your beliefs and convictions on wrong platforms it's like someone's building a high Riser without Foundation the moment floods or a hurricane or some wind or an Earth where it comes it collapses is our religion this is our beliefs all of us all of us even in Saudi Arabia even in matka and Medina they've changed in less than two three years 180 degrees why the foundation is wrong what was the foundation foreign the foundation I'll give you an example and I will conclude with this the prophet how many years did he stay in Mecca 13. there was no Salah there was no fasting there was no zakat there was no umrah there was no Hajj there was no Islamic legislations in marriage divorce it prescribed punishment transactions River nothing what was he doing 15 years subhanallah nobody contemplates on this he was teaching them he was teaching them who Allah is he was teaching them the six pillars of Iman I do counseling sessions you know this is my bread and butter this is how I make my living I don't work so I do Council paid counseling sessions very expensive but I can afford it because people who come to me are rich so I ask people who have problems us Marathon issues yeah and the uh doubts about Allah I asked him about the basics I said to him that every single person I say to you do you know the six pillars of Iman of course I'm asking you do you know the pillars of Iman not the pillars of Islam and I said six not five this is uh new is it an upgrade version I said no but because you're so ignorant of Islam you don't know your religion where is Ronaldo at the moment everybody knows they know worldly matters they know this and that of actors of footballers of critic cricketers or whatever but when you ask them about the ten Heaven bound of the companions um no so they give five six names no no the ten that are Heaven bounded the prophet name you will find someone giving you more than six names seven names ten never why we all know you go to Jannah may Allah make us all go to Jannah they'll introduce you this is never heard that and this is I thought he was a female what is this and this is I don't know anybody here uh can we go and visit Hellfire so we take him to Hellfire I said oh Masha Allah I know everybody here they're homies they're my people this is problematic when you don't know the people of Jannah but you know the people of Health which shows you where you will be probably ending so coming back to the issue six pillars of Iman to believe in Allah to believe in a day of judgment to believe in the angels to Believe In The Messengers to believe in the scriptures whether evil or good this is this experience every man mentioned in the same Hadith of the five pillars of Islam people don't know it this is what the prophet used to teach his people 13 years and we used to teach them the beauty of Quran and he used to teach them who he was so that they would praise him they would love him they would sacrifice their lives for him this is what we lack if I ask you when did the Battle of take place said long time ago very good masha'allah he's not a quiz I'm not asking for answers I know that you know being diplomatic so um this is what we should teach our children which is what we should learn how can you find the sweetness of Iman the most impressive people on Earth to me when it comes to prayer Our pakistanis and Indians we Saudis are lousy we pray over and live these people foreign you know that it is forced to free to pray 17 raqqa of Asia who said so he said he 'll say is foreign no problem but don't relate it to Russia it's impressive how pakistanis bangladeshis Indians they adore the system but are they doing it with conviction or out of habit so we have to go to the foundations build it I don't know what the question was today yes so now we come to this question we know that education is for who said it's fault it's not fun for this to learn the Quran to learn the Sunnah to know who Allah is is it possible that I give you a paper now and say tell to tell you write to me 99 Names of Allah the prophet said whoever implements them memorizes them understand their meaning they will intergenerally you want the inter gender show me I know only 20. this is what 30 percent yeah you will not make it 20 to General these 20 names you know of Allah explain the meaning how many surahs do you memorize in the Quran oh I know uh Allah means so you recite it every single day 25 times and you don't know the meaning what does it mean so what Islam are you practicing yes yeah but they have a very long been and a very short throw and a big miswah you don't have this one so I'm a good Muslim no a good Muslim is in the heart in your belief this is what makes you when you come to a fork of the road say no I'm not going this way I'm going to stand firm on this way because this is what Allah loves but we don't have this when it comes to our income can I skip Ramadan for your income can I skip prayers skip prayers you have meetings can I skip shahada I have to go too dark as what is left of Islam this is our biggest problem so coming back to the question is seeking knowledge worldly knowledge no it's not fun it's a communal obligation if one does it the rest are Exempted if none of us do it then we are all sinful so one has to be a doctor one has to be engineered one has to be ashamed now the whole Community is self-sufficient but it does not allow us to break the rules or even to bend them just because we want to be something or we want to prove something we have to abide Always by the regulations of Quran [Music] and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and the evening I will uh try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah"
