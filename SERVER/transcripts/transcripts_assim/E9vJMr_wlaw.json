  "transcript": "yeah I just wanted to ask you about a woman who wants to perform a homura she's made she's made the intention when she arrives in Mecca she realizes that shows that she's on her period she she has a the Menses um so what can she do and what can she not do in Mecca basically and is she gonna get the reward of omra okay first of all a woman who comes to perform umrah she assumes her Ram the intention is in the heart while flying to Jeddah about 25 to 35 minutes before landing usually the captain announces or the flight attendant that we're approaching the Haram zone for those who are interested in making umrah she says and intends that she is so if someone says here is a nail clipper to clip your nails she says I'm in the state of isram okay here's some perfume I'm in the state of Haram that's it she's a mohram if she reaches Mecca and before she attempts to perform her umrah she gets her menses she's obliged not to go and enter the Masjid what to do she has to wait until she's pure okay alhamdulillah she has a Visa of two weeks and she's planning to stay for two weeks in Mecca and Medina so she will be pure before that time in this case she remains in her state of a Haram she goes to the restaurant have breakfast lunch dinner brunches go to the executive lounge and drink coffee and tea no problem but she is prohibited and she's restricted from doing anything of the uh things prohibited in Haram such as wearing perfume such as wearing the niacab wearing gloves such as cutting her hair clipping her nails Etc after she is pure she makes her Russell and she goes to make her umrah okay what happens if she's Bound To Fly before her purity in this case at the last moment she may ensure that nothing is leaking and she goes to perform her to office for umrah due to necessity and then she can fly back home now all of this could have been avoided if while flying to Jeddah before she assumed her Haram knowing that she may get her period today or tomorrow or day after she says I intend to have this but in case there's something blocking me from continuing or completing my ritual then I may reject my Ram and become Halal as I was before this due to this legitimate reason of being blocked unable to continue my armor and if this happens the moment she gets her Menses she can wear her normal clothes and she could do whatever she wants to do as a normal person not as a person in a Haram as per your question what can she do she could do everything she wants to do she cannot pray she cannot fast she cannot have intimacy with her spouse and she cannot enter the Masjid other than that the sky is the limit"
