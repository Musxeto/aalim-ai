  "title": "Is it permissible to download YouTube videos using 3rd party Apps or Websites? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "thank you basically I would like to know is it permissible for me to download videos off of YouTube using third-party websites considering that YouTube has it in its privacy policy for bidding any sort of downloading uh I just want to download for example the sheets or um so I can have it in my car without needing internet for you know watching the videos and stuff like this this is an issue that some say it's ethical and others say that it is not and to me it seems that this is permissible because they are putting policies according to their own preferences not to my consent so as long as I'm not harming anyone there's no problem inshallah in doing that as long as I'm not violating anybody's copyright or taking money that is not lawful for me I hope inshallah that there is nothing prohibited in that especially if it's something like Quran which is Allah's words there is nothing wrong in that and Allah Knows Best"
