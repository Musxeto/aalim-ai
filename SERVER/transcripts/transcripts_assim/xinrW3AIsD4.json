  "title": "How many wives did the Prophet ﷺ‎ have? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "as for the number of wives the Prophet had a sum he died with nine wives with him and they differed whether he in total married eleven thirteen less or more depending on the wives that he did not marry al Junia for example was a woman from a noble tribe but somebody tricked her or she herself after the wedding was done when the Prophet came to his house and he approached her she said I seek refuge in Allah from you that was sufficient so the Prophet said if you sought refuge in Allah then no one is greater than Allah go to your family you're divorced because she sought refuge in Allah so the Prophet could not do anything but that so there is a dispute and an issue of difference among the people of Shira in regards of that and Allah knows best"
