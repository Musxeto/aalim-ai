  "title": "What is Sirat (Bridge)& Who are the people who cross the Sirat with lightning speed- Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Adam says I heard that some people will cross the salaat like lightning who are those people well let us break it down what is the Seurat Seurat is the way but when we talk about the day of judgement the word Seurat has a particular meaning and this refers to a bridge over the edges of Hellfire so in order to go to safety you have to cross the bridge now this bridge is unlike any other bridge first of all on the day of judgement when you cross the bridge it would be pitch black and people will be given light according to their good deeds and this is mentioned in Surat al-hadid and also in salat team the believers will be given light in front of them and to the right the bridge wet is also variable so to those who have good deeds it would be very white and for those who have bad deeds there are more than their good deeds or have no good deeds to begin with it would be as sharp as a blade and as thin as a hair thirdly the speed of people crossing it or also is variable it varies some as the prophet told us Allah salat wa sallam cross it in a blink of an eye others cross it in the speed of lightning others cross it as the speed of wind and hurricanes and others cross it as if they are on the horse on the back of horses that are very fast others jog across others walk and unfortunately others walk and crawl sometimes because they fall and others don't make it at all hooks from Hellfire comes and picks them up and throws them in hell so who are those who are so fortunate to cross it in a blink of an eye this is all dependent on your good deeds the prophets stand at the side of the Sarat of this bridge and they supplicate to Allah by saying a llama seldom seldom oh Allah make things go in safety in good terms because they're afraid for their people those who have good deeds their good deeds were illuminate and give them light so they can see where they're walking and they do not slip and fall over their speed the width the light they're given all is dependent on their good deeds and we know that good deeds erase bad deeds and this is why we tell you to always charge your credit we always tell people he make an extra homra give charity for the cause of Allah pray for you more raucous before fajar as night prayer maintain fasting Mondays and Thursdays every week and the three white days if you can every month try your level best to engage in vicar 24/7 so when we when you're walking from your home to the message don't think about the debts you have or about the things you want to do instead just say subhanAllah alhamdulillah allahu akbar la ilaha illa ma well ahora la quwata illa billah' as this elevates your level in Paradise increases your good deeds it raises your bad deeds so that when it comes on the day of judgment for you to cross the Sirat then you would be in good hands with the grace of Allah it's not it's worth saying that only the Muslims and the hypocrites would cross this Sarat disbelievers are taken initially and thrown into hell so the only people who would cross the Sirat are the believers and the semi believers and when we say the believers we do not exclusively say that there are the Muslims the followers of Prophet Muhammad erase all of them no this includes the followers of ISA of Jesus Christ peace be upon him until the time of our prophet these are considered to be Muslims and also it includes the Jews who followed Moses until the time of Jesus and all the followers of the previous messengers and prophets of Allah as watching you"
