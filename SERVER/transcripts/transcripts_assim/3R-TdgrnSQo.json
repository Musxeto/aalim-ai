  "transcript": "[Music] how do we calculate zakat on 22 gold 22 karat gold first of all zebra what are the conditions that we have to pay zakat over gold condition number one it has to reach the threshold condition number two a full lunar year must pass while it is in our possession so condition two i'm not going to talk about we were assuming that you got it as a gift from your in-laws exactly one lunar year ago now we come to the threshold what is the threshold the threshold in or for gold is 85 grams of 24 carat gold so if you have 12 84.5 grams of 24 carat gold there is no zakat on it clear clear so what if what if i have 18 carat of gold or 20 carats of gold or 22 what is the 18 20 22 16 it means that there are grams in this one carrot that are not made of gold so the 22 carrot gold has 22 for example portions of real gold and two portions of copper to compensate so it's not 24 carat it is 22 16 whatever so if i have a 100 grams of 16 carrot gold do i have to give zakat or not well first of all we have to convert that into 24 carat of gold so we go to the calculator i have a hundred grams of 16 carat so the 100 i multiply it by 16 and i divide it by 24. how much gold do i have in this um gold of mine how many 24 karat it has 66 grams of 24 karat of gold there is no zakat wow i didn't know that check so if i have a hundred grams of 22 carats of gold do i pay the cat for that multiply 100 by 22 divided by 24 and it gives you 91 grams of 24 carat gold you have to pay zakat for that because it's over 85. how to calculate the cat if you don't want to undergo this process i have half a kilo so it's definitely above 85 carat of uh 85 grams of 24 karat gold definitely half a kilo you're talking about a lot of uh grants here so i don't want to do the calculation i know that it is above the threshold how do i calculate zakat multiply by 2.5 divide by 100 and if you want to make it one single shot just easily whatever amount you have divide that by 40. usually what people say do is they calculate the gold and they ask how much is the value of the gold and they're giving a certain amount of euros dollars whatever and then they simply divided by 40 the result would be the zakat amount so if i have 80 000 dollars of uh uh gold divided by 40 my result is 2 000 this is my zakat 2 000 is to be given for zakat oh that's simple so if i have 40 000 1000 is your zakat if i have a hundred thousand two thousand five hundred is your zakat and so on"
