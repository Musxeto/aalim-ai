  "title": "Sinful husband forces wife to lie while she is fasting, should she divorce him",
  "transcript": "Fatima from India okay my question is as divorce happens to be the most disliked yet permissible thing by Allah in this case if a husband indulges in a lot of sinning like minor sinning not the major ones like telling lies and he also forces his wife to tell lies that too at times when she is observing her obligatory fasts then would it be preferable to live with such a person or would it be better to leave such a person who makes practicing Islam very difficult for the wife this is something that cannot be answered over a live program like this in the sense that you cannot give an advice to a woman to demolish her uh [Music] house and marriage over such data that you had given we don't know if she is divorced does she have a family to take her in and provide for her and take care of her we don't know if she's divorced she will be able to live without a man in her life and will there be anyone willing to marry her and the difficulties resulting from a divorce are far worse than what she was say facing and suffering in her marriage these small sins everyone has them so are they a legitimate reason to ask for divorce what do you mean that practicing Islam becomes difficult all of these things need to be discussed and I would recommend if you can afford it to book a session because divorce is not an easy thing to do anyone would say yep divorce him and he wouldn't pay any attention to the consequences that may result and this is not very wise you need to know everything in detail and Allah Knows Best"
