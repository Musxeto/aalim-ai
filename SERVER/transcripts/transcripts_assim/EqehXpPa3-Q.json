  "transcript": "Dr Zakia is it permissible for one who is unable to fast to feed one person for 30 days or 30 people in one day as far as fidya for a person who can't fast or is unable to fast the Quran say in Surah Bak chapter number two verse number 184 that if a person finds it difficult to keep the fast or finds fasting with hardship then he can either fast or he can feed one Indigent person for every fast that he has missed so if a person who misses the full month of Ramadan for example and if he has to give fidya he has both the options open he either calls 30 people and feeds them together so that compensates or gives fidya for all the 30 days that the person has missed or he can even give one person fidya for 30 days and each person should be given One S of the staple food of that state of that country one sial 1 and a half kilog approximately and both rulings are there as it's mentioned in the ruling of Abbas inkari number six number 4505 in commentary of this verse of the Quran of Bak 2 vers 184 it says that those people who find it difficult ult to fulfill the fast to complete the fast they either complete it or feed one indent person and it says that these type of people described are very old men and women or those people who have permanent disability or they have a disease which makes them difficult to fast and both typ of fast as is given in the Hadith of one of the sahabas by the name of an bin Malik m i with him when he was old the Hadith says that he cooked some food and called 30 people and fed them together the full f for the full month of Ramadan so here it shows that you can either get cooked food cook food for them and feed them well whether it be breakfast whether it be dinner whatever it is or the other option is as is also agreed upon by Imam ammed hbal Imam Shafi as well as some of the malakis that you can also give uncooked food to one person for 30 days one person only give him uncooked food for 30 days so that that compensates or give the feed there for the full month this is also agreed so the choice is all either feed one person for 30 days or 30 people for one day okay permissible fine thank you"
