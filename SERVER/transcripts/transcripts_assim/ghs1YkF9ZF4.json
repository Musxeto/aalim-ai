  "transcript": "The second question is about the gold business. We have a jewelry store, so if somebody purchases merchandise online, and let's say we agree on a certain price today, when the money is received within 24-48 hours, we keep it out. Is that allowed? Jazakum Allah Khair. The Prophet ﷺ mentioned to us six categories, and he said gold by gold, silver by silver, wheat by wheat, barley by barley, dates by dates, salt by salt. These are the six main categories of items that lead the riba items. Other items fall underneath. Gold and silver, you have currencies and banknotes falling underneath them. So the Prophet ﷺ said, when you are buying gold with silver or silver with gold, there's no problem in that, because this might be 200 grams and this might be 7 kilos. So the weight difference is permissible because the items are different, they're not identical, it's not gold and gold, it's gold and silver, or gold and dollars. But the Prophet put a condition, and this condition is that such purchase and transaction has to be physically simultaneous. Meaning that I give you the dollars and in the same instance, you give me the gold physically, and I possess it instantly. This is halal. Now if I have a gold shop and people send me requests to buy a necklace or a bracelet made of gold, and they see it and they know the weight and they send me the money and I ship it to them overnight, this is totally prohibited. Why? I cash the money. Yes, but it's not simultaneous. Therefore, scholars even went further by saying, if I have a gold shop and someone comes to buy gold from me or silver through his credit card, not through his ATM, if it was through the ATM, a thousand dollars is withdrawn immediately, it appears on my bank account. I get an SMS saying that a thousand dollars was deposited. This is instantly done. A credit card is not like that because there is a 40 days grace period and you don't know when the bank is going to transfer this amount to you. It may take some time. Therefore, such transactions are not permissible because of the fact that there is no simultaneous exchange physically and Allah knows best. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
