  "title": "Does the reward of deed suffice for an expiation Broke oath free slave Recite la ilaha illa  OK?",
  "transcript": "We have Daniel from Iraq Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullah So Sheikh in a sahih hadith the Prophet ï·º has said Whoever says La ilaha illallah wahdahu la sharika lahul mulk wa lahul amd wa huwa ala kulli shay'in qadeer Will have the reward of freeing ten slaves And we know if we break an oath we have to Either free a slave or feed ten poor people or clothe them and if we cannot we have to fast three days So, can I say that azkar to expiate the broken oath? The answer is no You cannot do this because there is a difference between a reward and an expiation And i'll give you an example if someone pledges And says by allah I will recite the full quran If allah azza wa jal cures my son and my son is cured And I look at the quran and said, oh, this is going to take me a week So I hear a hadith where the prophet says alayhis salam Reciting three times is equivalent to reciting the quran. I said, okay And I recited three times and it's sufficient Is it sufficient? I'll give you a better example. Maybe this is not clear Is your prayer valid without reciting al fatiha? The answer is no you have to recite the fatiha. So if I recite Qul hu allahu ahad three times in every rak'ah without the fatiha based on if I Recite it three times i've read Or I have the word of the full quran would be would my prayer be valid? Of course not. I have to recite the fatiha once another example The prophet said alayhis salam whoever prays fajr in the masjid and remains in his spot Remembering allah azza wa jal till the sun rises then he prays two rak'ah. This is equivalent to umrah and hajj complete complete complete So if I do this once or even every single day Does this exempt me from performing hajj once in a lifetime, which is fard and one of the pillars of islam? Of course not so there is a difference between Something that you're rewarded for But it does not take away From you any responsibility or obligation? And there is a difference between something that you're commanded To do and allah azza wa jal knows best And this is in by the way in arabic they call it al ijza wa al jaza Whether it suffices or it's rewarding"
