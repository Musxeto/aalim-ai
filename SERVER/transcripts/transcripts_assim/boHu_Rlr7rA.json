  "transcript": "Arham from India. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. Sheikh, as we have as we have fingerprints on our fingers as it is similar that and we also have fingerprints on our foot or take lines on our heels. If dirt or and soil fix in between, does it act as a barrier in Wudu? If what? Does it act as a barrier in Wudu? What are you asking about? We have fingerprints. I know, I know, I've heard this. What is in the grooves of your heels and your footprints? What is it? Take lines in my heels and and my fingers on feet. If an impurity or so if a dirt or soil fix in between this, does it act as a barrier in Wudu? If there is something that can be removed with ease, yes it is a barrier. But if it's something that is part of the skin or something that is a color that cannot be removed, then this is not a barrier. A barrier is mass, like a layer of plastic, a layer of glue that you can peel off or remove with certain materials. So this is a barrier. But other substances, some people's heels are black when they are not black in color, but their heels are black because they walk barefooted and it's almost dead skin. This is not a barrier, this is part of the skin itself, and Allah knows best."
