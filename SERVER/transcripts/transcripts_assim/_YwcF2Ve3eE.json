  "transcript": "or if I I'm know I know that I'm not saying the name correctly she's saying what's the ruling on following a particular maab and we've answered this question before if you are someone who's a layman in mechanics I'm a Layman if something happens to my car uh uh cars engine I would not have an iota of what's going on so as a layman in mechanics I have to go to someone and he would tell me you have to change the spark plugs you have to do this you have to do that and I would take his word for it and whatever happens it's his responsibility so if you're a layman in Islamic teachings in Sciences you don't have the ability to understand Quran in Arabic you rely on people translating the meaning and then translation might be right and might be wrong you don't have the basics of fundamentals of f or the F in general or the the interpretation and the commentary on the Hadith of the Prophet Alam if this is the case in your case you should follow someone who you trust whether it is a scholar a contemporary scholar that you can go and ask and read his fatwas and communicate with and and you trust his knowledge not only that you trust his religious commitment because I know a lot of Scholars on YouTube and and on TV channels that might be knowledgeable yet they're deviant and they're consuming people's money and they're calling the masses and they're making fiery speeches but they have no Iman in their hearts they're they're frauds so you have to trust their knowledge Islamic knowledge and you have to trust their religious commitment and you know that they are 24/7 abiding by the Quran and Sunnah you ask those around them you see them practicing you don't see any open sin or lies or deceit if you don't want to do this then you may follow one maab one school of thought and follow it because you trust the scholars who follow it and you think that this is the thing that you can uh uh follow now it is not permissible for you as a Layman to sit back and say oh I like this from hanab but this is better in shaf and I will take this from H maab and you pick and choose this is not permissible if you're a student of knowledge if you have enough knowledge that qualifies you to look into the schools of thought and select what is most authentic and closest to the Quran and Sunnah this is acceptable but the 99.9% of the Muslims are not like this they are Layman they don't have enough knowledge and they have to stick to one school of thought or to one scholar uh secondly"
