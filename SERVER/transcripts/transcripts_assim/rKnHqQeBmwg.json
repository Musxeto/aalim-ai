  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] bismillah r-rahman r-rahim o salat wa salam ala rasulillah kareem welcome back to episode 4 of life's Dorman's where we discussed the virtues the responsibilities the difficulties and the ins and outs of child-rearing Hum Dil I'm your host use of chroma we know that it is a great beauty is a great excitement that parents have when it comes to raising children or wanting children however they do come with great responsibilities and it is a great effort that must be placed into the up rearing of children so today we're happy that we have our honored guests Sheikh awesome milkman and Hakim I was a teacher at that Academy and a teacher at Kiu hamdullah he is joined us here today all the way from Sur idea to grant us his immense knowledge and his wisdom particle effects you I said I'm on the clock wow you're a character and it's an honor for me to be here I'm the lesser pleasure this is a statement that says all good things begin with bismillah so at the onslaught of a person with the NIA to to insect conceive a child which a man say upon entering his wife was the intention of intimacy she ran over him and hamdulillah salat wa salam o allah rasool allah i do so happy on earth did it be who there who am i bad it goes without saying that islam governs every aspect of our lives and it covers it in a way that leaves little room for maneuvering and this is part of being slaves and servants of allah azzawajal Islam is submission and you cannot submit your will to Allah Almighty if you keep on asking why or what is the reason or the justification and the logic this is not submission submission this is someone talking and objecting to appear of his in Islam it's totally different and this is why by the way the the Jews objected to salman al-farisi may allah be pleased with him and in a forum or in a way of ridiculing Islam they said to him your messenger sallallaahu are you seldom taught you everything even forgive my French how to take a crap and Salman was not offended rather he was honored and he said yes the Prophet told us is awesome not to face or to give our backs to the Qibla that this is the Kaaba the direction of prayer when defecating or urinating and not to hold our private parts with our right hand and not to cleanse ourselves from impurities with our right hands and to use stones when needed not less than three times all of this means that the Companions acknowledge the fact that every single thing they do must be in accordance to the Sunnah of the Prophet Isis when thinking of the future and of conceiving children it's not something isolated it is still in the same pipeline which it means that whenever a person is interested in having intimacy which is why he got married in the first place it's not something that you do and leave there's a process and procedure and there's a way of doing it and the Prophet highlighted this audience a lot of sinner by showing us the product of the process and by telling us about the outcome so he said when one of you wants to have intimacy with with his wife and he says bismillah Allahu Magendie - Shaitaan version a v-shape on Amara's aqua tena then in this case Satan would never harm this child that resulted from such intimacy or intercourse what is the dora bismillah in the name of Allah and bismillah is something we say in the beginning of almost everything we do so when I want to write something I write bismillah which means in the name of Allah in the name of God I write when I want to eat I say bismillah which means in the name of Allah I eat so everything of value we begin it with bismillah so you say bismillah Allah imagine living a Shaitaan or God or Allah protect us from Satan virgin Navy shaitana mama Zatanna and make Satan avoid what you have blessed us with meaning your spouse so the Prophet says if you say this dry before you start intercourse what does this do if you were granted a child due to this it will be protected and Shaitaan will never harm that child what does that mean Sheikh does it mean that he will never commit a sin does it mean that he will never have whispers of Shaitan and doubts like everybody else no scholars all agree that this is not what was meant what was meant was that either this trait this individual child will be among the righteous so Shaitaan will not make him among the deviant or that he will be protected from disbelief and qu4 so Shaitaan would not control him and make him a disbeliever or that Shaitaan will not have the ability to possess that child and in Arabic we call it salah which is seizures and these seizures can be caused by an imbalance of electric waves in the brain and this is a medical thing and it can be caused by possession of the devil the genie either way with the grace of Allah so gel and after that with the saying this duaa before intercourse this protects your child if a child would result from it in sha Allah okay so this begs the question then for the individuals who are not malign them like who have not studied who don't understand it and then also sick or even the bit you know basics of what should be done in these situations does that mean then that a person should refrain from getting marriage until they understand the filth of a marriage the fickle divorce they fill out what to do with child Sabir so how do we approach this I know many does get married you know without any knowledge of the Medora so this is like saying there are a number of etiquettes before eating and after eating yes so if I don't know these etiquette should I refrain from eating and starve to death no it wasn't married or badda it is I bad and so is eating so if I'm going to eat but I don't know how to say bismillah or hamdulillah that how many high dollars Akane or to eat with the right hand so should I say to listen I'm gonna fast until know this these things are recommended highly recommended and not mandated okay so if a person does not say that dry bismillah l'homme de genève necessary upon a generous time others often he doesn't say either intentionally or because he doesn't know this does not impact the validity of the marriage it does not impact the child and by the way a lot of the Muslims don't know or say this drug so do we condemn their children to be deviant or evil no there are so many other ways in the Sunnah that would ensure or at least provide the child with such a protection from Sheraton vanilla excellent and there's also the route that was mentioned by the wife of armor on for Miriam that we have in a tradition is this something that was the diversity and secondly is this something that we also say as well so these doors that are mentioned in the Quran for example what Miriam's mother said well in the Ori do ha because the riittää ha min ash-shaitani rajeem oh I seek refuge in you allah for maryam and her offspring from the cursed devil and likewise other dua of other prophets and messengers of allah azza wajal seeking a righteous offspring these are mentioned in the quran the question would be are these twice because they are mentioned in the Quran Sunnah for us to say or not well we have to look at the Sunnah of the Prophet Allison so did he do that there's no so should we do that or not it's an issue of dispute the most authentic opinion is that it is permissible not an innovation but at the same time not a Sunnah one would argue and say our infants mention the Quran should it be sooner I'll give another example there was a man in the hadith is reporting Buhari and elsewhere who whenever led leading the prayer with his companions would all the time recite surat allaha la school who Allahu Ahad and another surah and his companions used to complain say listen either recite surat al-ikhlas alone chapter 1 112 or recite a separate surah but why combine to cerous he said listen either you like what I do or shoes someone else to lead so they went to the prophet alayhi salatu salam and sought his advice and the Prophet told them to ask him again why do you recite surat al-ikhlas so the man replied by saying because it has a description of Allah and I love it for that so the Prophet told them to tell him because of your love Allah loves you mm-hmm now the 1 million Kuwaiti dinar question because it's much more higher in exchange rate than the dollar yeah is it soon that you recite it or not the scholars differed some say yes because the Prophet I saw some approved of it others say no because the Prophet had never done it and the most authentic opinion is that it is not a sooner because the Prophet did not do it is awesome but it is permissible because the Prophet our system has approved it likewise this drug a pregnant woman wants to say allahumma inni Orido the deity become in a on the regime I seek refuge in you for my offspring from the cursed devil is there any problem with that no providing you don't believe it's a Sunnah because this was said in previous Lumas and which is not our legislation but saying it as a general dua there's no problem in doing that you sha la mano koala fishing this is a very essential point that could be an episode of never self mashaallah tied up we're gonna pause here shortly for our break and for the viewers stay tuned for our second portion of life's a dormancy sha allah assalamu aleikum wa rahmatullah wa barakato [Music] Salon wanna come welcome back to our fourth episode of life's adore ministers a second segment handle and now we're going to talk about once a child is born and how many lad this is one of the most dreadful moment of a person's lives to see their child come into existence by the mercy of Allah who subhana wa ta'ala and sometimes we get so carried away that many people forget the actual something so we were like the Sheikh to advise us on what do we do when a child is born what did the purpose I saw time teachers campaigns to do and how do we sort of invite this child into the world upon the Khattab and that's another Nabi Saleh Haleiwa said them well first of all there are some rituals that are not backed by authentic hadith no and there are many that are authentic and this is why schools of thought differ in regards to some of the Sunan those who say that we cannot take anything that is weak and not authentic reject it and those who say that yes we can take things that are weak or not authentic as long as it's not fabricated they would accept it and embrace it among the first that is quite popular and famous among people is to call the Adhan in the ear of a newborn so there is a hadith but the vast majority of scholars say that this hadith is not authentic which states that the Prophet as-salaam gave as an in the ear of Al Hassan or Hussein when he was born or when they were born but the hadith is not authentic those who accept it and embrace it say that it is not something to do with Helen and Haram it is not something to do with the world of the unseen heaven and hell it is in favor idol I am al in the things that are not mandatory in our deeds of worship to allah azza wajal so they accepted and they justify it and say that when a person dies we perform the funeral prayer which has no advantage comma so this then is to announce that this newborn is about to die in to be preyed upon the funeral prayer but this is again not something authentic some people go to an extra mile and say yeah you give a van in the right ear of a newborn and then you give the Akama in the left ear of a newborn and this is totally baseless and while you're at it might as well pray to or archives you just did again in your time up free to extra records or who cares no this is not from the sunnah and the hadith is not authentic I personally advise people not to do it because I've done in the to call there than at all because as long as it's not backed up by an authentic hadith then why would I do it I should not do it and I should refrain from doing it the child is born and I have a child what's the first thing to do there is a Sunnah that is not very well known to Muslims which is called a technique the palate of the mouth or the sealing of the mouth from the inside this is called I think the palate Nepal ok this area the Sunnah for the first thing to enters a child's stomach after being born is as explained in the hadith the children whenever they were born their parents would bring the child fresh to the Prophet a little ceramic and technique is to take a very tiny piece of date and chew it up until it's really moist and take a very little part and put it in the palate of the child's mouth so it's in the roof of his mouth and the ceiling of his mouth so that the first thing he tastes and enters his stomach is this sweet thing scholars differed some say this is only for the prophet alayhi salatu salam others say no this should be done for every child through one of the scholars or the righteous people of the community and the most authentic opinion is the third opinion which says only the father or the mother should do it because we cannot seek anyone's blessing other than the Prophet Isis arum we acknowledge as his saliva Salalah Allah is a blessing by itself but I can say to you or to some great Grand Mufti or major scholar that his saliva is as blessed as anything no he's like any Tom Dick or Harry there's no blessing in him at all this is between him and Allah the prophet on the other hand are a selasa is a different story so the most authentic opinion is that this process should be done by either the father or the mother what are the benefits medically it's been proven that the lack of glucose in the child's and the newborns bloodstream causes a lot of deficiency in failure in the respiratory system so this glucose that you add to the child the moment it's born prevents from changing color into blue of the skin problems with the respiratory system and enhances the way of him accepting his mother's milk because of that okay so what about the placenta what does to be done to us some people keep the placenta some people say should be buried what would it be no there is nothing mentioned in the Quran or in the Sunna in this regard so if it is medically proven that it would benefit a person after being born few years down the line to get some stem cells or whatever things that would help him or cure him medically so preserving it and keeping it is totally permissible if not it even we can't say it's recommended to bury because this was not reported towards to us so just throw it in the dustbin without any problem in that neshama okay we know that when I shall Adela Hana I used to come and ask about certain conditions of a child which would was her her way when she would enter upon childbirth yeah I think we've mentioned this that her approach was whenever given the glad tidings that a woman gave birth to a child she wouldn't ask whether it's a male or female because this is the first thing we ask usually when someone tells says your sister gave birth to a child the masha'allah boy or girl this is what we usually ask mother aisha used to say is the child well formed meaning that hamdulillah there is no disability there is nothing defect in him nothing wrong they say yes and she says may praise be to Allah Azza WA JAL and then she asks whether it's a boy or a girl okay now this is the part that a lot of people focus on I spend a lot of time which is the test Mia we know with from the narration of the processor lambda1 if this woman is to name a child a good name as in the case he named Hassan and Hussein and has mentioned that earlier or Dullahan who wanted to name them how much I thought into this but this is what I've learned and read before so what is the sunnah of naming a child i would it was a good name what are some things that we should avoid i know for example if i some said that we should not take his connie a certain names for example the names of Spano Tejada I'm not sure of the dispute whether person can name is sun-like anymore right man without putting the upload of the daughter in front of it what are some ways to navigate this use if you've opened the Pandora Box this topic is so huge and vast I don't know if I'm gonna cover it all because I'm too old to remember but let me give it a shot first of all whose responsibility is to give the name so many times I get phone calls from couples and the woman says it's not fair I had the burden of conceiving this child for nine months sleepless nights the contractions of the labor and the delivery and the postnatal bleeding a blah blah blah and then I'm deprived from naming him the Islamic answer is it's the man's not world it's a man's choice to name the boy or the girl because that child would be attributed to him no one says he is Abdullah the son of Hadiya no he's Abdullah the son of Mohammed the father so he will be carrying his name so he's responsible for choosing the name this doesn't mean he doesn't consult on the contrary it's part of good manners to ask your wife listen I'm thinking of naming the boy X Y or Z what do you think is best if she says H no no this is not part of the options I'm giving you three options to choose from that would be fun don't be nice if he's an easygoing person and she chooses a good name there's nothing wrong in accepting that it would not insult you or tarnish your reputation as a man to ask your wife the Prophet himself erase awesome to consult his wives in what to do as in the hood they'd be a incident where the Muslims were rejected from entering and going to mecca for Umbra and the Prophet ordered them to shave their heads they were in sit away from as a massa does and to slaughter their sacrifices and they did not comply so he's angry he went back to Ole Miss ulema and he said look at your people that disobeying me I'm telling him to shave and none of them is complying she said o prophet of allah they depressed don't be angered with their action just simply go out and ask the barber to shave your head and look what they do so the Prophet did that I saw some and they immediately compiled so he consulted his wife so you're not more man than he was area salat WA Salam you're not even close to that so there's no problem in asking her I'm picking up this name so what do you think of it so this is one aspect of responsibility it's the man's choice now what type of names what names are prohibited when is the naming ceremony done this requires a lot of parking I don't know if we have enough time yeah yeah actually what we're going to do is going to pick this up on the next episode because it's something that should be given I'll get him on the time because I even have another question about naming the children after maleic and whole bunch of other things like this so I shall let say Allah thank you for your Tommy's wisdom your knowledge viewers please stay tuned for our next episode and look out for the topic of the Testament the naming of the child until next time assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh [Music] [Music] you [Music]"
