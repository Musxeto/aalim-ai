  "title": "Is performing different types of ibadah after completing umrah permissible? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "from saudi arabia tamil says that we see after the people finish the say in umrah we have tawaf which is seven rounds around the kaaba then we go to the mountains of uh safaol marwa and we make seven rounds and by this we conclude our umrah and we cut short or shave so afterwards he say he says that we see people offering many types of ibadah if these ibadah are related to the umrah this is an innovation but if someone finished his umrah and doesn't have anything to do and he he decided to stay in the masjid offer prayers because one prayer is 100 equivalent to 100 000 prayers elsewhere or to read the quran or to engage in vicar until the time of there is nothing wrong in that so you have to confirm that what they're doing is a ritual or a number of rituals that are related to the umbra in order for you to classify it or label it as innovation other than otherwise there's nothing wrong in doing that"
