  "title": "Accidentally gave salam after 2 rakahs in dhuhr, must I repeat the whole prayer? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "good question if i prayed and accidentally gave to sleep after two raka's must i pray again or does sujud sahu suffice this is a typical incident that took place and the prophet al-assam was the one who did this so he prayed one of the two prayers and he offered two raka's include concluded it with salam and then went to the pulpit crossed his fingers in the two hands like this and put his cheek and he was preoccupied with something in his mind he was angry so the companions did not know what to do until one of them stood up who had long arms and he was known as zulyaden and he said oh prophet of allah one of two either you forgot or the salah was abrogated and shortened into two raka's so the prophet said i did not forget and it was not abrogated then the companions knew that it was a mistake by the prophet if it's not from the sharia which he cannot make a mistake in it's not an abrogation then definitely he forgot as a human being so when they confirmed to the prophet that he only prayed two raka's he immediately went down faced the qibla continued his third and fourth rakah then offered the shahudan salutation upon the prophet salam offered salam then offered to sujud of forgetfulness then offered salaam again and the hadith is narrated by abu huraira please with him this means that you do not repeat the prayer if you remember immediately afterwards or by a short span of time then you have to go and complete what was missed from your prayer and offer sujudis as described to you you"
