  "transcript": "Sharing the responsibility is not only in teaching them, sharing the responsibility in the house. Who among you washes the dishes in the kitchen of the men? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Which is very good. Wallahi, it's very pleasing. In Saudi Arabia, everybody raised their hands and say, Sheikh we have plastic dishes, disposable. We don't need to wash. Which is good. The Prophet ﷺ, who cooks in the house? One. The same one who does the dishes. Very good. I cook sometimes. I make excellent steaks, I make excellent hot dogs. That's all. The Prophet ﷺ, when Aisha was asked, how is the Prophet in the house? She said, when the Prophet enters the house, he used to ﷺ, he used to work for his family. So he used to sew his clothes. He used to fix his shoes himself. And he used to milk the goat. But when it was calling for the salah, he would go to the salah. Now, compare apple to apple. How are you in the house? Wallahi, Sheikh, when I enter the house, I throw my clothes everywhere in the bedroom. I don't care about the bathroom. I sit and extend my legs and have the remote controls and I just make orders. Bring me tea. Bring me coffee. Go and get me some water. Turn on the air conditioner. I don't move in the house. I just instruct people to do things. Okay, do you help with the family, with the wife? No. Why did I get married? She's supposed to do everything. No. This is wrong. You will not be fulfilling the needs of a woman if you do not share the responsibility."
