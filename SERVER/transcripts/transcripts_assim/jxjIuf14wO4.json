  "transcript": "Tawinda from India So my question is, in my family women wear almost covered clothing salwar kameez, however they don't wear abaya. I have been making their dresses for years, now through a question I asked on your website, I realized that I'll be sinful same as they're sin if they don't wear abaya. Now I don't want to make their clothes or even wash or iron or buy their dresses because I don't want to be sinful. But as I live with them and I have to do this and also want to do this out of love and to seek reward of Allah Subhanu Wa Ta'ala for being good with them, I'm stuck and many waswasas are coming to my mind, what should I do in this situation? Are you asking about preparing and washing their clothes so that they can pray in it or to go out with it? To go out in it. Okay, so basically speaking, the act of cleaning and washing, drying, pressing clothes is a good thing. Now whether they use this in haram or not, this is not your responsibility because if we try to cascade this, we will fall into great hardship. Your sister asks for a glass of water and you give her a glass of water and then shaitan says if you give her a glass of water that will clear her throat and you know that in half an hour she's going to speak to her boyfriend on the phone or give a song in a karaoke bar late at night and that would help her clear her throat so don't give her water. Nobody says this. So washing their clothes, cleaning their houses, preparing their food is a good deed and this is separate to what they're going to do with these things afterwards so there is nothing wrong in you doing that insha'Allah. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it insha'Allah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
