  "title": "Is intention mandatory in divorce cases anger",
  "transcript": "Khadija from Saudi Khadija Assalamu Alaikum Assalamu Alaikum Umm Sheikh I have read that there are two different opinions of scholars about the usage of metaphor in divorce. So if certain scholars say that circumstantial evidence like anger or dispute or there is a answer to a question then it will be considered valid. Whereas other scholars say that intention is mandatory and others say no intention is not. So which opinion of the scholars is more coinciding with Quran and Sunnah and which is more correct? Issues of divorce Khadija cannot be answered in a phone call or through email. You have to sit with the Mufti alongside with your husband and he has to explain to the Mufti what he had said, what was his intention, what were the circumstances and the Mufti gives his verdict accordingly. So my advice to you is to ask where the nearest Fatwa office is and this is usually found in the Ministry of Islamic Affairs in your city. They have an office appointed by the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia to give Fatwas over such topics. They will listen to your husband and with you in his presence and then say that no this is not a divorce or this is a divorce and it's counted."
