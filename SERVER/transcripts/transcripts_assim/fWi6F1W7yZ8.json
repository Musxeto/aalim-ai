  "transcript": "um I worked job that had har things in it since three years and recently I found out that those things that I was doing were har now I am in the process of leaving that job but I'm I'm a little confused what I can do with this money that I made till now can I use it for health purposes or paying debt Etc what was the job and what was the Haram um I worked as a graphic designer and for example sometimes we had to edit faces of women and I knew that they were going to post them on social media or I made posters for uh TV shows that were Haram okay and you did not know that this was Haram beforehand no I did not know no okay the rule alhamdulillah is that Allah doesn't hold us accountable until we have knowledge so whatever you've earned thinking that your earning is halal and you had no shred of doubt that it was Haram whatever they paid you for that it is totally Halal and legitimate for you to use the moment you got to know that this is Haram then the percentage of Haram in your work from your income after knowing becomes Haram so maybe the amount of Haram posters and designs that are not permissible since you came to know on the 10th of September for example the amount compared to all of the other work is 25 or 30% then you should take 30% of the chunk of your salary from the 10th of September onwards and give it um in in Muslim uh to the poor and and needy Muslims or in charity to cleanse your wealth from such Haram but whatever before that is halal for you inshallah"
