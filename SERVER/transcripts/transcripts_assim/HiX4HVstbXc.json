  "title": "Eating Drinking in bathroom Have cold drink while having bubble bath, read magazine assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "by a brother where he says is it permissible to eat or drink in a bathroom if we say Bismillah before going in suppose if a woman wants to take a bubble bath can she sip on an ice cold drink while taking a bubble bath first of all there is no specific Hadith prohibiting eating or drinking let alone sipping a a nice cold drink in a bubble bath there's no specific Hadith however the scholars say that natural people would feel inclined not to do this it's not natural for people to go and have a good time while answering the call of nature it's not logical that people drink ice cold drinks when having a bubble bath except those who watch movies and are influenced by these Westerner Western ideas of lavish lifestyle and in Islam it's a given that places of answering the call of nature are inhabited by devils and Jinn this is why we say the Dua before entering it and we say if I seek refuge in Allah from male and female Jinn or devils or for whatever is indecent or immoral so you seek Refuge before you enter and when you go out you say rafranak I seek your forgiveness which means that to us Muslims this is not a place where you go and chill sometimes I enter people's toilets and I find a stack of magazines next to the commode what is this he says well I enjoy reading news and and magazines these are sports or car magazines Etc some people their filter their nature is deranged so they enjoy smoking and sometimes drinking black coffee or dark coffee after especially after a meal while sitting on the toilet seat this is disgusting in in Islam it's called it's something that decent people do not do nevertheless I wouldn't dare to say it's Haram but I wouldn't even think of doing it let alone to say halal however if there is a necessity as in the case of someone who is in need to eat but is prosecuted by his boss or by his ruler or some other authority by force not to eat and if they don't eat their sugar level would fall down and they may die and there's no other place for them to eat except in the toilet in this case they may do so by saying Bismillah before entering and when they exit they say Knows Best"
