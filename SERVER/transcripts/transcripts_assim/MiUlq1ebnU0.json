  "title": "How to convince a defiant person who argues about rulings of Islam? Sheikh Assim al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "as for Asaph's question he says that he has a friend and this friend is ignorant no matter how many times he shows him the hadith where the Prophet Allah saw some orders the Muslims to grow the beard and to not allow their pants and trousers and the likes or garments to go below the ankles the man still rejects this and said no no no this is not true is a cultural thing it depends on the environment the society the people the timing the error etc so see how can I convince such a person and my question as if by why even bother with such people there are people who are truth seekers they want to be convinced they want to be taught spend your time with them because there are others who are an illness to know they are a disease they are a waste of time so if someone just for the sake of argument keeps on debating and arguing and saying rubbish why waste your time it's 12 o'clock noon and you tell someone that this is the Sun in the middle of the sky and he says how would I know it's the Sun and not another star proved that to me this is crazy why would I waste my time with such imbeciles my friend if you show someone the Quran or the hadith of the Prophet Isis I mean he rejects it and he uses his logic do not even waste a second with him leave them and never speak to them about this because they are not truth seekers"
