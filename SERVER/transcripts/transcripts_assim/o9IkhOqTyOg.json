  "transcript": "Insaram from Australia Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh and that their rank will be according to the last verse they recite so my question is, out of one who only memorizes the Qur'an without implementing it and one who memorizes and implements it and one who only implements it without memorizing it who will be eligible for this reward? Jazakallahu Khairan Definitely the one who will be eligible for this reward is the one who memorizes it and implements it the one who memorizes it and does not implement it, the Qur'an will curse him and that would not benefit him lots of the hypocrites memorize the Qur'an without implementing it it doesn't help them the Prophet ï·º said, the vast majority of the hypocrites of my ummah are those reciters of the Qur'an those who beautify their voices to gain attention and likes not caring what the Qur'an says and not walking the talk they are among the hypocrites, may Allah protect us all so a person that memorizes the Qur'an and implements it is in the highest level and this is the person who falls under this hadith a person who implements it but does not recite it will be rewarded but will not fall under this category and Allah Azzawajal knows best"
