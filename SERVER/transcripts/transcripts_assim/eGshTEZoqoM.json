  "transcript": "[Music] to my knowledge the head of used to be the head of al-jamal islamiy of india and it was a good movement at the time because it came to counter the british colonization and to restore the spirit of islam to the muslims and it did a wonderful job however the scholars say that there are a number of mistakes upon this tafsir and my way and this is the way of a lot of the scholars is that whenever there are controversial issues about a share or a group or a book to leave it aside and learn from what is not controversial so with all due respect to the shaykh may allah have mercy on him and his good contribution to islam it's not the best tafsir to go through as the scholars say and hence we should not uh study it rather study things that are in alliance to the tafseer of the seraph and to the arpeed of the self and allah knows best you"
