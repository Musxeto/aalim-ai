  "transcript": "Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim Assalamu Alaikum Ya Sheikh, I'm your follower in Instagram I want to ask about the condition today in Indonesia, especially We know that Indonesia has secular education So, men and women are educated for looking for job, pursue their career And, I mean, a psychologist, we know her, Bunda Eli Risman, has awards because of her service to parenting in Indonesia She told us that women or a wife or a mother should be at home until minimum children reach 5 years old Because that's the youngest age for children to go to school And then, how about we as women or Muslimah in Indonesia especially They have parents who want them to go to office or go to pursue their career But maybe they have a husband, not allowed for these women go to the office They want this, I mean, the amount is increasing, the amount of Muslimah with the type like this are increasing But the parents are, most of the parents in Indonesia, I mean, they are grannies now They have grandchildren, they want their daughter to go to the office and earn some money Not only their husband, but, I mean, they want their daughter to earn some money We know it as a sandwich generation who earn money for their parents and for their own family, I mean, their children Now, we know that the amount of divorced couple is increasing too in Indonesia And it changed the structure of family So, the women have to go to work But this woman, I mean, almost all of these Muslimah is also a mother Which Allah said that, I mean, we look at this type of women, single mother and etc Their basic role, their basic obligation as Muslimah is to parents You know what I mean? I understand Thank you, Assalamualaikum Waalaikumsalam Now, the sister says, I have an obligation to my parents, correct? Correct My parents want me to work to earn money and to give to them This is not fair I, as a father, I raise my children not to give me money I give them money until I die This is my job I take the reward from Allah Azza wa Jal To ask my children to work and give me money so that I can become relaxed and have a car and have a house This is not right You, as a Muslimah, must do what Allah tells you in the Qur'an and in the Sunnah What does Allah tell you in the Qur'an and in the Sunnah? You have a husband, you have to obey your husband You have to be good to your husband You have to be kind to your husband and children They will take you to Jannah Your husband says, don't work, sit home Your father says, work Who should I obey? The husband Now, the father is no more Mother is no more We respect her, we love them, we obey them But your duty is only to obey your husband He is the one who has the key for Jannah Without the key, there is no Jannah The Prophet saw a woman And she was with a man He said, who is this man? She said, my husband He said, how are you with him? She said, I try my level best to obey him and to make him happy The Prophet said, be careful He is your Jannah or your Jahannam Depending on how you deal with him So, this has to be done Now, the problem is not here The problem is your husband wants you to work What can you do? It depends Indonesia is a growing country And it's sometimes not enough for one man to work Sometimes So, there has to be a collaboration, a cooperation If you can find a good, suitable, halal job That you wear your hijab without a problem And the job itself is halal And there is no free mixing I don't sit 8 hours with my colleague Go get lunch What is this? Oh, he is my colleague, he is my friend I sit with him 8 hours And you text him in the morning, in the evening How are you? This is haram, this is not from Islam If you find a good job And you can abide by Sharia Go ahead, it is halal inshallah I hope this answers your question"
