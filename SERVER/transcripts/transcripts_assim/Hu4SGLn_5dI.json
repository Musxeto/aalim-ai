  "transcript": "Humira says can one eat the meat of a goat or a cow that one has slaughtered as a sadhaka or should that meat be given to the poor only so sadaqa in English means charity other than zakat the zakat is a pillar of Islam which is a fixed percentage that one gives generally speaking annually over the savings he has or the merchandise that he trades in or over the life stocks or over some specific crops this is a cat but we have sadaqa sadaqa is general so we can give charity to Muslims and non-muslims alike it's considered charity any type of good work is charity if I give a stray dog some water to drink this is charity this is sadaqa so Humaira says if I were to slaughter a cow or a sheep or a goat can I eat from it or must I give it to the poor first of all if it is an expiation if you're slaughtering a sheep as a form of expiation you did the sin that requires that you slaughter a sheep you cannot eat anything of it if it is a general charity such as vows for example though vows are not recommended in Islam a person has a child that is sick and he's so afraid he asks Allah for cure but then Shaitaan overtakes him takes over him and says listen why don't you offer something to Allah as a result so that he would cure your child Allah doesn't need your offering but Shaitaan comes so it would be like a sort of trade a sort of a bribe or Allah if you save my child I'll slaughter a sheep so this is an oath that you make it's not recommended but once you commit yourself to it you must fulfill it if I slaughter the Sheep I may not take anything of it because this was devoted entirely for a lot there was an but if my son if I had one passes the finals in his college and I'm so happy and I say I will slaughter a sheep because I'm happy for my son now my intention is to slaughter if my intention was to slaughter this sheep and call the family and friends to feast and eat from it then I can eat from it no problem if my intention was to give it as a form and a token of gratitude to allah azza wajal thanking him then i may not eat anything if my intention is mixed so sometimes I say yes the sheep I slaughtered to give to and distribute to the poor while eating myself from it in this case you can take a portion according to what you intended but generally speaking if it's an expiation if it's an oath if it is generally given for charity and you did not make an exception you may not touch it and you may not eat from it"
