  "transcript": "what exactly does it mean to be content with the decree of Allah okay like during summertime go ahead yes yeah during summertime I would usually get like really hot and uncomfortable and you know like I don't feel okay and stuff and I don't really like it and sometimes I don't know my head just starts hurting and I get angry and I don't really I'm not sure if this is being like this content all thee what content with the decree of Allah is an inner feeling that you know you had nothing to do with it and this is Allah's test upon you a person gets into a car crash loses the ability to walk he's paralyzed this is a catastrophe this is a hardship that rarely you would find people being able to tolerate and the trauma is huge a True Believer is saddened he may cry and weep he may feel a bit depressed but he's content and he doesn't say anything that angers Allah when the prophet Alam lost his his long awaited child his own awaited son some say he died of the age of two years and the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam was approximately in his 60s and he had no male offspring living and we all know that you need an heir to carry your name and to carry your legacy so he was looking forward to this boy and all of a sudden he died this was a great loss in any man's life whether a boy or a girl but in the case of the Prophet Alam he already lost two boys so that was a Calamity what did the prophet doam he said the heart is saddened and the eyes are tearing and we say nothing that displeases Allah Asel and by Allah upon departing and leaving you ibraim we are sad that's it compare this to the discontent another person would do by banging their heads in the wall by tearing their clothes by crying and shouting why me why not them what did I do to you I did all what you wanted to be to do I prayed five times a day I did you always do this to me you the guy lost it he flun his test so when it's hot you have nothing to do in being in such an environment or weather turn on the air conditioning it's not working Sheik this is your test from Allah are you frustrated yes no problem what counts is what actions you're going to take and the things that are coming from your mouth if you keep on binding with excuse my French and saying every time someone asks you how are things oh it's hot it's like hell I don't know why we're living like this nobody's doing anything about it I can't even breathe I'm sweating like a pig I'm what are you doing this is not definitely the right thing to do being content is saying oh it's hot alhamdulillah I can't complain this is something Allah is testing me with so I hope this answers your question"
