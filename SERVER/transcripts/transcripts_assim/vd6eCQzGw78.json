  "title": "Can I run a Home Cleaning Business where men and women may be ALONE together? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "I have Abdul Kareem from the U.S. on the line. Abdul Kareem. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Kareem. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi. Is it permissible to run that kind of business? Basically, we have to be optimistic and positive. We cannot keep on putting hurdles and obstacles in our path, otherwise we would never ever progress. We have to improvise. If I were to say, is it permissible for me to drink my green tea, knowing that probably maybe there's a snake inside or some venom or something harmful. If I think like this, I'm not going to eat anything or drink anything or even behave or act or do anything. Your job to clean homes is totally halal. Now, if there is the possibility of being in seclusion, simply reject the job or indicate beforehand that up front that, listen, I'm a guy. So this may limit your possibilities of getting a job, but alhamdulillah, whatever jobs you get, inshallah, it would be halal."
