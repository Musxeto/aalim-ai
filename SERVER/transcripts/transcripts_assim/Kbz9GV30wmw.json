  "title": "Should I pray in the second congregation or continue on my own if I'm late? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "what says it happens sometimes when we go to Masjid and the official Gemara the congregation is already finished then we start our own individual prayer and we are in the second raka of salat suddenly a group of people come and form another Jumeirah now for me I'm praying my fault prayer alone should I continue with my prayer or should I discontinue and join the Gemara first of all you should not be late for the main congregation because all the great and big rewards lie in it secondly if you are as you've stated in the second raka and another congregation has just begun next to you I recommend that you conclude Taraka salat meaning change your intention from thought to voluntary two rakahs and offer Salam finishing finishing it then you go and join the congregation so that you would attain the reward of your fault salat with the congregation"
