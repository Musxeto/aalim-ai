  "transcript": "Aliza from Belgium Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah I wanted to know if I want to do an instant transfer of money, the bank will charge me 60 cents but they only take this amount at the end of the month and so I wanted to know if this kind of fee is haram or not? This kind of fee is known as transfer fee and this is what they charge for their labor. This is not lending you any money, they are charging you this amount in order to transfer the money from your bank account to another account somewhere else. So they charge this, they are not a charity organization, so this is not riba. Riba is when they lend you money and they charge you more. This is like hiring a porter to transport or to carry your luggage from one place to the other and there is nothing wrong in that inshallah."
