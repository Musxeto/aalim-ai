  "title": "Do we get a House in Jannah for praying 12 Rakat Sunnah everyday or just once?",
  "transcript": "Imran says we know the Hadith about the reward of paying the 12 Ras Sunnah throughout the day which is building you a house in Jenna do we get a house in Jenna if we prayed it once or must we pray it every day to be eligible for this reward it's an issue of dispute among Scholars some Scholars say that this reward is for every day and Allah's generosity has no limits others say that this Hadith refers to who's ever been observing these 12 rakas throughout his life and the middle path would be that it is that is the house made for those who observe these 12 rakas generally speaking because people tend to sometimes overs sleep or forget or travel and not pray them so such random and once in a blue moon excuses does not take a person with the grace of Allah from uh uh those to be qualified to get uh this reward and Allah asael Knows Best"
