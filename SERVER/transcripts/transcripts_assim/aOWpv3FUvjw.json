  "transcript": "Brother Imad from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu So Sheikh, when I try to explain to my friends that the last time for Isha is the Islamic midnight, they argue that they didn't have clocks or forms of time measuring at the time of the Prophet ﷺ. And they argue that the Prophet ﷺ couldn't know exactly when the Islamic midnight was. So they say as long as you pray before Fajr, it's okay. What advice could you give to them? And is the Islamic midnight like the last time? Jazakallah. First of all, we have to ask them, are you speaking with knowledge or out of sheer ignorance? Number two, if it is through knowledge, do you know that the hadith was reported in Sahih Imam Muslim when the Prophet ﷺ told us that the last time for praying Isha is at the middle of the night? Yes or no? If they confirm and say yes, but he said, wait, wait, don't say but. Don't use your analogy because this is how Shaitan booked his first class seat in hellfire when he used his analogy by saying, it doesn't make any sense. Why am I supposed to prostrate to Adam when he was created from clay and I was created from fire? I'm better than him. So be careful. Question number three, do we, you and I, know today when is the exact middle of the night? The answer is yes, we have watches. In this case, what will we say on the day of judgment when we face Allah Azzawajal telling us that, haven't you heard about the hadith in Sahih Imam Muslim where the Prophet said that the end of time of Isha ﷺ is at midnight? And haven't I provided you with the means to find when midnight is? What would your answer be? Yes, but do you think your but would sell on the day of judgment? Will be accepted? But, oh Allah, at the time of the Prophet, they didn't have watches. It's none of your business. Allah Azzawajal told them that the last time of Isha is midnight. They estimate. Allah Azzawajal told them that the last third of the night is where your dua is accepted and this is the divine time or the descent of Allah Azzawajal to the lower heavens. This is for them to calculate, not for you. You have the means to calculate it now. So how are you going to reject the instruction of the Prophet ﷺ This is crazy. You're a Muslim. You should apply the means you have. We have the hadith. We know that is the top in authenticity and we have the means to find the middle of the night. After that, you should do whatever you want. It's your problem. You're the one who's going to be held accountable on the day of judgment."
