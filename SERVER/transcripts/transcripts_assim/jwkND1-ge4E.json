  "title": "Is it better to buy Kosher meat?  (animals are stunned prior to being slaughtered)",
  "transcript": "jasmine is asking about halal meat her issue is that most animals are stunned prior to being slaughtered and she knows that if the slaughtering takes place while the stunned animal is alive this is halal but it is difficult to determine while buying this from the meat shops however one can be assured when buying kosher meat that is definitely not stunned and thus there is no doubt in it therefore in such cases is it better to buy the kosher meat first of all kosher meat is the meat or the food that has been approved by the jews by their rabbis and they say that this is kosher meaning that this is legit this is permitted and they are like the muslims would not eat anything except that is slaughtered so dead meat the jews and the muslims do not eat it and consider it to be negative and impure now what jasmine is asking about is not false proof in the sense that kosher meat though it is islamically halal to eat yet they involve in some of their kosher meals kosher food wine because they it is permitted for in their religion to use wine in cooking and this is totally prohibited for muslims however if you know that it is wine free 100 it is permissible to eat no one says it's not permissible but my issue is with doubt once you open a window for doubt you get this doubt to undermine all that is certain and uh perfectly fine so now i can apply this in every single thing i go to a muslim country i go to a a meat shop i buy a kilo of a kilogram of meat and then doubts come to my mind maybe the butcher does not pray maybe the butcher worships al-jilani or tijani or he's a super sufi worships peers and and and pray for them i cannot eat from that so um i will avoid it and this cascades down to include everything around you maybe this tea that i want to drink is made of water that is nudges maybe i don't know so how would i drink it if you open this pandora box you'll destroy your life maybe i divorced my wife without realizing it i'm doubtful this is how ocd creeps into your life and destroys it the norm the default is that they stun the animal and they slaughter it immediately before it dies khalas this is what i believe i can eat from that there's no need to say that maybe maybe those who are doing the kosher meet uh um forgot to mention the name of allah maybe they mentioned the name of their prophets or messengers or uzair for example who they used to worship how would i know if i open the door for probabilities and for big if if maybe then this would definitely lead you to a place that is not good for you to be in"
