  "transcript": "brother tamjit from Bangladesh so my question is basically is it shirk if someone says that something is dependent on something other than Allah for example if someone says my results depends on my hard work or my income depends on my job for example is it sure okay so the brother is asking is it shirk to say that something depends on another other than Allah that I said is no as long as Allah had made this thing means to depend upon then there is no Sheikh I depend on food to remain alive I depend on air to remain alive without air I will die is there any shirk of course not Allah has made these things to sustain my life I depend on you tomorrow to take me to the airport at six o'clock AM my driver is asleep so by depending on someone to drive me is this shirk the answer is no but if I depend on other than Allah in what no one can do other than Allah so I depend on the doctor to cure me the doctor can't cure me the Cure is in Allah's hands the doctor is means of it if I believe that only the doctor can cure me which I don't believe a Muslim does in this case yes we have a problem but most people when they say I depend on you to help me carry this big box I can't carry it on my own this is not thinking that this person is assisting you without the approval or the will of Allah because everything happens with the will of Allah and there is no intent of Allah Knows Best"
