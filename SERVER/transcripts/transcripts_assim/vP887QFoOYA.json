  "transcript": "the other type of hunting this the tool so this tool is i'm done who's using it the other type is using animals and birds of prey to kill game with their teeth or claws allah says in the quran say lawful for you are all good foods and game caught by what you have trained of hunting animals which you train as allah has taught you so eat of what they catch for you and mention the name of allah upon it and fear allah so this is crystal clear the animal has to be trained you have to have an animal that is trained animals and birds of prey used for hunting must be trained how to take away a game and do not chase anything else and they would stop when they are told to stop so this is their training you have the bird you have the hand and they see the prey they do not move until you say go this is how the training is then only they move to hunt and when they attack the prey the game you say to them stop they stop and an important condition is that they do not catch for themselves so if the falcon starts eating what he has hunted then this is haram because he's catching it for himself not for his owner or for its owner it has to do the kill and wait until the owner comes and feeds it or gives it from it or from anything else but not to eat from it for itself the prophet said if you send your dog and mention allah's name and he catches and kills the game you may eat if the dog eats of it do not eat because he only kills for himself and of course we mentioned before that the name of allah must be mentioned and if a person forgets then it's an issue of dispute but the most authentic opinion is that it is still valid allah says you may eat of what they catch for you but mention allah's name over it and have fear of allah what happens if a person sends his dog or shoots a bird or an animal and he reaches the animal while it's still alive some people think that okay we'll just wait until it dies totally then take it and this is wrong if you were to find the animal still alive or the bird you must immediately slaughter it because if it dies without you slaughtering it would become dead meat when is hunting halal for you to eat it when you shoot a bird or an animal or when you send your animal uh uh or predator to catch and hunt for you and it kills the prey this is hala if i shoot an animal and i reach it and it's dead this is halal as long as i said bismillah but if i reach it while it's still alive it is a must for me that i have to slaughter it in order to be halal and allah azzawajal knows best"
