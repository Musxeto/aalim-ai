  "title": "Is it sunnah to wipe face after making dua? Is raising hands while making dua sunnah Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "i want to know that when we make the normal drop arising our hand or after like when it is raining or we are traveling in this case when we raise our hand for dua what should we do after finishing our dua do we wipe our face or simply just put our hand down now the issue of raising your hands when it's raining or when traveling or between adan and nikama or in the last third of the night this is a highly recommended sunnah because it is one of the means that would attract more allah azzawajals answering to your dua so it's one of the reasons that allah answers dua what to do afterwards there are a hadith but they are not authentic they are all weak that you wipe your face with your hands and the school i follow states that allah the almighty has protected the quran and preserved the sunnah so the deen is complete and preserved and therefore we do not need the weak hadith to be used in our religion because everything that is part of islam and our religion has been preserved in the authentic fashion and form and therefore any hadith that is not graded as sahih or hasan is not accepted and we do not act upon it and therefore wiping the face is not part of the sunnah there are scholars who considered it to be an innovation and they used to say that only the ignorant people who don't have knowledge do this but due to the fact that there are weak hadiths if i see someone wiping his face i would not say fear allah don't do this i would leave him alone would i ever do it or recommend anyone to do it definitely not i will"
