  "transcript": "it says from saudi arabia he wanted to marry a second wife without telling his first wife his first wife came to know now she's asking for divorce how can he convince her not to get a divorce and to come back and to believe him when he says that he will not do that again or attempt to do it again this is with all due respect i'm like your father huh if you can't stand the heat get out of the kitchen you should not have attempted this from the first place if you are not a man enough to get married to a second woman don't even dream about it because your first will come in your dreams and gives you and give you help this is a well-known fact they have the power to get into your dreams unfortunately and ask me i've tried i've been there i've done that no i'm just kidding so what is the issue i get a lot of men in your shoes complaining what to do if you did not weigh the pros and cons you should not have attempted it in the very beginning a man who wants to marry a second wife whether in public or in secret he has to be man enough to evaluate the situation if his first wife were to know so if your first wife would uh where if she was to know about your marriage what are the consequences what are the things that may happen one she may accept it and stay home quiet which is 50 50. most women are sensible yeah they will they will be a little bit depressed but they'll accept it as long as he's providing a house and he's paying the bills and he's half of the time there he's showing compassion to his children and to her so she's just losing him a day every alternate day i to me that's a good deal see that she doesn't have to cook on that day she doesn't have to wear new clothes or take care of herself she could do her hobbies and whatever she wants fifty percent of women are sensible there are the other fifty percent that would you know blow a fuse and they would go haywire now if you know that this is an alternative and a choice you should weigh the uh the pros and cons meaning if you are in real need to get married to a second wife and this is well known for reasons this is not the time to disclose in this case you should bear in mind that if she wants a divorce that you're ready to give it to her because it's her fault that you're looking for a second wife maybe she's not fulfilling your desires 95 this is the case maybe she's not taking care of you maybe she's always with her parents and with her family maybe she is nagging maybe she is impolite disrespectful never grateful or showing her gratitude to whatever you do yeah such a woman you have to get another wife and if you get another wife and she demands divorce so what what has to be done has to be done but if you know that no she's a good woman and i can't live with her i can't live without the children and i can live with a single wife i can't get rid of the idea so don't even attempt getting married to a second wife so in at the end this is your call how to deal with her how to speak with her how to let i wouldn't say humiliate yourself by going down on your knees and begging for forgiveness and giving promises not to do that again this is at the end of the day it's your call but you have to weigh the pros and cons ishad from"
