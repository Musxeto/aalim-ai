  "transcript": "My brother, he says, is it permissible to recite dhikr or du'a or the Qur'an while chewing gum or exposing the awrah or while eating or drinking? As for dhikr, we're instructed to make dhikr while standing up, sitting down, lying on our sides, on all cases. And as Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said in a hadith that the Prophet ï·º used to remember and mention Allah Azza Wa Jal on all situations, in all cases, unless he was in the state of, that is, major ritual impurity that prevents him from reciting the Qur'an. But remembering Allah Azza Wa Jal, he would do that all the time. So for dhikr or du'a, you can do that while chewing gum or your awrah is exposed, there's no problem, providing that you're not in the state of answering the call of nature. Even if you are in the state of major ritual impurity, you can still make du'a, you can still make dhikr. Of course, it's not the appropriate or the best scenario. It's definitely best to make du'a when you're facing the qiblah, properly dressed, in the state of wudhu, raising your hands, this is the best. But is it permissible to do it otherwise? The answer is yes. As for the Qur'an, as mentioned earlier in the hadith, the Prophet used to recite the Qur'an in all cases, unless he was in the state of major ritual impurity. He used to recite it while lying down, even his head in Mother Aisha's lap when she was in her menses, and he used to still recite the Qur'an without any problem, insha'Allah."
