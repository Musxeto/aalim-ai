  "title": "Should I pray in masjid where they reject black magic or in a masjid they do shirk? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "in my locality there is two Muslim groups uh the first Muslim group uh uh rejects sah sah like uh denying the existence of black magic and they even reinterpret quranic versus to fit their logic the other group goes to D and may even commit shik so if I hear the call to the prayer from these mosque mosque can I attend or can I uh pray also there is no first of all first of all listen listen uh uh mids that believe in daras and the Imam see what counts is not the community or the locality what counts is the Imam if the Imam believes in dargas and going to peers and to grave Graves and and worshiping the graves and the likes and doing shik you cannot attend the prayer there behind such an Imam and your prayer is invalid as for those who reject black magic which is in the Quran mentioned in the such people have gone out of the fold of Islam because magic is mentioned in Surah Al bakar chapter 2 in verse 102 and Allah said that they learn from from harut and marut what they divide and separate between a man and his wife and they say we teach kufur so don't come and learn from us this is and they come and have the audacity to reject it this is totally unacceptable so my advice is don't pray behind such people and if you don't have any Muslim um Masjid that you can pray go to the Masjid the second the L one after the prayer is over and look for one or two people to pray with you jam and your jam is valid inshallah"
