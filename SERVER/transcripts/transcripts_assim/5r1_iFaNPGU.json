  "transcript": "selma says is doing household shores only the responsibility of the daughters and not the sons my mother never makes my brothers do the dishes or asks them to clean their room etc while she's always after me to help her around the house and even tidy up after my father and brothers how is this fair first of all when it comes to issues of equality we have problems women think that there should be equality and this is one of the fruits of feminism and the funny thing is they most of the time are selective so they want equality at the work at the pay at some rights etc but when it comes to hard work no men should do this physical work men should do this when it comes to entering a a room or a place from a door men should step back and say please ladies first they should be courteous they should open the door for women why is that when it comes to women standing in a row well as arabs and and men of honor we usually say okay let the woman go first instead of standing in the row in the queue among men but when things are like this there's no real equality and to be frank there is no equality in islam in the sense that feminists are looking for because allah stated that clearly in chapter three a male is not like a female they have different orientations physical abilities characteristics they're not equal there is no equality in islam but there is fairness and this is what i always repeat and say nowhere in islam we're expected that okay in order to be equal my wife next year i'll i'll become pregnant so that we are equal nowhere in islam where i should as a husband do this or do that and not my wife because she has a role to take care of i have a role and responsibilities to take care of i would never ask my wife to go and work and earn even if she's more qualified than i am because this is not her job now coming back to the parents yes there is a big error in dealing with boys and girls in the house when the boys feel superior and they feel that they have the right to control their sisters even if they are older than them young brothers think that i don't have to obey my elder sister she has to obey me just because i'm a man no this is not true the parents make a big mistake when they overlook the shortcomings of their own sons they should discipline the boys the boys should make their own beds they should put their own laundry in the basket they should tidy their own rooms now this is the norm what happens if the norm is not followed here this is the responsibility of the mother it's the mother's responsibility to tidy her son's room to take care of their laundry to take care of their beds etc if she is overwhelmed or she needs the assistance of her daughter she should make it clear that the daughter is helping the mother and not serving the boys her brothers why because then she would feel better that i'm not serving my brothers who are not doing anything rather i'm serving my mom and this is one of the tasks that would get me closer to allah and would admit me to paradise so now okay we're doing something positive and good in sha allah now having said that a girl has to be diplomatic as a girl you need your brothers and you need them in the future they are your rock they are the one who defend you and would help you generally speaking so there's no point in having fights and clashes with them because you will need them one day they may not need you they may get married and leave but you will always need them because you need a guardian in your life you need someone to support you they are your own blood and flesh so try not to think of it as being fair or unfair rather think of it as being dutiful to your mother and your father and being diplomatic with your own siblings you"
