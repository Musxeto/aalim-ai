  "transcript": "instagram from australia he says whenever we talk to some people who consider themselves to be liberals and in islam we don't have liberals we have muslims and non-muslims so when someone comes and says yeah i'm a muslim but i'm a liberal muslim what is a liberal muslim if you're liberal i'm conservative what do you mean by liberal it means that i have no problem with lgbt i have no problem with homosexuality i have no problem if people change their religions and flip from islam to hinduism or to christianity i have no problem with people having a uh things that go against islam but it doesn't impact me this is between the element and allah so if someone opens a brothel no problem people have to have fun if someone opens a bar sells intoxicants no problem it's a free country this is not liberalism this is kufur disbelief because they're accepting other than allah's sharia and islam is all about convictions so those who say whenever you talk to them about lgbt for example that this is condemned by jews christians and muslims so all these religions consider that to be sinful and it's a major sin and they say yeah this is between them and allah maybe but also child molesting is between them and allah also rape is between them and allah stealing people's homes without them knowing and not being caught is between me and allah that does not justify it that does not legitimize this it so we as muslims have quran and sunnah that governs everything we do it they govern our convictions and beliefs and as a muslim you do not have the right to condole or to endorse what such sinful people do by saying this is between them and allah yes it's true nobody told you to go and beat them up but we tell you not to endorse it not to be fine with it they want to be uh lgbt on their own time and on their own uh place that's their problem you don't force me to go and socialize with them and normalize ties with them and think that what they're doing is they're right and i have no objections so i have to endorse it invite them over to to to dine in my home and maybe take my kids for the afternoon no you don't have the right to do that i don't tell you to do anything harmful to them this is their life but we should call us pay this paid and allah knows best"
