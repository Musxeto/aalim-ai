  "transcript": "ahmed from bangladesh says that the national anthem national anthem generally speaking has music it is played usually when they're raising the flag or saluting the flag or in national events and the national anthem without any doubt has no relation to islam meaning that did the prophet have a national anthem or the companions the answer is definitely not now having music in it is haram without a doubt as well the ayahs of the quran and the authentic hadiths in the sunnah and the consensus of the four schools of thought so all school uh schools of thought their consensus is that it's haram the school of abu hanifa malik shafi and hamburg which means it's haram full stop we don't have to elaborate anything more but they do this there and they do this the here we are muslims we follow quran and sunnah end of story now if brother ahmed is claiming that there is a national anthem that has no shirk that has no music that is filled with tawheed and praising the country we live in the i see no problem none whatsoever in doing it this is a nasheed and it's a nasheed with a good meaning and a sheed that connects me to my country and no one in islam says hate your country especially if your country is calling for tahit and calling for islam definitely you have to and you must love your country and this is not nationalism nationalism is to love your country whether it's against islam or not so it doesn't matter with it whether it is with islam or idol or against islam you love it despite of all of that and this is wrong such nationalism is wrong we don't love the country because it's soil we don't love the flag because it's a piece of cloth we love what the country calls for so if my country calls for tahit it calls for righteousness it calls for establishment of salat and da'wah to allah azzawajal and purifying the aqidah and memorizing the quran and spreading the word of allah this is a country to be loved and to be defended but if your country is against islam and hates muslims and puts them in jail and fights islam and the muslims definitely this is not a country to live let alone to love you"
