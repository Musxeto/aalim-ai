  "title": "Are Islamic Artifacts in Turkey ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡· (Prophet's Relics, Staff of Musa..) real or fake? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "So where I'm from uh Turkey, we have a palace, historical palace from the Ottoman Empire. And in the palace uh they display religious relics uh that uh belong to the prophet Muhammad and other prophets. So among these relics there are uh supposedly the staff of Moses and the arm of uh prophet Yaha. So do you know any uh information regarding the authenticity of these religious relics? All of these relics or artifacts are not authentic. And I've been to that museum and it's a it's it's a nice place to go to. You see a lot of nice artifacts and it's a tourist attraction. I don't know if it's top copy or something like that. Uh whether it's in takim or I don't know. It's it's been ages but it's fun. It's nice but everything there is bogus. They say we have the sword of the prophetam. We have the helmet. We have the cloak of the prophetam and all of this is not true. Now to have the staff of Moses I don't know why they missed the ark of peace be upon him as well. That would have been y mighty fine. Maybe they could not find any anything else but that big. All of this is not authentic. All of these things they were fabricated. It's only for people to draw money from the ignorance or the poor and and and innocent people. It's like when they come to for example Jedha and they say this huge bicycle which is I think the the largest bicycle in the world and they tell the pilgrims that this is the bicycle of Adam when Adam descended and he was looking for Eve. So he had this bicycle and this is where it landed. Come on, give me a break. And some of the pilgrims, oh I'd like to take a selfie. Maybe take some baraka. Oh, let me take some cloth and wipe over it and take it back home. And then I wash it and I drink it and I pray to it. All of this is shik and shaitan is having a blast. May Allah protect us."
