  "title": "He wants to make Hijra but his home country is filled with innovators & corruption, what to do",
  "transcript": "alhane from canada he says i'm planning to go back to my home country and that would be probably in a couple of years or maybe a little bit less or more unfortunately my hometown does not have a salafi masjid or at least because they're all sufis and they're all people of innovation and i don't want to lose the reward i don't want my children to grow up seeing these innovations growing on shirk and worshipping graves and blindly following um their imams and peers and etc and also he fears for his own safety for being a practicing muslim that he may be accused falsely of being a terrorist or the likes especially that some countries have this intention to intimidate anyone who does not follow the sufis and the mystic ways of diluting islam and making it anything goes and at the same time there is the fear of rape kidnapping of women they're not safe so what to be done you should do whatever is best for you and for your family maybe going to your hometown is not a safe place but you can go to another town or city that is safe and the vast majority are practicing or through islam or in a neighborhood where it's safe and they're all following the sunnah and you will find a masjid it is at all unacceptable to claim that a big muslim country does not have a salafi masjid or a message of hallucinogen or a place to be safe in this is totally unacceptable when we want to put obstacles we will never progress and this happens a lot in our lives so you talk to someone why don't you get married ah if i get married i have to work like 10 years to collect the mahar the dowry and then we have to throw a lavish wedding party and then there will be problems between the in-laws they don't like my parents our parents don't like them and there are problems and then we after the marriage takes place we get children and the children may grow up in an islamic country and may they that the child my boy can be a drug addict my girl can go into prostitution what is this even in bollywood don't do this anymore so when you want to put obstacles you will never leave your doorsteps you never leave your home because if you do maybe a car would crash into maybe a plane would fall maybe one of the roaming satellites malfunctions and falls on your head and crushes you to death maybe you won't die maybe you'll get a spinal injury that would make you a parallel neck down all of this is nonsense where is your trust in allah where is your where is your trust and confidence in allah choosing the best for you and taking care of you so living in the west is okay you think if they can easily take your children away from you because your neighbors complained that they heard your child crying and they're accusing you of abusing your child if you go to the park and place your one-year-old child on your lap they say ah child molester he's my son said yeah yeah but this is inappropriate that what is this so yeah any with all due respect you have to improvise come up with solutions that are suitable for you and for your children and for your family go to a different hometown a city or a town or a region migrate to any muslim country that you feel is suitable for you not necessarily your own country go to a country that you can start a business that you can start a school you can do so many things but if you keep on putting obstacles and handling yourself from progressing you would never go anywhere"
