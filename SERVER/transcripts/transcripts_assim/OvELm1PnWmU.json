  "transcript": "hello perd√≥name o soul allah wa sallim wa barik ala aalihi wa suleman ameen nabina muhammad in water adding he was happy at main Imbaba assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh we're still studying the chapter that deals with prayer from this blessed book on the - aleykum and we move on to hadith 106 which deals with what is known in Islam as Sutra and Sutra means a scream advisor something that a worshipper prays to so that he would indicate to the people that he's praying so that they would not pass in front of him it is permissible for them to pass from behind the screen so we would like to learn the hadith that deal with this what is the ruling on praying to a Sutra and what are the etiquettes to take such a thing we have a number of hadith that deal with this the first hadith is hadith number 106 this hadith was narrated by abu jahal even know some and I'm sorry may Allah be pleased with him he said that the prophet of allah salallahu alaihe wasalam said if the person who passes in front of another person in prayer knew the magnitude of his sin he would had preferred to wait for 40 rather than to pass in front of him a bonobo one of the narrator's of the hadith said I do not know whether he said forty days months or years from this hadith we know that it is sinful to pass between the man's standing point and his prostration position it is forbidden to pass through that and it becomes even more forbidden if he was praying to a Sutra if he was praying to vizor in this hadith the Prophet did not indicate or say that one has to take a Sutra but he's saying that it is a great sin to pass in front of a worshipper and scholars did actually give us the space that you're not allowed to pass through because imagine if I'm praying in my position and four or five meters ahead of me it is almost impossible to tell people not to pass through otherwise no one would move in the Masjid however a worshipper is one of two either he's praying to a sutra or a screen an object which rises above the ground signifying that he is praying to it and this is his borders or he is a worshipper who's praying in the open as a lot of the Muslims do they pray in the middle of the Masjid nothing in front of them for 20 or 30 or maybe hundred meters if he's not praying to a Sutra if he's praying in the open scholars say that you are allowed to walk in front of him only beyond the area where he puts his head on when he prostrates so the area the space between his feet when he's standing and where he puts his head when he prostrates this area is sacred you cannot pass through it and as we stated what is a sutra a sutra is an object that a person prays to so that this would be his own space that no one is allowed to pass through and the sutra can be something it can be someone it can be an animal as well and the Prophet array Salah sternum whenever he used to pray he used to pray to what is similar to the saddle that is put on a camel and scholars say that it is this high it's about a foot or so high and a person can pray to another person sitting in front of him so if I am in the Masjid it's an open area and there's that worshipper sitting or praying and I pray so that the distance between me and him is sufficient for me to prostrate he would be considered as my sutra as my screen and I can pray even to an animal the prophets of Salaam sometimes prayed to his camel so praying to an animal providing that the animal is not going to move so this is permissible why is it not permissible to walk in front of a person who is worshiping allah azza wajal who is praying scholars say that prayer is a sacred state and when you pray you are in the state of calling allah azzawajal and invoking him supplicating to him so it's a sacred state that should be respected and that is why scholars say that in Islam it is prohibited to destroy synagogues or churches or places of worship the Prophet is awesome when he used to send his troops he used to advise them and instruct them not to destroy places of worship and so did Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with them and all the caliphs after that why because people are entitled to worship whom they ever want and as Muslims we're told that we are not allowed to demolish to attack to harm any synagogue for the Jews or churches for the Christians because they are places of worship for them and it should be respected and in the hadith the Prophet is telling us that had this person walking in front of a worshiper had he known he would have waited for forty before passing in front of him in the hadith of Rock'em it says that had he known the magnitude of his sin but in the Buhari and Muslim this word is not there it's only had he known he would have stopped for forty there is no mentioning of the magnitude of sin though it is found in other books but as we've stated before that all the hadith in this book is from Buhari and Muslim and this phrase is not found in Al Bukhari and Muslim so it's a mistake from the compiler who inserted it in his book the Prophet says Allah salatu salam had he known he would have stopped or he would have waited for forty I would not go says one of the narrators I do not know whether he meant forty days or 40 months or forty years and even if it was forty hours it shows you that the magnitude of the sin is so great that waiting until he finishes his prayer which would probably take not more than two or three minutes that would have been better for you so that you would not get any of the sins and scholars say is forty intended as a number or not some say yes it is others say no such numbers in the Arabic language when mentioned in the Quran it means that a great number but not that 40 is intended for itself for example Allah says about the hypocrites seek forgiveness for them or don't seek forgiveness for them if you seek forgiveness for them seventy times Allah would not forgive them so some scholars say 70 times is not intended it means that no matter how many times you seek forgiveness for them Allah will not forgive them and that is why the Prophet said that is salatu salam if I knew that Allah would forgive them if I sort forgiveness for them 71 times I would have done that but the Prophet understood that 70 times here is not meant for 77 0 it means that a lot of numbers and likewise when we hear the hadith of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam when he tells us that on the day of judgement hell would be brought in front of the people with seventy thousand straps that people pull it from and with every strap or leash there are seventy thousand angels pulling it so scholars say that the number is not intended for itself the 70 thousand but it means that there are so many that they are beyond count and likewise in this hadith one if he knew the magnitude of sin it would have been better for him not to cross even if he had to wait 40 days 40 months 40 years Allah Adam of how many he would have to wait however is it permissible for a person to pass in front of worshiper if there is no way out scholars say yes if the worshiper is praying for example in front of a door and this is the only door for the Masjid and there is no way I can go out scholars say it is his mistake for praying in front of the door and it becomes permissible for people to pass by but if there is another way around you can go from behind him it is not permissible we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back assalamu alaikum and welcome back the following hadith deals also with the issue of sutra or the screen the hadith was narrated by abu sa'id the hoodie may Allah be pleased with him he says that I heard the prophet salallahu alaihe wa salem say if anyone of you praise to something that is a screen between him and the people and wanted to pass in front of him he should prevent him if he insists and persists he should turn him away forcibly for he is a devil he is a shape on the origin of this hadith is that abou serrated Hood River Allah be pleased with him was praying once in Medina and this was after the death of the Prophet erase' lobstermen a bakr and umar and and Ozma etc at the very end of time of the Companions error and one he was praying to a screen to a Sutra a young man from the Ansar another companion he wanted to pass by he looked around he couldn't find or he didn't find or he was lazy to find so he thought that this is was the shortest way so he wanted to pass in front of Abu Saleh the hundred so Abu straighter who did this and as we know this is the way to prevent people from passing by the man stopped and then looked around yet determined he wanted to go in again in the Medina Masjid which is so big so in this case abuzer Adan houdry pushed him so hard in his chest that the boy almost fell so he went and complained to the Emir to the ruler of Medina and the ruler of Medina said Oh companion of the prophet alayhi salatu salam why did you do this to your nephew this young chap who is like a nephew to you and you are like an uncle to him he said because I heard the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam say this what did the Prophet say the Prophet said had a lot of Sam if anyone of you praise to something that is a screen between him and the people and one wanted to pass in front of him he should prevent him and if he insists he should forcibly stop him the Arabic word fellow carton who which translates to he should fight with him because he is a devil this is the action of a devil if he insist on doing this so scholars say it is so important it is so sinful to pass in front of a worshipper if he's praying to a screen to the extent that you must do what it takes to stop him so you should notify him by putting your hand out or saying subhanAllah or anything to bring to his attention that he is doing something wrong if he insists you must prevent him and if he continues you must fight with him but scholars say that you are not allowed to use any weapons you are not allowed to kill him for example you have to prevent him even by force however they say if he dies while you're preventing him or if you push him and he dies you have no burden or no sin and you not requested to pay the blood-money why because he is the aggressor and you were simply doing what Islam told you to do and they gave another example for example what happens if I poke someone's eye definitely this is a sin and I have to pay the blood-money for that however the Prophet told us alehissalaam that who ever sneaks and tries to look into our houses from a hole or from an opening or from the window and he tries to do this we have the right to poke his eyes and there is nothing no burden on us why because he's the aggressor he's the one who's doing something that is Haram and he's trespassing on my privacy and that is why he deserves what he gets likewise a person who wants to walk in front of me while I'm praying to a screen I am entitled to prevent him and if not I may fight with him and push him however you're not allowed to engage with him in grabbling and put him into grab because this takes you out of the mood of prayer you're not allowed to wrestle with him you're not allowed to do a lot of extra movement in prayer you're only entitled to push him or to prevent him or to move a little bit forward to prevent him or stop him from moving in front of you but you should not do anything more than that what is the ruling on taking a sutra the majority of scholars say that it is a sunnah and it is recommended there are few scholars who said that it is mandatory and if you don't pray to a sutra your prayer is invalid but their opinion is not the most authentic one the most authentic opinion is that it is a sunnah and it is highly recommended among the benefits of the sutra is that it restricts your site from wandering and this is known by experience if you pray to a sutra you never look ahead or at people you always restrict your site to beyond the sutra from your site so this adds a lot of value to those who pray because it makes them concentrate more when the I pray by not wandering and looking right left or center also among the benefits of Sutra is when people walk in front of you you may say I have no problem my prayer is okay but actually by them walking in front of you this would distract you and hence it would reduce the reward you would get for prayer so the Sutra acts as a screen that completes your prayer and prevents anything from cutting in the Sunnah is that a person draws closer to the sutra to the screen so it would not be permitted that I have three metres distance between me and my Sutra because this is burdening people and what it would not act as a sutra the most preferred and light manner is to have your sutra exactly next where you put your head so there is no gap and people would identify it the minute they see you praying to an object or to a pillar or to a wall they know that this is your private space which they are not allowed or entitled to walk through however the Prophet had a Philips arm himself whenever he prayed to a wall he would draw so close to it but even when there is a sheep or a goat that wants to pass by between him and the wall the Prophet as I'm used to walk until he sticks his belly in the wall so that the sheep or the goat moves behind him though if the sheep or the god moved in front of him it would not nullify his prayer but it would reduce the reward it would reduce the perfection of the prayer and that is why from this hadith and other hadith we learned that you should not let anyone pass by in front of you while you are praying to your screen you have to stop them don't take it easy sometimes we see children walking and moving and one of the children wants to pass by and we see in ourselves because he's a child it's okay no you should teach the child prevent him if this is not possible walk a little bit a step or two in front so that he would walk behind you but scholars say what happens if I were praying and someone came and passed and went should I catch him and bring him back again they said no this would be twice the time making him pass in front of you if he passed and gone Halas it's over you cannot get him back but if he wants to pass you have to stop him secondly who is entitled to take a sutra the Imam and the individual is the moon requested or instructed to take a Sutra to take a screen no he's not why scholars say because the imams sutra is a screen to everyone behind him and that is why if the followers the MU moon they're praying behind an imam and someone wants to walk in front of them should they prevent him no the imam is the one who stops people in front of him but us as followers us as worshipers behind the imam we do not have to do this and there is a hadith that backs this up or a number of hadith and the most famous one is the hadith of Abbas may Allah be pleased with him and with his father which we will insha'Allah get to read later on not today because I don't think we have enough time for doing it today now we have a situation which is if you go to al-haram in Mecca you will find that it is an open area and at times of Hajj or in the times of season it is not extremely difficult it is impossible to wait until people finish their prayer because you're talking about hundreds of thousand praying at the same time so you stop for this one praying to a sutra after he finishes you move one step and then there is another one and a third and a hundred and a million two event a Mia may Allah have mercy on his soul says that the harem of Makkah is exempted from this and if a woman or a man pass in front of you in harem you do not stop them whether you praying behind an imam or praying on your own because the harem is exempted due to the fact of its nature this is all the time we have until we meet next time via Manila assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
