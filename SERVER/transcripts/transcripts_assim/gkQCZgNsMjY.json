  "title": "Is a woman SINFUL if she covers her face in Hajj and Umrah (Niqab)? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Okay, Khalilullah from Nigeria. I'm Sheikh, I wanted to ask about women performing Hajj and Umrah. I heard that it's not compulsory or is not allowed for them to cover their face, for example, for a woman who is in a club on a normal day. So someone who now later did this, you know, cover her face, is this sinful? Is Hajj and Umrah accepted? Is it valid? Okay. Wa Jazakum. First of all, it is a misconception that a woman who is in the state of Ihram for performing Hajj or Umrah must not cover her face. This is totally bogus. The Hadiths are against it. Meaning that the Hadith of Asmaa bint Abi Bakr, Hadith of Aisha, that we used to perform Hajj with the Prophet Isa Salaam or Umrah and whenever riders used to pass by us, we used to cover our faces. And when they're gone, we would unveil. Which means that covering the face during the Hajj and the Umrah for a person who is in his Ihram is mandatory. Now what is not permissible for a woman in the state of Ihram to do is to wear the Niqab. As it is not permissible for a man in the state of Ihram to wear a shirt that has sleeves, but he can cover his arms and shoulders, no problem, but he must not wear something that has sleeves to it. Likewise, a woman can cover her face even with a veil that touches her face, but she cannot wear the Niqab, which is a face cover that has an opening for the eyes. This is not permissible for a woman in Ihram. So to answer your question, yes, a woman in the state of Ihram must cover her face if she's in the presence of non-Mahram men so that they would not look at her and Allah knows best."
