  "title": "The calamities Prophet Yusuf faced assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "And look what Allah did to him. And look at Prophet Yusuf. He is the son of a prophet. The son of a prophet. The son of Ibrahim, the messenger and prophet of Allah. Four prophets in a row. Who can be more honorable than Yusuf, peace be upon him? Nevertheless, as a child was abandoned and thrown by his own flesh and blood, by his own siblings. Stabbed in the back and thrown into a well. Caught by passers-by to be sold as a slave. Raised in the mansion of Aziz of Egypt. Only to be seduced by a beautiful, shockingly woman. And he refuses to bargain on his chastity as he fears Allah. To be punished and thrown in jail for a number of years, losing the most beautiful years of his life. Any one of us, if we're to be invited, my place or yours, I would answer immediately. Yusuf did not do that. He rather was thrown in jail, rather to respond to such filth and sin."
