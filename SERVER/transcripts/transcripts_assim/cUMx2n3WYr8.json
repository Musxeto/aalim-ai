  "transcript": "[Music] ald we continue the explanation of the great Hadith of the Prophet Alat wasam where he says in his instructions to the Believers don't envy one another and don't bid one another out for raising the price and don't nurse hatred or enmity and don't give your back to one another and don't enter into a transaction when the others have entered into that transaction and be as fellow brothers and Servants of Allah the Muslim is the brother of another Muslim he does not wrong him he does not let him down or look down upon Him tawa is here and he pointed to his chest three times sallallahu alai wasallam it is sufficient evil for a man to look down upon his Muslim brother every Muslim is sacred to another Muslim his blood his property and his honor we spoke previously about envy and the evil eye and the danger upon Muslims the prophet goes on sallallahu alaih wasallam to tell us that it is not permissible for us to bid out one another for race raing the price this is a form of transaction known in Islam as anes and anes is forbidden and what is meant by anes Andes is one form of having people deceived by Bing more over an item or a subject so that they would think it is more valuable than its true price and Scholars give example of this when people for example have an item for sale in an auction even if it was on eBay for example and people give a price for it so if it actually costs €100 and there is one or two people who are interested in buying it three four five 10 people collaborate to raise the price so that the value of that item goes from 100 to 300 or500 and why do they do this if it's one of the two reasons either they want to benefit the owner so if I am displaying an item for sale and the price of €300 is what I got for it my friends would like to benefit me more so when they saw that there are people interested in buying it for 300 they said 320 350 so they raise the price and and compete in getting it PR pretending that they want to buy it so they would deceive other buyers into raising the price until it reaches 500 or 600 and then they withdraw so that the one who was deceived would buy it the second reason would be if I want to harm the buyer I don't want to benefit the seller I want to harm the buyer so I see that my friend my brother XY Z person is going to buy that item for €300 I want him to pay more I want him to lose I don't know the seller I don't know who's selling it but I just want this person to lose so I say 350 and he is competing with me he says 400 I say 450 he says 500 I withd draw I did not ever had the interest of buying that uh item and this is forbidden and this is Haram why because it's deceiving people first of all and second of all because it erases the amount of hatred in people's hearts because if I knew that you were doing this so that I would lose money I would definitely be angry with you and I would not feel uh uh so good about what you had done and that is why the prophet saidat after envy and after forbidden forbidding raising uh uh the price he said do not nurse hatred or enmity which is the natural result result of envying people and also it is the natural result of raising the price so that you would bid one another out just for the sake of raising the prices"
