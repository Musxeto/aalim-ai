  "transcript": "so my question is um uh when I use social media I try to post Islamic posts most of the times but sometimes a lot of video comes where I might think the editing is not so well or the presenting is not well such as recently um I saw a video where someone instantly died died saying the shahada but the way they put text or emojis on it I felt should I share this or not or sometimes I feel the Quran recitation is not clear so I uh the thought comes that if I don't share it I might be disrespecting Islam so um is it kufur or not if I don't first of all first of all Misha is it mandatory to share it yes or no no sh and how would it be kuur see the most important thing for us to avoid OCD because this is how Shan Whispers in our ears inflating Little Things the most important thing is to have our thought process clear ask simple questions is it mandatory any person dumping stuff on me and says if you don't share it you will face the consequences on the day of judgment I don't forgive you if you don't share it who are you to forgive or not to forgive the heck with you I don't care so as long as you've just stated clearly and you know this from your own pure nature that it's not mandatory for me to share whatever people dump on me in this case if the quality is not good or if you think that it is inappropriate delete it without any sin let alone kufur"
