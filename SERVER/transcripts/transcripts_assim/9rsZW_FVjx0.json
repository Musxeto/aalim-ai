  "title": "How to answer children when they ask why don't we have a more lenient religion? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "the daughter of some age says that why don't we have a more lenient religion and maybe the other religions like the hindus or buddhism are much easier than islam this is probable but it doesn't mean that they're correct and the issue is with this girl and those who ask similar questions is that they do not understand what islam is they are culturally muslims unfortunately and this is the case with a lot of the muslims they're born and raised as muslims but they they are not convinced they just act as a routine and they say simon says but if we were to go to europe or to the far east and nobody knows us then we would not pray would not fast we would do like the romans do when in rome and and this is a very very serious issue you have to start from the foundation why do we worship allah is there allah does allah exist so you have to start from the very bottom up and once you establish these foundations and you build on them then you will be able to have a strong faith and eman with that without that it would be difficult to to convince this girl so go back to the basics so why should we adopt hinduism or seek or buddhism why not any religion is there a god that tells us to follow his religion or not and from there you go bit by bit and show her the evidence from the quran from the sunnah the perfection of the quran the miraculous quran the way of the prophet allah that would help tremendously you"
