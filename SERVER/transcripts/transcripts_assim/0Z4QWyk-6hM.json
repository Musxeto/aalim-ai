  "transcript": "a woman this is a question from a brother he says a woman got divorced after wedding night because she did not bleed her husband accuse her of zina but she never did wrong in her life there is a tradition of putting white cloth on bed to check the bride bleed or not what does islam say about this this is outrageous this is disgusting this has no relationship with islam none whatsoever no man with honor and dignity would ever think of doing something heinous like this even animals don't do things like this the haman of a woman is not always broken at the wedding night sometimes it takes a week sometimes it takes more sometimes it breaks without bleeding most of women don't have it because of the physical sports they do riding bicycles running jumping so to have the audacity to accuse a pure innocent woman of zina just because of your failure to intellectually think like a real man this is outrageous it's very simple islam shows us how to deal with such ignorant imbeciles in a beautiful manner the moment this husband after the wedding night accuses his wife of zina for failing to bleed as if it's something she has control over this accusation by itself only two male witnesses are required they should go to the muslim court and file a case of slander against him either he would bring four male witnesses testifying of seeing his wife committing adultery or he would swear four times taking allah's name that she is a adulteress or a fornicator and the fifth time he said that may allah's curse be upon him if he was telling the lie and no one no no muslim would do that because he knows that he will go to hell if he does this he didn't see anything he didn't do any she she didn't do anything so such people who do such customs they're not related to islam maybe it's related to hinduism to buddhism or whatever religion they follow but it has nothing to do with islam and payback as they say is a bad thing you will have tomorrow daughters and you will have sisters and you will be in the same boat so be careful don't marry women of honor and dignity if you cannot honor them go and look for some women here there with bad reputation because this is what suits you not women of dignity and honor from reputable family and allah azza knows best you"
