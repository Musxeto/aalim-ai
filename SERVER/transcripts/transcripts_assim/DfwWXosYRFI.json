  "transcript": "we have couple of minutes left maybe one minute um ni Islam says is it permissible to learn logic and philosophy to debate with the atheists non-practicing Muslims secularists modernists Etc to prove various aspects of Islam and to refute their false accusations against Islam the answer generally speaking no this is totally prohibited not because Islam cannot answer these uh atheists or or uh uh philosophy and logic ideas but rather because this is one of the biggest Gates of Shan to corrupt your heart and your soul as long as you believe that the Quran and the Sunnah are the ultimate truth there's no need for you to study something that casts doubts on each and every aspect of your life this is the satanic way of trying to divert you from Islam and therefore this is totally prohibited we have we know through history great Scholars like Abu hammed Al gazali who went into studying philosophy and logic in order to respond to these uh uh philosophers and to the atheists and to the Greeks uh uh theologists Etc however though he was a great scholar he lost his compass and he suffered drastically and made real bad mistakes in regards of a trying to communicate with them only to be salvaged like 30 or 40 years well decades later on and to raise a white flag saying that I have done something that I should not have done this is all the time we have until we meet next time I leave you"
