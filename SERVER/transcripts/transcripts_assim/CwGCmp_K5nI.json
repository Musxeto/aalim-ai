  "transcript": "Anas from Canada Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh uh so uh one of the days i made wudu with the socks in which i started to wipe right when uh after time begins then on the next day uh so uh beyond asr which the time has already expired for me to wipe socks uh like i was taking a nap and then i woke up and then i made wudu to pray the maghrib not knowing that it's already expired and then i prayed the maghrib and then i waited until isha and then prayed and prayed was praying isha and when i was praying the isha i just remembered that the time for wiping has already expired so i leave the prayer to renew remake the wudu and then pray again what's the ruling on my um maghrib and isha prayers you have to repeat your maghrib your maghrib is invalid because you performed wudu without washing your feet so your wudu is invalid isha alhamdulillah you went and renewed your wudu and prayed it you should have prayed maghrib first but because the prayer was ongoing and you wanted to catch the jamaah inshallah this is one of the opinions that allow you to pray isha and afterwards you have to go and pray maghrib you"
