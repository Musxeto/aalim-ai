  "transcript": "I have a question what's the ruling on using uh Snapchat because people have horoscopes in them and uh what if there is a way to remove these horoscopes will a person uh prayer be invalid or unaccepted for 40 days Yousef what's the ruling on reading newspapers where there is a whole page dedicated for horoscopes Yousef yeah yes Che what's the ruling on on reading the news paper when there is a dedicated page for horoscope said that you tear the page that has the horoscopes okay meaning if you don't tear it if you're in a public library if you're uh in a restaurant or on the train and you find it to read it definitely you're not going to tear it because this is not yours and you are not authorized to do it so basically use your logic if you're using SnapChat or any other application that has horoscope and you don't deal with it you don't read it you don't look at it there is nothing wrong in that inshallah"
