  "transcript": "um the second question is my father does not pray Salah and when I asked him to come pray with us he always says he'll start tomorrow I know that uh I know that is I know that the Islam of one who sorry the grammar is a little bit off I know that the Islam of one who questionable and I want to help my dad my entire family is practicing but him what should I or my mother do this is a big problem not with the father with the son let alone the Holy Ghost this is a big problem because lots of such youngsters are so quick to draw the gun and shoot and then ask questions in the sense that they just want to make his father cfir he's almost labeling him as cafir and his mother is cfir my brother did this he's a cafir right why why are you so eager to take people out of the fold of Islam why don't you look at the full full half of the glass instead of the empty half of the glass he's not rejecting Salat he's saying inshallah tomorrow and you don't know whether he prays when you go to the Masjid on his own or he prays in his bedroom or he prays when you're at work or at Uni so assume the best act with him in the best of fashion being diplomatic being dutiful and obedient and respectful give him a sense of feeling that you love him and respect him not that you are talking to him from your Ivory Tower wanting Simon says to be obeyed wanting to control him like so many of us do this is why people are rejecting you why aren't people accepting my dawa my family my close friends my relatives they always reject me because you are wanting to control show them that you love them that you're willing to go out of their way to help them and serve them and give them a year without talking to them about Islam and after one year they will come running after you and asking you about Islam and they'll be convinced of whatever you tell them to do because they trust you and believe you but now you just hatch from the egg and now you're telling me to do this and this is Haram and this is and this is sh and you're going to hell and what is this nobody's going to listen to you so do not reinvent the wheel go to the basics call people with your etiquette with your moral conduct with your behavior with your generosity with wanting to go out of your way to serve them not just to be the religious police this is halal this is Haram you're wrong you're this you're that they will never listen to you and Allah Knows Best"
