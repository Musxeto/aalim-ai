  "title": "Should I include my pension savings in my zakat? #assimalhakeem #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um so she I used to take pension until I saw your video and got to know that I should not um now in my pension account there's obviously my own contribution plus my employes contribution and I cannot take this out until I am 57 so like I have no control over it so my question was uh considering this do I need to account for this in my zaka calculation but first of all why do you not take it is it voluntary or is it mandatory by your employer so it was volunt and I used to take it considering it would be beneficial but then I saw your video and I found out that I should not and you cannot uh uh stay away from it you cannot claim it um so whatever amount is in there now I cannot claim it until I'm 57 which is like twice the age okay in this case there is no zakat upon you because you do not have full access and possession of it however once you reach that set age by the government or by the company and they release your payment you have to give once zakat over it so you calculate 2.5% of what they give you and give it as zakat and you take the money without a problem inshallah"
