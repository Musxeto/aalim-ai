  "title": "When people slandered Aisha & when mothers of believers complained about less provision to Prophet ï·º",
  "transcript": "the prophet alam's household had problems like any marriage and there are two main problems one of them is the story of Al this great Calamity that took place when the people of hypocrisy uh um slandered mother Aisha so what happened was they said that she committed adultery with safan may Allah be pleased with him after being unable to join the Expedition and the Army after the camp was dismantled and they left she was was left behind and looking for a necklace that fell from her and before she knew it the whole convy is gone so she sat where she was until safan passed by her and noticed her and knew who she was and then he took her on his camel and caught up with the Army and that was few hours later and when the Hypocrites saw that this they started to slunder mother and this is when Allah says indeed those who propagated the slander that is the if are a group among you do not think it bad for you rather it is good for you because it revealed the Innocence OFA in the Quran that Allah revealed till date we cited unlike what the ra say may Allah curse them when they slunder mother and insist on falsifying the Quran and saying that no this is not uh in her regard we don't believe in this and from uh uh such behavior and such belief and there is good in it because it exposed the Hypocrites for who they truly are so what happened was that the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam when he went through such a problem he stayed for a whole month and in this month AA did not know anything wrong because she fell sick and the prophet kept on coming to visit but she felt that that she was a little bit different because he just comes in and says how are you are you well and he leaves he's not showing her the compassion and the affection he used to why because the prophet was confused himself Alam all this slunder happening he doesn't have proof and evidence to defend his wife though he knows her but he cannot defend it when there are people accusing and at the same time Allah as a form of test did not reveal her innocence for a whole month so the prophet was confused and also the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam asked his close relatives he asked Usama and he asked Al Talib and each one of them said something Usama Z for example said she's your wife and by Allah I know nothing bad or evil about her so he got an assurance that she was okay Ali on the other hand took the safest approach and he said she's just a woman and Allah made all women Halal for you so yeah if you are in doubt leave her but I would maybe ask the maid because the maid is very close to her she's always with her in the house she would have noticed anything fishy and the maid said by Allah she has nothing to worry about and I've never ever seen anything bad about her but the only thing that I would criticize her for is that she's a young girl while doing her dough and fixing it in the kitchen she would fall asleep that's the only thing that I would um criticize her for and while she's asleep the sheep or the chicken would come and eat the dough and and and everything would be gone so what happened was for a whole month the prophet would not know what to do until Allah revealed the verses of her innocence and it was proven that those who slandered her had to pay the price and those who slandered her were three among the companions who were vocal about it who made this sin and made that huge mistake but the real Hypocrites would not be pinned out because they did that in secret and made sure that it was not public so those three companions great Companions of the Prophet were flogged for this now if we would look how the prophet dealt with it it's a crisis for a whole month your own love your wife the prophet Salli wasallam did wasn't haste and he took a whole month to reach out the decision with the grace of Allah and he did not even open the topic with AA but she noticed that he was not as compassionate and as kind as he used to and she had no idea why was that and also the prophet used to collect advice and opinion from those who were close to him so he asked Usama he asked Ali he asked uh her maid and he also asked his co-wife z b j Allah be pleased with her and Zab the co-wife we've which we heard about a bit earlier she said by Allah I protect my hearing and my sight I've never seen anything negative or bad of on AA she is legit Nowa may Allah be pleased with her suffered a lot yet she was patient and grateful to Allah alone for saving her reputation and from that Calamity as well the other problem was that his women once they uh uh reached something thing uh that was too much for them they've reached a level that you know they would not light fire in his house to cook for two months so they came from wealthy families and now it was too much for them and they felt that we should insist more on asking for more provision from the prophet Alam until the prophet was frustrated and took a oath to stay away from them for a whole month to reprimand them and this is how the prophet dealt with it he cannot give them more and this is his life style and this is his standard of living because he's a person of God and this is how how he sees this world so if you want you can stay on board if you don't you I could set you free as Allah says in the Quran oh Prophet say to your wives if you should desire the worldly life and its adornment then come I will provide for you and give you a gracious release but if you should desire Allah and his messenger and the home of the Hereafter then indeed Allah has prepared for the doers of good among you a great reward and he gave the choice to his wives one by one and all of them chose to be with the prophet wasam and repented and said no we would not choose this world over you oh prophet of Allah and this teaches us to take care of the women we have because they might have come from wealthy families and we may not be as wealthy as their parents so if they may insist on having a better life or wanting more money and we can't afford it we need to take it easy with them and try to be diplomatic"
