  "transcript": "bismillahi rahmani 1 [Music] cancer is an illness and allah azza wajal did not create an illness without creating a cure to it as the Prophet had told us erase a lot of somali mohammed anima those who know it will know it and those who do not will not know it and we know that the plague which is an epidemic is the evil eye and the stabbing of our Brethren's from the jinn so there is nothing to prevent cancer from being an affliction of evil eye which is most likely a result of a trauma a woman's husband gets married and she knows about it few weeks later she gets cancer you know a lot of similar cases it can be any of this how is it to be treated there is physical and there is sentimental or spiritual the spiritual part is the Rokia so little Fatiha I tell Corsi the last two eyes of Surat al-baqarah Allah with that the last vehicles was am some water alongside with copying alongside with seven dates of algebra all of these things that came in had my soda you try everything and take it the physical aspect people say chemotherapy people say by oxygen people say by special medication I have a friend he's getting an injection a pill I think or an injection that costs 128 thousand reals he was with me last week 128 thousand and this this is the price in Saudi Yanni how many kg cadiz 120 KD when twenty twelve twelve thousand twelve thousand dinars for one injection and elsewhere they sell it for I think a thousand dinner look at their it's a business now I know for certain out of experience that cancer can be cured with the grace of allah azzawajal through the mixing of camel's milk with camels urine the hadith of consuming camel's milk with camels urine is mentioned in sahih al-bukhari when a group of the tribe of rani gene came to the prophet as salaam accepted islam and gave the pledge of allegiance and all of a sudden they fell ill so the prophet told them to come out of medina go to the herd of sadaqa of camels and drink ordered him ordered them to drink from its urine and it's milk few days they became fit but they are pasta sized and turned their back to islam so they killed the shepherd took the herds of Sbrocco and ran away the point is that this is the instruction of the Prophet RA salatu salam now my personal experience is that 20 years ago I had a friend who was five years older than me he used to teach chemistry I happened to see him few years back after a gap of 1012 years and I saw him and he changed his Palestinian originally masha'Allah his beard is this big and it became white wearing Saudi dress with regal and very completely transformed and I said masha'Allah how are you I said I hugged alarm fine what's work what had happened to you I said well I got intestines cancer and they operated me on me and they cut a big portion of it and I had this medications and they said it's too late Alice you're dead so what did you do is it I heard of a professor in the College of Pharmacy from it's not a moaner pharmaceutical collagen slide that oh she's milling easy matter for pharmacology okay yeah so this professor happens to be afar in law of my brother her name is I don't know her sheet something hot sheet it will come to me and this professor in king of disease college came with so many researches of the benefit of urine mixed with the camel milk in certain percentages that kills he said I got in contact with her and she told me it's almost a bottle cap of urine compared to a liter of or a little half of milk you mixed it up in you drink it and he said I tried that for five months tell us it was hopeless for me I'm taking it from the horse's mouth the guy is standing in front of me and I said how did it taste he said at the beginning it wasn't that good but after few days its milk and I started taking it fresh outside of jinda if you go to Medina there are always camels and Sudanese taking care of it and they sell it very cheap and after five months I went back to the doctor I did the tests the doctor was shocked is it what did you do there's not a trace of any cancerous cell in your body I told them I did this is this isn't impossible no way this cannot be and I said how long this was is about two and a half three years ago so enough it never came back I said look at me and I'm still consuming it every single day for I believe that this is the hadith of the Prophet Simon Buhari and if you have canceled your debt so might as well believe and drink something of the medication of the Prophet arrestor lobster and insha Allah they will be cured and a large audience knows best sallallahu wasallam Obara karate or Surya nabina muhammad"
