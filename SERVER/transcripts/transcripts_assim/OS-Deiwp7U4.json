  "transcript": "Alia from Qatar Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh I'm a Filipino rebirth and working here in Doha Qatar and I am a second wife of my Egyptian husband and Until now he didn't inform his family about us So we are like two years now in a marriage and now I fight with him because I always keep on telling him to inform Them because now we will be having a baby, but he told me he cannot do anything So it's like I will divorce him by Khullah or I will accept the situation Maria Alia when you went to this marriage you went into it With your own intention and with your own will any woman Knowing that she is getting married. She would demand that her Husband's or future husband's parents would be present. His family would be present. You did not ask for any of this You just went to the court got your nikah done and Did not ask any questions back then Maybe he gave you false promises. It's your mistake to accept them now if you are married to this man and Living in Qatar and everyone in Qatar knows about your marriage Whether his family knows about you or not is Irrelevant as long as he putting a roof on your head food on your table Providing you for you financially and taking good care of you Yes, it is an added value for his family to know but I don't know what his circumstances are And whether he's married to a first wife with children back home And if she were to know she would make his life hell or ask for divorce and break his own Original big family that his parents know of so he has to weigh the pros and cons But again, this is your call at the end of the day Would it be logical to ask for Khula and divorce him and be a single mom and live alone? Where he will move on with life He will probably marry a second wife in Qatar and not tell his first wife whom he is unable to bring to Qatar due to financial Restrictions or for the schools of the kids and he cannot leave work and go and live in Egypt to do again to financial reasons. So this is your own preference and Allah knows best You"
