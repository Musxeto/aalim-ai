  "title": "Mother wants to give away gold to her daughters, who should pay zakat on it, she or daughters? Assim",
  "transcript": "uh if a woman has gold and this gold is over 85 grams of uh gold 24k and usually she gives the cat to it now she wants to give her three daughters divide it upon them like 30 grams each which means that it would be below the threshold so do they have to pay the cat the answer is if she's doing this as a trick so that she would skip the cat this is not permissible because gold is actually hers it's in her position she did not give it to them so that they can sell it if they wish or give it as a gift if they wish no she still possesses it but it is just by name possessed by them but it's not the she has to give zakat but if she actually and genuinely gave the gold to them and both on all of them it's below the threshold then there is no zakat on it because they possessed it they can do with it whatever they want and it's not hers any more"
