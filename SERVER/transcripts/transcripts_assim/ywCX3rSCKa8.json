  "transcript": "Aqeela from India. Sir, my question is that if a person makes an oath before the age of two-thirty, does it require expiation? First of all, the Prophet ï·º said that the pen of accountability has been uplifted over three categories of people. Meaning that they're not held accountable on the Day of Judgment for what they had done. A person who's asleep until he wakes up. So someone who's asleep and while sleeping he would shout, Oh my wife, I divorce you, I divorce you, I divorce you. Is this a valid divorce? The answer is no. If he says words of kufr or shirk while asleep, he's not accountable because he's not in the state of sanity that Allah holds him accountable for. The second category is someone who's insane until he regains his sanity. Someone who's classified as a wacko. He's insane. Mentally unstable and he goes and breaks things. Is he accountable? No. Yes, his guardian has to pay for what he had damaged, but is he sinful? The answer is no. And the third is a child until he reaches the age of puberty. So if a child swears or says words of kufr, he's not accountable because he is not sane yet or he has not reached the age of puberty where Allah would hold him accountable. And likewise if he swears not to do something, are we obliged to tell him to go and expiate? The answer is no, because he's not accountable for his actions and hence expiation is not due for him and Allah Azza wa Jal knows best. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah Azza wa Jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
