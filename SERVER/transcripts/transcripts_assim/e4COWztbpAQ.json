  "transcript": "lessons from the prophet's sayings a program presented and prepared by aim alhim dear brothers and sisters in Islam it was reported in the musnad of Imam Ahmed and the Sunan of of IB ma that Abu anari may Allah be pleased with him narrated that a man came to the prophet sallallah alaihi Ali wasallam and said oh prophet of Allah advise me and be brief the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam said when you stand to pray pray like a man bedding farewell do not say anything for which you will have to apologize and give give up hope for what other people have in this Hadith whenever we hear these advises from the prophet sallallahu alaihi Al wasallam we remember his saying about himself I have been sent with concise speech sallallah alaih wasallam he says few words that need volumes to explain and to elaborate on the beautiful meanings it contain the prophet Alat wasam was approached by this companion of his who is asking for advice and at the same time he wants this advice to be brief because he knows that the more a person talks the more people tend to forget what he had said this is human nature the more brief you are the more up to the point and the more you elaborate on a point the more people tend to forget the content of what you had said the companion of the Prophet Alam needed advice and that is why he went to the source where he knows that he would get a sincere and truthful advice unfortunately we are not like this we usually do not go to people seeking their advice and if we do usually this is on the materialistic side we do not ask them for advice in things that would draw us closer to Allah asael you find people asking about their welfare about the prices of the stock market about the prices of groceries and things that they have to buy every single day they ask about real estate they ask about the jobs the raises the bonuses but very seldom you would find people asking about their religion though Allah asael instructed us twice in the Holy Quran by saying ask those who have knowledge if you do not know and the funny thing is that a lot of the Muslims claim to know everything though they do not even possess the basic knowledge in Islam therefore if you look at the biography of most of the scholars of Islam since the time of the companions till our time you would find their keenness is the common denominator in asking about things that would benefit them in this life but surely in the Hereafter as well this companion came to the prophet Alat wasam seeking his advice and he want it to be brief so that he would be able to apply it to practice it to implement it in his life the Prophet Alat wasam gave him three advices the first one is concerning his prayer the prophet said when you stand to pray pray like a man bidding farewell and prayer is of Great Value and importance in Islam upon it lots and lots of rulings depend for example our Prophet Alam had told us that whoever abandons prayer completely he is a cfir he's a disbeliever he is not a Muslim anymore and allel mentioned a number of verses in the Holy Quran on this topic also those who are lazy those who attend prayer but they skip a lot of its pillars and maybe they skip a ra or two or they skip the whole prayer and make another congregation those who are like this the prophet sallallah alaihi Ali wasallam described them to be Hypocrites where he says that the most burdensome prayer of all upon the Hypocrites are the prayer of is and the prayer of f therefore one should be careful when he offers the prayer it is not something to be taken lightly the prophet told usat wasam that on the day of judgment the first thing a Muslim would be questioned about is his prayer and if his prayer is valid Allah will accept his deeds the remaining Deeds fasting paying zakat offering omra performing Haj all of these Good Deeds depend on the validity and acceptance of the prayers and the prophet tells usat but if his prayers are not accepted then so are the rest of his Good Deeds Allah will not accept them as well so the prophet tells this man to pray like a man bidding farewell but how can a Muslim pray like a man bidding farewell this is interpreted in another Hadith where the Prophet saysat wasam remember death in your prayer because when a man remembers Death In His prayer he would definitely and surely perfect his prayer and pray the prayer of a man who is almost certain that he's not going to pray another one in this Hadith the prophet explains to usam how to pray like a man bidding farewell he's telling us that when a person prays he should remember Death In His prayer and he should convince himself as if this is the last prayer he offers and why is that because the prophet tells usat that when a person does this he is surely to perfect he is surely going to perfect his prayer and one would argue why does the prophet Alat wasam promote why does he promote OTE the remembrance of death during prayer well this is what we're going to discuss inshallah next time we meet so until then let from The Prophet's sayings a program presented and prepared by aim alhim [Applause]"
