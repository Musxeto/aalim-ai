  "transcript": "says I have an exaggerated fear of death how do I cope with it as it hinders my day-to-day activities we said there's so many times that the fear of death can be positive and can be negative the negative part of it is usually due to Satan's whispers weakness of Eman and it might be related to other factors as well why do we say that this is related to Shaitaan negative fear makes people stagnant with refusing to progress it hinders them from doing a lot of things so whenever they want to do something they're afraid of death so they don't do it whenever they want to earn and work they're afraid of death whenever they want to plan something positive for the future they're afraid of death such fear is from Shaitaan and a believer a true believer does not fear the Shaitaan nor the soldiers of Shaitaan rather he fears Allah alone now you ask yourself is my fear of death going to stop me from dying hmm maybe maybe no it's not going to stop you from dying because your death was predestined 50,000 years before Allah had created the universe and this is why it's something which is done and over with whether you fear it or not it's gonna come at the designated time not a minute early nor a minute late so you come to think of it logically why then am i afraid it's gonna happen so is my fear going to prevent it no is my fear going to make me enjoy life no so who's benefiting from my fear shaitaan/satan so you have to put this in your mind in order to overcome such a negative fear on the other hand there is a positive fear and this fear is the one that drives us to excel so I'm afraid of death why because I have many shortcomings and since what are you gonna do about it well my fear of death is driving me to repent that's positive it's driving me to do good deeds to compensate for the bad deeds that's even positive it is making me not so attached to this dunya to the money to the wealth to the family to the children because I know I am about to depart them soon so I have to invest in them to the best of my ability giving charity to ongoing sadaqa sadaqa jariya to feed the poor to take care of my children and bring them in in an Islamic way so that after my death they make dua for me or maybe perform Umrah or any of the likes so this fear of death is a positive thing it is driving me to excel and to progress and this is how you should look at it a free"
