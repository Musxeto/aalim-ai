  "transcript": "his third question that in the sub-continent they say that 20 raka is mandatory eight raka is wrong and they are wrong a tracker is the prayer that the prophet offered that is awesome are you crazy this is what he did mother Aisha said I'm a Muslim when she was asked about how did the Prophet pray night prayer in Ramadan sallallaahu Selim she said he did not pray in Ramadan or out of Ramadan month r11 rak'ahs so this is the sunnah now having said that it does not mean that we should limit it to 11 because there are other hadith that may open the door for us and the sky's the limit so whether you pray 8:00 or pray 20 or pray 50 this is no problem insha Allah"
