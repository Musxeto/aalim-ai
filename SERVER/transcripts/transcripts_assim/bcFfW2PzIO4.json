  "transcript": "NAD from the Emirates last time you answered my question it was regarding uh buying and selling of crude oil and shares of multinational companies I still have one confusion uh if someone does not have an intention to become a partner in a m company but only intends to buy and sell the shares online on periodical basis is that Hal whether you intend yeah yeah Yousef whether you intend or not you're a partner by default so if you buy shares in Johnny Walker or in in uh um John player or something I think the the cigarettes I don't know what it's called the company uh this is still Haram because you are a partner in buying Haram stocks so it's the same concept"
