  "transcript": "Tawfiq from Turkey Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh Wallahi I love you a lot Barakallahu Feek May Allah Azza Wa Jal love you back Nasalsin Alhamdulillah Sheikh Yes Sir what can I do for you? Wallahi Sheikh I have a big problem My problem is that is in our country the public schools They are just prohibit us to grow our beard And I have tried to talk to them a lot And to show them that leaving beard is a fard for Muslim man Correct But they just making how can I say it they don't accept this What grade are you in Tawfiq? Grade 11 Ok so you have no other option but to change your public school And go to a private school that would allow you to grow your beard Or option two is to go into correspondence So you study from home and you only go to attend the exams Or you finish your grades in another country also by correspondence And you answer their tests online Because shaving the beard is totally prohibited Whether it is forced upon you by the government or by your parents Or by the society it is going against Allah's ruling Some would argue it is sunnah why? Akhi it is mandatory it is fard upon every male adult to leave his beard without shaving it The difference of opinion is in cutting it short Trimming it and this is a lesser evil But shaving it all four schools of thought The vast majority of Muslims agree that it is totally prohibited So you have no excuse in that and Allah knows best"
