  "transcript": "what about if I miss one raka and pray wonder how with the email again this is valid but you're dead end or your threshold or the minimum accepted is when the imam is in the record position of the second raka and you come to the machine if the man is in the second Rakharo core and you say Allah ho Akbar and you attend him while he's in true core you are in ruku at the same time you manage to say subhanAllah be an RDM once and he said sami allahu liman hamidah and you raise your head this is a valid raka in the requirement for a valid but if you came into the prairies in the second raka in the bowing position and just as you pour rocailles yeah but I attended the salat with the mmm no once the Imam raises his head from the second raka this means that you've missed the Friday and you have to pray for raka of the her so the dividing line is to offer record in the second record with the image you miss this you have to pray the whole prayer"
