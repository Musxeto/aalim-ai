  "title": "The 3 Quls and Ayatul Kursi | Authentic supplications by Sh. Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "What are the Muawwithat? They are Chapter 112, 113, 114, the last three chapters of the Quran, known as the last three Qul. Why? Because they begin with Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad and Qul A'udhu Bi Rabbil Falaq and Qul A'udhu Bi Rabbil Naas. So the Sunnah is to recite each once after all five daily prayers. Oh, can we recite them after voluntary prayers, the Sunnah prayers? Nope, only after the Fard. You don't mention them after Salatul Janazah, the funeral prayer, or the Rawatib, the voluntary highly emphatic recommended prayers, or the Witter, etc. These are only for the five daily prayers. What else? We also recite Surat or Ayatul Kursi. What is the significance of it? It is the best Ayah in the entire Quran. The best Ayah? Yes, this is what the Prophet, Alayhis Salatu Wassalam, told us, which indicates that the verses of the Quran vary in their importance. The greatest of them all is Ayatul Kursi. So what's the greatest of all chapters of the Quran? It's chapter number one, Suratul Fatiha. So what is Ayatul Kursi? As you can see. Allah, none has the right to be worshipped but He. The ever living, the self-sustaining, and the sustainer of all. No slumber can seize Him, nor sleep. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and on earth. Who is He that can intercede with Him except with His permission? And He knows what will happen to His creatures in this world and in the hereafter. Nor shall they encompass anything of His knowledge except that which He wills. His Kursi extends over the heavens and the earth, and He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them. And He is the Most High, the Most Great. This is known as Ayatul Kursi. What does Kursi mean? This is a very important thing and it's related to Aqeedah. Kursi in Arabic can have the meaning of a chair, but we don't refer to the Arabic when we have evidences from the Salaf explaining it and the best one to explain it is Abdullah ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him and with his father, the cousin of the Prophet, and the interpreter of the Quran. He said that Al-Kursi is the footstool, is the place of the feet, the footstool. It is different totally and totally smaller than the throne of Allah Azza wa Jal. And this is something unfortunately people of ignorance may confuse and they think that the Kursi is the throne or Al-Arsh which is not at all as the size compared to the throne is like a ring tossed in the desert. The size of a ring compared to the desert is negligible and the Kursi compared to the Arsh or the footstool compared to the throne is the same way. What is the benefit of reading this ayah? The Prophet said, alayhis salatu wa salam, whoever maintains reciting Ayatul Kursi after each and every one of the five fard prayers, nothing would prevent him from entering paradise except death. I want to enter paradise now. Wait, you're not dead. If I continue to recite Ayatul Kursi after each fard, if I die, I will be admitted to Jannah. This is one of the greatest rewards and unfortunately a lot of the people, a lot of the youngsters and some of the elders as well do not know this beautiful ayah. So unfortunate. They don't memorize it, they don't know the benefits of it because their parents failed to do so. As stated in the hadith of Abu Hurairah, the long hadith where a thief came over three continuous nights trying to steal some of the treasury of the Muslims and whenever he was caught by Abu Hurairah, he pleaded that he was poor and his children needed food and in the last night he said that I will teach you an ayah, if you recite it in the night, Allah would protect you from all devils and the Prophet said, peace be upon him, he told you the truth and he's a liar. And that was about Ayatul Kursi. So do we recite A'udhu Billahi Minash Shaitanir Rajim when reciting Ayatul Kursi? There is no need to do that because it's not part of the sunnah. Yet generally speaking when reciting the Qur'an, the sunnah is to recite Al-Isti'aadah, A'udhu Billahi Minash Shaitanir Rajim, not with the adhkar as this was not prescribed. So we recite Ayatul Kursi in the morning and the evening as well as with the five daily prayers. Then we recite the last three quls. Okay Sheikh but we recited them after Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib and Isha. Yeah you recited them once each but in the morning and evening adhkar, you recite them thrice each. So you say Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad three times, Qul A'udhu Bi Rabbil Falaq three times, Qul A'udhu Bi Rabbil Nas three times in the morning and in the evening. So if you manage to say that in Fajr or in Maghrib, there's no need for you to repeat that once after Fajr prayer or Maghrib prayer because doing it three times each would suffice for that. You would have hit two birds with one stone."
