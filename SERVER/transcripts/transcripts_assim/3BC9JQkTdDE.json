  "transcript": "while I was playing Isha today my nose was not clear due to phlegm or mucus so I pulled the flame from my nose and swallowed it so it did not come to my mouth but it went straight to my food pipe so is my Salah valid and what about the congregation who prayed behind me it is valid insha Allah and their prayer is valid as well"
