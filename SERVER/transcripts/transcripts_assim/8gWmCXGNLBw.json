  "title": "Period stopped for 12 hours, should I perform Ghusl, how to determine end of period",
  "transcript": "halima from nigeria says that her period is sometimes four days five days six days and on the fourth day it stopped for 12 hours so should she perform russell or not when a woman gets the flow of blood this is her monthly period she must refrain from praying and fasting when it stops and she sees her purity this is her purity she must perform russell and resume praying and fasting if she wishes now basically or generally speaking when a woman has her period six to seven days on average and the blood stops on the sixth day and she sees her purity she must take russell but what happens if it stops on the fourth day here we have to determine number one did she see her purity or it only stopped because dryness can happen even on the second or third day sometimes it happens for half an hour or for few minutes so a woman must not rush to take her hustle unless she sees the purity which the prophet alison ordered and it was mentioned in explaining what purity is that it is a discharge that is thread-like and it's white unaccompanied by yellowish or brownish discharges so it's a thread like white discharge that a woman sees and it announces her purity once she sees this she can without any problem perform russell if the blood returns the flow of the blood not the the color discharges a day or two later if the flow of blood resumes then she should refrain but if it doesn't then alhamdulillah she did the right thing you"
