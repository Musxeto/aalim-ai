  "transcript": "okay welcome back to the next question shake this a sister saying that her mother-in-law is living with her and she's always causing her issues in the home and they're always fighting she forgives her and then they fight again and then recently the mother-in-law has actually physically hurt the sister and she said that she's never gonna forgive the mother-in-law or again and so the sisters asking if Allah will forgive her for not forgiving her mother-in-law do you have many questions well yes and no answers would suffice because I don't have any other speakers to share the floor with me so I can speak as much as I want and hamdulillah the issue of mother-in-law and daughter-in-law is a very sensitive issue the short answer will Allah forgive her this is up to allah azzawajal not to me so don't worry about your right on the day of judgment you will take it unless you forgive then you will be double the reward because Allah is most forgiving I usually say this story but it is not true so is it Elijah well it's for a better cause I usually say to my married daughters when they complain so I tell them that a woman came to me and she asked me about her mother-in-law and she's causing her a lot of problems in the house and they live in a joint family and she doesn't know what to do and I told her are you up to doing whatever it needs to get rid of her she said yes I said even killing her she thought for a while is it yeah so I gave her a bottle and I said put two drops in every meal you prepare for her it has to be breakfast lunch and dinner and come back after one month with the good news and with a handsome payment so she left after two weeks she came back and she started crying and saying I seek Allah's forgiveness I don't want to go through this please give me the antidote give me the medication that would take this poison of her system so I said why why the change of heart she said I don't know my mother-in-law all of a sudden started to treat me well started to care for me started to love me and I don't want to kill her I don't want to harm her I said don't worry what I gave you was only drops of water it's unharmed for the change of heart was because you prepared three meals for your mother-in-law and you present it to her once you're kind to her she started treating you kindly and this is what's happening the same thing happens in homes when you treat everyone else as a rival or as an enemy you will only receive negative treatment but if you treat others with respect even if they once make an error and you respect them and you're kind to them and you treat them well they are forced and bound to treat you well but this is not the time to the path of the husband's hearts is the path to Jenna and inshallah if you do well with people for the sake of Allah it doesn't harm you if they abuse you or hurt you or say bad things to you I could care less I'm doing what I'm doing for allah azzawajal and whatever comes this would be insha'Allah in my record book and Allah knows best"
