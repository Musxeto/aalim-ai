  "transcript": "so my name is matin and I was just wondering if I need to change uh my name because uh it is one of uh the 99 Names of Allah is one of Allah's beautiful names and it means the one with the strength and power and this name unlike Alman can be used with individuals as well as a name of Allah subhana wa tala so we can say Kim and Karim is one of Allah's beautiful names we can't call someone or Alim because this name can be shared in Surah Yu the ruler of Egypt was called [Music] aliz and this is one of Allah's names so there are names that can be shared and there are names that can't and matim seems to me that it is permissible definitely putting before it would add a lot of value and would make you safer and out of any Harm's Way though it is is permissible and Allah Knows Best"
