  "transcript": "okay got another question here um from somewhere around Italy that's what they say here the brother says what is the hook he says on the size of the beard now he asked another question with that he said what are we allowed to trim and where does the beard start on the man's face you just said what is the H what's the meaning of h the ruling of okay because I believe that for for people that know Arabic they would find it easy to understand what's the meaning of h but those who do not would find it difficult so what's the ruling on growing the beard or the size of the beard well it's got written here the size of the beard yeah well Allah first of all Allah the almighty did not tell us to grow our beards to a particular or certain size mhm and he did not ask us or instruct us to prolong it m and uh to put uh uh some medication to make it longer MH the only thing that Allah the almighty instructed us to do was to just leave it not to touch it whether it's not growing then this is from Allah you don't have to shave it a number of times so that it would grow more and more you just leave it as it is this is the instruction of Allah the allmighty to us now did Allah give us a particular or certain size no is it possible for us to trim it the answer would be it's a an issue uh um that Scholars have disputed upon they all agree this is the consensus of all Scholars of Islam the four schools of thought so anyone that comes afterwards and claims otherwise then he is rejecting this and he is rejecting it without any evidence from the Quran or from the Sunnah the four Scholars the four schools of thought they all agree that it's forbidden for a Muslim to shave it mhm but they differ with whether it's allowed for a Muslim to cut short of it or not this is an issue of dispute some of the companions of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam used to say that it is okay to cut short or to trim whatever is more than a fist if you hold your beard and and whatever comes out of your fist then it's okay for you to trim that of course from the bottom not from the top so it's okay for a person to do that that and this is uh reported uh uh to Abdullah and to AB Abu Hur and other companions the most preferred and authentic and acceptable opinion to me personally is not to touch it but if it is so long to the extent that it becomes an obstacle for a person to uh uh uh to live then it's okay to follow the opinion of the companions in that issue just is"
