  "transcript": "Aisha from Japan uh Sheikh I wanted to get this   um there is an eating disorder called apica and \nit's eating non-food things such as clay mud   and chalk and stuff and there are uh YouTubers \nthat make ASMR videos uh eating chalk and stuff   so whenever I watch such videos I want I have \na feeling to eat clay and chalk and I don't I   don't know exactly whether I have that disorder \nbut would it be permissible to eat such thing   in Islam first of all first of all we have \nto understand that anything that is halal   and that is not harmful is beneficial and and is \npermissible for us to eat so if someone eats seeds   flower seeds this has no value most likely \nbut it spends time and it tastes good there's no problem in eating it but if you eat \nmud or if you eat chalk or if you and have known   relatives of mine who used to dip chalk sticks \ninto ink and then they chew it and eat it with   all their teeth in blue and it was so funny it was \nhilarious I don't know whether this is dangerous   medically or not most likely it is it would harm \nyour kidneys it would have negative effect among   other things but I'm not a doctor you have to go \nto doctors if the doctors say no this is not good   definitely then it's totally prohibited if they \nsay it's safe then it is permissible not logical   a bit weird but as long as it is safe there's \nno problem in that but what's more important is   for you Aisha to realize the impact which \nis very negative upon these YouTubers of   these YouTubers and influencers on you now who \nin his right mind would spend a few minutes let alone hours watching such irresponsible \npeople and picking up their bad habits   and you never know tomorrow you may wear a cross \nbecause lots of them wear crosses or maybe have a   crush on having a tattoo on your arm and this is \nnot at all permissible for Muslims to waste their   time watching such people who are not related to \nIslam and most likely they're disbelievers even   if they're Muslims they are worthless they \nhave no value to Islam or to the Muslims we   have to value our life our time much more than we \nwhat what we're doing at the moment Alano's best"
