  "transcript": "jawad from emirates uh sheikh i just have a question about the cap yes so just recently alhamdulillah i've been practicing and you know before i was born into a muslim family but before you know i didn't really pay the cash because i was never really you know practicing um it's been like 10 plus years i'm wondering should i pay the cap like as soon as possible because i found my money became uh over the tab i think it's called yes so i'm wondering should i pay it as soon as possible and then if so how do i pay for the past years if i pay for them these amounts of zakat is a debt because it's allah's right in the wealth he has bestowed upon you so this is a debt to allah now if you haven't paid zakat for 10 years you have to estimate how much you are overdue how much you have to give to allah azzawajal so that you can calculate it and give it out the sooner the better because this is a debt that was already overdue you should have paid it 10 years ago so if you don't have the amount to pay it all off at the same time then you have to do it to the best of your ability and allah azza knows best"
