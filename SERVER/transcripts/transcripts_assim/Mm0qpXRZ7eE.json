  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] [Music] all [Applause] [Music] [Applause] alhamdulillah the Quran is the word of Allah this is from Allah the almighty nothing in it not even a single letter is from other than Allah the almighty now in order for us to understand the Quran it is not something that one can do without thoroughly pondering upon it Allah says in the Quran this is a book which we have sent down to you full of blessings that they may ponder over its verses and that man of understanding may remember so we know that it is blessed and blessing comes only from Allah he is the source of blessings and this book is blessed because it is from Allah and the blessing is displayed when you recite it you can see the blessing in your life you can see the blessing in the Tranquility you find in your heart you can see the blessings of the Quran and the peace you enjoy in life but it was revealed so that the men would Ponder upon these verses and how would I Ponder well this is the essence of the science known asran means in simple English explaining the Quran and one would say do I have to have someone explain the Quran to me and the answer is yes because this is from Allah the almighty in general terms everyone can understand it so versus is like do not approach fornication anyone on the street when I tell him this he says okay illegal sexual acts are forbidden in Islam when Allah says that gambling and intoxicant Etc are all the works of Shan of Satan so stay away refrain from it anyone on the streets even if he's not a rocket scientist even if he's a Layman or even an literate would listen to it and say okay it's prohibited for Muslims to gamble and to consume intoxicants when Allah says worship Him and do not associate others with him anyone would know that if you say that Jesus is the son of God or he's one out of three then he knows that this is associating others with God this is sh so we believe in the Quran however there are some technical aspects that need Scholars to explain and that is why Allah says ask those of remembrance those of knowledge if you do not know so you have to ask the prophet told us in so many places that you have to ask therefore the science of tap is one of the greatest Sciences of Islam and Sciences of Islam are divided into two types types that are known as Sciences of the tools or the equipment and what is that are we into mechanics no see to understand Islam there are auxiliary supplementary sciences that are not studied for their own sake that would draw you closer to Allah but rather to help you understand what draws you closer to Allah for example Arabic language if a student studies Arabic is he studying something that is leading him to Jenna answer is no we have Jews and Christians studying Arabic it would not lead them to Jenna definitely if you study the science of Taj of how to recite the Quran and how to say the and the and the different aspects of again this is not meant for itself but it helps to perfect your recitation of the Quran the grammatical and the Linguistics of Arabic again this helps but it is not intended for itself the commentary the explanation of the Quran Quran this is meant for itself it is a science that leads you straight to Allah why is that because it studies the meanings of the Quran what is not so clear to the people and what is meant by its verses it studies the rulings of the Quran what is halal and what is Haram it explains what happened to the previous generations and it is giving you the Glad Tidings of what awaits you in paradise and it threatens the disbelievers of what awaits them in Hellfire it is a description of Allah the almighty how would we know Allah the almighty if it weren't for this Noble Quran Allah Asel is describing himself to us in the Quran so we know that he is glor glorified the almighty that he is praiseworthy that he is allseeing all hearing we know that he is over his throne on the seventh heaven over Paradise we know that he is the most high the exalted nothing is over him the Almighty we know that he is so powerful and so great all of this we find in the Quran so the science of tap is the most of all Sciences in elevation and priority Allah Asel has told us I've revealed the Quran for you to ponder upon the verses so your first priority is to know what the Quran is and it also gives you a lot of confidence when you recite the Quran and try to implement it because just simply the recitation of the Quran and pondering upon it is not something to be praised if you're not going to implement it so someone who recites the Quran someone who understands the Quran but still involves in riba uses interest money usually and he fornicates and he consumes intoxicants someone who recites the Quran and knows the of each and every Ayah but he still lies He Cheats he back bites he does cruel things and evil things then this is not sufficient so the science of gives you the meanings it leads you to the way but you have to walk the talk and you have to implement this in your life and that is why the companions of the Prophet Alat as was narrated by their students they said that they used to tell us that we as the companions of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam used to learn 10 verses of the Quran and would not go to the following 10 until we understand the meaning of these 10 verses Implement them in our lives and have strong conviction in them then we move on to learning the the following 10 verses and that is why it was reported that abdah Omar may Allah be pleased with him one of the great Scholars of the companions he memorized and perfected chapter 2 Surah Bak in eight years and this is astonishing because people can memorize the Surah in let's say couple of weeks but he took eight years because he pondered upon each and every verse and he implemented that in his life so it's not the knowledge that is sufficient it is what you do with that knowledge because this is what you will be held accountable for on the day of judgment and Abdullah Mas may Allah be pleased with him said to one of his companions today you are among a lot of knowledgeable people and few that recite the Quran few kis but soon you will see a time where you have few knowledgeable people few Scholars and plenty of kis and this is a fact so now if you look at what we have today we have few Scholars and a lot of kis beautiful recitations beautiful ways of leading the T Etc however when you look in depth you would find that they're not implementing it they're not walking the talk one minute he's a beautiful Kari reciting the Quran the second minute with a musical band and singing and chanting and what kind of Quran is this you carry in your chest so what said is totally correct and we have to go back to square one in order for us to get the benefit and to get the most of this beautiful and glorious Quran we have a short break stay tuned and we'll be right back assalamu alaykum and welcome back so when we look at the different texts the different hadiths we get an understanding of what we should do a man once said to Abdullah may Allah be pleased with him he said I recite Al in one and abdah told him that you do this as if you reading poetry no this is not the way it should be done the prophet has warned usat from people reciting the Quran it does not exceed their throats but what's beneficial from reciting the Quran is what remains in the heart and one benefits of it so going back to the previous issue what is most important to recite as many as you can from the Quran or to ponder upon the verses well Allah has revealed the Quran to be pondered upon yet reciting it without pondering also is rewardable but Scholars made a comparison and they said that if you Ponder upon the Quran as if you have precious Jewel and you give it for the sake of Allah and if you recite many verses of the Quran without pondering as if you have some silver and gold coins and you give it for the sake of Allah so the coins are a lot but the value of that single jewel is more precious and more valuable and that is why we have to try and combine the two we have to try and recite as much as we can but still have few verses to ponder upon now Abdullah Mas may Allah be pleased with him and we always mention his name simply because he was known to be among the four that the Prophet Alam instructed us to take the Quran from so abdah the prophet called him he was so knowledgeable in the Quran to the extent that the prophet no matter where or when the Quran was revealed to him Abdullah Mas knew that and he said I took so many verses straight from the mouth of the Prophet Alam I took so many suras and there is no single Ayah or verse in the Quran that was revealed except I would know when it was revealed and what is the reason it was revealed for and that is why his knowledge of the Quran is so great may Allah be pleased with him he says that do not recite and spread the Quran as if you're doing with the bad dates so when you have good dates and bad dates you usually spread them around so that you can collect the good one and leave the bad one away he's saying that don't do this with the Quran and you have to avoid reciting it as you're reciting poetry you have to stop chanting like as if you are reading poetry without pondering upon it you have to ponder upon its Miracles you have to move people's hearts with the Quran and you should not only care about the last part of the Surah so for example if the Imam says in the beginning then I know the Surah so I know exactly when it's going to end and I know with the Salah is going to be long or short now this means that I'm not concentrating on the Salah rather I'm anticipating when it's over and this shows you that I do not have any taste for the Quran and there's no pondering upon the verses what should happen is I should concentrate and focus on every single verse so that my heart would benefit from it and when I hear the fa being recited I benefit from it when I say ald or when I hear it I know that all praise is due to Allah the lord of the Dominion subhana so my heart is filled with it not alh just tried to get it over with and the prophet has warned us not to be like the theit or the as they known they are a sect they are a cult that pretend to be Muslims they pretend to have good intention but they do devastating things that are totally against Islam nowadays we know the Kish to be the extremist those who are terrorists they blow up people they would overthrow governments they would give to anyone who does not follow their methodology the prophet told us that they will come at the end of time and they'll recite the Quran but it would not exceed their throats so they would not benefit it's just sounds and mumbling that they're doing but it has no benefit or no value to or to the people and the prophet told us that they leave Islam as fast as an arrow penetrates a game and it goes away from it and they kill the people of Islam and they leave the people of idol worshippers they claim to be Muslims but they're killing Muslims so their claim is greatly challenged and that is why reciting the Quran by itself is not sufficient you have to ponder you have to know what your Lord wants from you so that you would benefit the most and Implement what Allah Asel tells you to do this and if you look at how the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam used to recite the Quran you would understand the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam moral conduct was the Quran as mother AA tells us and this means that he pondered upon every single Ayah and he's the only one who understands exactly what Allah meant by each and every Ayah because it was revealed to him H may Allah be pleased with him and with his father he said I saw the prophet Alam once and he wanted to pray night prayer so I stood next to him and I said I'll pray with him night prayer he started beginning to recite from chapter 2 Al bak and this is the longest Surah in the Quran so I said to myself he's going to recite 100 verses of it and then that would be a ra a unit but the prophet continued until he finished it and then he began with Surah chapter 4 until he finished it and then he began with chapter three Al Iman until he finished it three of the longest suras of the Quran in one raak not only that H says whenever the prophet Alam recited these three suras he was slow in reciting it pondering upon it whenever he passed by a a verse that has praising of Allah and glorification of Allah used to glorify Allah and whenever he passed by a verse that encouraged people to ask Allah for his grace and favor and mercy he would ask Allah for his paradise and his mercy and whenever he passed by an Ayah of torment and Punishment he would seek refuge in Allah from such torment and Punishment and this is how the prophet used to deal with the word of Allah the almighty and this is logical if you have a book in medicine or in engineering you would definitely expect the professor to explain it to you because not everyone is capable of going through it and understanding it cover to cover and that is why the role of the scholars is to explain to interpret to comment on these beautiful verses of the Glorious Quran so that they would draw the people closer to Allah the almighty and to explain what is not understood by them and to make it clear and one would say why would we need this if the Quran was revealed for all Humanity well that's a good question you need this because Allah has created people different in their intellect and in their understanding you would not expect a rocket scientist to be a neurosurgeon because he has his field and that person has his own field you cannot expect a dentist to be an expert in car repairs or a mechanic to be an expert in tooth repair for example each one Allah has given him the knowledge that is suitable to his intellect and understanding and that is why this Noble Quran this glorious Quran has to be studied thoroughly has to be made easy for people to understand and for people to ponder upon and it is the number one priority on any student of knowledge list it would be unfortunate to see a student of knowledge who's knowledgeable in Hadith who's knowledgeable in who's knowledgeable in different Sciences of Islam but when it comes to when it comes to explaining the verses of the Quran he has zero knowledge you cannot get closer to Allah without understanding the book of Allah and the more you study it the more Allah would open doors closed doors for you that you thought would never get opened the more you Ponder upon it the more you devote time to it a lot of knowledge in other Sciences in Arabic in in in in in every single part of the different Islamic Sciences they all originate and they all go back to this Noble and glorious Quran now this is what we will do inshallah in future segments of this program we will try our level best to have an understanding of this Noble Quran yet it's not going to be easy and I don't claim to be qualified to do this but I'll try my level best so that we would try and strive to get closer to Allah Asel and by doing that we may with his grace and mercy be entitled to be admitted to Paradise this is all the time we have until we meet next time [Music] [Music] for for [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]"
