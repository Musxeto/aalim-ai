  "transcript": "she said what do we do about a husband who doesn't pray he hasn't been praying for 13 years of the 14 years that he's been a Muslim um what's the advice to her well actually there isn't much to advise her except by reading the Hadith of the prophet and this Hadith is in Muslim which is the authentic after the Quran the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam says that between a man and disbelief is prayer and Abu daud added to that whoever abandons prayer is not a Muslim so this is the criteria that we judge people by or with if he is not praying if he does not pray at all then we cannot label him as a person that pray then you have to immediately separate from this man he cannot be your husband and the contract the marriage contract is void because he's not a Muslim now it's up to you that you may give him a last warning but from today it's forbidden for you to have any intimate relationship he's a stranger to you because now you know that he's not a practicing Muslim hence he is not your husband you may give him a warning for a day or two or a week depending on your circumstances but he must not get close to you and if he insists then you have to separate separate from him and ask for divorce if you are in a Muslim country you may uh uh relay this to the Islamic uh uh court and they will separate you from him"
