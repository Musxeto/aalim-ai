  "transcript": "Pyle says what does Islam say about lucid dreaming and lucid dreaming when I googled it found out that people claim it's a type of a dream that you have control over and this is like saying is being tall and short at the same time this is not possible how can you have control over your dreams we know that once you are asleep you are unconscious you are gone from this world you don't know what's happening and you have no control over your dreams yeah in science fiction movies maybe yes you can go into a dream and do things and change the future bla bla bla but this is nonsense either you are asleep or you are awake and I don't know what the psychologist or the psychiatrist may say because this is not my field but it's something that is logical even if they say the opposite with all due respect this is logic this is not religion so either you're asleep and you have no control over yourself the Prophet said Alice a lot Sam the pen that is of accountability has been lifted from a person who's asleep until he wakes up so whatever you do while asleep you're not accountable you're fasting and you have nocturnal emission and you wake up and you find that you had a wet dream does it nullify your fasting no there's no accountability upon you you went to bed and slept and woke up after sunrise you mists fudger prayer am i sinful no because that was asleep so either you are asleep and what you're seeing is a dream and lucid or unloose it you have no control over that tree you have no control on what things of how things progress or you're not asleep you're awake and in this case you are daydreaming you are fantasizing this is something within your control so you say okay I'm riding a red Ferrari and then I take the top off and then I accelerate and I drag race and I do this you're you're awake they said no no no let's not have a thread I'd like to do tried one that is white you change it so this is not dreaming this is fantasizing maybe it's a form of hallucination whatever you have control over but you're not asleep and Allah knows best"
