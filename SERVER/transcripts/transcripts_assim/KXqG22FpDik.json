  "title": "What is the meaning of the Arabic term “SAMA” sky, heaven, earth, or height, used in the Quran?￼",
  "transcript": "Madina from Germany. Assalamu Alaikum. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Okay, so my question is, there's like this verse, it's I think in Surah like 51 and verse 47, and there's like the word Sama and people say that this verse is like, it's like a wonder in Islam because it's like talking about the expansion of the universe, but like some people say that this Sama can be like translated in a different way and it's just like the way that people like try to interpret the word, so yeah I just want to ask about like Sama and like the context and why it can be universal or something else. The word As-Sama may have a number of meanings, and this is the beauty of Arabic language. The verse you're referring to - and the heavens, the skies, the seven layers of it, we have, that is Allah, we have built it with strength, bi-aydin, this is referring to strength, -, and we will expand it, which means that it's ever being expanded and growing, and this is the universe, these are the galaxies, the heavens, and whatever you want to call them. So here, -  it refers to the heavens, the skies. Now in other verses, for example, - , in the same verse, in the same surah, previous ayahs, in the beginning, Allah said -  Here, As-Samaa refers to al-Uloo, as in the verse, -  Are you in safety that the one over the heavens, -, not inside of it, because nothing can incubate Allah Azza wa Jal, the Almighty, rather As-Samaa here means in the height. So are you in safety that the one over and upon the heights would not concave the ground and destroy it so that you would fall into an earth pit? So this or these are two meanings of As-Samaa. Either heavens and earth, -  this is what everybody knows, or As-Samaa which means the height, al-Uloo, which refers to Allah Azza wa Jal being on top of everything and nothing is over Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala and Allah does not need anything to be on top of, but He is the all exalted and the all high, and I hope this answers your question."
