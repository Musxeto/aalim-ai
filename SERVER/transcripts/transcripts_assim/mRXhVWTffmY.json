  "title": "Overwhelmed by voluntary acts, ppl say I am making deen difficult, is taking a break sinful or kufr?",
  "transcript": "Maisha from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi So Sheikh, sometimes I feel overburdened in doing voluntary acts. Even though I know whatever we do is still not enough, we must do more. But whenever I feel I will skip some of them and then I fear maybe I am committing a kufr of stubbornness or maybe I am sinful. And everyone says I am taking deen in a very difficult way because of whispers regarding everything. So if I intend to have a break sometimes in voluntary or sunnah acts and start over again after a few days, will it be sinful for such specific intention or not? No, it's not sinful at all even if you quit doing this voluntary sunnah act forever. There is no sin in that. Insisting that there is a sin or you are committing kufr is by itself a major sin that may lead you to kufr. Because a sunnah by definition is if you do it, you are rewarded. If you skip it, there is no sin on you, none whatsoever. No matter what the people are telling you is the truth. But shaytan doesn't want you to hear this. Shaytan is enjoying seeing you drown in this ocean of whispers and OCD and extremism. And soon you will drown and die. Literally. And he is happy, you are making him very happy because you are a good student of his. Either quit and save yourself or face the consequences."
