  "transcript": "he says I have a question that how can we define modesty known in Arabic as haya as the misconception is in the minds of people that modesty is all about just covering the entire body through wearing the hijab or the parda so give us in detail the authentic concept of modesty this brother Muhammad requires a lecture and hamdulillah I had already given such lectures in the past you'll find that on YouTube also in Ramadan if I am not mistaken in our program called our values there was a segment on this topic and haya modesty or bashfulness is a feeling that either Allah grants you as a favour and blessing from him to practice it or you train yourself into being a person of bashfulness so it can be either one and it refrains you it handles you it stops you it prevents you from doing anything that may tarnish your reputation anything that may draw criticism unjustly and unfairly to you anything that may be a reason of punishment on the day of judgment and brother Mohammed was referring to women in jail but bashfulness is not only for women it is a characteristic of our religion the Prophet said Ali is awesome for every religion there is a moral conduct that stands out and the moral conduct of Islam that Islam is known for is bashfulness al hiya and this is exactly what happened when our fathers our parents Adam and Hawwa and Eve ate from the forbidden tree they saw their private parts and it was revealed to them after it was concealed so they rushed to cover their IRA with the tree leaves and this is why they descended to earth because of that sin of eating from the forbidden tree the problem is that if you look at the primitive inhabitants of the jungles and those sophisticated civilized people living in the capitals of the world in New York and London in Milan those who walk on the catwalk as they call it you'll find that the common denominator between both of these primitives and those sophisticated civilized people is nudity is the lack of bashfulness they don't have any shame they don't have any modesty so this is why they fight nicob they fight a job they oppress Muslim women who abide by it if you strip naked this is okay this is beautiful everybody enjoys it but if you were to be modest and bashful this is totally out of the question and in Islam it is not only what you wear that defines you it is a great part of your identity as a Muslim but it is also your way of behaving and talking the way you are present in the community so a woman wearing niqab wearing full hijab but she posts her video clips snapshots snap shots and pictures of immodest things even if with her husband this is contradicting with hiya a woman's identity is in her bashfulness Islam is the only religion that protects women that honors their bashfulness and their modesty through various measures that must be followed allow social orders women to wear the hijab the full hijab to protect women from men looking at her allah azza wajal protects women even from an irresponsible word that may slander her or may tarnish her reputation so anyone who says and such an irresponsible slandering word would be flogged by 80 lashes unless he brings four male Muslim witnesses to testify that she committed fornication or adultery Islam protects a Muslim woman and the non-muslim women as well from even any sort of physical contact I cannot shake hands with someone who's not lawful for me though people think that shaking hands is okay it's a sign of respect yes but not with the opposite gender and this doesn't end so if you go to London Europe shaking hands is common if you don't they're insulted who cares if I go to Spain kissing on the cheek is common and if I don't this this is insult what is the limit Islam puts the limit protection of the man and of the woman mixing with your cousins with your nan Muharram relatives is prohibited in Islam to safeguard the women and the men in the community let alone mixing freely with the opposite gender who are not related to you a woman is prohibited from leaving the house wearing perfume and it's a major sin so that she would not lure and seduce other men when she they find her scent it is even prohibited for a woman to wear an anklet that makes a sound so that when she walks people or men may listen to that sound and Shaitaan may throw something in their hearts about this woman how beautiful she is how the anklet may look how her foot is chicken is there is none prohibits a woman from softening her voice when speaking to the opposite gender allah azza says if you fear allah then do not be soft in speech to men lest he in whose heart is diseased should desire covet but speak with appropriate speech so all of this shows you that islam highly regards bashfulness yet unfortunately the enemies of islam have noticed this they have learned this and they know for certain that you cannot defeat Islam until you corrupt half of the society and that is corrupting women and this is what they're doing and striving to do in all Muslim countries the call of freeing women empowering women that they are equal to men and we know the consequences of such acts and we can see that clearly in Muslim and non-muslim countries because they went against the law of allah azza wajal and the consequences are crystal clear may allah azza shall protect all muslims from such things"
