  "transcript": "Adam from Ireland. I have an issue. I washed my clothes. One of the clothes had a mask on it. It has a mask. When I took it out of the machine, I didn't really realize until the clothes were dried and I put them on. Other clothes were in there being washed. Since the mask didn't appear, it didn't go away. Are the other clothes nudges or is it just the clothes that had the mask nudges? The answer is no. Only the clothes that contained the mask of impurity, whether it's feces or something, and you can tell the mask is there, is impure. The rest of the clothes are pure because by default they were washed and you cannot see any traces of impurity on them and Allah knows best. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
