  "title": "Is it correct to stop eating & drinking 5-10 mins before Fajr (IMSAK)? Assim al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "but from bangladesh sheikh my question is in some countries there is a time yani five or ten minutes before fajr time which they say is the time of ismak when the people usually start fasting and stop eating and drinking is it correct sheikh jazakov what is that first of all it's not called uh ishmak it's called sac and imsac means to refrain and they give a buffer zone of 15 minutes before the adana fajr saying that you have to stop eating and drinking this is an innovation there's nothing as such in islam you are entitled and allowed to eat and drink until the time of break of dawn until the then says allahu akbar so there is no point in stopping to eat two minutes or three minutes earlier not only that you can keep on eating even and you can keep on drinking even if you hold the glass in your hand so as i'm holding the glass in my hand and then it's cold i can still drink drink and sip from it because the hadith says do not put it down until you're satisfied from it if that is cold and this some scholars say is exclusively for drinking while holding the glass in your hand not rushing to the kitchen and opening the fridge and taking it out while that is coming that is not the case and allah's best you"
