  "transcript": "allum you mentioned about zaka what about in Zak Zak example I did not give or performed uh is My fasting accept yes this is a another misconception that a lot of the Muslims uh believe they think that Zak is a factor that validates their fasting so whoever fasts the month of Ramadan if he does not pay zakat his fasting is not accepted and this is wrong Zak is a form of worship separate from fasting if you fast and you don't pay zakat you're sinful but your fasting is correct and if you don't fast and you pay zakat your zakat is accepted but you are extremely sinful for ES skipping one of the pillars of Islam and to hope this um answers the question"
