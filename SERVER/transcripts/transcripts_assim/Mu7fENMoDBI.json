  "title": "ðŸ†• Is Athaan & Iqama mandatory? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "I hope you have brother Saad from India. If I am praying in jama'at as an imam with my cousins without the adhan, is the prayer valid and is it a must that the adhan should be loud or someone should be there to hear it? Is it permissible for me to give the adhan as if I am a Muslim? The adhan is not a prerequisite for the validity of your prayer. The adhan and the iqama. So if a person starts to pray dhuhr without adhan or iqama, the prayer is valid. The adhan is highly recommended if there are other people who would hear you and if already the people have masjids and the adhan was called. So if you call the adhan so the others in the house or in the vicinity or the workplace would hear you, that's fine. But if there is no Muslim and no masjid, then the most authentic opinion is that the adhan is mandatory for you to give. The iqama is highly recommended, but it's not mandatory and it has no impact on the validity of your prayer and Allah azza wa jal knows best."
