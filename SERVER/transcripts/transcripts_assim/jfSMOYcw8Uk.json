  "transcript": "Abdul Qadir from UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh There is a friend of mine that says when we are sick or we have evil eye or envy, so we go to a specific Sheikh and going to that specific Sheikh, Allah will only cure us by going to that specific Sheikh I said to him that Akhi that is committing kufr am I right Sheikh or not and he says and replied to me, so people go to doctors, why they go to doctors when they are sick, it's like that so he says that that Sheikh has barakah and Allah gave him barakah so reading Quran to you by that Sheikh Allah will cure you, so what's the ruling of that Sheikh? It is not permissible, it is not kufr rather it is shirk to believe that only going to a specific Sheikh to recite Quran or anything else only going to him would cure you, this is shirk there is no doubt in that whether it is a major shirk or minor shirk depending on the intention of the individual no one in his right mind would say that going to the doctors we go to the doctors not believing that they have the ability to cure our illnesses, rather they may direct us to a medication or procedure that Allah Azza wa Jal would put shifa and recovery and healing in it not that this doctor does that, it's a scientific thing that we go to have as a means, as a way while connecting our hearts 100% to Allah isolating the recovery and the healing process in an individual doctor and no one else could heal you or cure your illness other than him, this is shirk, may Allah protect us."
