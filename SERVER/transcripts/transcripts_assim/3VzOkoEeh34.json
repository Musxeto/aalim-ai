  "transcript": "Nazli from Azerbaijan Nazli Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu My grandparents live in a village and they slaughter animals but they don't they are not praying and I'm not sure about their Aqeedah so can we that meet? Can you what? Can we eat it? Who is making the Dhabiha? No, I say that my grandparents they are not performing Salah and I'm not sure about their Aqeedah but they slaughter animals and can we eat that? They slaughter it themselves or they give the money to the butcher? No, they make it themselves. Okay, if you don't know about their Aqeedah and they say they're Muslims and you don't label them as Kafir, they may pray when you don't see them, they may pray at the end of the day, they may pray when you're out, so as long as they say they're Muslims you can eat from their slaughtering the animals that they slaughter without any problem. you"
