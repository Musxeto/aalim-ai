  "transcript": "uh Muhammad from Kuwait's first question was about his son his son like most of the new generation now they are influenced greatly by hip hop singers by uh movies by the Western culture which is the new form of invasion so he feels inferior he feels weak he doesn't know anything about Islam he doesn't know probably except Al F maybe and uh if you tell him do you know a he would not uh uh probably know it by heart so how would he feel uh the pride and the dignity among his peers is by doing something that no other one uh would probably do so he pierced his ear to wear an earring and most likely it's one ear only not both ears maybe next year he would do tattoos on his body unfortunately may Allah protect him and guide him so uh Muhammad is asking is this permissible the answer is no the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam cursed The Men Who imitate women and curse the women who imitate men and the prophet told us those who imitate the disbelievers or those who dis who imitate a people would be among them so Muhammad your son is one of two either he's imitating women or he's imitating kufar and I I very much doubt that if you look at any of the scholars of Islam of the D of the judges of the imams of the Masjid you would find anyone piercing his ear no one does this except the cfir and even the bad sinful Muslims don't do this generally speaking so he is in great danger he should repent to Allah Asel and stop what he's doing and to be proud of his Islam before it is soon without him realizing he may think of other religions to be better than Islam"
