  "transcript": "says can someone ask if a I accidentally put the cross symbol instead of the plus sign on my copy book which a non-muslim can see and I don't erase it as soon as possible Amaya kafir first of all first of all we have to identify that not every cross symbol symbolizes a cross that the Christians worship so if this is or if this was not the case we would have not used the plus sign in calculating things we would not have used the first aid kit because it contains a cross symbol and so many other things and therefore a normal a normal Plus or a cross that does not signify anything does not refer to the Christian cross even if it does resemble the Christian cross where the vertical line is longer than the horizontal line if you had this done by mistake on a book or anywhere else unintentionally without the intention of worshiping it or glorifying it there is no cover in that and I always tell the people if you go to your next door neighbor and he's a Christian and you give him a piece of paper that has and you ask him politely to read it and he does and he hands that paper back to you has he become a Muslim the answer is of course not why he just read the shahada because he did not have the conviction if he did not have the conviction then he's not a Muslim likewise when you wrote or drew that symbol did you have the conviction of glorifying it praising it worshiping it as a symbol of Christianity that there is no in this case there is no cover in that and Allah Knows Best"
