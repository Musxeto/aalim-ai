  "title": "Backbiting in Islam and Its Punishment Gheebah",
  "transcript": "What is considered as backbiting and what is the punishment? As for the punishment, there is a hadith that such people would be tormented in their graves as in the hadith wherein the Prophet ﷺ passed by two graves and he said they're being punished over something that's not so big, by Allah it is big, meaning that they thought it was a negligible thing and that it should not impact their livelihood but they did not realize it was a major sin. One of them used to not clear himself from the ricochet of his urine. So he used to pray with najasa all over his body and clothes. The other one used to walk through gossiping between people to destroy their relationship. In another narration, he used to backbite people. So this is the torment in the grave. In another hadith, they used to… the Prophet saw people, Alayhis Salatu Wassalam, in their graves being with long nails of copper and they are scratching their faces and bodies, if I'm not mistaken, and this was about those who slander people and they backbite them as well. What is considered backbiting? The Prophet, Alayhis Salatu Wassalam, explained that in an authentic hadith. He said, if you mention your brother with something he dislikes to be mentioned about him, you've backbitten him. And if you make up something that's not in him and you mention it in his absence, you have slandered him or committed buhtan, which is a combination between backbiting and lying. So things that people don't like others to discuss about them, which are negatives, not positive. Maybe someone hates people talking about their generosity, yet we speak and this guy is so generous, he gives in the cause of Allah, this is not backbiting. Backbiting is mentioning something that, generally speaking, a person is offended when faced with it. So he's stingy, he's fat, he's short, he beats his wife, he's… though these are true things, but he hates it when people mention it and there's no legitimate cause for doing so, and this is backbiting, and Allah Azzawajal knows best."
