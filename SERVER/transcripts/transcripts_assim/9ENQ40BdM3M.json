  "title": "How to pray the Eclipse Prayer",
  "transcript": "The eclipse prayer is a unique prayer that is formed of two rak'ahs, like Fajr, but instead of having two ruku' and four prostrations, it has four ruku' and four prostrations. So each unit, you read the Fatiha and the Surah and you bow, and then you rise from bowing, and you recite the Fatiha and the Surah again, and then you bow, and then you rise up, and then you make your two sujood, and then you stand up for the second unit and do the same. So it's a unique format for a prayer, there's nothing similar to it at all in Islam. And it is sunnah to remind the people for the imam to come after the prayer is over and to remind people about Allah and to throw the fear of Allah in their hearts and to advise them to give charity, and Allah knows best."
