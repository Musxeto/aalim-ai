  "title": "Why didnt Allah address Satan directly to Prostrate to Adam as He addressed the Angels?Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "allah azza wajal is telling us in surat al-baqara and elsewhere that the instruction to prostrate to Adam was addressed to the angels and Allah tells us in Surat al-kahf chapter 18 that Satan was from the jinn so why didn't a las the WA JAL address Satan directly as he addressed the Angels to prostrate okay Andy the answer to that would probably be answered with another question if it is as you claim why didn't Satan object when Allah told him why didn't you prostrate to Adam why didn't he object by saying you didn't tell me you told the Angels he didn't say that he acknowledged that the command was given to him as well see in arabic will you address someone or a group of people you do not have to specifically say each and every one's name so when allah al told the angels and those who were with them and Satan knew that allah azza wajal has elevated his status and that he is in the company of angels and the address was to him as well so everyone there had to prostrate therefore your question is in mind in my point of view irrelevant because Satan did not object which means that he understood that he was as well addressed along with the Angels"
