  "transcript": "We have Armaan from India. Armaan Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh I am facing a lot of doubts and difficulties prayer and I know some of the mistakes because of this I take 15 to 20 minutes or even more to complete just four rakahs. I also struggle to pronounce. How long you've been a Muslim? How long have you been a Muslim? Sir I am born in a Muslim family. How old are you? Just 16 and maybe 17. How long you've been praying? I am being practiced since two years. So for two years you've been praying five times a day correct? Yes sir. What's your name? Armaan. How long did it take you to say your name? Just one second. Very good. How many times do you say your name per week? I don't know sir. Maybe five times four times if someone asks you about your name correct? Yes. Though you did not make a single mistake and you said it in a flash in a split of a second and you say it only listen listen listen this is what I do in my counseling sessions. Four times or five you say it a week and you did not make a mistake and you said it instantly. Two years. 360 days a year. Five times a day. This is almost 35,000 times you have prayed and making mistakes in pronouncing it. Doesn't this feel crazy? Satan is messing up with your head like this and you're entertaining it allowing it you believing him. Doesn't this tell you that you have a problem? The only problem is here. When you empower shaitan to mess up with your head and you believe him and you give him your control then nobody could help you. Man up. Stand on your feet. Put your foot down and say no I'm a Muslim. I've been praying for two years. No way I can make these mistakes. Children don't make these mistakes. Never repeat something you've said or a prayer and just move on and whatever the doubts and thoughts you're getting ignore them and you'll be fine inshallah."
