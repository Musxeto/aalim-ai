  "transcript": "[Music] the things that void your fasting Scholars say are seven so memorize them and then you don't have to worry about anything else because now you know that D seven nullifies your fasting nullify your fasting so anything else does not first of all eating and drinking so eating and drinking anything that goes into your stomach into your uh stomach through the mouth or through the nose then this nullifies your fasting even if you swallow a stone it nullifies your fasting secondly whatever takes the role of food and drink such as the IV if you have Gila for example that you can live for 3 4 days without eating and drinking just because of this uh IV is going into your veins so this nullifies your fasting and this means that if I take anti biotics if I take uh uh voline shots if I take insulin if I take penicillin anything that does not nourish me that does not take the role of eating and drinking this doesn't nullify your fasting so if someone says if uh uh uh I have to take vaccines does it affect my fasting no it doesn't I have to uh extract a tooth and the doctor gives me uh uh uh or anesthesia does it affect my fasting the answer is no thirdly vomiting intentionally I ate too much I have something going on I don't like it I put my finger or smell something and I vomit intentionally this voids My fasting if I ate too much and I feel Disturbed and all of a sudden without me helping it I'm throwing up I'm vomiting this is unintentional it doesn't affect your fasting fourthly cupping and this is an issue of dispute among Scholars so the most authentic opinion it's safer not to cup while fasting cing is having scratches and slashes on the back of your uh neck or on your shoulders and then extracting the rotten blood and it's a a form of healing and medication and it's good the prophet uh encouraged it but during fasting refrain from it because it's an issue of issue of dispute however uh uh taking samples of your blood for the hospital is totally permissible bleeding from your gum while the doctor the dentist is working this is does not affect your fasting try not to swallow it what else uh donating blood if it wears you down and it's a a pint or two if in this case make it after M and if you don't have uh the possibility to make it after M then do it and make up for that day fifthly ejaculation any person ejaculating while he's awake of course because this is different than nocturnal emission what you suffer or what you have of wet what they call wet dreams when when you jaal it while sleeping this doesn't affect your fasting at all but if you do it intentionally while awake by seeing at looking at something or thinking or masturbating this nullifies your fasting sixth is intercourse and this is the highest of all and we spoke about the experation in the beginning seventh is the blood of mensis or postnatal bleeding these two if there exist then the fast is void even if it's seconds before the aan of the M now if you look at toothpaste and look at these seven categories you will find that as long as it doesn't go into your throat you're in the clear [Music] oh [Music] [Music]"
