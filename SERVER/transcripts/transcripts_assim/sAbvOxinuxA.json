  "transcript": "foreign that the prophet used to say alaihis salah to assalam to inaugurate the prayer after takabira saying allahu akbar he used to read this beautiful dua ladies and gentlemen foreign i have turned my face sincerely towards he who has created the heavens and the earth and i'm not of those who associate others with allah indeed my prayer my sacrifice my life and my death are for allah lord of the the worlds no partner has he with this i'm commanded and i am of the muslims or i'm the first of the muslims oh allah you are the sovereign none has the right to be worshipped except you you are my lord and i am your servant i have wronged my own soul and have acknowledged my sin so forgive me all my sins for no one forgives sins except you guide me to the best of characters for none can guide to it other than you and deliver me from the worst of characters for none can deliver me from it other than you here i am in answer to your call happy to serve you all good is within your hands and evil does not stem from you i exist by your will and i will return to you blessed and high are you i seek your forgiveness and repent unto you what a beautiful long dua but seriously rarely you will find people saying it usually people say the first two lines now this dua again portrays being a slave and a servant of allah submitting your will over and over again to allah telling allah that you confess and that you adhere to the fact that he is your master he is your lord so you show all types of tawheed to him the almighty and then you confess of your sins and of your aggression and that no one forgives sins except him then you ask allah azzawajal to guide you to the best of characters now who would do this nowadays rarely you'll find people attributing whatever they are enjoying in life to allah i'm rich i'm powerful i'm strong i'm an athlete all of this because of my hard work of my training of my intellect of my long hours of studies of my connections rarely you will find people attributing every single thing in their lives to allah azza and this is something that we are in need of we need allah to guide us to the best of characters you can't be generous you can be kind merciful considerate compassionate without allah allowing you to not even the prophet alice of some can be that without allah allowing him to and this is in the quran it is only by the mercy of allah that you're soft to them otherwise had you been hard hearted or rude they would have gone away from you so even the prophet elizabeth needs allah subhanahu wa and this is what he is doing in the beginning of his prayer asking allah azza to guide him to the best of character asking allah azza to divert him away from the worst of evil characters stinginess grudges hatred enmity envy all of these are not befitting of a muslim and this is why the prophet always reiterates emphasizes on asking allah on begging allah to grant him this and then at the conclusion he acknowledges that all good comes from allah yet he glorifies allah azzawajal when he says that and evil does not stem from you does not come from you one would say this is not what we think and believe because there is evil there is satan allah created satan there are hardships there are crimes happening who created them allah there's no doubt in that there's no creator other than allah but what is meant in the hadith is that there is no pure evil coming from allah azza because allah does not create pure evil whatever evil is created we do not attribute it to allah though we know that allah is the creator of evil and good but there is no pure evil stemming from allah azza even the evil we see such as satan illnesses earthquakes volcanoes there is good in it without night you cannot appreciate day time without illness you cannot appreciate health so there is no pure evil for the sake of evil allah does not create that and it is not attributed to allah so i am as it is said blessed in high be you i seek your forgiveness i exist by your will and will return to you anabikawak total submission i am from you and to you i have no power on earth that would help me to do whatever i want if you don't guide me if you don't help me this is the attitude of a muslim and that's why muslims are not arrogant they don't have pride in themselves they're always down to earth people when they follow the quran and sunnah and this is why they are down to earth people because this is how they deal with their lord they bow only to him they prostrate only to him and they glorify only him the all mighty this is all the time we have until we meet next time i leave you if you're illa was foreign [Music] foreign"
