  "transcript": "saying that he saw a debate between a Sunni and a sh and I definitely ask the brothers and sisters not to engage in such debates because at the end of the day 100 points the good guys happen to refute 99% one% remains in your heart and this may corrupt your heart so why watch such uh uh debates aren't you in confidence of your religion then remain St your religion rather than watching people insulting your religion and waiting for someone to defend that however he says that the issue ofah of mut mut marriage which is in in a nutshell it was permitted in the beginning of Islam because the Muslims were in need for that and they did not have financial means and it was a win-win situation the prophet permitted itam I meet a girl I like her and I say listen i' marire you for one week for â‚¬500 and then after the week is over everything is over I don't have to give you any uh allowance you're divorced by default and and that is it at the beginning it was permissible and you have to look in the uh uh the environment the situation at that time everything was permissible all the idol worshippers and the Arabs there was adultery there were uh prostitution uh uh legitimized and BR and Etc so this was a in a sense a way of diverting from these Haram things into something that is between Hal andam and it was permitted by the prophet Alam later on the prophet banned it and that was on the seventh year of Hijra putting Omar's name in it may Allah be pleased with him is one of the Deviant ways of Shia Omar had nothing to do with it at the consensus of all the companions after the death of the Prophet Alam that it was permissible uh that is it was prohibited except forb Abbas at the beginning he used to permit it because he did not hear or learn that the prophet has forbidden itam but later on he went back on his fatwa and he went with the consensus and all the companions agreed on making it haram and now this Still Remains taking the Shia's opinion into consideration is worthless because they don't believe in our Quran they don't believe well the major maity of them do believe in our Quran because they don't read their books if they go a little bit to the level of student of knowledge and open alfi by the Kini and this is the most authentic book to them and they will find that it states that all of their imams say that the Quran you have is not what Allah revealed so you're mean telling me that the the only copy of the only book that is authentic and unaltered unchanged for 15 centuries is not authentic this is Blasphemous so we do not look at what they say because they are a small minority that sings out of the crowd and they do not have anything in common with us not even the books of Sunnah they don't reject all our books of Sunnah they slander all of our companions except six or seven like and and others only those they accept and Sal of course but Abu Abu Bak man all the righteous Companions of the Prophet Alat they all disregard them and discredit them and some of them even go to the further and say that they are disbelievers so don't watch these uh uh debates it only hardens your heart it throws doubts in your mind you have the Quran you have the Sunnah let everything else go but to come and look yeah they said this yeah 1,400 years ago the companions agreed upon it now you're going to reinvent the wheel and they say that the Quran says so and so you don't believe in the Quran that we say and you bring me and you quote me an Ayah you don't know Arabic and you say no it means so and so it doesn't mean so and so where did you get this oh our Imam 12 imams the 12th one is in a cave he went in a cave like uh uh 1300 years ago and he's still waiting until Allah tells him to come out he was a child when he went in and he has a river of milk and a river of honey mahab and yes only the the ayas the mulas know and communicate with him they have like I think SMS or BB and they're just chitchatting what what kind of religion is this we have the Quran we have the Sunnah don't go into this nonsense with all due respect"
