  "transcript": "Allah's blessings and favors upon us are endless Allah says in the Quran and of his signs is that he created for you from yourselves mates that you may find Tranquility in them and he placed between you affection and mercy indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought marriage can be a number of things it can be Allah's Paradise on Earth in a house filled with Tranquility compassion love and it can be a pit hole of hell where it's like a swamp without a bottom filled with problems disputes argument and it can be in between and most marriages are almost in between yet you will find that there are so many efforts wasted so many things put into it without any result it's like a body without a soul many marriages are a lost cause they are treating marriage as if it is a motel room with Benefits such as a restaurant and laundry and women on the other hand treat their spouses in such marriages as a moving mobile ATM this is all what it is such marriages no Tranquility no affection and no mercy now family disputes marital disputes usually are inevitable no marriage usually is free from it even with the great Scholars of Islam for example he says I married Allah and for 20 years we fought only once and I was the wrong Doer so she was a good woman for 20 but again even the marriage among Scholars imams you find that there would be some form of disagreement so if this is the nature of marriages how can we utilize it to the best what is the best thing to do to utilize such marriages so that we would avoid any possible conflict do you guys find any problem without you the ladies Maybe now to talk about this big issue you would probably need a workshop not a lecture because this is a story of a life that we're talking about so it involves so many aspects into it but if you look at most disputes I do a lot of marriage counseling alhamdulillah and this is something I find my I found myself in in the last few years that it is good to be able to resolve disputes not only marriage counseling but disputes when people differ they need someone external to come and say you're wrong and he's right and show you the logic because so many times you're blinded so when I look into such disputes I find that the origin of it is attributed to a number of factors one of them is human nature you find that sometimes you have chemistry with another person that you are so close to you'd like to spend your whole life with so you have a friend and you enjoy hanging out with you go places you're so close together but at the same time you may find people that you simply don't like there's no chemistry even if they are good to you even if they are people of knowledge but you don't feel comfortable to National stereo now I can't even see myself so by this yeah I have duat I have Scholars I know I hate their guts sorry we go to conferences together we sit together I don't like them I don't like their nature subhanallah and there are people Masha Allah we are best of friends as if we know one another for centuries this is human nature when you get married to someone you might find this it's like buying a watermelon the guy opens it for you it's red and sweet sometimes it's white and sour or or not tasty marriage is like this also some of the disputes are attributed to social effects so you come from a culture she comes from a different culture and this is why I'm not very supportive of Multicultural marriages or Intercultural marriages as they say because so many sisters who married a revert who's a good practicing brother find problems in their marriage why different culture nothing is wrong with the brother but his culture is different the woman is used to finding her husband coming and addressing her father as uncle or pops and mother auntie in their culture the rivers they call them my name how are you Abdullah what is this he's he's as young as his children he's calling him like this say it's a different issue of culture social effects among the reason of disputes which is highly attributed to is ignorance of sharia when the spouses don't have a reference a point of reference to judge when I when you were you and I have a dispute who should we turn to you say I go to the Civil Court say I go to Sharia Court say I go to my Guru no we have to have Foundation that would solve our problems if we were knowledgeable in Sharia you and I would go to and see whose right and who's wrong and the dispute is over also among the reasons for such disputes is misunderstanding and a big misunderstanding she's not married yet she's still misunderstanding of rights and obligations most disputes take place because I only see my rights and I'm always neglectful of my obligations so why aren't you doing this you're supposed to do this in that not looking in the mirror and seeing that I myself I'm not doing what I'm supposed to do now this is an Overlook if we want to go down and dissect it it will take us ages so I gathered few points here and there maybe it would not save your marriage inshallah your marriage is saved but it would help you improve your marriage among the reasons for trouble between the spouses lying or not being able to trust and this is a little bit controversial in Islam lying between the spouses is recommended seriously there's a Hadith the prophet said Allah I'm lying is prohibited except in three situations one of them lying to the spouse so this is recommended but you have to understand it in context not to openly take a rain check considering that lying is okay Scholars say lying in terms that would increase the love between the spouses is recommended your wife comes to you and I always give this example I don't know why but it sticks into my head she comes to you wearing a beautiful red dress and she says how do I look and you start laughing for half an hour Non-Stop and he said this is your grandchild's address it's so tight on you what is this you need at least to lose 35 kg what do you expect from her no you should lie you should say wallahi I don't know whether you're making the dress beautiful or the dress is making you beautiful to me I think that you are making the dress the dress is normal but you make it wow this is diplomacy this is halal lying men come out of the bathroom usually wrapping a towel around their waist and failing to see their toes for the past 20 years because of their belly and they flicks their muscles in front of the matter and and he says to his wife in a proud voice how might how do my muscles look she laughs for half an hour ended by divorce she she said what is this what what are you talking about what muscles are you talking about this is not right the right thing to say and the right lie is I don't know whether you're more handsome or Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 70s wow look look at this body wow just do it this is halal lying now the lies that happen in marriages and Destroy them they're not like this they're frequent Liars like frequent flyers we have frequent Liars who constantly lie they lie over everything so okay they lie when it comes to going out I have a shift I have work to do at the office while he's actually going to be with his friends or some of them even lie to go to their parents because of the pressure they get from their misses so they're so scared to say I'm going to my father or my mother I have things to do I have homework I have this and that some of them lie compulsively to hide their shortcomings they don't do their obligations so the only way to run away is to lie why didn't you bring the groceries up I had a flat tire I had this I wanted to go and see the doctor and how can you live like this okay now we have stereo so shall I reply any Replay that the whole thing again well I will not summarize anything I have so much material that it would take us to taraweeh and in in these type of lectures you cannot just say one two three and leave each one has an example something that Allah azzawajal shows you so tough luck and he tried to maintain your marriage don't get a divorce anyhow uh sometimes we lie when we are afraid of Confrontation so no one likes to be questioned and if I have a spouse that interrogates me on every single thing the easiest way to do is to lie if a woman is always asked by her husband about every little tiny things in the house she will eventually like and whenever there is lying compulsively in the marriage this destroys it I can't sit with someone I cannot trust she cannot live with someone she cannot trust marriage is built on trust and therefore if the bridges were destroyed between us it requires years to rebuild so I highly advise people not to lie confront your problems face them and don't run away from them some of the brothers say I need to get a man to get a second wife this is your right if you're man enough they lie they cheat they get married and five years later he comes to me and says Sheikh I told my wife yesterday that I am married to a second wife with two children and now she's seeking divorce what to do is your problem you should have said that from day one if you know you're man enough to run two houses to marriages to wives make it clear from day one hiding it this long you're putting yourself in trouble and then you're seeking advice for disputes is oppression from both sides an oppression can be caused by not knowing your obligations and your rights so as stated earlier when I always demand my rights you have to cook you have to clean you have to obey me you have to give me my rights you have to do whatever is necessary upon a wife to do but I don't provide her with a decent home or I force her to serve my family or I don't give her enough money or I don't give her quality time then there is an imbalance so this is oppression this is part of the from the husband's side is when he got when he has more than one wife and this is a serious offense to have more than one wife and not to be fair Allah said that if you are unable to be fair then only restrain yourself and restrict yourself only to one wife it is totally prohibited people who do not have a job get married again and they expect their first wife who is a working woman providing for her family to spend also on the second wife this is not logical this is it is part of the film that you make your wife work and you take her wealth in Saudi this is prevalent unfortunately men who have one wife and she's a working woman he demands that she pays the salary of the mate and of the driver and to contribute to the groceries what kind of a man is this who allows a woman to pay and provide for him the role of a man is to provide for their wives Allah says in the Quran men are guardian over women because Allah favored men over women and because men provide and spend over their women and not the opposite way so what is the solution for this problem to acknowledge that Allah azzawajal is all hearing and All-Seeing so whenever you feel like transgressing whenever you have the urge to oppress your spouse then always remember that Allah is watching and no one is treated unfairly by his side thirdly we have jealousy and jealousy can be positive and can be negative do you have full here do you have tamis you have this huh good in Saudi just like half an hour before Maghrib it is chaos and so much pact people are fighting you see a man or a male that I rephrase that you see a male in his fancy car parking in front of the shop having his wife go and buy because women get better treatment and they won't have to stand in line for too long but they will mix with men and the man is sitting in his air-conditioned car waiting for the food to come through his wife is this jealousy no jealousy can be positive and can be negative when it is according to Quran and Sunnah this is positive when you feel jealous if your woman says I'd like to go to the mall on my own said no I'll come with you I'll shop with you how is it possible that he goes to the mall or to the shop and asks the salesman for a discount come on give me a discount for me okay this is the price but what what's the price for me she speaks like this what is the jealousy no I have to be with you when she goes to a hospital and it's a male doctor you have to be with her oh no no you go with your mom go with your sister go with anyone this is positive jealousy to be with her negative jealousy is the one that destroys marriages when you keep on thinking I have tons of people asking me every month seriously through email about such jealousy share I married my wife she's a righteous practicing devote woman she's a good woman but I keep on having these Whispers that she had the past and I speak to her did you have boyfriends girlfriends did you have Affair did you have this and she doesn't tell so I don't know should I divorce her what kind of a man is this I got a counseling session a couple of weeks ago from a man and his wife together they're having the same problem she's suspecting him and she says I went through his phone email Facebook account I even made a false Facebook for myself and tried to seduce him is this part of the jealousy that Allah loves this destroys marriages not only that it can be jealousy without any foundation a man is jealous of his own children because his wife takes care of them a woman is jealous of her mother-in-law because her husband always loves her cooking and speaks highly of her and Cuddles her and kisses her she's what is this so this causes a lot of marriages to be In Harm's Way how to solve such disputes first of all by respecting the other learn to respect the feelings of others their privacy they have their own privacy so you respect that never ever look into your spouse's Private Affairs throughout my marriage I've never opened my wife's mobile phone ever she never did the same to me I don't know her email password I get people coming to me insisting Brothers calling me saying Sheikh I'm ordering my wife to give me her we use your name and password of the Facebook to look into it this is my right he said no it's not your right it's not your right to look into her uh emails or messages what is this she's not your slave she has her own personality her own friends her own connections you doubt your divorce her but such a life is not a real long-term marriage you have to be frank so you have doubts address these doubts but not something in the past what is in their past remains in the past if I had pre-marital relationships and then I repented and sought Allah's forgiveness and now I'm a practicing Muslim no one on earth has the right to question me I am sinful if I go and tell anyone on Earth that I did this and that in the past what's in the past remains in the past as long as Allah has concealed it do not expose yourself or Allah will hold you accountable even after repentance even after repentance you will pay because you exposed your sins we have to also look at the reasons of jealousy if you are not abiding by the Sharia laws and you allow your wife to mix and intermingle with the opposite gender of the Nan mahram so the in-laws they can sit freely as many communities do the in-laws the brother-in-law the sister-in-law they all sit for iftar they mix they maybe some of them wear the hijab but this is called free mixing and she sits with her brother-in-law the man married to her sister she treats him like a brother you treat the sister of your wife like a sister and you start to chit chat to laugh to do this she thinks shaytan comes I said this joke last week he didn't even smile and now my sister-in-law is saying the same joke and he's on the floor laughing with tears in his eyes what is this so it's not the joke it's someone who said it shaytan comes ah look he has feelings he has this and that the man as a man also has feelings what is this she's always complimenting my brother-in-law dress the way he talks the way he speaks his job he's traveling his gifts he's this is the jealousy that destroys the foundation of marriage among the things that would destroy marriages or cause problems in it not being kind see kindness is an essential element in life Allah is kind loves kindness in everything so when you don't have this kindness in marriage you have a problem what what is a proper way of display of lack of kindness in marriage stubbornness when both spouses are so stubborn each one holds on to his own opinion we cannot have a conversation I'm right and you're wrong end of pro end of story when there is rivalry if my wife thinks that she is equivalent to me yeah so we're all equal now you remember we're not equal imagine flying a plane with a pilot and a co-pilot and the co-pilot insists that we descend to ten thousand feet and the captain says no we have to remain on twenty thousand feet and they dispute what happens it will fall down it will break because there's only one captain that is allowed to fly to steer the ship to rule and command in the marriage so there is no rivalry here a lot of argument provoked for no reason so a simple command or a simple request from the wife turns into an interrogation and why why did you do this I remember you had done this and and it becomes argumentative and and life cannot go on like this Whenever there is incompatibility he's not educated and she is a PhD or holder he is from a poor family she is from a rich family there'd always be there'll always be this look of degrading or looking down at people and this destroys marriages so how to move on from this problem of not being kind you have to be kind you have to be tolerant you have to move on not every single thing I must have an answer to this is an Arabic called a tarafel in English the best translation is looking the other way when your wife says something that may hurt you pretend as you did not hear it and move on this is mentioned in the Quran when Allah azzawajal revealed to Muhammad our prophet about the secret he entrusted one of his wives and she revealed it so when he came to her he did not expose all what Allah has revealed part of it and concealed some when people the siblings of Yusuf went to him and they said if steals a brother of his stole before referring to Yusuf Allah says Yusuf he concealed it and he did not show them that he knows that they're lying one of the great leaders and rulers of all times liberated Jerusalem what did he do he was with his army division leaders discussing battle when two slaves were fighting one of them got angry took his shoe and threw it at the other one only to miss the other slave and it fell right next to Salah ayubi the great warrior what did he do he looked to the left and continued to speak that's it no harm done if we can manage to do this with our spouse not every single statement that comes out we make an interrogation we make a fuzz about it then we will have a lot of uh compatibility inshallah among the reasons and I have to I think wrap things up how much time you are out of 15 no no this is not entirely enough at all among the things that cause problems in marriages boredom being bored after we have a joke actually I have a joke and I have a very bad sense of humor but may Allah make it easy for my wife I always tell her that when I marry the first year she's the love of my life the first five years she's my cousin I treat her as as a cousin the following 10 years in marriage or 15 years we are man and wife after 20 years we are brothers and sisters after 30 years we become oh she becomes to me like a part of my body does not invalidate wudu and does not obligate Russian so sometimes if the marriage is too long you get a little bit bored you need to change what do you mean take a second wife no no no that's the wrong change you will devastate your life by doing this if not needed change meaning that you have to understand that the daily routine makes people bored it's the same thing she does every day cook wash the dishes wash the clothes iron clean the house then the cycle again tomorrow and the next week and the next year this is very bad so what to do insert change into your life in the easiest thing for example and I always tell the people this when was the last time you said to your wife out of the blue I love you rarely when was it the last time you texted her I miss you never why should I do this it's uh it cost like 15 fills for SMS this is too expensive no no she's not worth it no you're wrong change your life send her once every month a bottle of perfume every week buy her a red rose do something invited for one to one no children we're going uni quality time to have dinner at a restaurant it doesn't cost you anything but it breaks the daily routine and sometimes we have to not pretend that we are idle we have an uh a Persona we look in a certain way we would like to give the people impression that we are like we look with your spouse it shouldn't be like this you shouldn't be serious himself says I like for a man when he enters his home to be like a a little child playing around joking having fun why be Sheikh in your home imagine my wife comes to me and says awesome do this say Sheikh please first of all before you speak to me what is this no between the spouses it's a different thing you have to be used to be like a girl with you so that the routine is broken we tend to lose so many things down the line in our marriage because we take things for granted and this is wrong number six outside interference in short just to catch up with the rest of the material do not get your family's interference the the worst thing a man could do is to go to his mom and say mom she didn't cook she didn't do this for me she did what how would your mother feel she would be devastated this is my investment my son what is she doing now you go back home you make up you kiss her she kisses you you go to visit your mom the following day your mom will not forget that incident for five years and she will hate your wife for it you explained oh Mom I love her I cannot even live without her doesn't do doesn't work you made the Cardinal mistake the same thing if she goes to her mom and this is why usually men hate their mother-in-law because of this the the girl goes and speaks to her mom he did this he did that he made me cry the following day she's so happy with him the mother is not happy with what she sees because she thinks of him as an enemy don't let anything that happens under your roof come out no matter what unless kalas you want to divorce this is the last resort you have if needed go to someone you both Trust so again I'm advertising my my marital uh counseling seriously go to the Imam of the Masjid go to a person an elderly you trust like an uncle and you trust him and say uncle listen to us he will explain so many things and make life beautiful just by opening your eyes to some of it uh seven selfishness and this destroys marriages Men by Nature are selfish so we always want to come first our needs our desires our social activities and this is not a healthy marriage women tend to be selfish sometimes but not as much as the men because the men are controlling usually and we need to respect each other's rights and needs and we have to participate in good and in bad now in a nutshell I have only 15 points to reduce or to prevent marital disputes if we manage to apply them in our marriages there won't be any dispute with our wives but these are theoretical when you come to the ground and try to implement them it's almost difficult one first of all any dispute you have to add here to the fact that it takes place because of your sins any Calamity that falls upon you it is because of your sins and a dispute with the one you love is definitely a calamity Muhammad one of the great tabirin says I commit a sin and I see it clearly in the behavior of my right and in the behavior of my wife we are so overwhelmed with sins we don't know which one caused the drift we have so many sins and we have problems at office with the neighbor with the children with the wife with the parents with the in-laws with the relatives and kinship because we have so many sins was a righteous man he had one sin he can immediately related to what he sees two you have to live on Earth you have to be realistic don't live in your fantasy land marriage is not living on fantasy land so you have to be realistic you have to stop wanting to change the world your spouse will never change accept him as he is and hope for the best make Dua try to improve but to try and fix things against its nature this won't usually happen live with all the shortcomings that are possible and look for the best three learn how to apologize even if you're not wrong oh why would I do this most of the disputes that come to me the the one party one spouse says no I'm not going to apologize if he doesn't come and apologize I'm not going to forgive him and he says if she doesn't come and apologize I will not forgive them and the only one who's laughing is shaytan he is happy he's like okay guys don't forgive one another and the hell with you this is what he's doing so learn how to forgive because it is not winning the battle that counts it is winning the war and marriage is not a war but don't be short-sighted so the Hadith is crystal clear the prophet said should I tell you about your women in Paradise what are the characteristics characteristics of women of Paradise The Prophet says she is kind and loving she is bearing a lot of children she is a woman if oppressed who's the oppressor the husband she's a woman if oppressed she will go to her husband take his hand and says my hand in your hand by Allah I will not sleep until you are satisfied she's the one who's oppressed who's the one who's supposed to apologize the man but the prophet tells us this is the characteristic of a woman of Jannah now most women would say no way I'm not gonna apologize for him yeah this is difficult but this gender attaining Jannah is not easy it is something that needs a lot of work one of the best reasons to stop disputes in marriages and and reduce them is to suppress your anger says in the Quran those who spend freely whether in prosperity or in adversary adversity who this train anger and pardon all men for Allah loves those who do good a man came to the prophet Islam and said advise me he said don't become angry I get tons of phone calls my husband yesterday after an argument says I divorced you so does this count I said yes it counts she says but he was angry I said no one is happy with his wife and drinking cappuccino I love you but I divorce you every divorce happens when you're angry so what do you expect 99 of divorce cases come to me I was angry I didn't know what I was going to say I was this she provoked me she insulted me if you manage to suppress your anger for five minutes what would have happened I have a brother mashallah is practicing but he's wise he's masha'allah more wise than practicing not knowledgeable he says that I have a wife that breaks my glasses takes my mobile and hides it conceals my keys I can't leave the home if I try to open the door and leave she takes off her clothes and goes in the street and she says look at me look at me she's lunatic he says and I said mashallah how long you've been married he says 25 years you haven't divorced her yet I would have probably killed her what kind of a wife is this no no sir you don't know gave me the power to suppress my anger so I just don't say anything I let her speak insult curse my father curse my mother curse me curse everyone but after one hour she comes to me kisses my feet and cries at my feet saying that I am sorry I apologize I don't know what I have done I'm an animal I am this I am that and I'm sitting enjoying it for another two weeks like a king but then I get this cycle again suppress your anger you win my sisters or daughter suppress your anger you have him like a ring around your finger but once you confront rivalry no you said this you said that then you have a problem try to live and when you have a problem address that particular problem I have a sister I have her name here but I'm not going to disclose it she calls me every now and then and her husband calls me and the husband complains that Sheikh it's been five years I am like clock work everything I have to do and oblige to do I do it extra but every time she comes up with something I she doesn't like she opens old files 25 years ago you married me you did this your mother said this and you did my mother is dead and she brings the problems now what kind of a life is this what kind of a marriage no you have a problem with your husband you have a problem with your wife identify and address that particular problem and get it solved don't connect it and open different fronts you will definitely lose the battle and the war have one front focus on it solve the problem problem close call us do not participate other parties we've gone through that the best marriage is when you have one preferably both spouses being kind easy going tolerant patient this is the best marriage I make a mistake she says no problem next time don't do it I'm gonna watch you but she doesn't she makes a a mistake I'll I'll share with you a secret but it's not a secret everybody knows this I've been married for 35 years alhamdulillah almost 36 who's counting my wife is so old she was born in that previous century and she's a grandmother so don't even have any weird ideas so many times she cooks bad food after this long period of marriage I eat three four morsels and I says excellent food and I leave and she says you're lying the food is horrible the food is burnt the food is too salty I can't eat it why don't you come open and say that this is bad I said it's very simple I don't buy you jewelry I don't send you flowers I don't take you to codazur or to Dubai or to different places on vacation I'm not giving you a lavish life like so many of your cousins and relatives and Friends so at least I have to appreciate what you're doing for me so it's give and take if you are easy going you will have the happiest marriage possible don't put your rights in front of your face whenever you have communication neglecting your obligations and only looking at your rights is devastating for a marriage and what is more devastating for a marriage is to make something to be one of your rights when it's not it's not all right you magnify things so for example like you guys most of you joint family is a norm you have to get married and get your wife in your house to serve your parents and you think that this is god-given right and that she must serve your mother and your father and your siblings and your in-laws and cook and clean no it's not you're right it's not your right if she does it out of her own Goodwill you should cherish her and treat her like a jewel because Allah tells you to give her a separate home so when you magnify things and make them rights of yours when they're not you will have problems try to solve problems and not run away from them running away from problems do does not solve them it will remain so you have to have quality time sit down talk find a compromise what she is happy with what you're happy with and try to find a way out never be aggressive there are types especially men when they speak they start pointing fingers they start accusing others you did this you did that you know in in Britain and UK doing this is an insult in in in you know once he said in China they have a beautiful saying they say when you point at a person you're pointing one finger at him but you're pointing three fingers at yourself so always keep this in mind so don't be aggressive don't be insultive always ask maybe they have a reason for what they had done so you can give them an excuse instead of attacking and then end up apologizing sorry I didn't know I didn't know too many apologies would ruin it select the right time to speak sisters fail in doing this I come from work 8 hours 10 hours a horrible day my boss did not give me my increment nor my bonus nor my race the appraisal was bad my colleagues are digging holes so that I feel I fall into them and they get my position they are gossiping chit-chatting against me I'm driving here back home this guy cuts in front of me he hits my car another person gives me his fingers or hands or whatever in a bad gesture someone curses me insults me I come to the house my parking under the shade has been taken by someone I don't know who and my neighbor is putting garbage in front of my house so I'm devastated frustrated tired and hungry I come home and my wife who's been 10 hours between four walls wants to speak wants to chit chat I'm not in the mood no you have to sit and talk to me your mother called she said this and that why did what did she do this your sister did not invite me to her uh yo this is select the right time uh reasonable wise woman would just say how was your day okay put the food massage his feet maybe put it in salty hot water give him a massage before his nap when he wakes up in the afternoon give him help now is the right time but you have to be selective likewise a man has to know when to address his wife if she's angry and she's frustrated and Furious and her red are are her eyes are red and you can see that the Thorns of Iblis coming from her uh horns of a beast coming from her head and you say the prophet said women are so bad because of their religion and because of their uh sanity and said she will curse the prophet Allah you're the one who's causing it so you have to be selective in in what you say and what you do and when to choose the right time you have to also be knowledgeable and careful because women have different moods men usually have one mood they don't change they don't want to talk they don't want to argue the women they are like a cycle this is what makes them beautiful one day she is wow it burns your fingers and one day this is a problematic you have to live with that and appreciate that they have different uh modes for them and that would put them in a different mood you have to be satisfied with what Allah has given you if you manage to look but we don't have any glasses now because you're fasting a a glass that is half full half empty why always say it's half empty you're pessimistic if you say it's half full you're optimistic life is like this it's always helpful so look at the good thing of your wife or of your husband so that you would be appreciative the prophet says that is awesome no believing man no believing man should hate a believing woman if he hates one of her characteristics he will be pleased with another and finally I hope on time yeah you have to be wise you have to look at the consequences of your decisions not being Victorious is important winning the battle is not winning the war sometimes you have to lose a battle show that you give up surrender just to make things or move and I pray to Allah azzawajal that he makes our marriages one of the happiest if not the happiest possible I pray to Allah that he grants us the wisdom and the knowledge to know how to tackle and to please our spouses"
