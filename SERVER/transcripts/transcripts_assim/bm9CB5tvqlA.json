  "transcript": "okay I'm Anna two questions the first question is quite generic which is what is the role of the youth in the current crisis the Muslims face it is not only the youths role it is the entire Ummah the youth may be addressed not to be impulsive because usually the youth tend to be impulsive tend to shoot then ask questions tend to do things and apologize and all of these things are prohibited in Islam so what to do they have so much energy in them this have so much self and the need to act however this has to be harnessed by the scholars by the elders by the people of wisdom who themselves are may may not be able to act like them and do the things they can do or achieve what they can achieve but at least they can give and share with them some of their own wisdom and experience so the most important thing for the youth is to have scholars leading them real scholars of Islam not social media scholars not Muftis from here and there whether they are bought by the government or they are self acclaimed you have to go to the real scholars who follow the Quran and the Sunnah like share happiness a mean said may Allah have mercy on his on his soul there are three types of scholars scholars of the state who gives fatwa according to what the government's want tailor-made and scholars of the nation whatever the majority of the people want they give them fatwa not according to what pleases Allah Azza WA JAL but rather according to the masses we want numbers we want quantities we're not interested in qualities anymore and the third type are the scholars of the millah of the dean and these are few but they are known they don't fear except allah azza wajal and they weigh the pros and cons and they do not give fatwa according to what the masses want to hear nor what the state want wants to hear so the youth have to abide and have to follow such scholars as for the general Ummah the crisis that we are seeing these calamities are caused by our distance from Islam look around you and you will find that all these crises are caused by the separation between state and religion whenever the Muslims say what is in the message it is in the message and what is in the nightclub is in the nightclub know that they are doomed and this is what's happening all over the world we have to go back to square number one the Prophet seller is salat wa salam islam started strange and it will get back to becoming strange so pool bar which is a big tree in paradise for those who are among the strangers so they said who are those among the strangers the Prophet said assemblies who are following my footsteps and the footsteps of the Companions so the youth have to follow the footsteps of the Prophet item and his companions and if they managed to do that through the consultation and the guidance of the scholars of Islam they would be unbeatable but unfortunately the enemies of Islam the hypocrites the liberals etc this is what they are banking on separate the youth from their scholars discredit others tarnish their reputation accuse them of not knowing anything in this world accusing them of being petrol dollars or scholars for dollars or milkshakes instead of shakes as they claim all of these words are similar to the words that were used against our prophet alayhi salatu salam which means that they are work walking the same path for being harassed and abused in the same fashion of the Prophet Isis Salam was abused so this is what I would advise that the youth that they have to abide by their scholars acquire knowledge learn the Quran learn the Sunnah of the Prophet as Salaam implemented in their lives walk the talk and inshallah our calamities will be solved"
