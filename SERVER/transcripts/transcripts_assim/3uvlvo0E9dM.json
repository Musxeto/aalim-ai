  "title": "Forgot to say Rabbighfirli in congregation or praying alone, must I offer sujood as sahu Assimalhake",
  "transcript": "if a man forgot to say rabbil fairly between the two prostrations and he's praying in congregation should he offer sujuda sahu first of all rabbi firli between the two prostrations is an issue of dispute is it sunnah mandatory or what and the most authentic opinion that i'm inclined to support is that it's mandatory which means any mandatory act during prayer if missed intentionally invalidates the prayer if missed unintentionally due to forgetfulness or not knowing that it is mandatory then the prayer is valid now if a person forgot it and he's praying alone or he's the imam he's obliged to offer two prostrations of forgetfulness before sallam but if you're praying behind an imam and it was your fault that you forgot it and you prayed with the imam the full prayer from the beginning to the end then the imam carries the burden and the fault which means that you follow him when he offers salam you offer salaam and you're not obliged to offer the prostration of forgetfulness she you"
