  "transcript": "says he's 16 and he has two jobs and he wants to get married well go ahead if you find a proper girl to accept you and this goes in line with the laws of the country because some countries in europe and america they'd rather you committing fornication rather than getting married so if you can do this without breaking the law definitely it's a good thing to do you are a sensible responsible person no one in 16 years with two jobs interested of getting married is a punk such a person is a responsible person who knows what he's doing and definitely inshallah you'll find someone to accept you say"
