  "title": "Dua for Seeing The New Moon Authentic",
  "transcript": "A man from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh, is it from sunnah to see new moon every month and to say the new moon du'a? Is this authentic? Also the du'a authentic or not? Jazak Allahu Khairan Wa Jazak. This is an issue of dispute among scholars. Some authenticate it and some say that it is a weak du'a, and it depends on the Sheikh you follow in authentication. I personally don't believe that it is authentic, but those who want to say it say that it is not connected to issues of aqeedah, and the du'a is not connected to halal and haram, therefore there is nothing harmful in saying it even if it is a weak du'a, and Allah knows best."
