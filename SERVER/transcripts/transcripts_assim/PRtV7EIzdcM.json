  "title": "Zakat on plot bought on installments on which payment is still due - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Helen he says I have bought a plot of land on installments for selling and have paid 25 percent of the price up till now al insha Allah get possession after development work is completed which could take up to three years but the ownership has been transferred to my name do I need to pay the cut on the total price of the plot first of all the transaction though it is in installments the possession of the land is already yours it's in your name which means that the whole thing belongs to you whether you paid only 25% and there is 75% pending over the coming three years or not the land is yours so you don't ask now that I only pay 25% the whole thing is yours you can resell it again if you wish no restrictions secondly is there's a cat on it or not this depends you mentioned in the beginning of the question that you bought it for selling so if your intention is to develop it and sell it then buy another property develop it and sell it this means that the cycle is for investment and hence you must pay the cat annually for this how much I will just come to that thirdly if you bought it to live on it to build a house on it to rent it there is no zakat so it becomes like your car like your clothes but if it was bought with the intention of selling it and making more money and investing it in this case you have to do the cat fourthly what is this a cat then you have to look at the current price so I bought it last Rabi al-awwal for example the following Rabi al-awwal it's still under development I paid 25% I paid 100% regardless it doesn't matter what matters is the price and the value of the plot at the moment so a year later I asked experts the plot in its current condition with only the foundation set or only bare walls on it whatever how much does it cost now I get three opinions from professionals they tell me it costs X amount of money I gave 2.5% over that amount of money or at least of the average of the three opinions the following year now there are more buildings on it it's more developed like 75% ready I asked again they gave me another estimate but definitely it's gonna be higher I give 2.5% over that and so on so I hope this answers your question mrs. nadim she says I'd like to know the correct way of says that it till our different people have different ways of doing so kindly guide how one should according how one should do it according to Islam okay because before we go to mrs. Nadine we have a bow Malik from I think Switzerland Abu Malik what can I do for you [Music] during suit or when we finish the Torah cut okay any more questions Hey Ya Allah okay Abu Malik's question was about istikhara esta Hara is seeking Allah's assistance to facilitate something for you I'm not gonna through the procedure I'm not going to go through it because this is not the question Abu Malik says allahumma inni Esther here o Kabir in Macau a stockier Aqaba karateka Wow as I look I'm in public allowing this door where should I say it should I say it in the suit no one to my knowledge has said that it can be said Institute the scholars differed whether it is to be said before Salam so after you do the tisha hood and you do a solid ala nabi sallallahu alayhi wasallam then before you conclude your salat with salam you say the door and the second opinion which i am inclined to follow is that you say it after the Salam so you pray two rakahs you conclude it and then you say after Saddam Allah Minister here kappa teamuk etc and allah azza wajal knows best so mrs. Nadine's question was about how to perform sujood Attila what is to do Dattilo there are 15 locations in the Quran where we are supposed to and recommend it after reciting this verse that we go and prostrate one prostration this is called prostration of reciting the Quran so you do till our if you are not praying so I'm just sitting on my home and reading the Quran or in the Masjid and I passed by this ayah I say Allahu Akbar as I am from the sitting position and I'm prostrate and I say subhana wa bil ala three times or more or I say the other doors allahu malika said yet to abaca a month will occur as lambda the agility halacha who was Hawara who were shocked kasama whoever Allah who be holy Yahoo what if a Tabarrok allow us a new Halloween etcetera different than if you just say so hanna-barbera Allah this does the job and then once you're finished you raise your head without saying Allahu Akbar and without saying a ceremony convert Allah that's it because I'm not praying so it's only one takbir to go to sujood and that's it he famines a lot and I passed by this ayah then I say Allah Akbar that makes you dude in order to go back to the standing position and continue my recitation I have to say Allah ho Akbar once again and I continue my dissertation and I hope this answers your question for WA says can you tell me the dress code for women in salat is it permissible to wear short camis short camisa any short shirt that doesn't go all the way down so the dress code for a woman in salat is to cover all of her body properly excluding her face and enhance and by properly we mean that it should not be tight in the sense that it should not be showing her body and it should not be see-through it does it must not show her curves so it should be something that is loose ample that covers her body well the sure welcome ease is or does not fit this criteria it usually shows and exposes the waist the hips and the buttocks and the thighs in in some cases especially when the hammies is short and therefore this is not permissible I think we have a couple of minutes Taha says his question is on the game of Monopoly so he says I've heard that it's not permissible due to using the dice yes dice is Haram so it says can we avoid dice by drawing the Lots meaning that use using a spinner using pieces of paper with numbers on them I personally believe that this is a trick where the same concept is used which is randomly choosing numbers and to go on with this game I believe that this is not permissible the dice are used for educational purposes like in a kindergarten where they want to learn the numbers and how to count this might be okay but for games no I believe that this is not permissible and allah azza wajal knows best this is"
