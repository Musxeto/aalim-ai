  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Germany okay so uh my \nfirst question go to a restaurant it's   like an all-you-can-eat restaurant but it's from \nChinese people if we only for example eat noodles   um are we allowed to like eat the noodles there if \nwe're not sure whether they they um cooked haram   food or not the Norm is that we eat only halal \nfood noodles is halal the problem is that Chinese   restaurants they make a lot of their dishes based \non pork and pork fat and pork oil they love pork   and this is something totally unacceptable to \nthe Muslims because pork is najis and everything   derived from it is Haram for us to consume so \nif you live in Germany or in a western country   if the beef or the food served to you we \nwould say generally yes this is halal by   default until proven otherwise if \nit's being served in a restaurant   that serves both Haram and halal food here I would \nadvise people to refrain from eating there why   because most likely there is food contamination \nthere is cross-contamination that is between   utensils frying uh oil dishes forks spoons and \nknives when they are preparing food they're not   going to change them to serve something Halal \nand something Haram differently they're going   to use the same things and this would render \nyour noodles najis and Haram for you to consume"
