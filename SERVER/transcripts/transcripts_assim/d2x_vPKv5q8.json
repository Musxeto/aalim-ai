  "title": "Ten Commandments in Islam - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Emmett says in Islam do we have the 10 commandments if so what are they well the issue of 10 commandments is found in the Old Testament given to Moses peace be upon him and the Christians believe in it basically speaking we have something similar because Judaism Christianity and Islam come from the same root and Musa ASA and our prophet Moses Jesus and our prophet alayhi salaatu re mo salat WA Salam they're all brothers there are messengers of Allah they are all from the strong willed messengers who are 5 no Ibrahim Musa ASA and Mohammed peace be upon them all so they come from the same source now in Islam we don't have only 10 we have these and a bit extra formulated to fit and suit Islam as a religion that is capable of being implemented till the end of time and this is what makes Islam stands in front of our other religions that there is no religion after it there is no messenger after a Prophet Muhammad as Salam there is no prophet after him so this is the final testament the final religion it must go through the acid test it must prove that it is applicable compatible to all times and locations till the end of time so we have Commandments in chapter 6 verse 153 onwards Allah says as well to follow though he'd in 153 and before that in 1:51 that is from 151 till 153 of chapter six allah says say come I'll recite what your Lord has prohibited to you he commands that you associate anything with him and to parents good treatment and do not kill your children out of poverty will provide for you and them and do not approach immoralities and so on it goes on listing these things also we have in surah - Ezra in chapter 17 where allah jalla says from verse 31 onwards and do not kill your children for fear of poverty do not approach unlawful sexual intercourse Allah says do not kill the soul which Allah has forbidden except by right and whoever is killed unjustly so and so and so Allah says do not approach the property of orphan and Allah says give full measure when you measure and way with an even balance etc so all of these things are commandments of allah azza wajal but they're not limited to ten it governs our own lives it governs our relationship with our maker it governs our relationship with those living around us whether muslims or non-muslims so yes if you look at these locations which i've mentioned earlier you will find this clearly within the last illusion"
