  "title": "Does a traveler have to pray in the Masjid? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "us are from saudi arabia they've traveling for a week like going to taif or going to al-bagh or to abha and they are staying in a hotel where there is a masjid adjacent to it so whenever the prayer is called he tells his son go and pray in the masjid and the son says why we're travelers we can chill we can just relax this is why we are travelers and i said that a lot of the scholars say that this is true but this is not the most authentic opinion even if amin said the hadith of the blind man whom the prophet asked him do you hear that he said yes he said you have to respond i find no permission no uh approval for you to pray home though he was blind this is a clear indication that it is mandatory for those travelers who are settling in a city and have nothing to do yes if you're going on a picnic or something but you're in the hotel why not pray on time in the masjid when you hear the adhan this is the most authentic opinion allah knows best"
