  "transcript": "Sumaiyah from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So, I'm trying to ignore all the OCD about everything, every act of worship. So, fasting, so I fasted a day, trying to make up one from Ramadan. And then, I was in a session, I was teaching, and then saliva, like a bubble, like saliva, there is a bubble came out of my mouth, and I ignored it, risking my fast. I didn't know if it was valid or not, and I ignored it, I was negligent. And then after the session ended, I thought about it, I was like, I risked my fast, so now I don't know if it's valid or not. Your fast is valid, there is nothing wrong in it, ignore it and move on."
