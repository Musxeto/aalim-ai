  "title": "She follows 2 trustworthy Sheikhs for ease, is this Kufr fatwa shopping or cherry picking",
  "transcript": "Maisha from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. So Sheikh as a layman if someone follows two or three trustworthy sheikhs who has almost every opinion same but she tries to follow 90 to 95 percent of one of the specific sheikhs every time except one or two thinking it's tough and can't follow every time as both are present in the sharia but rest of the things she follows that particular sheikh and never cherry picks other rulings except that one but willing to follow it sometimes but thought comes that she is disrespecting and getting bothered but she knows her intention is not like this she wants to follow it as soon as possible so is these thoughts considered as kufr or not? These thoughts are not considered kufr because she did not disbelieve in Allah Azza Wa Jal but what she's doing is cherry picking following one sheikh in 95 of what he says and all of a sudden changing to one other sheikh in what he says because it seems better or easier for her to follow this is the definition of fatwa shopping or cherry picking"
