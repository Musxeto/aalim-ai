  "transcript": "while watching the new moon sighting felt like a good in lighting this day is all right as the first time I wasted night with family around a nice meal we're making doing I feel how nice it is to be so near to those I love and welcome to this new episode of Virtues of fasting coming to you live from Huda TV and we are studying the book or the chapter that deals with fasting from the book of which was compiled by alham may Allah have mercy on his soul Hadith number 20 6 which we have today was narrated by IBN Abbas may Allah be pleased with him and with his father he said that an elderly man is permitted to break his fast but he must feed a poor person daily and he does not have to make up for it now this Hadith is and again it means that these are the words of the companion of the prophet however Scholars say that such an opinion is not usually said by a person's own whims and desires and definitely such an opinion is based on the rhetoric of the Prophet Allah and his teaching and as as we know it is mentioned in the Quran that you must fast the month of Ramadan and whoever is ill or traveling then he should make up for these missed days on other days and those who can afford it they may pay an expiation and at the beginning of Islam you had the choice between fasting or feeding a poor person but then this was abrogated to all except azimir Abbas tells us may Allah be pleased with him and with his father except when it comes to a person who is unable to fast and in this Hadith he told us that an elderly person a person who is old and who is unable to fast in this case this person is Exempted from fasting yet he may uh or he must feed one poor person per every day that is missed so what is your definition of an old person so someone who's 50 someone is 60 no this hasn't anything to do with the age it has to do with the ability so if someone is in his 90 years of age and he's fit Masha Allah and he still can't fast and he has no problem with that he may not feed the poor person and Skip ramadan's fasting because he's capable but someone who's maybe 55 or 60 years of age and he is bedridden or he has so many illnesses or he has reached a stage in his life where fatigue overwhelms him and he's unable to fast and Allah knows it this is something between you and Allah so he says that I can't fast in this case yes you may skip fasting as long as you cannot and you may feed a poor person per every day you miss and similarly anyone who has a chronic illness or a permanent excuse that would never go away so this old person will never become young again to be able to fast that's why we're telling him go ahead and feed a poor person for everyday Mist likewise someone who is chronically ill in the sense that doctors say that this person will never recover or this person will never be able to fast again so someone who is suffering from uh uh diabetes I think it's type one where he must eat something otherwise he's gonna faint and maybe die his blood pressure goes not blood pressure his his diabetes level goes beyond or below 70 or 60. so constantly he has to keep on consuming something that raises the level of sugar in his blood so such a person doctors say we don't have any cure in the foreseen future so in this case this person may skip Ramadan the whole Ramadan and feed a person for every day that he misses how much do we feed this person well Scholars say you have to feed him half Asar or whatever is sufficient to be called a meal so if you get like 1.125 kgs of rice bro and you give it to him this is okay better more if you cook food some rice and some meat or chicken and you give it to him which is a normal good healthy meal healthy is not a condition but it's a recommendation from my side of course this is good this is sufficient one says or one asks can we as permanent uh people who are excused from fasting can we come on the first day of Ramadan and prepare food and feed 34 percent the answer is no this is not permissible you cannot feed the people before the actual day is obliged upon you so when I feed 29 people and today is the first of Ramadan there are 29 days coming that are not yet mandated upon me so I cannot feed on their behalf or for these days I have to either feed a person after the sunrise or the break of dawn of every day so today is the first of Ramadan it's daytime yes I can feed why because it's mandatory upon me too fast and I did not fast so this day is not valid and I have to feed for that or at the end of the month the Whole 30 days or 29 days depending I can gather 29 poor people or 30 poor people and cook lots of food for them and give them and one meal is sufficient people think that feeding a poor people a poor person means that we have to feed them three meals no it is only intended to be one meal a second question that people may uh tend to ask can we feed the same person 30 times the answer is no can you explain I will at the end of Ramadan I have to be I have to feed one poor person per every day mist so if I get the same person let's assume his name is Ahmed and I give Ahmed 30 meals I would have not fed 30 poor people I would have fed one poor person and this is not intended and this is not the right thing to do but if I'm going to feed one person a day each day of Ramadan so at sunset I prepared a meal and I give it to Ahmed the following day I prepare a meal and I give it also to Ahmed and so on till the rest of the month this is permissible why because Allah ordered me to feed a poor person per day and I did this when I feed a poor person for 30 days meaning the whole thing I give it to one person this defies the purpose of it and hence this is not permissible so I think that this is all what um there is to talk about in this Hadith we move on to Hadith number 28. or 27 that is the Hadith of may Allah be pleased with him narrated that a man came to the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and said I am ruined o messenger of Allah or you can translate this to I'm doomed so the prophet Islam asked him what has ruined you why are you doomed so the man replied I had intercourse with my wife during the day in Ramadan while fasting of course the Arabic translation the Arabic text is much more polite and uh high in in language because the man says I fell on my wife during the day of Ramadan so this the Arabs use this beautiful words so that they would not be so uh direct and and harsh by saying I had intercourse with my wife as it's translated here the prophet said to him are you able to free a Slave the man said no the prophet Islam said can you fast for two consecutive months the man said no the prophet then asked sallallahu Can you provide food for 60 poor people and the man answered no then he sat down there is the man a basket of dates was brought to the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam and he said to the man give this as sadaqah that is voluntary charity so the man said to whom o prophet of Allah to someone who is poorer than us by Allah there is no one in this city there is a Medina there is no one between its mountains who is in need of these dates more than us me and my family that is the prophet then laughed until his molar teeth could be seen and said to the man go and feed your family with these dates and this is an authentic Hadith agreed upon bukhari Muslim and other books of Hadith now in this great Hadith we learn the penalty for having sexual intercourse with your spouse during the day of Ramadan while fasting now the man knew for sure that it was a sin but he did not know the expiation so that's why he confessed said I'm doomed I know I did something wrong but I don't know what to do what how to to solve it and if you read the Hadith once again you will find that the prophet Allah ask the man because it is part of your duty as a Mufti as a teacher as a scholar to know and understand what the person who is asking you meant so but just confessing that you're doomed doesn't say anything so the prophet asked him Allah about the thing he did now one would say Okay aren't we ordered to conceal our sins the answer is yes definitely you are not allowed to brag about your sins you're not allowed to tell anyone about your previous sins and this happens a lot with some of the imbeciles some of the ignorant people when they propose to a woman and she's a righteous practicing woman and he starts uh uh interrogating her have you ever had any relationship with any man did you ever call any person on the phone did you have any a dark past I have to know and he insists on telling him about this and some of them even after marriage he does this with his wife and some of them have seen cases that came to me like this ignorant men say by Allah if you had the relationship between marriage you're divorced and the woman is is cornered she's like stuck between a rock and a hard place what to do if I don't tell him I'm divorced and if I tell him I'm exposing my self and my sins well for for such a person I think she's better off without him because such an ignorant person Allah conceals the sins and forgives those who repent to him and he insists on knowing something that destroys his life and the life of those uh whom he claims to be to love so the man was not exposing his sin the man was inquiring so that he would get the religious verdict the fact were the answer for what he had done and we find that the prophet Allah acknowledged him when he said I'm doomed I'm I'm ruined he didn't say no no no it's okay sit down no the prophet approved that Islam telling us and and showing us how a major sin it is to have intimacy with the misses during the day time of Ramadan and who is or what is what or let me rephrase that what are the conditions for the kafara for the expiration to be implemented well one it has to be during the daytime of Ramadan to it has to be from someone who's obliged to fast okay what do we understand from this one it has to be during the daytime of Ramadan meaning that if you are making up for a missed day of Ramadan during the month of during the month of rajab you're making up for a few days missed because of traveling of illness whatever and during the fasting you have intercourse with your wife the expiation is not obligatory upon you yes the day is void you've nullified your fasting you're sinful and you have to make up for that day but there is no expiration for that two it has to be from someone who's obliged to fast so if a person was traveling and he has intercourse during the daytime of Ramadan he's okay there's no expression on him not only that if a person was traveling so someone residing in Jeddah he traveled all the way to Medina with his wife and he continued to fast and when he reached Medina he had intercourse with his wife while fasting during the daytime of Ramadan we say that he is not obliged to give the expiation he was fasting yes no problem because he's not obliged to fast he has the permission not to fast so in this case it's okay for him and he is not even sinful because he has the right to break his fast likewise if a person is old as mentioned in Hadith 25 and IBN Abbas says that he doesn't have to make up for the day and he has to feed a poor person so this person who's chronically ill or he is unable to fast but he has the energy to have intimacy with his spouse and he does that during the time of Ramadan there's no expiation on him and his his uh what he had done is totally legit now what is the expiration for having intercourse during the daytime of Ramadan the prophet Allah made this in three stages one you have to fear a Slave two if you're unable then you have to fast for two consecutive months three if you're unable then you have to feed 60 poor people now can we combine between the two what do you mean I can in a sense can I fast one month instead of two but feed 30 poor people instead the answer is no you can't combine you can't free half a slave if two own a slave so you say my share is free is is uh and and then fast one month no it has to be the full thing or not nothing second scenario second question what if a person has a lot of money and this happened in the past a king who used to violate Ramadan by having intercourse during the daytime and freeing slaves is very easy for him so some of the scholars the Contemporary Scholars of his time said no you're not allowed to free a slave you have to fast two consecutive months because this is harder for him so is this a good choice logically it is but islamically it is definitely not because logic here is going against the rule of Allah so the prophet tells us Hassan that you have to free a slave you don't have the right to come and say well because he's Rich then we do not accept this from him because he will frequently break his fast during the daytime of Ramadan with intercourse no we will punish him with where it hurts that is fasting to consecutive months so this is not the right thing to do you have to follow the sequence and one of the things in this Hadith is that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam is always as it is in the Quran as it is in the Sunnah we are encouraged in Islam to free slaves so those who tried to tarnish the reputation of Islam by depicting it by choosing things and saying that this is what Islam teaches Islam is not a religion of Peace blah blah blah they one of the things that come to mind when they talk against Islam is Islam promotes slavery by the way slavery is promoted in all religions so read your textbooks read your uh scriptures and you will find it promoted there however Islam does not promote slavery but rather Islam makes slavery one of the means of entering Paradise not only that Islam solves this problem through the system of expiations it has which is a unique system if you kill someone by mistake I was driving in someone I ran someone over and he died this is a mistake I I didn't do this on purpose he died by mistake was the expiation in Islam free a Slave someone who did vihar what is the heart someone is angry with his wife and says by Allah you are now Haram on me like the back of my mother you become like my mother I this is not a divorce this is making her Haram to himself as a punishment he has to free a slave otherwise he cannot go back to his wife or divorce her someone who swears and says by Allah tomorrow I'm not having lunch at your house and then when he learns that the food is delicious he says now I'm having second thoughts what to do one of the things that he may do as mentioned in the Quran is to free a slave and on and on and on so Islam promotes and Advocates freeing slavery freeing slaves but it's a system so prisoners of Wars instead of being sent to Guantanamo or sent to any concentration camps they are allocated and sold to Muslim families who will take care of them will feed them from what they eat will clothe them from what they wear but at the same time get a first-hand experience in watching how Muslims live and hence get a chance to embrace Islam and this land promotes freeing slavery as we see in this Hadith now if a person is fasting two consecutive months meaning that he may not skip a date unless he has a legitimate reason such as if the day of read is in between so someone starts to fast the month of the cerda and then he begins with the month of the hija and in the second week of it there is the tenth day of the heji which is and the three days of a tashrik and these four days it's not permissible for us to fast so do you mean that now I fasted uh 39 days in vain and after their aid I have to repeat another 60 days no alhamdulillah you skip these four days and on the fifth day you continue as if they did not exist so you continue with your 40th day and you have 10 more days to go or 20 more days to go likewise if a person is fasting tickets negative months and he falls ill or sick so what to do this is a legitimate reason if he has to travel and it's a legitimate travel not to break his fast but it's a business trip he has to go for uh something that is urgent in this case yes he is permitted to skip these days and to continue the minute he becomes fit to fast uh or a resident but if he misses a day for no legitimate reason in this case he has to begin the 60 days from scratch now the 60 day of the two months the two consecutive months are not necessarily 60 days because if the month is 29 days should I add another day that answer is no so if you start on the beginning of today today's 17th of Ramadan of course in Ramadan but let's assume it's 17th of show one so from 17th to the 17th 17th of this is one month even if shawwal was 29 days and from 17th of declareda to seven to the 16th of the hija this is the second month even if the hija was 29 days was 29 days so in total you actually had fasted 58 days no problem because Allah ordered us to fast for two consecutive months and the month can be as the prophet saws 29 or 30. so this is all uh acceptable now what about this person who came to the prophet assalam and said I don't have money to free a slave I don't have the ability to fast two consecutive months and definitely I don't have money to feed 60 poor people what to do if you're unable to do all the three then there is no expiation on you and this you are forgiven with the grace of Allah and you have to make it up in the future is it a debt on me the answer is no it's gone but if you get the financial means or the ability in the following day or two when it's relatively close to it in this case yes you have to pay the expiration other than that no you do not have to do this what happens if a person repeats this sin so there are two scenarios one repeating having intercourse more than once in the same day as long as he did not pay the expiation so if he has intercourse once twice or three times in the same day he has to give the expiration of one day only but if he has intercourse today tomorrow five days from now three days before the end of Ramadan these are four different days that he has nullified through fasting through intercourse while fasting during the month of Ramadan so what is the ruling well the ruling is he's obliged to give four expiations yes it is a lot but this is his punishment so he has to fast two consecutive months and then he may rest for a month or so this is for one day then he may have fast another two consecutive months and then a third and then a fourth Etc what about if he broke the whole month the Whole 30 days every single day used to have intercourse during the uh uh day time of Ramadan knowing that it is not permissible and he has no legitimate reason well the same rule applies because this is a sin and he has to pay for what he had done and in the Hadith we clearly notice the generosity of the Prophet Allah and before that Allah's Mercy on this man the man who came terrified stating that he was doomed and leaving at the end of the day jubilant and happy with a big basket of dates feeding himself and his family so look at Allah's Mercy changing the situation 180 degrees and this is our life story Allah the almighty tests us yet blesses us and favors us more than anyone else and we so many times see things flipping and changing with the grace of Allah the Almighty now is he obliged to make up for that day the answer is yes it's an issue of dispute but definitely the answer is yes the expiation does not suffice for making the day of Ramadan some Scholars say that he would not be able to compensate for it even if he fasted a thousand days and this is true yet he's still obliged to make for that day now the prophet if you've noticed Allah did not ask about the woman about his wife so his expiration sufficient for him only or also for his wife the scholars have different opinions regarding this issue and the most authentic opinion is that she is an individual and if she was uh complying with him and she was um reciprocating in this case she is obliged why didn't the prophet ask him about her there are many reasons maybe she was a traveler and she came on the day of traveling this is far-fetched maybe she had hermesis and after she saw her Purity show so she took the bath and she's not obliged too fast because Fajr came while she was in her Menses so now she can have intercourse but she is not obliged to fast there might be a number of reasons and that is why the scholars say the prophet did not ask him about her sallallahu alaihi wasallam we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back from Allah commanded Us in the Quran saying hasten to the Forgiveness of your lord and to Paradise the width of which is the heavens and the Earth prepared for the righteous and pious brothers and sisters in Islam especially in the month of Ramadan the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam tells us that when the first night of the month of Ramadan is here the devils are chained o Seekers of goodness come forth yeah every night in the month of Ramadan and learn how can we haste

fasting falsely they themselves and if they want to break the fast can they break like in between okay any more questions yeah like for example some ladies those who are practicing Islam especially in the case of hijab like in the uh in front of stranger strangers also we should not uh show our face and hands we have to cover okay before I was not doing that but now I started in front of all of my cousins and covering so my sometimes my parents they will say that you can show face and hands there is nothing wrong and they argue with me so in this case how I have to handle okay from Saudi how are you I'm fine okay I have uh three questions regarding uh prayers yes first one I want to know about Namaz tasbi a lot of people offer this so I want to know should we make the Master's be or not okay uh second question is uh want to know about a winter prayer like these days when we go for tarawi uh usually the Imam ends with the Wither so if for me like I wake up for the hot chut uh is it uh recommended that I leave the with a prayer uh in tomorrow because I have to wake up for the hot children pray like how should I do about it should I pray or should I skip the hot shows and pray with her in the mosque with the Imam okay is that question and third question is Also regarding these uh prayers you know like Doha you know it's an important but there are these uh and charged prayer I want to know like the timings or are they similar to Doha or um okay I will answer your question thank you so much you're welcome from Saudi Sheikh has said that this is listened to the salaam sent to them when visited to the graves is it more beneficial if Quran is recited sitting near their grave so that they also they can listen to that one and regarding this only this same question kindly tell me how since when this grave punishment starts so that we can pray to save them from punishment of the graves well for their forgiveness we pray it like that but for particularly as you said last time say that you can pray to for the opening of this window in the grave and all like this one but the thing is that what I am confused is the with this grave punishment persist every day or every time or so like that that is what has become I will answer the question inshallah you're welcome um uh actually my question is regarding payment of raka uh actually if we have money saved money from our husband's savings um without his knowledge I mean he knows he's not totally ignorant he knows that we keep honey and we save it and is it permissible for me to pay zakat from this money he knows that I take money for like we take money from him and I keep it as a savings and you I use you utilize it for uh for my daily household uh you whatever payment is there to be made on my domestic household chores but from that if I save money can I make payment of zakat from that money okay so you are what what you're saying is can I pay the cat on behalf of my husband who does not want to pay zakat but he knows that I'm taking from his money either for the home or for myself but not for the zakat I will answer your question inshallah and another question is not exactly after with her any other play like a Zohar also or Asar also I will answer your question I will answer inshallah uh Ibrahim from Gambia I hope it works on the earth yes and you get in yourself when you're what you're wound when you're alone and you're bleeding yes yeah so it didn't necessary for you to break your password and you have to wait until after after the month of Ramadan then you face that okay I will answer the question inshallah okay thank you you're welcome okay uh first umrahman says that children six to ten years of age they fast voluntary by themselves and then in the middle of the day they feel hungry and they want to break their fast can we do this the answer is yes they can do this because they're not obliged but you try your level best to extend it as much as possible so if you can make it instead of 12 o'clock make it at 3 P.M 4 P.M give them a gift so that it it is a training for them this is better she says that now she started picking up nikab and covering in front of her relative cousins Etc but her parents tell her that it is not mandatory and you shouldn't do this you can uh show your face so what to do simply tell her that tell them that this is not correct and I must cover because this is the obligation of Allah masara from Canada I think I have a question of your shows and other the shakes talking we have not been brought up like that like most of my relatives or family members we don't know much about Islam the way that you people tell us and it does scare me are there any books that I can read to make myself a better Muslim and my children and family members okay because we're very ignorant of things like we do so many things that are so wrong and we have not been taught that this is wrong you know we think that we are born in a Muslim family therefore we are Muslims so it scares me and I want my children inshallah to be good Muslims myself also and I pray as you and all the audience to pray for us to be a better Muslim ummah another more question I have that it breaks my heart to see what's happening all over the Muslim World why are we as Muslims not doing anything why are we just sitting quiet living our own lives isn't that Haram okay I will answer the question you're welcome from Saudi Arabia Allah I think I have two questions yes yeah first one is generally is it allowed for women to use the perfumes and the deodorants when generally yeah when when in the house at home or um most probably outside home okay I would answer this question second question second is like uh during the Ramadan does it break the fast using the perfumes and the deodorants it does it break the fast okay especially I have seen like women going to Muslim and most almost everyone is using having the perfume so I was having this question does it break the fast you're not fasting When you pray usually yeah we're not fasting but like Ramadan is going on okay I will answer you okay I will answer the question yes for this what other insha Allah I will do that inshallah to the Muslims I mean um from Saudi solution yes husband had given loan to his brother six years back we send money in Saudi real but he receive it in Pakistan in rupees now he wants to return it should we ask him to return the money in Saudi riyal or rupees because the rate of rupees have gone down a bit now and the second question is should we pay the zakat for the last six previous six years if we receive the money or only for one year after one year has finished okay I will answer the question inshallah and we have from Gambia I think we lost Yaya okay we will try to answer a few questions until Amber says the ruling on Saturday is not authentic and one should not pray it because the format of it is not similar to any other prayer there is no other prayer where you have subhanallah Allah said 15 times while in the standing position in this and in the position of reciting uh the Quran and also saying it ten times when you are prostrating or you're in the between the two sajdas and Raku and and also all of this is second to none therefore the scholars say that this is not a legitimate for us to pray she says that she prays after talawih so she's confused should she prayed with her with the Imam but then when she prays to hajjud at night what would she do or not to pray to Hadith at all no pray both alhamdulillah but you have an option the best option is that when the Imam prays his and he offers Salam don't offer salaam stand up and make your Witter an even number so the Imam prayed 11 rakas in conclusion you have prayed 12 rakas and then when you go home you pray as many rakas as you want for your tahajud and then conclude that with one she says she's confused between buhar and ishraq it's a long a debate the topic is the same both fall under prayer however israq has a Twist to it that is that if you do the conditions that you pray in the Masjid with the congregation and you remain in your place in the Masjid making thicker reading the Quran whatever until the sun rises and then you pray turaka Allah would reward you for that as if you have offered and Hajj complete complete complete as a prophet said in the Hadith but they are both so if you do the israq prayer and you don't pray this is okay and the funny thing is that one of the brothers sent me an email a few days ago asking me on that whether the prophet Islam had prayed or not and I answered him and I said yes he did so he sent me a Hadith with bukhari saying this and that that Aisha said that he had never prayed but I prayed them she said and he said please refrain from giving wrong replies as if the brothers if I I take advice from people and if you give me an advice it's a gift to me but when you run an imbecile an ignorant and you don't know and you give the wrong advice well like this is a catastrophe Muslim herself said that the prophet Islam used to pray in the conquest of Mecca she said that the prophet Islam prayed Hadith that the prophet came and prayed in the time to in his house Etc so it there the prophet did not pray it every single day but he did pray it is and the hadiths are there so don't jump to conclusions and start correcting people without knowledge because this is showing how ignorant you are to the people and not only that it's disrespectful and you are abusing yourself you're doing yourself harm when you talk in the religion of Allah without knowledge Allah from Saudi Arabia says that okay we know that the dead can hear the uh salaam of those who coming to greet them this is a fact for the prophet for the others it's a a disputed thing there are Hadith at the moment I don't recall whether they are authentic or not but even if they were authentic though I doubt it but even if they were authentic this doesn't mean that they heed everything the here only what Allah allowed them to hear and that is the Salaam so if you go in in and offer salaam to the prophetam he hears you but if you start telling him about your problems he doesn't hear that there's an angel appointed to only deliver the Salam to the prophet but not nothing else so you can't go to the grave of the Prophet Islam let alone anyone else and say oh prophet of Allah we have this we have problems we need Solutions ask Allah to do this ask Allah to prevent this this is totally unacceptable and it is considered to be shirk So based on this if you say that I'd like to play Quran or recite Quran for the deceased so that it would benefit them in their graves this is an innovation the prophet Sam had so many people dying in his life and never ever he told any of his companions to recite the Quran recite Surat recite this or that so that they may benefit in the graves it would not benefit them because it's gone they're dead and hearing it would not have any impact on them and it is an innovation he says when does the torment of the Grave begin so that we can start supplicating you should start immediately after the burial of the deceased but do not assume the worse that he's being punished assume the best and just ask Allah for forgiveness and uh that Allah expands his grave now when will it stop this is in Allah's knowledge it may go for ever till the day of judgment and it may go for a few years a few minutes a few hours this is something we have no knowledge of and Allah did not inform us and therefore we do not speak without knowledge says that her husband is lazy he doesn't pay the money of zakat and this is a great a major sin and he is in great danger so she says he gives me money for pocket money for buying groceries Etc and I save from that money and he knows that so can I pay zakat on his behalf the answer is no without his permission and without his authority authorization to you it would not help him it's just a charity on your behalf not on his because this is a pillar of Islam it has to be done intentionally so if he doesn't do it intentionally and you do it behind his back Allah would not reward him for this and he will be punished severely for that she says can we make kunut in other voluntary prayers instead of uh Withers for example can we do it in other voluntary prayers and the answer is no it should be only done in Ibrahim from Gambia says that if someone has a wound in his fasting does it affect his fasting the answer is no unless he is having a hemorrhage or or a real big time bleeding that would make him faint in like five minutes because of the loss of the blood in this case yes it does break his fast masara from Canada says that are there any books to learn Islam from because this is not the Islam that they were brought up uh on and I have to agree that this is true see the problem of the majority of Muslims they only follow the religion of their ancestors like the idol worshipers when the prophet came to them with the Quran they said no we found our ancestors on a religion and we will follow suit so a proper Muslim begins a new life he does not follow his ancestors whether in right or wrong he begins his life by filtering all of the things that he had learned through the Quran and the Sunnah so are there any books yes are there any more books there are plenty of but you cannot just give names simply like that because everyone has a level there are beginners Novus intermediate highly leveled intellectual students of knowledge Etc so each one has a level of his own but I would advise you to visit one of the most trusted websites that you can gain knowledge from and that is www dot islamqa dot info this is one of the best websites I uh benefit from it greatly and it's a tremendous effort that you can get true and reliable sources information from it she says that what is the solution with the catastrophes and the calamities and the tribulation around the Muslim world that we see today and this is similar to the question of I think someone I don't know who asked again what what is the solution the solution is easy Allah mentioned in the Quran that he will not change whatever has happened to a people until they change themselves so when we look at the calamities around us so we look at Syria we look at Palestine we look at the sunnah's plight in Iraq under this uh uh evil regime where you see the plight of the Sunnah in Yemen we see it in Iran we see it everywhere so why is this happening it's simple if Allah wanted to if Allah wanted the Muslims to be victorious he would have done it in uh Flash all what he needs the almighty is to order it be and it is but Allah mentioned to us that he wants to test us one and by one another so what the Jews are doing to our brothers in Palestine this is not a test for Palestinians when they die they go to heaven insha Allah because they are oppressed and they were killed unjustly so Allah would forgive their sins so they don't have any problem being bombed being killed being uh whatever they're rewarded for that we have the problem because Allah is testing us and we've failed we've flunked big time the Arabs the Muslims they have failed big time they're not doing anything they're not let alone doing enough they're not doing a lot at all anything so what are they doing nothing all what you hear is that oh it's a shame we have to do this the U.N has to move it's in us if we do not move if we do not react if we do not feel the pain of our brothers and sisters if we do not give if we we are past the stage when we ask people to condemn and to allow the human humanitarian aids to go in this is way back in the past now we're demanding to free the Land and the people we don't want food and medicine to go in this is what the weak ask for we want to liberate the land we as Muslims is Our obligation every single one of us to free the Land of Allah our hatred to the Jews is not because of their skin color or their the color of their eyes it's because of their of their religion their hatred to the Muslims and what they've done to the Muslims likewise the atrocities that are taking place in Syria whether by any faction or any party this is because the Muslims are lagging behind they're not doing their Duty they're not doing their job neither financially nor on the military basis nor even on the political or economic so it is a collective matter now I can spend all day long pointing fingers said this is this person's mistake this is this government's mistake this would not take you anywhere you have to be proactive you have to react you have to start looking at organizations that take your money to your brothers and deliver it firsthand not going to the corrupt not going to those who are against the Muslims and Islamic cause who embezzle the money of the people and they become fatter and richer and their Swiss accounts are inflated with such donations no look for real good organizations who would do the job for us namri says what's the ruling for women using perfume and deodorants this is permissible providing that they do not pass by or uh that Nan mahram finds such perfumes or such scent the prophet said any woman who wears perfume and then passes by men who would find her scent who would find this beautiful smell of a perfume she is a fornicator the prophet said it's a major sin so if you are in your home or among your mahram or among other women yes put perfume wear perfumes use your tolerance nothing deodorants usually you cannot smell it uh outside your garments but perfumes yes this is too strong and it must not be worn when there is a possibility of passing by other men does wearing perfume affect um your fasting the answer is no unless you drink it it's Haram it's intoxicating but definitely no I was just joking no wearing it does not affect your fasting and then from Saudi foreign yes uh if we are in the land of Haram for if we go to foreign I will answer the question she says that her husband uh lent his brother six years ago money and now it's time to pay back the money but they don't know whether to pay it back in reals or in rupees and to answer this question we have to know what did the borrower receive at the time what did he ask for a thousand Reals in reals or atal what is equivalent to a thousand Reals in rupees so if your brother told him and this is what I would think listen I'm sending you uh a hundred thousand uh rupees in this case he is obliged to return a hundred thousand rupees not the equivalent but if he told him I'm sending you a thousand reals and you will bring it back to me a thousand reals then he should bring it back as reals what about the six months that the six years that he did not pay for the zakat he has to pay it now providing that every year he used to ask his brother to give him the money and the brother would say I don't have money yet have patience if this is the case his his brother was unable to give back the money due to a lack of funds in this case once he receives the money after six years he should give 2.5 percent once for the whole entire period instead of giving 2.5 for every year no you give 2.5 percent for the whole period as once and finally Adnan says that if when we make wudu and we are in the Harem it is crowded man it's full house so if I have the feeling of passing wind I know if I let it go then I have to go through the crowd to the toilets and this would take like a couple of hours so can I withhold it the answer is if it's not any uh going to harm you it is going to distract you so yes holding it would not physically harm you but it would definitely distract you from your prayer and you are advised to let it go because you can make wudu in any place near the water containers inside the Haram is not like taking a shower so it's a glass or two and you make wudu in a quick fashion and this does the job without having to leave the uh Kaaba and I believe that this is all the time we have until we meet you tomorrow same time I leave tonight with family around a nice meal we're making doing how nice it is whenever we think of Ramadan all the good things that we need to do and plan it's not always easy but we'll do the best we can foreign"
