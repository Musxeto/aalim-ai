  "title": "Can medical students dissect animals, insects etc for educational purposes? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "for Han says I'm a medical student and we often dissect organisms like earth warms roaches frogs is it a sin to kill these creatures for the educational purposes is dissection allowed answer is yes this is permissible such worms and insects and animals are okay to dissect but when it is in the case of animals you have to try your level best to kill it without inflicting any pain so you cannot while it's alive dissected without anesthesia or drugging it because then that would be torturing an animal or a living soul but if it's dead if you cut its head and you slaughter it or kill it without any pain inflicted and then you dissect it as you wish there is no problem in that inshallah"
