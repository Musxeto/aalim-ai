  "transcript": "foreign we need protection from allah every laptop needs an antivirus and allah has the highest of all examples your laptop needs protection indeed we are in greater need of such protection and protection does not come except from allah azza so what is the fire wall that protects us with the grace of allah it's the thicker and we all know that the devils take the worst of places to live in such as dumpsters toilets and the likes graveyards so what and how can we protect ourselves when we enter lavatories the toilets the dua is crystal clear there are two ways of saying it so one of the virgins means males of the devils females of the devils and is anything that is filthy anything that is not appropriate and al the other meaning for it is both men and women or males and females of the devils so again we say in the beginning bismillah why to protect ourselves from the eyesight of the jinn and we say this dua because we need allah's protection when in being in such place we're surrounded by the devils so that they won't attack us or do anything so i go with full confidence that allah is with me because i've said the dua of protection you need this it's not something that you may have a choice you have to say it in order to be protected i did what i had to do and then i want to leave the toilet what should i say the prophet islam used to say which translates to i ask you allah for forgiveness why do i say such a thing scholars say that you ask allah for forgiveness because as allah relieved your body from toxic waste from things that are harmful for your body as allah azzawajal facilitated you to eat and drink and now gave you the permission to dispose of such waste likewise you have a lot on your shoulders meaning sins that burden you so you ask allah azzawajal as he gracefully relieved you from such waste and filth that may have harmed your body you pray to him that he relieves you from your sins that may take you to his torment and wrath on the day of judgment now after we relieve ourselves usually usually people perform mudu so what to do when you want to start your evolution bismillah the sunnah is to say bismillah is it mandatory no it's not mandatory it is highly recommended according to the most authentic opinion of scholars okay very well what should we do while doing wudu because i've heard some people and i've read somewhere that when washing the face we say a particular thing when we wash our arms we say a particular dua all of this is bogus all of these duas no matter where you read them are fabricated are not related to islam nor the quran nor the sunnah so where did they get them from it's none of my business what concerns me is this is not authentic the prophet had never done it islam nor his companions so these folks who fabricate things and tell you you have to say oh allah do this to my face when you wash your face in evolution all of this is bogus so you just say bismillah in the beginning you make your thing you make your wuddle your evolution you wash your feet after finishing washing your feet and what is this this is the testimony of tawheed you say this you acknowledge that saying this opens the gates of jannah for you it makes allah azzawajal pleased with you and grants you a lot of reward that's all this is one way of saying vikkir after evolution another thicker is this one oh allah through the process of my wudu make me among those who frequently repent to you and make me among those who remain clean and pure because this is a means of purification is this the only duas i can say no there is also a great dua and this is usually known as kafaratul majilis but it is also said as mother aisha tells us in another authentic hadith whenever the prophet sallam concludes reciting the quran whenever the prophet sallam concludes a gathering and whenever the prophet alaihis allah concluded doing wudu a beautiful dua subhanallah is composed of praising allah glorifying allah azzawajal the testimony of tawheed there's no god worthy of being worshiped except allah azzawajal and on stating that subhanahu azzawajal is the one who provides us with forgiveness and he's the one who repent upon us when we ask him for repentance and we seek his forgiveness what does this show you it shows you that islam is based on the relationship between a servant of allah and his master his lord the creator of the heavens and the earth who has no partner who has no child who has no spouse who has no affiliated associate with him the one without a beginning the last without an end subhan this is the beauty of our religion this is all the time we have until we meet next time i leave you with salaam alaiki [Music] foreign"
