  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] AC [Music] alhamdulillah the prophet was a human being and as every human being he married because this inclination to the opposite gender is a human nature and Allah Asel does not order us to curb this inclination by refraining from it rather Allah channels it to us through Halal means which is marriage so when the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam was a young man as we mentioned earlier he had to make ends meet so he had to work and one of his jobs was to trade and he was hired by Khadijah bid may Allah be pleased with her who was a prominent businesswoman at the time and she sent him with her slave M to Syria to buy goods and come when they came back she found a great great deal of Baraka and profit in her wealth through this merchandise they bought back and when M spoke to her about this youngster this young man who was 25 years of age when he spoke to to her about his honesty his truthfulness his bashfulness his his strength as a man and how he dealt with others in a way that he had never experienced with any other person and of course you may know people through social media through video clips and you judge them through what you see if you did not travel with them if you did not live with them if you did not deal with them with money you cannot truly judge their true identity what you see of us is only this you don't know who we are until you go and check with our families with our spouses with our children with our uh subordinates with our superiors with our neighbors then you you can judge this is EXA exactly what M did he traveled with the prophet for a couple of months he knew him inside out he could not keep this information for himself so he gave it to Khadijah who was quite impressed and her companion and friend NAFA heard this from her thoughts and expressions and knew that she had a liking to the prophet Alam so she suggested why don't you marry some one like him would you fancy that now having said that Khadijah may Allah be pleased with her was a beautiful rich and from an honorable family that everyone wanted to get married to she was highly sought after but she would turn down dignitaries of quray the best of people in terms of lineage and wealth because she didn't like any of them with Prophet Muhammad Alam it was a different story so nafisa spoke and proposed to Prophet Muhammad Alat wasam and asked him if he would fancy marrying Khadijah and the prophet Sall wasallam agreed to such a proposal and so his uncle went and spoke to her guardian and the marriage took place and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam married for the first time to Khadijah may Allah be pleased with her the majority say that she was 40 years of age and he was 25 some say that she was 28 nevertheless it doesn't make a big difference she was older than the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and she was a blessed woman she was the first woman that the prophet wasam married and he loved her so much and she loved him back that he never married a second woman in her life so she lived with with him as his only wife and the prophet told usam that only four women were perfect among all women folk one of them was Khadijah she's the Mistress of the women of paradise she's the highest level of them all and she was so blessed that all the prophet's Offspring were from her with the exception of ibraim was from Maria the Coptic who was a concubine of the prophet and not one of his wives but the rest were all from the prophet and who were the children of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam they were Alim whom he was nicknamed by so everyone knew him as abim and and this is why the prophet prohibited in his lifetime for anyone to be called abim that's his name and she also gave him Abdullah who was nicknamed asah and both died as infants as young boys and she gave him four daughters zanab who was married to her cousin and then there wasum and R Who both were married toan may Allah be pleased with him and when umum died he married r and then there was Fatima who was married to his own cousin Ali AB Talib so these are the six that the prophet was blessed Byam from his wife Khadijah ibraim was born from Maria and he also died when he was 2 years of age all of the prophet's children died in his lifetime so six of his own children died in his lifetime and you can just think of the toll on the prophet's heart Salli wasallam to see Calamity after Calamity being patient and content with Allah's decree and not saying anything that would anger or displease Allah Fatima may Allah be pleased with her died after the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam by 6 months so who did the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam marry after Khadijah the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam married 10 women after Khadijah after the death of Khadijah he married two SAA B zah may Allah be pleased with her Anda SAA was approximately The Prophet's age which was 50 plus at the time when he married her Anda was a young child so he just had the marriage contract without consummating the marriage and this was by the instruction of Allah and then the prophet Marat the daughter of Omar his close companion so AA was the daughter of Abu Bakr his close companion and then he married Zab bin jash and Zab was his cousin and she was married to his so-called son through adoption before Allah abolished adoption in Islam so she wasn't at the time his daughter-in-law because there was no adoption and her husband was z may Allah be pleased with him he's the only companion's name to be mentioned in the Quran and their story was mentioned in the Quran as well in chapter 33 where adoption was abolished and abrogated then the prophet mam also among those whom he had married Zab B hus and Z lived with the prophet only for one year and few months and she died in the lifetime of the Prophet Alam so Khadijah and Zab both died in the lifetime of the Prophet Alat wasam and she was a really righteous Pious woman who was known to be the mother of the needy why because she used to feed the poor and the needy and the orphans and she used to dedicate her life to them and the prophet also married Sal of course z the prophet married her as a form of showing his gratitude and pity at the same time when her husband died so most of those whom the prophet married Alat were either widows like in the case of ha of Zab B of um Sal may Allah be pleased with her um Sal was a widow and her husband Abu Sal was the prophet's brother through suckling so when she was stranded with children and an immigrant in Medina with no one the prophet stepped in to marry herat wasam which she opposed in the beginning saying that I'm an old woman I have children and I'm extremely jealous I can't be your wife so the prophet said you're not older than me and your children will be under my wing I'll take care of them as for your jealousy I will ask Allah to remove it and so this is what happened then the prophet married umab Ram B ABI sufyan who was one of the first to migrate to abisinia and when her husband died the prophet proposed to her when she was in abin as well and married her then there was maymuna B and maymuna B is the sister of z b k may Allah be pleased with them all and we've mentioned her story before that their mother had a number of daughters I don't remember now maybe nine or 10 who were married to dignitaries of qu so Muna B one of her sisters is which is or who is the wife of Al Abbas the mother of Abdullah Abbas Abbas and the other one is who was married to or the opposite is married to AB and is married to Al the mother of khid uh uh to uh she was married to Al who is the father of KH so imagine the prophet Sall wasam was married to the aunt of Abdullah Abbas and at the same time this is the web that the prophet Sall alhi wasallam married so many women for to have alliances to have allies among all of Arabia among the the the dignitaries and the families of Arabia and then the prophet mam saf B whose father and husband were Jews and then she accepted Islam after them being killed for betraying the Muslims and their treachery and the prophet mared her to honor her and finally the prophet married uh well Muna we spoke she was the last one the prophet had married Sall Ali wasallam but before that he married also from the tribe of Al and the prophet married her in order to honor her and her tribe who were captive and prisoners of War but when the prophet married heram the Muslims released all these prisoners and freed them for the honor of the mother of the Believers and these are all women that the prophet wasallam married them all of them the only virgin was AA and the rest were all either widowed or uh uh divorces or women who were in distress and had no one to care for them and the prophet stepped in to do this Noble job and we know the great role and importance of having so many wives around the prophet Salli wasallam who managed to convey to us everything that happened in his home in his privacy and how he dealt with things that other men could not see because it was concealed in his house so we know exactly how the prophet lived inside outat through his marriages to these Noble mothers of ours all of his wives are mothers of the Believers may Allah be pleased with them all [Music] [Music] AC [Music] for"
