  "transcript": "Sam from Canada how are I'm doing great alhamdulillah alhamdulillah my question is um when somebody goes to the Masjid and the Imam is uh reciting loud prayer either FAA or another Surah should the follower just say allahar and just listen right away or should he recite no the most authentic opinion is that if you join the Imam while he is reciting whether the fa or another Surah in aoud raak you just say allahar and listen you don't say anything at all now is reciting the fa mandatory upon me it's an issue of dispute and according to the Maliki which is the most authentic that the recitation of the IM of the faat though weren't there is sufficient for you if you would like to recite the fa while he's doing his recitation there's no problem you can do that but if you just simply listen and go to r with him your prayer is 100% valid"
