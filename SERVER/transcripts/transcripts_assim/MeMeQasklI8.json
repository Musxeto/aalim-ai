  "transcript": "a brother sent us an email he says almost 99% of the people from the subcontinent always say jazakallah instead of jazakallahu khayran or jazakallah who hair what is the correct way okay now linguistically this is valid I know that the people may object and say what does jazakallah mean the answer is may Allah reward you but in Arabic jezik or reward can be for evil and for good so I can say jazakallahu khayran which translates to may Allah rewards you goodness higher or I could say jazakallahu Sharen may Allah reward you with evil with torment with punishment so this caused some confusion with the brothers so when someone says just like Allah and he says okay what good or bad so they complain an object you should not say that without any doubt the best way is to say it full because the Prophet as Salam ordered us to reward people by making dua for them he said whoever says jazakallahu khayran to his brother then he had praised him and exceeded in praising him so the Prophet is telling us um that the Sunnah is to say jazakallah hi Ron but linguistically it is correct so it all depends on the circumstantial evidences around you if I do you a favor if I help you by opening the door or carrying a heavy box with you and you say to me jazakallah I shouldn't be angry because this is a situation where he is obviously thanking me anyone on the streets would say yes he's thanking him I shouldn't make an issue of it and say yeah but he didn't say hi run he did say in goodness he just said jazakallah this is sufficient the scholars say that this is acceptable but it's a secondary grade and level the best of all is to say it complete jazakallahu khayran analyzer knows best"
