  "title": "Is studying Philosophy permissible in Islam? (Made a mistake in the title of the video) apologiesâ€¦",
  "transcript": "the knowledge of allah's beautiful names and attributes the knowledge of the quran of the sunnah of it can be beneficial but permissible or a communal obligation such as chemistry physics math medicine etc these are beneficial but they're not related to the deen if some of the people learn it then the rest of the community are exempted from any sin and there are sciences or knowledge that is permissible to learn because it has no good things in it and no bad things in it so someone likes to pick up photography as a hobby or to be a carpenter or to learn car mechanics this can be beneficial it can have no value to him depending and there are sciences that are prohibited either to their nature such as the science of knowing how things can be through uh um astrology and studying the movement of the of the stars and the zodiacs so you are a scorpion then this is what will happen in the future this is totally prohibited and it's blasphemous it takes you out of the fold of islam knowledge related to music if you go and study music or the arts this is haram knowledge music is haram studying theater or cinema is also related to haram jobs and studying of philosophy so what do people study in philosophy philosophy teaches people how to be independent from everything even from religion so you as a philosopher claiming to be wise you must get rid of all these thoughts and ideas an ideology that handles your free thinking you're a free thinker so you don't believe except what your logic tells you to believe my logic tells me that there isn't any invisible creatures such as angels or devils there is no heaven in hell my logic may tell me that there is no god though philosophers say that there is a god but he does not speak and you do not speak to him so the quran is not allah's word subhanallah and they don't definitely believe in the hereafter and the day of judgment so all what philosophers talk about is nonsense with all due respect and they disbelief in the fundamentals of religions specifically in the fundamentals of islam and they think that the philosopher is in a higher state than a prophet and this is blasphemous so this is why the vast majority if not all of the scholars of islam say that studying philosophy is prohibited so many people who were highly decorated students of knowledge who who studied who studied hadith when they went to the disbelieving countries to kafir countries and studied islam there they got deviated and they were brainwashed to talk against their own religion through philosophy they could not understand islam until they it studied it in these kafir countries so so it's this shows you how dangerous studying philosophy and the likes at such countries when you don't have strong foundation in alpeda and this is why scholars say that is totally prohibited to study it now sometimes i'm doing english literature i'm doing something that deals with business or some but there is a mandate course in philosophy that i have to study otherwise i would not graduate in this case you may study it while abhorring and disbelieving everything that is in it and you do that out of necessity while consulting scholars to back you up all the way in order to enforce your iman and allah azza best"
