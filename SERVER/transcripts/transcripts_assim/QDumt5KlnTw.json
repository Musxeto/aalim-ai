  "transcript": "bangladesh can we support disbelievers in their sports so italy is playing with um england i think i don't know so if we uh support england or support italy would we be committing an act of coforno it wouldn't but this is a little bit ridiculous with all due respect then uh you are supporting the tactics the art used in this game you like this coach you like this player the way he uh maneuvers not their religion so by supporting them there is nothing that impacts your religion though i'm totally against watching uh football matches it's a waste of time for a proper muslim 90 minutes watching 20 people running after a ball as i always say buy a ball for each one of them and let them be content with it instead of fighting over one ball and not only that if you play that's good but watching them supporting them i would consider this to be waste of time haram no it's not haram when the byzantians fought at the time of the prophet salaam with the persians who were fire worshipers all the muslims took the side of the byzantians who are christians while the idol worshipers of quraish took the side of the persians because they were pagans and idol worshippers fire worshipers like them not people of the book so the muslims supported the christians in their uh fight against these five worshipers you"
