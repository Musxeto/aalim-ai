  "transcript": "my question is as I already told you previously that I have a problem that M comes out anytime so for that you told me to make woodoo for every prayer and if you see a Mii stand on underwear then simply sprinkle water over it no need to change and you can pray so I doing this in every prayer because underwear is BET all the time now because of making Voodoo five times and I'm unable to know whether M had come out or not so I'm sprinkling water every time is this right and I don't see sometimes any little St okay listen to me listen to me fan now first of all I'll assume that my hearing is not correct and you did not say in the beginning wedy because wedi and Medi are different two things so most likely you meant Medi and I'll assume that this is what you've said in the beginning and it was my hearing that was wrong secondly the default is that if there is nothing coming out that you don't sprinkle water and you don't perform woodo you only perform wo when you're certain that something something was emitted something was discharged and this thing is continuous so it is great hardship for you to uh um perform M any every time it comes out out this is called in the books of and it's similar to someone with or with uran incontinence because they cannot find enough space of time to purify themselves and perform and pray without anything coming out they have this concession in Shar due to the hardship that whenever the aan is called you go clean yourself if there is traces of Med you sprinkle it or wash it or change your underwear make wood and go and pray even if it comes out no problem because it is continuously coming out and there is great hardship you cannot live with that now if you don't have 24 hours 7 days a week continuous discharge rather it happens only after you UR and after 10 15 minutes you're fine in this case no you cannot apply this ruling you have to wait until you are not emitting anything wash yourself change your underwear or wash it and wash the affected area make W and pray now if you continue to the other Salat the following Salat and you don't feel any discharge coming out you don't have any proof of it and your woodo is intact no need to perform wo again you can pray as you are I hope this answers your question"
