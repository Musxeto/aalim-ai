  "transcript": "a person who did not give his name said how should we give also to the people who died due to the coffin 19 and how to perform funeral prayers I heard Hospital wraps the dead body with plastic and sent directly to graveyard in this situation what is to be done according to Islam first of all this is only done by ignorance even medical doctors say that this is nonsense the World Health Health Organization said that coffin 19 is not transferred through washing it is transferred through touching a surface that is affected by it and by breathing that that person does not breathe so if we have a dead corpse and you have your masks and gloves you can wash that individual without any problem shroud him after his shrouded you're totally protected normal people can carry him without a fear of contracting that deadly virus and he can be preyed upon buried in the normal Islamic way without any problem it is not contagious to wash a dead body of a person who died due to covered 19"
