  "title": "Why muslims don't advance in science?",
  "transcript": "why Muslims not advanced in science and technology I don't know because they're lazy probably first of all second of all because they've passed an era of ignorance in the past 200 years when they were conquered by France England Portugal uh uh and other country who conquered them for tens if not hundreds of years and that is why they need a lot of time to catch up second reason is because their governments usually are corrupt and they do not support technological advances they'd rather keep the money for themselves and use extortion embattlement bribes just to run their country third of all it is very unfair to look at today's advancement in America or in Europe and neglecting the centuries of advancement in what is so-called Middle Ages they are our Golden Ages where the Muslims far exceeded any technological or scientific advancement of any other country when the people of Spain and Europe used to send their children to Muslim countries to learn from their advancement in technology if you go to history you would find that the Muslims the scientists they are the ones who founded the foundation of to's modernization whether in medicine whether in jebra and Al jebra comes from the uh uh scientist jab and and he is jabber Al jebra and if you look at physics if you look even at numbers the world did not have zero until the Muslims invented the zero imagine the world without zeros you just go from one to nine and then you cannot write anything except doubling this or doing this or that the Z was invented by Muslims and this was in their Golden Era now don't look at the past 70 or 100 years where the Muslims were a little bit behind they're catching up alhamdulillah there are a number of excellent researchers and scientists worldwide but unfortunately they are adapted by the non-muslim countries like in the US or in Europe whenever they see uh an advanced um researcher in medicine or in in physics or in nuclear energy instead of him going back to benefit his country they offer him uh citizenship they offer him or her uh money position and they give them what they need most which is the facilities to continue the researches and they backed them up with excellent budgets this is not found in Muslim countries because of the the the the the lifestyle of these countries but it is picking up alhamdulillah and Allah knows"
