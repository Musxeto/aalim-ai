  "transcript": "sadika from bangladesh this time after my period i see my purity like the white thread discharged and i take my major ritual birth and he started praying but after one day i spotted some brown discharge does that impact on my purity do i need to take major but again okay now spotting and colored discharges have two times to appear first time is when a woman is pure she's living normally and all of a sudden prior to her menses she may get these brownish yellowish or spotting discharges the most authentic opinion is that she must ignore if she's pure and she gets these discharges before her menses she must ignore them until the flow of the blood is established because high menstruation in arabic linguistically means to flow and they say when the valley is flowing so some women get these brownish discharges accompanied by cramps back pain for three four days they stop praying hoping that their menses will come and all of a sudden it stops and they don't have anything for four or five days and they call what to do well you're wrong you should not have done what you had done in stopping prayer so this is scenario number one when you get the brownish discharges or the spotting before your menses starts you disregard it scenario number two is when you have your menses and on the fifth day or sixth day the flow of the blood stops you do not see your purity and you see these regular yellowish or brownish discharges mother aisha the women at her time used to send her their pads asking her is this white discharge is this sufficient for us to make russell and she says do not hasten until you see your purity which means that brownish and yellowish discharges connected to menses at the end is part of the menses so these are the two scenarios in regards of your brownish or colored discharges now the question is if my not mine if a woman says if my period is over and i see my purity okay now you take hosuh and after that i see brownish discharges or yellowish or spotting not the flow of blood in this case this falls under the first scenario you ignore it simply wash yourself change this impurity and make fresh wudu before you pray and allah azza knows best you"
