  "transcript": "I never hey man hamdulillah never bill alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa vomit and anatomy nabina muhammad in wa and he was happy woman if today we had he he was send a mission that he either a yummy team my god oh dear brothers sisters in islam assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wa barakato and welcome to this forty something I don't know let me check 47th episode of the Islamic club short book and we stopped at the pillars the essentials for marriage and the scholars say that our can the pillars for a valid marriage are free now you remember we said that there are what is known as pillars there are conditions and there are other things that are mandatory in the nakai in the marriage so the pillars that without the marriage would be invalid are as follows the first one is to have the marriage taking place without having any obstacles so the two parties the wife and husband should be free of any reason that prevents a marriage and we spoke about that earlier when we were talking about the conditions of marriage such obstacles would be that they are siblings the man and the girl we're breastfed by the same woman for example with the conditions of course no as we will come and discuss later on a Shalala marrying a woman while being married to her niece or to her aunt this is not permissible the Prophet isin prohibited combining between a woman and her niece marrying two sisters this is not permissible as mentioned in the Quran in chapter 4 certainly said marrying someone who is of a different religion that we cannot marry from so a man cannot marry a Hindu woman by Buddhists an atheist he can only marry a Muslim a Jew or a Christian woman and a Muslim woman cannot marry anyone who is not Muslim so all of these are obstacles that prevent marriage from taking place the second pillar is what is known as proposal and the proposal happens from the woman's guardian and we said that the guardian is the father and we mentioned that this is one of the conditions of marriage to have a guardian but we have a guardian a pillar of nikka of marriage that the Guardian gives the proposal by saying I give you my daughter in manager in the conditions we said proper identification so if he has five daughters saying I give you my daughter in marriages was not valid he has to identify the eldest the youngest her name by description that cannot be ambiguous this is known as the proposal in Arabic is called a job and the third pillar is acceptance al-kabun and this is done by the groom or those who represent him now in the midst of copied 19 a lot of marriages have been postponed and delayed due to lack of travel due to you know the reasons so I get a lot of calls from a brother and a sister living in America and the father is in India or in Africa and they cannot travel to conduct the marriage so can they do it through Skype so the father calls the boy and he says I give you my daughter in marriage and he names his daughter the groom must say I accept her marriage to myself so this acceptance is a must now in your text books you will find this last phrase after mentioning these three pillars it says the commitment must precede the acceptance meaning that the guardian of the girl has to say I give you my daughter in marriage I give you my sister in marriage and the groom says I accept if it was reversed by the group going and saying uncle I would like to marry your daughter Fatima and Guardian says son I give you my daughter Fatima in marriage according to our textbook this is not valid and it is not accepted yet this is not the most authentic opinion saying it is not accepted is the opinion of the humbly school of thought which I follow and saying that it is accepted regardless who initiated it is the opinion of the vast majority of schools of thought and I am inclined to that opinion simply because the Quran and the Sunnah support it as for the Sunnah in an authentic hadith a man was in the presence of the Prophet Aristotle Silla when a woman came stood in front of the Prophet Allah saw Sarah and said o prophet of Allah I give myself to you in marriage now this is known in Arabic the one who gave herself to the Prophet in marriage Allah Heba nafs aha the Prophet looked at her and looked elsewhere showing that he's not interested a man stood up and said o prophet of Allah if you don't want to marry her then let me marry her so the Prophet also asked him how much he has to offer as a dowry etc then the Prophet said Alice of Salaam I give her to you in marriage the Prophet was the guardian so the man's proposal or shall we say the man's acceptance preceded the proposal of the Prophet a sorcerer which supports the opinion of the majority of schools of thought that in normal cases when we go to propose to a woman in her house so all the men come from the boys side and the men from the girls side are sitting her uncle's brother cetera then they speak if this is an engagement they would say we are interested in your girl and they would say you are more than welcome and of story acceptance of engagement proposal but not marriage but if the man says to the girl's father uncle I want to marry your daughter Ayesha and the father says you are mother welcome my son I accept this is valid and it's a it's a happy marriage of course in the presence of two Muslim male witnesses and some schools of thought insist on using special terminology so they say you have to say and touka even a tea or the well she took her dignity and he responds by saying ability to Nika haha Bible to sahaja ha and they say that if you use any other terminology this is not valid and this is not true if you propose an English son I'd like to give you my sister in marriage or daughter in marriage and the man says whoa at school I'm all for it that's that's the job he doesn't have to say a bill 20 caja or accept marrying her any statement of approval does the job insha'Allah who as well we move on to the chapter that deals over the section that deals with the dowry dowry in Arabic means sadaqa sadaqa or Mahalo so either way it's the same thing that is paid for a girl and the Arabic term sadoc is derived from a root that means truth it refers to the money that the groom must give to his bride in connection with the marriage contracts and this is backed by the Quran by the Sunnah by the consensus of scholars of thought that no marriage is possible without giving compensation financial compensation to the woman allah azza wajal says in the quran and give their women upon marriage the bridal gift graciously we are to Nisa asado party in nella with happiness don't give the money the dowry while you are hesitant or hating that analysis to those with whom you seek to enjoy marriage you shall give the dollar the dollars or the dowry due to them and the Prophet Elisha loves them in the previously mentioned hadith of that woman who gave herself to the Prophet when the man Allah saw when the man said o prophet of Allah if you have not interested in her marry me to her the Prophet asked him what money do you have and the man did not have anything so the Prophet said look even for a ring made of iron and the man who has stone broke nothing he does not possess a thing not a penny so the Prophet asked him about what he memorizes from the Quran and he asked about what clothes about a sword about a shield anything when the man said he doesn't have anything the Prophet Allah so salam ordered him to marry her through teaching her sorors of the quran and most likely this was an alternative for something that is tangible something that is financial nowadays we get rich women insisting that their dowry would be ayatul kursi for example also at so-and-so this is not something that is recommended in Islam that was an exceptional case for that man because he had nothing but for those who possess wealth or money the dowry should be in money or something that is tangible something that can be compensated and returned just in case the marriage is needed to be dissolved a woman needs to leave the marriage and files for fuller she has to give back her dowry but if her doubt is ayatul kursi how is she going to pay her husband back so it has to be something financial if the man is capable of paying it the following section now ok let us go back to dowry because the book did not mention these things let me try to think of things might benefit you and not mention a lot of the people think that giving the dowry is essential to consummate the marriage in order to sell Rosati so in order to get the marriage consummated the dowry has to be paid and this is not true the dowry can either be paid in advance the marriage night is in two months time and I give the dowry in advance two months it can be given on the same night it can be a loan postponed to later on and a lot of unfortunately a lot of the men delay giving the dowry until the woman dies and this I have seen so many times getting questions about this a man says or the children say that our mother died last week and our father did not pay her the maja the dowry the sabaha so is he entitled to keep it or this is part of the inheritance the wealth that must be divided the answer is it's just like a normal loan it has to be paid off now a word of advice a lot of the sisters don't need the dowry so they don't ask for it however this is their right in Islam and it's part of their savings so this means that if you got married and your dowry was 5000 euros and he did not ask for it or take it every single year you should include these 5000 euros in yours account and give 2.5% why should because it's alone and you're not asking your husband to pay it off so either ask him every single year to pay it off to you because this is your god-given right if he's broke and he cannot pay it does a cat is delayed no problem but if he is capable of doing it but you're ashamed of asking him or you don't want to you have to give the cat every single year how to escape this either he pays oh you forgive him so he tells you okay 5,000 euros inshallah I'll pay to you next month you see I don't want it it's a gift from me or you say well give me 1,000 euros I need to do my teeth I want to buy a new glasses and keep the rest as a gift no problem because Allah mentioned this in the beginning of chapter 4 certainly sir that if they are kind enough to give you wholeheartedly or some of your doubt that you'd paid there's no problem that among the things that needs to be addressed is that in Islam the Dow is given from the boy to the girl all financial expenses are covered by the boy the girls side of the family do not have to spend a penny and unfortunately we see nowadays this trend of imitating the Hindus where the men live off their wives we see unfortunately a lot of the Muslims and I have come across or actually I usually get across such issues on weekly basis where the girl says that I married a man and his family they're haunting me every single day for a dowry and I asked but this is not Islamic she says yes I know the area we live in is dominated by Hindus so his family are expecting my family to purchase a flat and apartment and this is okay if the girl's family wants to purchase a flat or an apartment so that they can live without paying rent no problem the problem is when they register it in his name not in hers this is dowry what did what does he do to deserve such wealth by marrying their daughter he's the one who's supposed to financially provide for her and give her the dowry the house the furniture the walima party of the wedding the whole nine yards this is a man's duty and responsibility but in these countries in the subcontinent India Pakistan Bangladesh the boy's family due to their Hindu roots due to their disbelief or let us say lack of commitment and submission to Allah Sharia they demand an apartment and I've seen people demanding a car and not any car they say to the girl's family you have to buy our son a Corolla Toyota 2021 not 2022 because it's almost over what is this this is so shameful of the boy and of his family to demand such things the dowry is only from the boys side to the girls side and likewise all financial obligations such as the wedding such as furniture etc yes if the girl's family want to contribute in giving gifts the gifts must be in the girl's name so if they want to furnish her house so this is okay the bedroom the kitchen appliances their conditionings it's all on us but it's a gift to our daughter so if they were to split she takes everything back to her in normal cases the whole house is furnished by the husband and he's the one who is supposed to take everything if there were to be a divorce and this is also part of the shameful acts in these areas of the world when the in-laws the parents of the girl keep the dowry keep the gold of the woman of the bride they have no shame they keep all her gold jewelry gifts maja and refused to hand it over to her because she's living in their house and they say we will keep it for you I'm not a child for you to keep it for me you are crooks you are thieves concealing my stuff like this against my wealth and I have come across a lot of issues where divorce takes place and they confiscate all of her stuff and refused to give her a penny on the day of judgment they will face Alonzo gel as thieves and they will be thrown in hell for their major crime which is stealing anyhow what are the material rights this is a big topic and the the book mentions very little which is a tip of the iceberg and I don't want to convert this filthy book into a course about marriage you can find this free inshallah on my youtube channel where I would the grace of Allah did about eight hours maybe 16 hours of after God a weekend course called half Dean and I made that in India Chennai so you can find that watch it may be benefit from it if Allah is willing so marital rights a valid marriage contract creates many rights for both husband and wife these are one the wife's rights so what are the wives rights there are so many so many mentioned in the Quran and the Sunna unfortunately we cannot be any elaborate a lot on it just to save time so the first right that is mentioned here is the dowry and we gone through that number two being looked after it is your wife's right in Islam to look after her I don't want to tell you how many in Europe reverse this and they said home playing with their PlayStation all day long was the woman works comes back from work takes care of the children of the cooking of the cleaning and provides for the husband money because he doesn't work and he seems to be happy with that and this is shameful Allah Azza WA JAL mentions in the quran average Allu our moon our let me say ba-ba-ba-ba-ba then will be man woman am worried him men are guardians over women due to two reasons one Allah so gel has favored them over women too because of their financial spending their providing for the wives and this is why scholars say if a man cannot provide for his wife financially she can easily leave this marriage and file for divorce she's not sinful she's not a charity organization giving with that account this is a marriage contract you paid money which is the dowry in exchange for services but this dowdy is not a one life payment once in a lifetime payment this is the first deposit you have to take care of her child allah azzawajal says in the quran to provide from them a housing according to your ability and Allah and the Prophet said that his salat WA Salam that you should be kind to them feed them of what you eat clothe them of what you wear shelter them and never beat their faces and never criticized how they look and if we were to just expand on this hadith Allah knows how long it will take us so not only physical abuse is prohibited in Islam also mental abuse look how fat you are look how ugly you why don't you fix your hair why did you do something about your weight what did you do something about these black circles around your eyes why don't you put some makeup whiten your teeth do something I would've a laser okay you're as ugly as a monkey what is this this is a major sin not what it is and you're sinful and if you had guts to look in the mirror and see how ugly your face is or how bad your mouth smells or how big your belly is you fail to see your toes for the past 10 years and you're criticizing how she looks you have a problem these are the rights of women in Islam a wife must be respected must be valued her parents did not bring her up to throw her in the garbage where she's living at the moment they brought her up to be honored to be respected they gave you the most valuable thing in their lives so you should take care of that and you should be grateful for that so being looked after it's not just only food clothes medical care and a shelter it is also a lot other than that but these are what they call the tangible aspects so we have tangible aspects where a husband is obliged to provide for his wife and there are intangible aspects so when we when it comes to the dowdy to being looked after the these are tangible you can you know monetize it is that I spent this much and this much but when it comes to intangible actions well the third part is sexual intercourse a woman got married and she came as a normal human being interested in having intimacy work with her spouse allah azza wajal described the spouses of being a cloth to one another so each one is metaphorically the clothes of the other so it's not a one-way street you desire her she desires you as well and a [Music] number of men are neglectful of such a fact some of them are impotent they are unable to fulfill their wives desires due to physical inability or to mental to whatever and this is haram because if a woman is in a marriage and the husband does not take care of her desires and intimate needs this is opening the gate way for Shaitaan to make her fall into sin it's like saying okay I'm not gonna feed you I'm gonna make you starve until you die and when she goes and steals food to eat instead of dying you're accused of stealing this is not the right thing to do we have to protect women from falling into temptation so it is part of her god-given right to be sexually fulfilled with her husband number for proper companionship and kind treatment Allah says in the Quran and live with them in kindness while she will not build mahu and this is mutual between men and women so women are also supposed to live in kindness and proper chemical companionship with their husbands and the husband's are ordered clearly in the Quran so live with them in kindness means that you don't beat them you don't physically or mentally abuse them you don't torture them you don't do like some quote unquote male companions do to their wives when they restrict their movement to the extent that they say you cannot go to your parents house and your siblings cannot visit you what is this so lousy confinement this is not presently if Allah gave you the right to be obeyed Allah did not give you the right to transgress allah gave you the right to be obeyed in such incidents for the continuity of the manege but when you become a tyrant prevent her from going out and people from visiting her preventing her from using the phone or the mobile or the internet or anything this is solid solitary confinement this is prison the woman is way better off in her father's house such women should fight for her give me one reason why I should stay with such an imbecile whose if it was in his head he would have even blocked air so that I can breathe give me one reason this is not a marriage marriage is something that is filled with compassion mercy allah azza wajal made it from among his signs that he created for one another a man and a woman so that they would shelter to one another is your wife feeling that you are her shelter or you are her torment and prison cell number five among the rights of the girl of the wife upon us man is to be fair and fairness comes handy and necessary when a person is married to more than one wife if he has only one wife usually by default he has to be fair because there's no one to compare her with but when there is another wife and he has two or more wives here he is being scrutinized and allah azza wajal stated in the Quran that you may marry a second a third a fourth wife providing that you're fair so if you are afraid that you won't be fair and just between them then only marry one what is meant by fairness meaning that you provide for them equally in the sense that you have a suitable home for each one that you provide both of them with the same facilities that you give them gifts equally and that you share your time with them equally as well and this sometimes is not applicable 100% for example I got married to my first wife after 20 years I managed to build a house a big house and each one of my children has his own separate room and I was well off back then then they need to get married again came up so I got married to a second wife I rented a flat of three or four rooms for her she has no children and now she's complaining she say no I need a big villa like your first wife am I supposed to the answer is No am I being fair that says yes how am i fair first of all the villa the house was built before the presence of the second wife so there is no equality or fairness here needed it's like saying to me listen your first wife over the durations of 20 years you bought her gold jewelry you took her to countries of vacation now you have to compensate me no I had to compensate you thing I did that when she was alone now you hold me accountable after our marriage so we got married for some January whatever I did to my first wife which is not part of maintenance rather it's part of gifts you can have the same share so now her house is big requires a hefty electricity bill and your apartment is a quarter of that no problem you're not fair yes I am fair what do you want me to do this is your expenditure her family is ten people yours is one so I buy groceries and meat in accordance to their number and for your house I buy groceries chicken meat fish whatever according to our number with two of us only so this is fairness now if I go to Cairo for two weeks and I take her I have to give you a similar vacation let's say to Casablanca Morocco Arab country other country almost the same this is being fair if I were to buy her a bottle of perfume I must pay the exact amount for you maybe a different brand usually but the same money and if the money is different I have to put cash into it and I used to do that when I was married too long ago I used to buy a bottle of perfume to my first wife and it was like 500 Rios and other perfume bottle are buy for my second wife which is as good Coco Chanel and Yves and Laurent or whatever but it is fifty reals less so I used to give her the gift with a banknote of fifty reals just to escape the wrath of allah azzawajal you have to be fair in spending the time one night here one night there three nights here three night there a week here a week there but if someone says are my first wife has five children so I have to spend more time with them so I'll spend four days with them a week and because you don't have children I'll spend three days this is Haram or I say I'll spend the weekend with you and five days with them this is how you have to be fair so there are so many things when it becomes a part of your life that you must fulfill the rights of your wife and there's so many rights you'll find that in the course I told you about and maybe if next time I see it fit or people ask for it maybe we will we can expand on it a little bit but inshallah this is all what is needed for you guys to learn about so we move on to the questions leaving the rights of the husband to next Thursday insha'Allah soldier but zero says if Muslim man says Quran discriminates women can I call him a character well this is a very difficult situation can there be a person criticizing the Quran the norm generally speaking we have something called tak fear on Mayan and we have the tech field Alam takfeer Alam meaning giving takfeer in general not specifying a particular individual so we say anyone who steps on the Quran is a kafir agree everybody says definitely you set foot on the Koran you're a caption anyone who says that the Koran is unfair or unjust is the capture agree yep anyone saying that river is halal is a capture no problem now when we come to implement these general rulings on a specific individual so we have here mr. Abdullah Abdullah says that while I was walking one day it was so dark I stepped on something so I turned on the light and I found that what I stepped on was the Koran shall we imply implement the rule we've mentioned for earlier anyone who steps on the Koran is a kafir mmm sure it was an error he didn't mean it that will help answer is correct then he says that due to I was recently any converted to Islam didn't know Arabic once a person said to me that Islam says do this do that for answers do this do that and being impulsive and thinking that there's no way Islam consists such a thing I said no this discriminates this is unfair but when people told me about it I came to back to my senses and I said Sakura I was wrong so is he a kafir answer is no question number three if a person says Reba Holland this is good for but wait Abdallah here says Reba is solid is that true Abdullah's know how the villa libras Haram it's mentioned the Quran in the Sun let's it's Haram so what did you mean up the law he said he repays Haram but the interest that I pay to the bank in exchange for a loan this is business this is not River River is in gold and silver I'm taking cash this is not RIBA ah so our Dulles problem is with understanding the meaning of RIBA in identifying the meaning of RIBA whether this falls on the river or not but the concept of RIBA being Haram he has no disputing that so he's miss interpreting this does not take him out of the fold of Islam so now we come back to your question before you pass ero if a person says the quran discriminates women we sit him down usually not me scholar so Islam Muslim judges to investigate what he meant by that so if he says yes Islam or the Quran discriminates against women why would Allah favor men over women and mentions this in diversity of just recited el regalo agua moon are Lannister men are guarding over women due to what Allah has favorite men upon them why would Allah do this so Ali watch your steps carefully are you claiming that a lies unfair and unjust if he is defined if he is insisting this means that the conditions are fulfilled he's not misinterpreting he's not ignorant we've shown it to him he is not having any ambiguity he did not make any mistake you know the man who lost his camel in the desert and on it was his food and everything and water when he realized that he was a dead man in this huge desert he took a nap when he woke up he found the camel next to his head he grabbed a rope and out of joy he said allahumma and time D o Allah you are my servant and I am your slave sorry you are my servant and I am your Lord the Prophet said ask them i meantioned a farmer he made a mistake out of extreme joy now does anyone say that this mistake would put him in hell so when there is misinterpretation when there is ambiguity when there is no clarity when the man is making an error when he doesn't know all of these are conditions and obstacles obstacles from giving tech field but if all conditions were fulfilled and all obstacles were eliminated and the man is defined he is insisting RIBA is not Haram and what was mentioned in the Quran is not correct this is a blatant kafir however try your level best to avoid giving tech field to anyone because this is the role of Muslim judges and scholars they have to identify the fulfillment of the conditions and the elimination of the obstacles for us we see people giving takfeer day and night somebody come share my husband doesn't pray he hasn't prayed for twenty years and he doesn't fast and he always does bad things and he doesn't believe that it is man the theory to do this or that so is he a kafir am i divorced so she's giving takfeer in order to get away from such a marriage and this is problematic dipping tech field is one of the characteristics of al-hawa Ridge so be careful from falling into such dungeons so bio says why is this lamb saying on Xena in marriage this doesn't make any sense spider if you are asking about a married person committing adultery this is a major sin if he is not married and committing fornication this is a major sin if you meant that they were fornicators and got married while being fornicators without repenting the marriage contract is void is invalid you have to redo it so your question doesn't make any sense okay but I hope you found your answer in what I had said nutri says a female Muslim single parent used the profit from savings certificates to meet the family needs now she is repenting and wants to calculate the profit of those years and give it away how can this be done well she has to go to her bank and check the financial statements or her statements over these years and calculate how much she took from that and try her level best to pay it off if she is still poor and needy and doesn't have money to pay it off then Allah is most forgiving sha Allah due to the fact that she was in desperate need Sanji de says is it permissible for a girl to abroad for higher studies before getting married I think she is asking about travelling to pursue her higher degree before marriage this includes the number of things that we have to be careful about first of all if she's traveling she must not travel without the companionship of a mailman traveling without a male muharram is prohibited in Islam the Prophet said that is salatu salam nya Hindu l'americain told me to be Latino male a hip and to Sapphira ulema ID Maha it is not prohibited for a woman who believes in Allah on the day of judgment to travel without a male Muharram so he has to be an adult he has to be male he has to be a Mahad a man she can never marry such as a father a son a brother a cause a uncle paternal uncle or a nephew or a father-in-law or a son-in-law etc secondly if she is to study abroad the school has to be segregated she can't study in a mixed school or university where men and women sit freely mixing talking chit-chatting boys coming to college with shorts girls coming in many skirts and this is not befitting of a Muslim girl to go to and she's a girl she's not obliged to open a house provide for her husband and children she's a female she's to get married to be honored and to get her provision while sitting home her husband does all the dirty work so if the conditions are fulfilled that is she travels with a male Muharram the University is segregated or at least men and women don't sit next to each other don't communicate and it is safe for her then this might be okay in Sharma ideal Ahmed says when I was young I did not realize how badly I was transgressing while backbiting now I have truly come to realize the wrongs I was committing is it enough if I ask Allah for forgiveness or should I ask the people as well as I do not remember who the who they were or where they are is it enough to ask Allah for forgiveness the origin of the problem is that the Prophet said on his salat wa sallam Johannes Oh people who ever wronged his brother then he must clear it before the day of judgement meaning clear it in this dunya for on the day of judgment there is no dirham or dinar there is no dollars or Euros or reals there is only good deeds and bad deeds which means that you cannot compensate someone else by paying from your wallet like you do here in life you I'd make a mistake i wronged you in any way I said he forgive me you should know I'm not gonna forgive me you hurted me really bad said okay this is a thousand dollars will you forgive me now whoa I forgive you man so I can buy my way out on the day of judgement you can't all what you have is your good deeds and bad deeds so you start sharing your good deeds not sharing giving away your good deeds to those who you have wronged and if your good deeds are over but your sins are still you will take from their bad deeds and put it on you and then you will be thrown in hell this is the ideal situation now the only route possible is that you go and meet those who have you had back bitten and say listen forgive me I did this and I did that but the result from such an action would either be oh it's okay I forgive you and this is rare this is like 5% while the majority of people 95% of them they would curse you and say me allah azzawajal curse you i don't want to forgive you i don't want to see your face get out of my face and maybe cause more problems so due to the fact that people would rather escalate than to forgive it is advisable that you don't approach them rather you ask Allah for forgiveness you repent and whenever their name is mentioned you try to mention them with good things that are truly in them in order to any be a kuffara for what you had done and Allah knows best Rabia says thus comparing and saying my family is better than yours for my family knows many things and does better to make themselves look superior over others is a form of Kippur and arrogance most likely yes when you say such phrases that are not called for there is no reason for it you just simply say that my family is bigger than yours my family is richer than yours why are you saying this to belittling to make you false feel small to look down at you this is utter and pure arrogance which is a major sin lyric says can one fast the six days of chaiwallah Mondays and Thursdays and have the reward of both fasting the show well and there were the fasting Mondays and Thursdays that says yes most Muslims I know of they have 30 days of Showa so they fast Mondays and Thursdays Mondays and Thursdays Mondays and Thursdays in the first three weeks and they have accomplished two birds with one stone fasting the six days of Showa and fasting Mondays and Thursdays according to the Sunnah no problem in that normal server second question here in my country the messages now are open but with some restrictions such as leaving the mask on while praying and keeping the distance like two meters between each other is it better to pray at home including praying water instead of jama' or should we go to pray and the mosque with these kinds of rulings I've answered it so many times so the final answer would be that social distancing in prayers is an issue of dispute there are three or four major scholars in Saudi Arabia who say that due to necessity it is permissible and there are scholars that say that there is no real necessity give me a break we go to the supermarkets we go to the shops to the malls and we are like half a meter away from one another or sometimes shoulder-to-shoulder we're wearing masks but nobody says anything when it comes to the message you tell me to stay 2 meters apart what is this and this is for covered 19 it's not a plague it's not a real pandemic that kills the millions worldwide like the Spanish flu for example no they killed what 300 thousand 1 million person worldwide out of 1.7 billion this is nothing so the necessity that necessitates this social distancing in prayer does not seem to be genuine and real but due to the fact that major scholars did give the fatwa if you feel comfortable with it um you may go and pray the normal prayers with the social distancing there's the fact way in that if you don't feel comfortable and you don't feel like you are in a mess you especially with the mask on and with your prayer mat and with the social distancing might as well feel better praying ho this is up to you so there's no problem but I would recommend that Friday would be attended because this is once a week and you can pray outside usually inside would not be enough for a room for the people to pray so there's no problem in attending it to Charla and you pray outside and it's only once a week and Allah so Allah knows best a Frida says in the subcontinent it's a common practice to give salam to the elders by bowing and touching their feet especially on weddings please say something on it sir this is totally prohibited this kind of humility must not be expressed to humans bowing down is a ritual that can be only devoted to allah azzawajal and not to humans so this is not permissible to comply with and the final question is from Mohammed Hemme yen says the woman hair that are no longer part of her head should she bury it or can be thrown out so this is a misconception a lot of the people think that when a woman or a man cut their hair that they should take the hair and bury it but there is nothing in the Sunnah nor in the Koran supporting it so it can't be thrown in the dustbin without any problem in sha allah azzawajal this is all the time we have until we meet you in sha allah next Thursday I leave you fear Manila or Salaam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
