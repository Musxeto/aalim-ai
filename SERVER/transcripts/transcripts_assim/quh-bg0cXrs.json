  "title": "Website holds client's money till delivery until then Agent (me) pays for the product (drop shipping",
  "transcript": "yes so previously you said in Drop Shipping uh Drop Shipping islamically you have the option to act as a agent and purchase products for company from the company like AliExpress and ship them to your client or you can do a slum a Salam transaction which is quite similar however the problem is when the customer pay on your website the website platform holds or keeps the money of the client then upon delivery of the product to the client they pay you later on but initially you have to use your own money to purchase for the client so does this come under the ruling where the Prophet said to not combine a loan and a sale in one transaction thank you no it does not because you did not borrow anything you bought the product yourself and your money which the buyer has transferred is withheld with a third party to ensure the safety of the product reaching them on time and that you're not camming them so inshallah this is fine as long as the rules are followed and Allah Knows Best"
