  "title": "Why did Prophet recommend all men to marry virgins? What about divorcees & widows? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "an anonymous brother says yeah what's the wisdom behind the prophet Alam recommending all men to marry virgins what about the divorced and the widowed women this is a topic that will never go down well with the feminists and I'll be waiting for your hate mail uh and your attacks as usual but why not if you have for a man a woman who is Virgin and someone who was previously married which one would you take which one is recommended give me a break something that is Untouched by a man before is it better or someone who was previously married divorced or widowed for any person would say that no I'd rather take a virgin likewise if a woman was proposed to by two men a divorce or a widow a widower and someone who has never been married before who would she choose or she I would choose the divorce or the widower why oh he has more experience no one would do that so the essence of marriage is to enjoy life and for a man to marry someone who was not married before is more enjoyable than to marry someone who was married before nevertheless this is not a must in the Hadith of abdah may Allah be pleased with him and with his father he came to the prophet Alam and he told him that he got married so the prophet asked him did you marry a virgin or a non virgin so he said no I married a non virgin so the prophet said why wouldn't you have married a virgin who was like you a virgin and both of you would play with one another meaning that you're both fresh don't have previous experiences so you will explore and enjoy your marital life together he explained oh prophet of Allah Abdullah my father died leaving sisters to me who were orphans I did not want to bring someone like them without any previous or prior experience to handling things so I married someone who was a divorce or a widower who is more mature so that she could take care of them and of me the prophet consented the prophet agreed he did not object to thatat so it's not all the time that a virgin is what people uh uh uh um look for now remember the demand for marriage is far lesser than the supply there are so many women out there but the demand to get married to them is fewer and lesser so a man is the Seeker while a female or a girl is the one sought after and not the other way around so this is why it is recommended but for a person who already has a wife and he wants to get married to a second wife would we recommend for him a virgin or as you have already taken one it's best for you to go for a weder or someone who is divorced or this or that of course the latter why because you've got your share of enjoyment now you can do that and fulfill your responsibilities to the community and this is what the prophet used to doat imagine all the wives that the prophet had married sallallahu alaihi wasallam he married only one virgin and that was AA the rest were all either weers or divorced or separated from the husband because they were not Muslims so if the prophet Alam was to restrict himself only to marrying virgins as the questioner may think then that would have been the case with him and he would have married only virgins but he did not sallallahu alai Al wasam"
