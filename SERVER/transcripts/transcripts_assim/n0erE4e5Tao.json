  "transcript": "Ata from USA Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So you know how I live in the USA and the majority of people that are here are non-Muslims. So how can I properly practice Islam here? Jazakum Allahu Khairan Alhamdulillah, Islam can be practiced regardless of the environment you are in. And this is what makes Islam a universal religion that is fit for every generation, every time, till the Day of Judgment, and for every location, even if you are in the North Pole, even if you are in Siberia, in the jungles of Africa. You can practice Islam without any problem. It is a universal religion. So praying on time, fasting, giving Zakat, being honest, being truthful, not cheating, keeping your promises, having good morals, staying away from immodest things, all of this can be done anywhere in the world without any problem. www.mooji.org"
