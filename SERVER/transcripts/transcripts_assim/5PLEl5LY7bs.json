  "transcript": "Umm Mazin from the Philippines? Yes, Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. I have some questions. Number one, is Virgin Mary from the Bible and Maryam in the Holy Quran are the same person? Okay, so in regards to Umm Mazin's first question, is Virgin Mary in the Bible the same as Maryam, the mother of Isa? The answer is yes. She is the same person and is the same person who had the miraculous birth of Isa or Jesus peace be upon him, and she is the same one. Now whether some details may differ in her life and in the life of Maryam, this is probable but it doesn't make them two different people. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
