  "title": "Images or Cartoons on blankets, bedsheets, carpets etc, is it permissible in islam? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh Sheikh what's the ruling on having blankets which have some drawings of living creatures with facial features on themselves and does though do those blankets uh do they have the same like ruling as keeping picture pictures hang on the wall do they prevent angels from entering our room this is an issue of dispute where some Scholars looked at the hadiths that prevent having any drawings on clothes and the permissibility of humilating it and insulting it's like making it as doormats or something that people walk on so it's not glorified and the other party would say no it's totally restricted whether honored or humiliated as when you have it as blankets or bed covers actually you're using it as a form of adornment not as a form of humiliating it and not caring about it and hence I'm inclined to say that all types of drawings of living creatures like humans or animals or even cartoons on clothes or on bed sheets or on carpets and the likes are not permissible and Allah Knows Best"
