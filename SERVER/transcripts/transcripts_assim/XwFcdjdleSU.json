  "title": "Is it sunnah to expose your body in rainwater? - #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "what I wanted to ask you today was is it part of the Sunnah if you're a man to roll up your sleeves and to unveil a couple of other pieces of clothing when it starts to rain so that the rain water could fall on your body it was reported in the authentic Sunnah that whenever rain started pouring down the prophet saws would go out and expose his body to some of that water and saying it is recently close to Allah azzawajal and he seeks Baraka and blessings of Allah through that so yes it is part of the Sunnah to get some of that rain on your body without harming your self and this is a Sunnah it's not something that is mandatory"
