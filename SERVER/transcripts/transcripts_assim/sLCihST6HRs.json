  "transcript": "okay so what is the ruling for me to travel all the way to the kafir country and not only that also apply for citizenship well this generally speaking is prohibited for a muslim who belongs to a muslim country so a muslim from bangladesh a muslim from indonesia a muslim from pakistan a muslim from jordan from egypt from morocco these are all muslim countries yes i agree maybe life is not as comfortable as it is in the west maybe the jobs opportunity and salaries are not as high but you are acknowledged as a muslim and you belong to a muslim country if a person goes to a kafir country and then he's forced to work there or live there for a number of years in order to attain citizenship and not only that maybe he is obliged to marry from that country and then he has to apply and give the pledge of allegiance to the kafir ruler or to the queen or to the crown or to whatever to the constitution this is not permissible for a muslim to do he's compromising his islam his religion for no apparent or valuable reason unless someone comes with a legitimate reason such as i am being prosecuted in my country because i'm a muslim our president is someone who hates islam yes she is a muslim but she is a blatant enemy of islam and she is prosecuting anyone who grows a beard she is prosecuting anyone who prays in the masjid she is arresting a lot of the muslims and killing old scholars for accusations that are not based 40 or 50 years ago and if this is the case and you're fleeing prosecution and there is no other muslim country that would take you in unfortunately because we know that politics is the dirtiest and the filthiest thing on earth and politicians are likewise unfortunately so they would not accept you to come to their country to my knowledge if this is the case and you find only a place like canada to take you in or anywhere else then this is permissible due to necessity if you are a muslim living in a non-muslim country in a cafe country like india for example and they're being prosecuted they're being lynched they're being tortured they're being killed because of the uh prominently uh dominated hindu government and they're killing and torturing muslims though the muslims are almost 200 million but they are the majority the hindus and they are killing our brothers in broad daylight in this case yes you can you're a physician you're a doctor you're a cardiologist you're an engineer the people in the west would accept you go and migrate and take their citizenship there is no problem in that due to necessity however is it advisable you are the judge of your own self i've met in the west families where parents were crying weeping because one of the children or more fled the home he says to me my 17 year old year old daughter who we raised to be a muslim and to pray and to read the quran always rejected hijab and last week she ran away and she said i'm going with my boyfriend don't ask about me whenever i feel like coming back i will come back and she left check we don't know where she is and we can't do anything because if we say anything or do anything the police would arrest us imagine in our islam we are told to reprimand our children and to bring them up to care for them now we cannot even spank them if they don't pray let alone if they go away and do drugs or uh fornicate we can't do anything if we do the children call 9-1-1 and they will come and arrest us so would you want such a faith for you and your children look at the muslim children worldwide living in such countries talking like them living like them they're animals more than humans unfortunately would you like a children to have such a fate well this is up to you anyhow"
