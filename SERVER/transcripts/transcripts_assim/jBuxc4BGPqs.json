  "transcript": "Salaam so my question is my Menses usually last for six days and on the fourth day when I answered the call of Nature and then do its ninja and I use the tissue to see whether my Menses has ended or not I say nose discharged but that is because I just cleaned my private part but after like walking or sitting for an hour or two I get blood or brownish annually you'll listen discharge coming out so my question is how long should my dryness last because blood comes and goes ordered women not to haste until they see the sign of Purity and the sign of Purity as Madara Isha explained and others is the white thread like discharge so when a woman wipes she finds a white thread like discharge that indicates her Purity no brownish or yellowish discharge associated with it if she doesn't see it and she knows that her Menses is six days she has to wait until the sixth day if the sixth day comes and still she does not see it but there is dryness meaning that whenever she wipes whether after answering the whole of nature or a couple of hours later there is nothing she should insert a tampon and if the tampon comes out clean then she may take Russell as this is her sign of Purity and Allah Knows Best"
