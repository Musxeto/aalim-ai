  "title": "Ruling on drinking zam zam standing up",
  "transcript": "on the ruling on drinking Zam Zam while standing up is it Sunnah well the prophet Alat wasam as in the authentic Hadith came to zamzam and he drank from it standing up so no one disputes that this is uh recommended or this is part of the Sunnah of the Prophet Alat wasam unless people would justify it by saying that there was not an appropriate place to sit down Etc but there is no evidence to back what they're saying however drinking while sitting down is far superior than drinking standing up to the extent that some Scholars even forbid people from drinking standing up and this is an issue of dispute and that is why Al pleas with him said I do not mind drinking standing up or sitting down because I've seen the prophet wasam drink uh standing up"
