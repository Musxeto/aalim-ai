  "title": "\"Contradictions\" in Hadith: Our Response - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "[Music] I mean sallallahu sallim wa barik alaa al al-amin nabina muhammad in water and he was happy woman daddy had a Western nervous when Nettie he lay on me Dean I'm back assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh our topic for this morning is not one of the easiest because it is a little bit technical and there isn't much room in it to have stories and to say things that may be appealing but alhamdulillah what throws satisfaction in my heart is to know that the majority of you are the elite of students of knowledge some people is are laughing I don't know I'm serious don't look down at yourself meaning that you did not come here to have fun you did not come here to enjoy your time you came to learn and inshallah you did the right thing but the topic itself it is a little bit not complicated but a little bit serious the issue of hadith of sunnah of the prophet alayhi salat wa sallam has a very high regard in our hearts we love it we believe in it we abide by it and we make it our core existence the reason of our core existence to follow the Sunnah of the Prophet are a solution simply because it will take us to Jinnah insha Allah so whatever comes out as we've mentioned yesterday from the prophet's mouth alayhi salatu wassalam it is the ultimate truth it is a revelation from allah azza wajal so if you put this in mind you will clarify a lot of the confusion which arises from the enemies of Islam their mission is to confuse you is to misguide you is to make you uncertain of what there is no doubt in at all the Quran and the Sunnah there is no doubt la riba feel therefore when you come and look at what they are plotting against our religion you will find that they utilize people's ignorant they utilize how Muslims are away from the circles of knowledge where they can learn the Quran and the authentic sunnah of the prophet alayhi salatu salam and this is how they misguide the masses this is how they confuse the layman by poking and criticizing the sunnah of our prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and it is without doubt to all muslims that there is no real contradiction between what the prophet says allah√≠s alot was salam because then he would not be a messenger of allah if he says something and then he goes against it or if allah azza wajal says something in the quran and then contradicts it in somewhere else and this is a different topic because so many people come to the quran itself and say i don't understand this the vast majority of the Muslims say I believe it's from Allah this is sufficient for me but some may open the Pandora Box and start to have whoosh wasps and doubt and it would have been eradicated simply if they went to a scholar and asked them can you clarify for me please I do not understand in the hadith it is even greater because the hadith comments complements clarifies and explains this religion to us and therefore as Muslims we believe that there is no real contradiction there might be something apparent that needs to be clarified but there is no real contradiction in the Sunnah and this is why before we go into our topic you have to have this conviction in your heart that everything that is authentic and this is important underline one with red and one with blue two lines if you want to add that no problem why is it important because not every Sunnah is authentic there are so many fabricated hadith there are so many weak hadith okay sure why are you confusing us if this is the case why then need this one from the first place go back to yesterday's lecture you can buy the DVD insha'Allah I don't get a percentage out of it but it's good buy it and you'll understand that this is why from Allah social in part of protecting this way Allah Azza WA JAL has segregated the hadith which is authentic from what which is not we have scholars who protect sheikh sa'eed raj yesterday spoke about the compilation of the hadith and the effort put into it it's not an easy ride it's a journey of a lifetime so whenever you see a hadith and another one that may seem to contradict and both of them are Sahay both of them are authentic do not talk against them accuse your own logic accuse your own intellect and ask and it will be clarified with the grace of allah azza wajal how do we do this you have to refer back to the scholars of the religion you have a stomachache it you have pain in your stomach what do you do go to a mechanic if you're a transformer you don't you go to someone who's specialized in it likewise you have problems with your car you don't take it to the dentist you have a problem with hadith you don't take it to someone who specialized in turf seed for example has no knowledge in hadith or in flip has no knowledge in hadith though they are scholars in Islam but they lack this specifications speciality the authority in that particular science so you have to go back to the specialised one Allah says fellow let Vicki in kuntum Litella moon ask the people of the message ask the people of knowledge if you do not know again going back to Kuwait the $1,000,000 the 1 million quaity dinar question would be why then have this contradiction concept in the hadith in the first place why not have it clear to us the answer is simple Allah Azza WA JAL had created us on earth to worship Him but this is not an easy right Allah says in the beginning of surat al-ankabut a hasib Anasuya you taku taku who a man HomeLife ternoon do people think that they will be left alone to claim that we are believers without being tested or tried no no one can have this easy right Allah will test you whether you like it or not however the test differs some are tested in their wealth their poor some are tested in their health they have illnesses some are tested in their religion and this is the most difficult test of all when allah azzawajal tests you in your belief in your conviction will you remain steadfast what was the majority the vast majority of the prophets darkness was that he would always continue to say yeah ma Kali Belko lube fab it will be al Edenic o Turner of hearts make my heart steadfast on your religion why because this is the most important test you make it you pass to Jenna you fail in it you go to hell and this is why we are tested by these so-called contradictions in the hadith this tests your Eman exactly like Abu Bakr was tested may Allah be pleased with him when the Prophet is salam went to jerusalem and then went to the seventh heaven and came back to makkah and how long in few hours the mushriks the idol worshippers came to abu bakr and said did you hear what your friend said he said that he went to jerusalem to the seventh heaven and came in less than a couple of hours this is a contradiction is it not its contradiction with logic its contradiction with all the norms what did Abu Bakr say let me wait let me check but then never he said if he had said that then he is truthful and I believed him they said how can you believe such a thing I said I believe him when he said that says that Allah told me so and so and the information from the seventh heaven comes to him and he conveys it to us don't you want me to believe something easy like that this is a so deep this is why he was called a Sadiq the one who is at most in believing what he is told about therefore do not object do not use your logic do not reach the level where Shaitaan utilizes your ignorance in rejecting something that cannot be rejected from the Dean so it is important for us as Muslims when we hear some hadith that we cannot understand that we do not interpret this hadith or comment on it because in order to be able to do this you must read the rest of all the Hadees it is wrong and this is why people of deviance in Islam exist they come to a hadith they come to an ayah they take it out of context they look at it and they apply it but there is another ayah that explains it differently should no no no I have this ayah boilerman Kasaba say I attend well I ought to be haughty at work for Allah I guess Habanera whom fear Holly dude the Huaraz come to this ayah verily those who make a sin and it surrounds them that they will abide in hell forever Huaraz come to this ayah said mmm whoever makes a major sin he's in hell forever he's a kafir in a fury shakopee he Allah does not forgive people to associate others with him but he forgives anything else whenever he wishes so I don't like this i I'm gonna stay this one this is the way of the deviance they take whatever they like and they neglect the rest Muslims do not do this something I do not understand I have to search and look in the rest of the Sharia in the Koran in the Sunna so that I can fully and holistically understand it otherwise it will be means of fitna to me and I will be diverting from not the convention I will be diverting from the straight path the real straight path so why do we have contradictions mainly because our understandings differ you may look at the hadith from a different point of view and you think it contradicts with what you know it contradicts with nature it contradicts with science it contradicts with another hadith that might be fabricated that might be not authentic that might have a different understanding that might be abrogated imagine someone reading the Quran a reverter a Muslim river or original no problem he reads the Quran after salat Elisha nine o'clock he brings a bottle of wine 1976-77 is okay he drinks and he is wasted what are you doing he said allah azza wajal says do not pray while you are in the state of intoxication but now I am I've prayed Asia and by pfizer I'll be sober Allah says this in the Quran do you have any objection are you a kafir you don't believe in the Quran I see this ayah was abrogated was he I know but I'm following the Quran this is the way of deviance when you come to one and you do not apply the full meaning of it you do not not know the origin the history whether it was abrogated or not and therefore it's not an easy topic to speak about hadith if you go to hadith you will find a lot of such hadith that may seem contradictory to one another because you don't have knowledge but once you go deep and start to ask learn write inquire research you will find that it all falls in the same line because it comes from the same source well my young people Anil hawa it is not out of his own desire that he speaks sallallaahu Selim it is a revelation therefore whenever there is a contradiction that seems to you in the hadith or in the Quran or anywhere in the Sharia scholars have placed four ways of solving it so it's like a policy and procedure chapter one whenever there are two evidences and our concern now is with the hadith not with the Quran but it's the same procedure whenever there are two evidences seeming to be contradictory to one another you have to follow the the follow the following procedure number one reconcile between them and this is the best why if one says right and the other says left if you reconcile you are applying both evidences so you're putting them in your pocket and you say both are authentic my understanding to them is as such so both are okay there is no contradiction problem solved but if you take the other steps that we will talk about you have to neglect one of them so the best is to apply both and accept both and embrace both with the following understanding and I'll give you a few examples but not not a lot but few examples the Prophet said alayhi salaatu awesome to his companions and this was the last jabberin abdullah even knew haram may allah be pleased with him and with his father said the last of the prophets and so some two orders to us is that we do not have to perform ablution from what was cooked by fire this means that in the beginning there was a prohibition you eat steaks mutton any meat that is cooked you have to go and perform you do this was for a period of time in Islam then it was abrogated and the last was no need for you to perform would you eat meat no problem clear no contradiction but then we have an authentic hadith in sahih al imam muslim where the prophet erase a lot of salaam was asked all prophet of allah shall we perform woudl after eating mutton lamb meat the prophecy if you wish up to you then there was the Prophet was asked again in the same hadith then shall we perform woudl after eating camels meat and the Prophet said yes you must perform model now this is a contradiction but we don't need to call Houston to solve the problem the hadith of Jabbar Abdullah is crystal-clear it was abrogated that any kind of meat does not affect your rule the hadith of Jabbar Nishimura specifies and takes out from the general rolling camels meat so camels meat has a speciality that if you eat anything that is related to meat whether it's liver whether it's meat whether any men's meat whatever you have to perform Moodle now the question would be why the answer is none of your business you're a Muslim imagine someone asking every time why why it's none of your business Allah says for historico Maghreb is 3 why this is problematic when people apply their logic to something that you are not supposed to do that you're a Muslim part of being Muslim you said Ximena were upon who foreigner Caribana wa alaikum o see this is part of your identity and I always give this example so many times I think you bored with it but I have 23 minutes to fill the lecture is too long the examples I have will not be finished don't worry but I just want what is the purpose of my lecture just to give you examples of contradictions and move no the purpose is to give you a way of thinking so whenever I see hadith I do not criticize it oh no this is not logical I never remember one of the Diaries one of the brothers who is an our diary and he is filled with regret because when he started practicing he used to make fun out of everything he said yesterday I prayed with someone who was choking himself to death he was doing like this and he says now I know that the Sunnah is to put your right on the left on the chest but I didn't know at the time and he says when I was sitting in tisha hood the guy was staring right all the time putting the indicator I said now I know the hadith of 111 Hodja may Allah be pleased with him that the Prophet whenever he used to sit for the Shahada he used to point with his index finger shaking it in its place not moving it like this so I was making a lot of fun he says because of my ignorance what we want is that you do not fall in the same trap of shape on you should you see something you don't understand wait don't jump to conclusions a rivet or not a river a Christian comes tell me about your religion la la la la sala zakah Psalm Hajj masha'Allah what is salah we pray five times a day Wow we go only wants to the church on Sunday and every few years not often okay how do you pray said we make wudu what is would do they say we wash your hands you wash your face you wash your arms you or sure you wipe your head you wash your feet three times each time so this is 15 times a day minimum so you wash your feet 15 times per day I wash my face once only your Dean is a Dean of what of purity of of cleanliness I love your Dean and you feel proud like a peacock and as you are spreading your feathers he says but if you don't have water what do you do say nothing you just strike the soil and wipe your face and said what fifteen times washing if you don't have water you soil your face what kind of a religion is this if you're ignorant you say hmm I never thought of that but if you're a believer you say it's a miracle robbing our Oracle Monsieur this is the essence of this lecture understanding expanding your horizons so that you understand that this comes only from Allah there is no contradiction in it none whatsoever moving on so again camels meat what are you running no I'm not running just forgot camels meat is something that is authentic in our religion the hadith is Muslim the hadith is comparing two types of meat mutton and camel so mutton no problem if you wish perform Moodle if you don't your rule is valid camel it nullifies your woudl this does not contradict with the hadith of jabber jabber is general in all types of meat except camel's meat and this is the math above mmm I'm Adam Campbell and it is the most authentic because it follows what hadith in Muslim so on the day of judgment would you like to follow the hadith of the Prophet SM or you follow the other schools of thought regardless with the rapid edit or not we abide by the hadith this is the connection we have with our religion evidence for an and Sunnah likewise when you come to a hadith where the Prophet says Alice awesome in general terms in every 40 sheep there is one sheep as the cat understood easy but this hadith was contradicted by another hadith where the Prophet said Ali salat wa salam only in the sheep that grazes there is the cut so one says okay now what to do I have 40 sheep in my home I feed them I buy the grass for them I water them there is the cat or not according to the first hadith yes there 40 you have to give the cat according to the second hadith there is no zakat why because it does not graze so now when you read the two hadith and you know how to come between them you understand that zakat is only mandatory in cattle whether camels cows or sheep only when it grazes freely most of the year but if you feed it you put money into it there is no zakat in it unless it is used for trading selling and buying so even if I have a thousand sheep in my home that would be a very big home but regardless I would not have to give zakat to it I'm just keeping it there there is no zakat none whatsoever another hadith the Prophet said that is awesome whoever obeys the ruler has obeyed me and whoever obeyed disobeys the ruler he has disobeyed me now this is a general hadith do we take it for whatever it says some people say yes we have to we cannot go against it so the ruler says you have to take off your hedge up this is for citizen the brothers say ok I'll take my job of no this is for the sisters the ruler says take off your hijab I have to obey it the ruler says you have to shave your beat I have to obey it the ruler says that you have to eat pork or drink wine the hadith says whoever disobeys the ruler he has disobeyed me it doesn't sound right it doesn't until you read the following hadith which is a separate hadith see you have to look around in research where the prophecies are they salatu salam in a map are to fill my roof that obedience is only with regards to that which is right and proper so whenever someone orders you to do something that is not right or proper you cannot obey if your father tells you to go and do something Haram you do not obey if your husband tells you to do something that is Haram you must not obey Him so by looking at the different hadith you start to understand and remove any misconception or possible contradiction in the hadith another hadith whoever washes a deceased must have motion and whoever carries a deceased must perform mudal this is a general instruction now this instruction is an order whenever there is an order it means it is mandatory to implement and you cannot dilute this order without another evidence making it softer it's like when your father says to you go and bring me a glass of water and you're continuing to play your video games Ya Allah go and bring me a glass of water yay inshallah okay why are you obeying your father say he's not serious maybe he's not ordering me he's maybe asking me no an order is an order so when Allah tells you to do something you have to do it it's a must if you don't you're sinful unless there is another evidence that makes this obligation a recommendation in this case the Prophet said in another hadith alayhi salat wa sallam you do not have to perform hustle when you wash a corpse your deceased believer is pure his Pajero he's not nudges it's sufficient for you to wash your hands so now the obligation of performing ghoshal has been degraded down into what into making wudu once you read you learn the other way around is also applicable when there is a prohibition then this means that you have to refrain but if another hadith comes it makes this prohibition not recommended and one of the example is the hadith of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam where he says the worst of earnings are the wages of a prostitute the price of a dog and the fee of a copper a prostitute is a prostitute do I have to explain whatever she takes this is the worst of all evils it's Haram the price of a dog selling and buying dogs is prohibited in Islam even if the dog was for legitimate use such as for cattle for guarding for hunting it is still haram to buy or sell and the third is the fee that a copper takes what is copying copying is hijama it's one of the prophetic means of medication and healing you have high blood pressure you have migraines you have a fatty have difficulties you go to a copper he makes scratches and slashes at the back of your neck and shoulders and then sucks the rotten blood from it which is different than the blood that comes from your veins and then in sha Allah your worries will be gone the Prophet he's saying that his fee is evil it's one of the worst so one would think okay this means that it is haram to work in such a job but we have another hadith where the Prophet himself Ali Saleh to Sam performed copied copying and he gave the copper one dinner another hadith he gave him a sword of dates if it were Haram the Prophet would not have given him anything so the contradiction here is lifted up when we understand that it is not recommended it's not prohibited but it is not recommended why it is not recommended scholars say because this is not what the ordinary people do as a job it involves in the old days when you make these small scratches and wounds that you put a special tube and you suck it with your mouth which means that some of the blood may come in contact to you so this is not very pleasing or appealing or good but it is not harlem how is it not haram when the prophet called it evil ali salat wa salam not everything evil in arabic evil is hadith you know this so hadith is not always Haram and the example the easiest example is garlic and onions eating them is what halal or Haram halal though the Prophet described them as Haditha and that you should not go to the Masjid if you consume garlic and onions in Fez your salat you go in the Masjid and the man next to you had eaten this masha'Allah and it is a mean and everybody in the first row are on the left and what are you doing he said well Elijah yesterday I had to eat some big you know we chicken from Umbra and they have this garlic and I ate like six or seven packs of it this is Haram it is prohibited for you - it is Haditha the smell but it is Helen it is totally halal so once you understand the context the surrounding environment other evidences it makes it easy for you to understand sometimes there is a contradiction between two hadith for example an asymptomatic says that so many times I have seen the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam when he gives salaam and he wants to turn his back to the Qibla and face the congregation he would turn to his right while Abdullah heaven mr. roat says I've seen the Prophet only do this to his left how many salat since a lot so one is describing that the Prophet always turned right and the other one described that the Prophet always turned left so which one should we believe we believe them both but this is contradicting no it's not contradicting each one is narrating describing what he had seen and this is why one of them described it to the right and the other to the left because this what sticked to their memory not that the Prophet never did the other one he used to do this and he used to do that but subhanAllah each one narrated what was mostly his observation babe we have eight minutes but this is not sufficient we're still in process number what number one reconciliation we go a little bit quickly if there is no possibility of reconciliation at all we tried doing this we tried doing that we read everywhere we couldn't we move to process number two which is abrogation an abrogation means that one is newer than the other so we have to take the latest and this is why everyone must root not even miss rude this is why Jabbar nabbed Allah may Allah be pleased with him and with his father used to say that the prophet's companions may allah be pleased with them used to follow the latest of the two things meaning that the latest abrogates what came before it and they used to think that this is the one that abrogates some abrogation can be learned from the prophets saying himself Ali salat wa salam for example people used to come while we are praying and knew they used to say assalamualaikum and I would do ring I say or it was salam to LA this is normal common abdullah Mossad said when I went to Abyssinia for Hedra and I came back I saw the Prophet praying so I greeted him with Salam Salam aleykum he did not reply after that he said to me allah azza would after he finished his prayer allah azza wajal makes whatever he wishes and wills in his religion and among the things that he willed is that we do not speak in our prayers so this is what an obligation by the Prophet himself alayhi salat wa sallam he said I used to deny you from visiting graves now go ahead and visit them because it reminds you of the hereafter an abrogation from the Prophet himself alayhi salat wa salam and there are many other examples also there are obligations taught to us by the companion like the hadith of Jabbar the last thing of the tomb was that eating meat which was cooked does not affect your would do so in five minutes this is real five minutes last five minutes five minutes hype there are many examples of obligations but we will jump to another or a third way of trying to solve contradictions if we cannot reconcile and we do not know the timing we don't know which one came before the other so that we can say it abrogates then we have to go into examining or what is known as third year we have to wait an examine in trying to know that this one is more authentic that this one so if we have an ayah of the quran and hadith which is always dominating the ayah if we have a hadith sahih bukhari and another one in most Adric al Hakim definitely Buhari is stronger more authentic and this is the third way how do we do that examining the chain of narrators so here so here so hey half half so he and the other one is also here then this one has presidents has priority or through looking at the text of the hadith himself janna for example some hadiths may have an authentic chain but the hadith itself goes against the norms and the scholars say that this is fabricated a very famous hadith don't shoot me I'm just a messenger known as Saleh to Tessa be is it known to you here unfortunately everywhere it is known salat Oh Tessa be is a fabricated form of Prayer as in the Haditha will advance may Allah be pleased with him the hadith says if you do this Allah will forgive your previous sins and upcoming sins and what you did intentionally and unintentionally and if you do it every single night good if you do it once a week if you do it once a month if you do it once a year if you do it once in a lifetime the same reward and this is unheard of in any other hadith not only that it says that you say after the surah subhanAllah hamd allahu akbar la ilaha illallah 15 times will you make record you say ten times when you raise up ten times we Institute ten times Subhan Allah Allah Allah Allah this is unheard of in salat so the scholars the four Imams Abu Hanifa Malik Shah free a madman humble they all do not approve of it actually a Hanifah mm malik al imam shafi'i never heard of this hadith only mohammed said that this is not true this is not authentic this is mukha and he shook his hands meaning that whoa what is this because the hadith is not authentic and a lot of the scholars the majority of scholars make that hadith as fabricated so this is one of the ways and means of examining a hadith now in two minutes this is not logical I have 10 most prominent hadith to discuss because this is not suitable for a lecture it is suitable for a course so I'll just give you hints hadith regarding other dystiny so allah azzawajal had written our destiny fifty thousand years before the creation of the creations correct correct masha'Allah but there is another hadith where the Prophet says Allah so Salaam that dua repels destiny and righteousness increases your lifespan and it also increases your provision that was it destined or not now this is a contradiction confusing is it finished or is it changeable I cannot give you the answer because I have one minutes in 16 seconds I will not give you the answer is not enough time you can ask me in the panel you can stalk me outside you can write to me on my website I will answer in shell but this is not enough time the hadith where the Prophet says are a solid serum a man is not a believer when he fornicates or when he steals but then the Prophet says Ali salatu salam whoever says la ilaha ilallah will enter jannah how to reconcile because people of takfeer come and use this hadith and says you will be abiding in hell forever and i will not also answer this the issue of the Prophet Allah so salam being casted a spell and this is in Buhari and elsewhere it is the highest level of authenticity was the Prophet Allah saw - Salaam ever affected by black magic the answer is yes Tom how do we reconcile with Allah saying in the Quran when the wrongdoers say you follow not but a man affected by magic if he is affected by magic how can he be a messenger and how can we accept this and also time is over but who cares it's a Samsung I hope it doesn't blow up anyhow the hadith where the prophet alayhi salatu salam says that to abu dharr do you know where the Sun goes when it sets Abu Dharr says Allah and His Messenger no he says it goes to prostrate at the throne of the Rahman the throne of allah azza wajal but the Sun keeps on setting every single minute so how can we reconcile between this and the natural thing that it sets here and it rises up there the hadith where the Prophet says I assume there is no ad wa there is no contagion transmission of infectious diseases without the permission of allah azza wajal there is no add one if I meet someone who has the flu I'm infected with it HIV hepatitis all the infectious diseases I will catch it up so how does one understand this hadith I will not tell you and there are many many other Hadees and and and ya need we can seriously make a course on this you can come for a full day and it's endless but the more you apply the concept which I tried my level best to give it to you that everything in Islam has an answer to it Abe no Jose ma one of the great Imams of Islam who had the the books I have in Hosea marketable tawheed etcetera he said challenging people there is no contradiction nan whatsoever in the hadith any two hadith that seems contradicting to you bring it to me I'll write a book on it look at the confidence because he has the belief that this hadith cannot contradict and we must share the same and Allah Azza WA JAL knows best I apologize for keeping you hanging but we have a commercial break inshaallah we will continue after this was all allahu wa sallim wa barik ala nabina muhammad [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]"
