Islam and welcome to the second episode of this new program the signs of the hour if you recall we discussed yesterday the importance of studying such a science and we mentioned the importance of the belief in the day of Resurrection the belief in the day of judgment and we stated that it is part of the six pillars of Ean so a person who does not have it does not have any IM he's not considered to be a Muslim any person thinking that there isn't no day of judgment it's just like the pagans used to think it is wombs pushing out and earth swallowing in and this is the cycle they think that life is all about if a person thinks like this he's not a Muslim even if he prays and fasts and does all the nine yards he is not a Muslim because he lacks one of the pillars of Iman and hence he is not considered to be a Muslim we we mentioned yesterday some of the verses that state that there are signs of the day of judgment and now we will move on to mention some of theth which is the prophetic teachings the teachings of the prophet and messenger of Islam Muhammad peace be upon him sallallahu alaihi wasam and the majority of evidences are stemmed and derived from the Sunnah it is far more than what is found in the Quran and why is that because the Quran is a general book it's the word of Allah and it is not stated in detailed the details are mentioned in the Sunnah of the Prophet Alat wasam otherwise if there was no need for the prophet Alam to be around then Allah would have just sent us the book the Quran and that would have sufficed there was no need for a messenger to explain and to give us what and what not to do and to be our role model but the prophet was sent and he was given another Revelation other than the Quran which is whatever comes from his mouth because he does not say anything out of his own whim it is something that Allah inspires him and reveals to him to say and if he says something out of his own if he makes something out of his own judgment and it be and it occurs to be wrong Allah will correct him immediately therefore whatever he had left is part of the religion without believing in the Sunnah a person is not a Muslim those who only abide by the Quran so they claim and they say we would not do anything except abiding by the Quran they're not Muslim if they don't believe in the Sunnah if they reject the Sunnah of the Prophet Alam they're not Muslim because everything that we practice 90% of it is in the Sunnah and 10% it's or 100% is mentioned in the Quran but in general terms the details you have to go and refer to the Sunnah now as you remember yesterday we've stated that the program is half an hour talking about the signs of the hour the signs of the day of judgment and the second half is for your questions it is recommended that you call at 3:30 local time meca time which is in about 24 minutes from now to ask about the topic which is the signs of the hour or anything related to it if I know that answer I will answer you if I don't know the answer I will inshallah postpone it till tomorrow however some of the brothers and sisters complained that yesterday's segment the second half we had only one question about the signs of the hour and the rest of the questions were about fasting prayer uh um it's like ask Huda and they're complaining and they have the right to complain but this is the format of the program so the second half is for questions now if I'm going to just sit here idle and do this and wait for you to call about the signs of the hour and you don't this would be a waste of time my time and your time so if you have a question on the signs of the hour this is a priority that should be given to you but if there are no questions at the moment because we did not go into detail and I believe that we will get a lot of questions later on inshallah if Allah prolongs our lives and and if if we don't have any question at the moment then the floor is open to any of your questions and I pray to Allah that we benefit from this program and we learn from it now going back to the importance of studying the signs of the hour so many times we get people who are skeptical meaning that when you say let's talk about the sign signs of the hour you find someone jumping and saying this is not a great uh topic to talk about why not talk about our brothers who are being oppressed in Syria and in Burma why don't you talk about Jihad said good idea okay so tomorrow I start to talk about Jihad you get another portion of people jumping and saying talking about Jihad at this present time this means you're from the karage you want to topple governments you want to create violence and mayab chaos Subhan Allah okay what do you want me to do you should talk about the things that people are so much in need of such as prayer Purity people don't even know how to answer the call of Nature and how to purify themselves and clean themselves okay following day I speak about purity water W of janaba menstruations people come up and jump and say this is all what you know Scholars of Saudi Arabia Purity menstruation post uh uh birth bleeding that is all what you know talk about things that are more important about transactions Subhan Allah so following day I talk about transactions uh of Banks and riba and credit cards Etc the Halal the Haram that involves in it and you get people talking about problems in the house talk about social problems talk about marriage talk about disputes about between the spouses at the end of the day you will not be able to satisfy every single person however studying the signs of the hour is extremely important someone would say yeah this is why you're doing it definitely it has to be extremely important but if someone else was doing it maybe you would not think so no I it is and I'll give you the example from the Sunnah the evidence that you inshallah will be convinced that studying this science is extremely important to know of it is extremely important the first Hadith is the Hadith of Omar may Allah be pleased with him we all know this Hadith Omar says that we were once with the prophet Alam when a man came in and he had black dark hair and very white clothes and he did not have any signs of traveling you know a traveler usually comes dusted and his clothes are not clean or iron properly the guy was perfect in his appearance and Omar says and none of us knew him so the man was a stranger no one knew him in Medina and Medina was small everybody knows everyone else and he it was not a traveler where did he come from so the man came and he placed his knees opposite to the prophet's knees Alam and put his hand on his thighs so he was this close to the prophet Alam and then he asked the prophet the questions you know he said tell me about Islam and the prophet named the five pillars of Islam tell me about IM and the prophet gave him the six pillars of IM tell me about isan and the prophet told him about and then the man told him oh prophet of Allah tell me about the hour and the prophet said the one who is being asked does not know more about it than the one who is asking so the man did not stop here he went further and said then tell me about its signs and the prophet saidat wasam the slave girl will give birth to her mistress and you will see the Barefoot naked destitute herdsmen competing in constructing lofty buildings and then the man went away the prophet told the Companions and told Omar to be specific go and fetch the man back so immediately Omar went out but the man has vanished so the prophet Alam told Omar Omar do you know who was who that man was and Omar said Allah and his Prophet knows best how would I know and the prophet told himam it was giel the Archangel Gabriel he came to teach you your religion to teach all of you your religion in another narration the prophet saidham every time jiel came I could recognize him except this time I didn't know who he was which means that the prophet when answering these four questions or five sallallahu alaih wasallam did not know that jiel was the one who's asking and that is why he told the companions afterwards after Allah informed him that this was jiel teaching you your religion okay so what's the point well the point is easy the Hadith is about teaching us our religion and jiel asked three questions Everyone Knows by default everyone in the prophet's Court know it what is Islam what is IM what isan what probably they did not know was was the signs of the hour and that is why the prophet said he came to teach you your religion so your religion are these four things Islam Iman and the signs of the hour and this highlights because it was combined with the three branches of Islam the most three important three branches it highlights importance of the signs of the hour otherwise he would have asked him about uh uh the ruling on transactions dealing with riba interest or the ruling on migrating to the non-muslims and living there or the ruling on this or that that was not the case he asked him about his these four questions so when the prophet said Alam that the the one who's being asked does not know more about it than the one who's asking then he asked him about its signs which illustrates how important this is this should enough for us to know the importance of studying this the signs of the hour in the in the authentic in the and who is may Allah be pleased with him and with his father was one of the companions of the Prophet Alat wasam who migrated at the second year of Hijra and when they were about to enter Medina they were abducted by the pagans and they asked him what do you want you want to become Muslim you want to go to Muhammad and they said no no no no we just want to go to Medina and they said you're not going to fight with Muhammad he said no no and they gave them their oath and pledges and promises that they will not once they went in the prophet was prepared to go to bad in the second year of Hijra so Hua told the prophet Alam about their pledges and about their Promises to the pagans the prophet did not tell them they are pagans the hell with them break your promise the prophet wasam said fulfill your promise and we will ask we will ask Allah's uh uh uh support and we will depend and rely only on Allah against the pagans look at the beauty of Islam fulfill your promise to the pagans who are about to fight the Muslims why because our religion is built and based on trust on fulfilling your promise and those who claim to be Muslims and they're lying and cheating they don't relate to Islam we don't bear the consequences of their wrong actions they will on the day of judgment be accountable for that that is why we're studying the day of judgment so that you do not cheat you do not lie you do not do things that would tarnish the reputation of Islam the hell with your reputation with all due respect it is the reputation of Islam that we are protecting and we're fulfilling our duties to Allah so went with the prophet the following year to the Battle of uhud his him him and his father his father was killed by friendly fire in the chaos in the midst of uh uncertainty when everything was so mixed and people thought that the prophet died wasam was killed in the Battle of so the Muslims started killing whoever they see in a battleground of course huh they were not in a city they were in a Battle Ground fighting an army and by mistake because the people were in armor they killed huda's father Al Yan and he was shouting my father my father and they did not listen because they were unaware of what was happening and he died and the prophet alai wasam wanted to give Hua blood money and Huda said no this was a mistake from my brothers may Allah forgive them and he did not take money and this got him much much closer in the eyes of the Prophet Alam he's a man of Honor may Allah be pleased with him was known to have known the names of the Hypocrites the Hypocrites pretend to be Muslims they pray like us they fast like us but they are undermining Islam and they are plotting to destroy it we have a lot of Hypocrites nowadays in the Arab world in the Muslim World there are so many many of them some know that they're Hypocrites and they are in the Hellfire forever with the kufar some don't know but their actions unfortunately are the actions of kufar so Hua was with the prophet a lot of the timeat and the prophet told him about the names of the Hypocrites and the prophet was open in the sense that a person says that I'm a Muslim and he behav like a Muslim Allah reveals to him that this is a cafir He's a hypocrite he's not a Muslim but the prophet does not wantam to jump to the gun and execute his companions without any evidence then they would say that Muhammad is killing his companions so the prophet Alam would only judge people on what appears o over them on their actions not on what is in their hearts because this is only known by Revelation and the prophet wanted to give the lessen to his um do not judge intentions do not judge people's hearts because this is only uh uh something that Allah knows about you and I are supposed to judge people by their actions so if I see someone going to a graveyard going to a tomb of a Welly or of a Pious person or even to the prophet and starts to prostrate to it and sacrifices to it and hangs candles next to it it and gives money to uh uh the custodians of such a shrine and he supplicates to the deceased to the dead oh bring me good or prevent me from harm we do not judge his intention we say this guy is a cafir his actions state that he's a cafir otherwise if I see someone stepping on the Quran or trying to burn it or trying to humilate the prophet Alam I would say let me look into to his intention I don't have to this is a clearly blunt evidence that he is a cafir with the Hypocrites is a different issue the prophet told usam do not judge intentions judge actions intentions are for for Allah the almighty subhanahu wa that verily Deeds are by their intentions this is something I cannot judge so H was with the prophet Alam once at the Battle of tabuk when some of the Hypocrites I I if if I'm not mistaken uh it's the Battle of tabuk on the ninth year of Hijra when some of the Hypocrites tried to assassinate the prophet Alam and he was with Huda and the prophet saw them and he shouted at them and Subhan Allah they were 12 or so and they were terrified and they ran away 12 of them only in front or against two unarmed men yet it is Allah that threw the A and fear in their hearts and they fled and ran away h knew them one by one not only that the prophet also informed him that this man is a hypocrite this man is a by name but he would not reveal that to anyone and that is why om may Allah be pleased with him whenever he wanted to appoint one of his rulers in a district or so he used to go to uh Hua and he would ask is he among the Hypocrites and Hua would not say if he's not he say he would say no but if he is he would refrain from answering and people the companions knew that he was the one to know and they used to call him the the the owner of the secret of the Prophet because he informed him about the Hypocrites why is this long story related to the signs of the hour I'll tell you Hua beside knowing the names of the Hypocrites he also knew the signs of the hour more than anyone else why is that well simply because he used to ask the prophet in an authentic Hadi he asked the prophet he said about himself everyone used to ask the prophet Alat about Good Deeds about good things except me I used to ask him about evil things fearing that I would fall into it and the prophet and you find a lot of the hadiths about tribulations and calamities mentioned or the narrator was Huda for example Huda says may Allah be pleased with him that the prophet Alam once preached us and gave us a sermon and in that sermon he did not leave a single thing that will take place from now till the day of judgment except he told us about it he did not leave a thing now logically one would think this would take like few years at least well no the things that the prophet told them about were the signs of the hour they were about the tribulation that will the the Muslim umah will face in the future great tribulations such as the Antichrist such as uh uh uh and Ma and we will talk about this inshallah if Allah prolongs in our lives and he told them about everything and he said that I memorized it all and so did my companions but some of them or most of them forgot what they heard on that day and I forgot few and Subhan Allah whenever I see it happening in front of me I remember that the prophet told us about it as if you forget someone's uh name but when you see his face you remember that not only that also in the may Allah be pleased with him he tells us that the prophet Alat and listen to this carefully prayed F prayer so this is in the beginning of the morning and then he went to the pulpit and gave us a speech a sermon until it was prayer and he came down and prayed and then went back and gave us a sermon until it was prayer and then he prayed and then he went back and gave us a sermon until it was M time and then he prayed and he said that he told told us about everything that's going to take place from now till the day of judgment and the most knowled knowledgeable of us all is the one who memorized what he had said sallallahu alaihi alhi wasallam so this Hadith clearly indicates that the prophet took a full day off just to talk to the companions about the tribulations about calamities and about the signs of the hour that will come a full day lecture from till so minimum it's if if you're in the UK and it's winter minimum it's like8 hours or 7even hours but if it's in summer and you you are in in the Scandinavian or whatever uh the longest the day is so long it can reach up to 20 hours it can reach up to 18 hours yeah say it's 10 hours imagine what would the prophet you tell them sallallahu alaih wasallam we have 5 minutes before we uh uh open the lines for your questions a third Hadith highlighting the importance of the signs of the hour H again may Allah be pleased with him told us that the prophet Alat wasam was counting the tribulations that will happen to his umah and among them he said that there are three tribulations that do not leave a thing meaning that it it it is so harmful it is so strong that it would not leave anyone without touching or affecting him and he spoke about sallallahu alai um tribulations that are like the wind of Summer and he spoke about tribulation that were small tribulations that were big and everyone was in that gathering with the prophet who heard it is gone and only I remain om the second KH he also used to ask about these signs and about the tribulations that the prophet had taught them about sallallahu alaihi wasallam for example in an authentic Hadith he was with his people and he asked them a question and he said who among you heard the Hadith regarding fitna and FNA can mean Calamity can mean test and can mean tribulation so Huda said I heard it and I know it as the prophet has said it so Omar said mashallah you're brave you are coming forward and you have no fear of talking about the prophet's uh uh Hadith sallallahu alhi wasallam so H said yes the prophet told us about the fitna the test the Calamity one would have in himself in his children in his wife in his neighbor in his wealth everything that's connected with an individual and he told us that the kafar the experation that would remove the any sins occurred through this is that a person's prayer fasting charity and enforcing uh uh virtue and preventing Vice so Omar said said no no no this is not the FNA I'm was asking about I'm asking about the FNA that is in waves like a Title Wave it is like a Title Wave and it's so huge that it is beyond imagination look at the knowledge that had said don't worry about that FNA you are afraid of because between you Omar and this FNA there's a big door so Omar asked will this door be opened or will it be broken and Hua said no it will be broken then Omar regretfully said if it's broken it will never be closed meaning that this would mark the beginning of all kinds of different tribulations and calamities and catastrophes for the umah of Islam so the companions OFA asked him and they said what puzzles are you guys talking about door breaking opening calamities tribulations did Omar know what the door was Anda said yes he knew what the door was as he knew that tomorrow comes after today the door was Omar so Omar knew that he would be assassinated and his assassination would open all doors for different types of tribulation and this happened after his death we had the the assassination ofman then we had the assassination of Ali then we had before that the the battle between the two huge Muslim armies led by Ali and mua may Allah be pleased with them both and then we have S we have the camels battle then we have the who came to fight uh Ali and the tribulation they did then we had the then we had different kind of tribulations all started after the the assassination of Omar may Allah be pleased with him and to study this science the signs of the hour this increases your IM this makes a lot of what you're going through clearer when you look at things and analyze by only studying the signs of the hour for example when we see when we see Al when we see Jerusalem the Blessed land in the hands of the filthy Jews the impure cfir Jews and we have 1.6 billion Muslims unable to do a thing if you have we have a saying if you have five Muslims you would get six opinions one just for the road they are not United so when we see what is happening in Palestine and I pray to Allah that Allah liberates it from the hands of the filthy Jew and those who uh uh assist them and provide for them weaponry and provide for them the logistics the enemies of Allah when we see what's happening there we feel depressed and we feel down but when we see the signs of the hours and when we know for sure and for C it's certain it's beyond doubt that Jesus will kill the deal in Jerusalem and we know this for certain we feel comfortable that the land is ours and Allah will give this land to us to the Muslims and it will Allah will liberate it and everything will Spring out from this uh uh blessed um country this blessed land and then we will see the major signs cascading as we will come to mention inshallah likewise when we have the Hadith where the Prophet tells us that those eating will collapse on the Muslim umah the the non-muslims will collapse on the Muslim um as those who eat go to the plate to eat from it so when they're hungry they all come and collapse to eat from a dish or from a big plate the non-muslims will collapse on the Muslim umah likewise this is the Hadith of prophet Prophet this is exactly what's happening Muslims are worthless they have no power they have no opinion no one listens to them why because the prophet told us in the Hadith when the companion say why would the whole world collapse on us is it because we're few the prophet said no you are a lot but you are like the foam of a flood the foam that comes on top has it's worthless nobody would pay a penny Penny to to to buy it and Allah Asel would throw the fear of death in your heart and Allah would throw alah in your hearts and so they ask what is wahan what is this weakness the prophet said the love of this dun loving to live thinking that you're not going to die so you work and live for this world as we mentioned yesterday about those who do not believe in the day of judgment Muslims are like this some of them they live and die for this world not thinking of the Hereafter and Allah would make you worthless in the eyes of your enemies and finally before we go to the break the prophet also told us that and it's part of the Glad Tidings when we see this oppression in the Muslim world when we look at countries and we see the goods and the fortunes of these countries are embezzled and are being extracted by a few filthy leaders who oppress their people and who take the goods of the land and never return anything back to them they look as if they're living in primitive uh uh uh cities and and Villages and when we see this Injustice taking place and when we see this uh uh um type and sort of Oppression and aggression we feel depressed but when we study the signs of the hour we know that there will come a dawn on after this dark night and there is a light at the end of the tunnel the prophet told us that when the M comes he will come at a time of extreme oppression and Injustice and Allah will fill the whole earth with Ali but uh uh he will fill the whole earth with fairness and Justice now this does not mean we sit back and relax waiting for the MDI and saying well I'm not going to change anything no that when the Mahi comes there will be lots and lots of other Pious and righteous people Paving the way for him by forcing Justice by trying to implement the Shar in all aspects of life so when he comes he will find this uh uh paid for him and Allah knows best we have a short break and then we will either take your calls if there are calls or we will continue to go on with uh the program so stay tuned Allah fulfill our AIMS in life Allah there is an American sister who's very active in da in Egypt told me personally that H she traveled between Buddhism and Christianity and different sex and when she came to read the Quran she started by reading from right to left she said I swear once I finished it I fainted I could not believe myself that there is such book that people were so negligent and ignorant about this is that has to be the book of Allah subh and she said I accepted Islam simply after reading and knowing the first chapter seven verses seven verses the Arabic itself which is the Allah spoke the Quran so this is by itself is a medicine it is a word of it's a word of Allah subh tala goes into the heart it was not created rather Allah spok raded and Ramadan Ramadan [Music] Ramadan can't do that because you do not know what to say to them something at least you raise up your hand and ask Allah oh Allah please give guidance to this brother of mine the importance of following Prophet Muhammad sallu alhi wasallam to follow our Prophet sallallah alhi wasallam means you must understand his Islam is a very easy religion simple religion so don't make religion difficult to yourself I believe this Hadith is very common to all of us but the beauty part of this Hadith number one it started by Omar saying now again I'd like to share with the brother and sister to understand the beauty of this same of the [Music] comp oh my Creator oh Allah fulfill our aim in lifeam Alum and and welcome back so until we get um your calls and and and phone calls we will continue to go through some of the things that are related to these signs of the hour the scholars divide the signs of the hour into two types minor and there are so many of them and major and and they say that it's only 10 signs that are major why do they call it minor signs of the hour they say because there are so many and they take a lot of time to take place in so some of them happened and will never happen again some of the minor signs happened but there's nothing to prevent it from reoccurring somewhere down the line and some of them are continuously happening so these are the minor signs the major signs they were mentioned in a Hadith and they considered it to be major because they are unlike anything that men had experienced before not only that they are taking place in a very short period of time which means that they are like a necklace uh we have sister Asia for the nice program I really appreciate uh but along with the question and answer we are getting the information uh which is very important so side by side we can ask the question also and we can get that information also one question people always say uh they always discuss this is the sign of this is going this is happening this is happening all this discussion are going on but when we try to tell them we we we will let us do some action they they go behind and they say what can we do it is already mentioned there are going to come 73 sex it is already mentioned what we will do it like this they keep on argument how to handle such people sister as is asking a very very good question and that is there are people who are not ready to act they're not ready to do something so when they see things they first of all are wrong in interpreting these things to the signs of our this is not for me and you saying that okay if we see something if there's a battle in Iraq for example when the the American Invasion took place in Iraq people started extracting authentic weak and even fabricated hadiths saying that oh this was mentioned in the sunah the prophet spoke about the sufyani and Saddam Hussein is the sufyani so we should back him up and the the the invading troops are this and that and there will come and this will happen happen and all of this is baseless you do not have the right to say that this is or this is not the sign of the hour because a number of Scholars have to study it thoroughly and make sure that this is the sign of of the hour as in the The Case of the fire that came out in Medina which we will come to discuss later on inshallah and the prophet told us that from this fire 2,000 mil away in Iraq or in in so there is in in busra in sham about 1,500 miles away kilos uh kilometers away that from this fire in Medina it will be lighting you will see the light of the necks of the camels 1500 kilomet away so the scholars of all the time who were there which this event took place in 654 654 hij and and it was reported in all books of of of history and the people there reported it and documented it they agreed that this is what the prophet saidat it was obvious but we do not have the right to whenever we see something or hear something oh this is part of the uh uh signs of the hour the prophet said so and so without verifying it with the scholars and authenticating this is number one this is number one number two is that these people even if they know that the Antichrist is coming Jesus is coming tribulations are coming they tend to relax and say kalas I cannot do anything do something make a difference say no no why should I tell people that this is wrong and this is right it's no no useas it's all been through with and I will not change a thing and things will deteriorate these people are accountable at the side of Allah Allah told you that these things will happen and Allah told you at the same time to work and act upon it so you have to work if someone says I'm going to die in like 70 years from now so why should I pray why should I fast if you don't you go to hell but if you do then alhamdulillah if you abuse yourself and consume something that is Haram that's harmful to your body thinking that well it's already been recorded and I'm going to die at a certain age I don't know which age so no matter what I do I'm going to die so I'm going to take uh uh drugs and I'm going to uh drink intoxicant and I'm going to smoke and and you harm your body you are killing yourself so you are right sistera you should act and do what you have to do as instructed in the Quran Sunnah we have Abdullah om ABD Alum apologies for keeping you waiting it's okay uh this is I just can you throw some more light on imami okay imami and also what is read and repeat of this program so that I can watch even later on okay inshallah uh sister Asma sister asum how are you I'm fine alhamdulillah how can I help you yeah what I want to ask you about the zakat if my husband want to give the zakat to his brother is it uh his brother has a does his brother have a family yeah his brother is having family and he's poor and needy yeah of course okay I will answer the question sister fisa from Emirates hello alikum my name is FAA I'm South African and I live in the UAE listen to me from the phone please um I would like to know I don't have a Mah here in [Music] Dubai and I would like to know if it is possible for me to go for umra without Mah I'm 45 years old okay I will answer your question inshallah okay uh brother sister om ABD Rahman was asking that can we shed more light on the Mahi the answer is no the we we're going into a sequence but I'll give you some highlight so that you would not mistaken anyone coming tomorrow I may come on the TV channel say I am the Mahi Hallelujah prove it first of all the prophet Alam told us he would be called Muhammad like the prophet's name and his father his name is like the prophet's name Abdullah so the Mahi must be Muhammad Abdullah this is his name so if someone comes to me tomorrow and says listen I'm the Mahi I'm a I have a very long beard and very short thobes and maybe I have something on my forehead to prove that I've been prostrating for ages and hours and my name is ABD Rahman IB uh uh Ahmed I say tough luck no cigars why because the prophet told us you have to be Muhammad abdah if someone comes to me says my name is Muhammad IB abdah I said tough luck why because this tribe honorable tribe ofan is not related to the prophet Alat wasam and the prophet said he is from my descendant so he has to be the son or originally in in in his uh uh family tree he has to reach to alassan or to Al Hussein reaching to the prophet Alat the prophet said that he would not be practicing and overnight Allah Asel would turn him into a practicing and Pious and Fe God-fearing not only that that he would fill the Earth which means that he would have control that he would have leadership he would fill the Earth with fairness and Justice so if someone comes and he's killed or he's imprisoned and he does not have these conditions he's not the Mahi so is it wise that we sit back and relax and say I'll wait for the mahadi and when he comes I'll fight with him no Allah knows when he will come but we know that he will come definitely at the end of the time because there will be a severe and Grave and serious battle between the Muslims and the Christians this is history this not this is Sunnah this is our religion we believe in that and this we will come inshallah to talk later on when we talk about the great battles and there will come a time when the Antichrist will the uh uh uh show up and he will show up at the time of Mahi and Jesus Christ will descend from the heavens when the fjer time is called and Mahi is about to lead the prayer when he sees Jesus he Retreats and Jesus says no it was established for you and you should lead so he prays as an Imam and Jesus prays behind him so all of this happens at the very end of time so don't sit back and relax work hard because your day of judgment takes place when you die as for uh the reruns W I'm not sure but if I'm not mistaken they have reruns at 7 a.m. uh local time Saudi time nowadays it's like 2 hours earlier in uh GMT so Saturday time it's after F at 7 a.m. and Allah knows best uh sister Asma is asking about the ruling on giving the zakat okay we have first of all I would like to congratulate H for all these wonderful programs those are helping we Muslims alhamdulillah and another thing is that I have been watching HFA last 7 years I have been in 7 years and the day you have started this h i watching this and I like all the programs and and especially my IM has grown stronger because what you are say that is logical it is not like other channels they doing their own innovations alhamdulillah that is a big thing Al that isic straight way it fits your brain that is the best thing I like about H best to thing now my question is that about this I heard you before I was watching all your program we I basically from Kashmir India okay so in VI we PR three together okay uh so I want your clarification about that how to play the with that is important another thing is that in M here in Saudi Arabia we make M after that we make aan after we wait for 10 or 15 minutes and after that we make the Salah okay but in Kashmir they say no after we have to make theah so I want to know the exact this what is the exact this on this ring on this and I like your program sir and your this are very nice and perfect thank you sir God bless you God bless you may Allah make you steadfast on IM increase your IM through h or through other means inshallah sister JRA from the AE I think she's gone I apologize but the question took a little bit too long uh sasma is asking about giving the zakat to your brother is this permissible this is sometimes mandatary should I give my zakat to a stranger to my brother if I give it to my brother who's needy he has to be needy a lot of the Muslims give their zakat to their siblings to their relatives not because they're needy and poor and deserving to have zakat but so that they would have an upper they're telling me two minutes for conclusion and and I don't know why anyhow I I will not uh care about that so you may and should give your zakat to your brother when he's needy if he's classified as needy or poor you give him the zakat and you have two rewards for that FAA says that she is from South Africa and she is 45 years of age and she wants to go to without a is this permissible the answer is no the prophet is the one who gave you the fatwa the prophet said it is not permissible for a woman that believes in Allah and the day of judgment and we are in the size of the day of judgment or the hour it is not permissible for her to travel without a m so and are not obligatory upon you and you may not travel for without Allah will reward you as long as you have this yarning to uh uh go for and you know that it is not permissible Allah will give you the reward inshallah in full uh is asking about wit he's from Kashmir and he they pray WT three R so is this permissible the answer is the prophet forbade us from praying Witter exactly as we pray M so you can pray three ra wit providing you do not sit on uh in the second ra so that you would not make it like m you pray the first and stand up you pray the second and you stand up and you pray the third and you sit for tah so this is the Sunnah or you split them into two and offer Salam and then pray one individual raak also this is the Sunnah now one would say if I go to a Masjid and the IM is praying wi exactly as M what should I do the answer is go with the IM pray with him and do exactly as he does while knowing that this is not the Sunnah why because the Imam is is following a very respected and authentic school of thought which is the school of thought of Abu hanifah may Allah have mercy on his soul so this is his conviction you follow him as his your Imam if it's wrong then it's up to him but this is his conviction and by following it you uh follow the Sunnah the last question before we conclude was about what's being practiced in Saudi Arabia he says that thean of is called and there's a time approximately 15 minutes between the aan and the prayer while in Kashmir they make the aan and they immediately make the prayer afterwards and they go back home to break their fast so which is the best I believe what's being done in in Kashmir is the best because what is happening is that people between and they sit home for 15 minutes and eat and fill it up to the rim with Brim and this is wrong and they go to you know uh their M like Humpty Dumpty walking you hear the liquids and the food in their stomachs and they're postponing and delaying the m without any legitimate reason they should establish the prayer as usual if you want to break your fast with dates and water and go this is the right thing to do and not to delay it this is all the time we have until we meet you next time oh my Creator oh Allah fulfill our aim names in life Allah forgive our sins yeah Allah oh Allah the most gracious oh Allah the most gracious oh my Creator oh Allah fulfill our AIMS in life Allah forgive our sins yeah Allah oh Allah the most [Music] gracious"
