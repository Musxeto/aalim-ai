  "transcript": "[Music] today is our sequel of yesterdays or the day before about the sunnah and the importance of the sunnah being one of the fundamental basics of islam being the second source of legislation in sharia so if one were to think as the criminals would think the first thing we would like to do when trying to attack islam is to attack the sunnah disseminating the sunnah destroying the sunnah destroys islam without any doubt allah says in the quran o you who have believed obey allah and obey the messenger and those in authority among you and if you disagree over anything refer it to allah and the messenger if you should believe in allah and the last day that is the best way and best end result this is a call from allah azzawajal to the believers so when allah is calling upon them he's telling them to obey allah and to obey the prophet so the obedience of allah and his messenger is essential the obedience of those of authority those in authority among you is according to the obedience of allah and the prophet islam not something that is separate which means that if the muslim ruler orders us to do something that goes against the quran the sunnah we must not obey him we must disobey him because there is no obedience to anyone in disobeying allah azzawajal and the law of sharia so allah repeated this in the ayah obey allah and obey his messenger and those in authorities among you he did not say and obey those in authority to hint to that their obedience is part only and mandatory only when it is in accordance with the beingness of allah and the messenger no muslim ruler can come and say intoxicants are okay allah says in the quran it's haram but by the way it's i say it's okay this is a legislation legislating selling alcohol or prostitution or riba his disobedience is mandatory unless you're not a muslim and no one differs in this no one has the guts to come and say no the obedience of the ruler is mandatory when he makes haram thinks halal because this is an act of apostasy whoever says this becomes a kafir on the spot no problem so allah azzawajal is ordering this in this ayah to obey him and to obey his messenger what happens if we differ and this happens every single issue there's a dispute among scholars and they're all trusted scholars we believe in them we love them we uh respect them but they happen to differ it so happens that they differ even the companions may allah be pleased with them they differed among themselves in the most famous incident the prophet said none of you shall pray asar except in the tribe of bani quraida and on their way the sun was about to set half of them said we have to pray asar otherwise we will be deliberately skipping it the other half said no the command of the prophet allah is that we must not pray asar until we reach bani the first half said yeah but this was to encourage us to do our level best and reach there as soon as possible not to skip the prayer the other part he said no this is what the prophet said aslam and we stick with it some of them prayed some of them did not when they reached medina or when they reached bani koreva and they told the prophet allah of what had happened the prophet did not comment he did not say to those who prayed you did the right thing and those who skipped the prayer you did the right thing he did not comment allah so even the companions may differ and this is part of human nature what to do when there is a difference between us allah says in the quran and if you disagree over anything refer it to allah and the messenger those who want to take the sunnah out of islam they say we only go to the quran this is the only thing that we act upon and we say to them what do we do with this ayah allah says refer it to allah how do we refer things to allah to the quran any person would know this how do we refer to the prophet this is his this is his teachings so this is the role of the sunnah it is to explain to complement the quran allah says and we that is allah azza revealed to you o muhammad the message we reveal to you the sunnah that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them what was sent down to them and that they might give thought what clearer verses do you require o who you claim that you only abide and praise and glorify the quran and refuse to believe in anything else what this is the quran when you reject such ayas that allah clearly tells us that the sunnah is there to explain to you what was sent to you which is the quran when you reject this ayah you reject the whole quran you cannot understand the quran without the sunnah so the quran is in more need to the sunnah than the sunnah is in more need to the quran and this was what imam al-uzzai said may allah have mercy on his soul the quran is a holistic book if there was no need for it to be explained there was no need for the message of the prophet allah would have revealed a quran for each of us to read and interpret by their own heads and this is not applicable this can't be you come to ayas in the quran we call it in arabic [Music] it's a holistic word but you can't understand it without going into explanations of it and you require this so a holistic ayah says such as establish prayer everybody understands what prayer is but what is meant by prayer actually in islam how many times are we to pray mentioned in the quran and isha are they mentioned in the quran specifically are they mentioned that fajr is two maghrib is three and richard are four raqqas and each raqqa each unit is composed of two prostrations why not one is this mentioned in the quran the answer is no so if it's not mentioned in the quran how are we to know how to pray this is this is ambiguous that needs to be clarified and explained in details by the sunnah when allah azzawajal says prohibited to you are the dead animals the blood the flesh of swines i understand from this ayah that any dead animal that was not slaughtered would be haram is this a valid understanding well when we go to the sunnah we find that the prophet mentioned to us that there are two types of dead animals that were permitted for us the lucas and the fish and there are two types of blood that were permitted for us the liver and the spleen so would this be a contradiction no see the sunnah either coincides 100 with the quran or it brings something that explains what is in the quran so it gives us details of what in the quran as in the case of the prayers or it brings something new altogether that the quran does not go against so it's something new not found in the quran but the quran doesn't prohibit as in the case of combining the marriage of a woman and her aunt or a woman and her niece this is prohibited from the sunnah all scholars know of this it's not mentioned in the quran the quran only prohibits combining between two sisters but does the quran say it is not prohibited no it doesn't comment on it so the sunnah adds value if you go on to other aspects of sharia zakat for example so many verses in the quran ambiguous verses holistic saying that you have to give zakat you have to give zakat what is the cat it doesn't say how much it doesn't say the categories that we should pay zakat over it doesn't say when it does it say the details that we have nowadays from the from the sunnah how would we understand when to give 2.5 percent as in the case of gold silver cash and commercial items that are sold or to give 5 percent when crops are irrigated with effort or to give 10 percent when crops are irrigated naturally from rainfall and streams nearby that do not require any financial efforts from my side how do we know what is the minimum amount of camels to give zakat which is five and that we give one sheep over every five camels why give a sheep over camels and not give a camel this is the sunnah this is how the prophet explained things to us islam and we also go to for the sake of allah azzawajal how to perform hajj how to perform umrah how many rounds should we go around the kaaba and should we make it to our left or to our right how many times do we go between safa and marwah for sai what is the format when to go to arafah when to go to muzdalifa when to go back to minna how long to stay in minna what is all of these things are not mentioned in the quran in such details without them you wouldn't have any of hajj or umrah or zakat when it goes to marriage how to conduct a proper marriage the conditions the pillars the consent of the guardian how to conduct divorce when divorce takes place what is there in the period a woman should wait when is the divorce revocable and when it is not how much should uh or who should take the custody of the children and what is the procedure for that the alimony the allowance the maintenance before the divorce during divorce after the divorce and then you when you go to the transactions that are haram islam mentions of the quran mentions that riba usually is prohibited what kind of usury are we talking about is it ribban nasiya is it rebel fadal is it rebel card when it is it considered to be riba and when is it when it is considered to be lawful transactions the many different haram transactions that are out there are not mentioned in the quran the sunnah explains them bit by bit and the list goes on and on and on what does this all tell us it tells us that without we cannot understand the quran and this is not a bold statement this is the conviction of all muslims and i mean all muslims that the sunnah without it you cannot understand the quran in the verses of vudu o you who believe whenever you want to establish prayer you have to wash your face your hands to the elbows allah used the word hands to the elbows and also in regards of the prescribed punishment for theft allah says as for the thief the male and the female amputate their hands in arabic the same word is used for wudu and for the prescribed punishment of theft the word hand in arabic can refer to this hand and it can refer to the arm and it can refer to the whole limb up to the shoulder when i come to this ayah amputate their hands should i amputate it from the shoulder from the elbow or from the wrist without knowing the sunnah you're blinded you can't tell and that would cause a lot of chaos we need an explanation and by the way what is a threshold where below it there is no amputation because it's trivial it's not worth it and above it there should be an amputation what are the conditions to amputate it's not just any type of theft if someone steals from his father's wallet would i amputate his hand no how would i know this without the sunnah you won't be able to know this without the sunnah you won't be able to understand the quran and this is why the enemies of islam are trying their level best to disseminate the sunnah how they have many steps and ways among them first of all try to discredit the companions the narrators of the hadith and we've seen this among the people of innovation and the deviant cults when they try to tarnish the reputation of abu huraira may allah be pleased with him simply because he narrated the vast majority of the sunnah when they tried to speak ill about muawiyam sufyan they try to speak ill about this companion or that what's the reason because they want to tarnish the reputation of the sunnah that they narrated which means that they cancelled 80 or 75 percent of sharia if this is not possible then these deviant people go a step further by trying to discredit the science of hadith so they segregate between the hadiths with words that laymen like us would be astonished when hearing and shocked when we listen to such people speak with confidence thinking that come on this guy appears on tv and he's so confident when he segregates between the hadiths and they say that this is and this is ahad this is this is this is and these words i've never heard before and when he explains it with confidence with the media focusing on this imbecile laymen get confused and may be fooled by what he's saying because he looks as if he's talking out of authority saying we only take the matawatar hadith okay excuse me sir among the tens of thousands of hadiths that we have that govern our religion how many mutawater hadiths are there oh they're less than [Music] maybe 50 60 hadith so you want us to discredit disregard ignore all these authentic hadiths because they're ahad what is a hat when you come to the hadith which everybody knows verily deeds are judged by intention haditha everybody says of course everybody knows this hadith since we were children we know this hadith by heart and all the scholars of the hadith say and the scholars of islam say that one third of the whole religion revolves around this hadith so definitely it is the most important hadith well this is not muthawater by the way because only narrated omar may allah be pleased with him and in order to be mutawater we have to have like 15 20 companions narrating it so what do you mean you see where they're heading and this is one of the most important or most dangerous reasons for the ummah of islam being where they are when they learn their religion from such imbeciles celebrities coming on tv or on youtube or on snapchat or in tik tok lately why religion is not taken from any tom dick or harry religion is not taken from someone who has millions of followers on youtube or instagram it is taken from real scholars who are acknowledged by other real scholars and when you have this process of learning from real scholars you won't be fooled by such allegations so if they cannot tarnish the interpretation of the companions they tarnish the reputation of the way the hadith has been conveyed to us the sciences of hadith if this is not possible they use their logic with some emotional impact we believe only in the quran this is the book of allah this is what we believe in and we disregard anything else on the surface this sounds like a good pitch i'm buying but if you look deep down you would you would find that they are disseminating islam destroying islam taking it part by part so that you don't have islam and this is what's happening with those who try to dilute islam so islam has nothing to do with arts movies songs it's different it has nothing to do with entertainment with liquor with nightclubs it has nothing to do with politics with joining hands with the enemies of islam and taking them as best friends and making the muslims enemies of us because they don't share their point of view with us this is not islam this is a different religion yes you make call it whatever religion you want do not attribute this to islam people that who are not known to be among the worshipers among those who pray and fast and do righteous deeds and have scholars that they refer to you must not listen to them when they try to do what they're doing to your religion and to the sunnah of the prophet alaihis salatu maybe tomorrow we will conclude inshaallah with this topic about the basics of the sunnah but i think we need to elaborate a little bit more on that so we will take a short break and be right back to take your questions inshaallah"
