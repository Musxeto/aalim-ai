The face is whatever faces people. So, don't be obsessed by washing this area between your ear and your, what do they call them? Whiskers, maybe? Sideburns? So, people think that, oh I missed this millimeter, so I have to spend like half an hour doing it and rubbing it and underneath the chin. No, no, this is your face. Whatever faces people, just wash it normally and move on. And it is included in it, rinsing your mouth and rinsing your nose. How do we rinse our mouths? You take some water, place it in your mouth and turn it right, left in your mouth, then spit it out. And also rinsing your nose, so you take little water, usually the sunnah and we will come to talk to that later on inshallah, so I'm going to skip it here. So you take the water and you sniff it up your nostrils to the best of your ability without blowing your mind, without harming yourself and then you blow it out. So this is part of washing the face. Mandatory or recommended? Most authentic opinion, it is mandatory and part of the wudu. You skip it, your wudu is invalid. Number two, Allah azza wa jal says in the ayah mentioned before to wash your forearms to the elbows. So this means that we have to wash our arms, forearms to the elbows. Big mistake people do is they skip washing the hands because they washed it in the beginning of the wudu, this is invalid. When you wash your face and rinse your mouth and nose, when you want to wash your hands, you have to wash them from the tip of your fingers to the elbows. You have to wash the whole area. So number three, to wipe the head. And wiping the head is not washing the head. And the sunnah is to go from front to the back and from the back to the front. This is wiping the head. Oh I left a strand here, there is a hair that may not have been wiped. This is too extreme. Just do this and that's enough, with wet hands of course. And included in wiping the head is to wipe your ears as well. Because in the hadith of Abdullah ibn that the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam, after wiping the head, also in other hadith, the Prophet said the ears are from the head, meaning they have to be wiped. And wiping them is very simple. Just putting your index finger in the ears and the thumbs from behind your ears and do this and it's done. Now if someone has long hair, a woman or a man, you're obliged only to wipe over your head, not the rest of the hair. This is not included, only the area of the head, go back and front. So what about if I am bold, in the sense I don't have any hair? Well, you're obliged to wipe over your head, not your hair. So even if you don't have hair, you just do this motion again from the area that usually the hair grows to the back of the head and coming back up front. The fourth pillar is to wash your feet up to the ankles. So from your toes up all the way to the ankles, the ankles are included. And the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam made a warning to the Muslims when he said, woe to the heels from hellfire. Woe to the heels from hellfire. Meaning many people wash their toes, their feet and neglect the heels at the back of their feet because they're lazy or they don't wash it thoroughly. They don't ensure that the water had reached that area. And the Prophet gave them this warning that be careful. So this is how it should be done. So these are the four limbs mentioned in Surah 5 verse 6. We come to the fifth pillar which is the sequence. And by the sequence we mean that you wash your face, arms, wipe your head and then your feet. You can't switch. You can't say, I started with my arms to the elbows then I figured out that I didn't wash my face. So then I washed my face and then I went on to wipe my head. This is a no-go. The wudu is invalid. It has to have the sequence. Number six, you have to have what is known as al-mawalat. And al-mawalat is that you try your level best to do it, doing it consecutively. So washing the face, doing the arms, wiping the head, washing the feet up to the ankles. These are done in sequence and consecutively. If you wash your forearms and before you wipe your head someone knocks on the door so you go and open the door for them and go back to continue, this is invalid. If you go and answer the phone, this gap invalidates your wudu because it's not in sequence. So you have to watch out. What about if someone has an amputated limb, part of it. So someone's arm is, may Allah protect us, amputated and he has, I think it's called prosthetic limb, I don't know. So when he wants to perform wudu, part of it is covered by this device. What to do? He has to remove it so that what remains of the limb can be washed properly. But if it is difficult, it's installed in a way that causes a lot of hardship to take off and put back again. In this case, alhamdulillah, Islam is a religion of simplicity and ease. You can wash all the other limbs as usual. When it comes to this limb, you just wipe over the area that is covered and you're unable to take it off to wash. Likewise, those who have crowns on their teeth or they have what is called as, you know, what dentists do in the case of rinsing the mouth, if you have dental implants or the likes, or false teeth, do I have to take them off? This is a lot of hardship and is not practical. Scholars say no, alhamdulillah. Having such false teeth or dental implants or dentures, all of these do not impact your madmada, your rinsing of the mouth. And even if it is easy to take off, you're not obliged to do this. You can keep them on because it has no impact on the validity of the wudu. And the justification the jurors give is the hadith of Arfajah ibn As'ad, may Allah be pleased with him, who was dismembered and his nose was cut off and chopped off in one of the battles. And the Prophet ordered him, salallahu alayhi wa sallam, to have a sort of an implant of a golden nose so it would give his face a structure. And the Prophet did not order him to take it off whenever he wanted to perform wudu, rather to keep it on. And this means that, alhamdulillah, such things as false teeth or dental implants are forgiven and pardoned with the grace of Allah azza wa jal. wa ma'a hu mutawwiru adawatina fi taqdeemil ʿalm al-sharaʿi akādimiyyatu zād al-ʿilmika al-azhāri fil-qustāni"
