  "title": "Can I give a gift to my Muslim daughter who is fasting Ramadan & deprive my nonmuslim son",
  "transcript": "Fatima from the Philippines Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh I'm a rebirth to Islam and I have two kids One Alhamdulillah she converted also and the other one, my boy, he didn't accept Islam And then now it's Ramadan, my girl she's fasting, she's doing very hard on fasting And she's doing her best and I wanted to give her a gift after Ramadan So what about my other kid who is not a Muslim, how I will manage about giving gifts to them How old is your boy? My boy is 16 and my girl is 14 and she's the one working hard for the fasting and doing her best But my boy he's not doing anything because he didn't convince him To me it seems that it is permissible Inshallah to favor your Muslim son with gifts Or your Muslim daughter with gifts and depriving your non-Muslim son because of his kufr and disbelief And why do I say this? Because when you die your son will not get a single dime of your wealth While your daughter would inherit you Because it is a well-established fact in Islam that a Muslim does not inherit from a disbeliever kafir And the kafir does not inherit from a Muslim believing individual So it seems to me that favoring your Muslim daughter for her ibadah for her fasting is permissible And Allah knows best Now I have to also bring to your attention that it is not permissible for you To serve your kafir son breakfast or lunch during the daytime of Ramadan Though he's a kafir yet still he is addressed by sharia laws Which entails that he has to pray he's not he's a kafir he will not pray Okay he will be punished on the day of judgment because he did not pray In addition to being punished that he's a kafir And also he's obliged to fast which means that we as Muslims must not serve non-Muslims food during the daytime of Ramadan Except if these non-Muslims are not addressed to fast such as children beyond the age of puberty They're not obliged to fast so we can cook food for them Or elderly like our parents or grandparents who are disbelievers but they are over 78, 80 years of age And they are unable to fast if they wanted to fast In this case we can cook them food and Allah knows best you"
