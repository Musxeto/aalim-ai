  "transcript": "from bangladesh she says her aunt her aunt worships graveyards dargas and she collects money from people who would appoint her to do sacrifice corbani for the graves and acts of shirk this is too generic i don't know if she's doing this as a form of shirk and she's working uh she's worshipping the actual graves or not this is something we have to discuss in details but hypothetically if this aunt is a full-fledged mushrika she worship worships the grave she believes firmly that the deceased the one who's buried has the ability to benefit her and to protect her from harm's way and she offers forms of worship to that grave or to that dargah or to that shrine then this case she's an apostate mushrika and you must cut all relations with her you"
