  "transcript": "alhamdulillah uh she my question for today last time you guided the fal lady has bleeding most of the month that's isad and once proven she needs to revert back to her old cycle days it is said that because periods can be become longer or shorter as long as they within 15 days so her old reference would be the last period cycle before isad occurred however she doesn't know how many days they were exactly but roughly recalls that very very long ago she used to B bath around eighth day but there there could be a possibility that she identified her Purity incorrectly at that time in her last two cycles the second last bleeding lasted initially for a few days then during 8th to 12th day it was prominent brown discharge on 13th till 15th day the discharge turned yellow she doesn't know if that yellow was normal discharge was or to be taken as isad but seemed light and in the last period She experienced small tiny particles of menstural remains till and even after 15 day in this case since she does not know which previous cycle to refer to if she differentiates between color what are menur remains to be catalized as Lastly lastly can she simply take bath after 15 days without making up any prayers she has not made up prayers for the last two times even though after the first time of yellow discharge at the end of of of her menes she thought of taking the yellow discharge not as a normal one okay this is too long if she's not aware of the number of days she had a fixed period in this case she refers to her woman folk she refers to the women in her family her siblings her cousins and aunts and mother and most likely they would have a similar pattern or a men menstrual cycle similar to one another so if they all say that we our menis is usually seven days she takes that if they say eight days she takes that and Allah Knows Best"
