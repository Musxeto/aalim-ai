  "title": "Can a young person who has white hair dye his hair black (20 - 30 years of age) - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "from the UK um my question is um if you've been getting random white hairs growing in your hair since your late teens um is this considered a defect and are we allowed to color them using hair dye because I know um you can't dye the hair black but if the the hair dye is like a different shade of black like soft black or light black is this permissible can you repeat the question uh how old is that person um in the early 30s and they they have white hair yeah like random white hairs in like since 13 teens they have been getting the random white hair coming out so is that considered a defect okay and if it is can we dye it using a hair dye uh that is like different shades of black okay first of all it's a rule in Shar that a defect can be removed so it's not changing the creation of Allah a person has a sixth finger instead of five so is it permissible to operate and restore the norm back to his hand the answer is yes a person is born with a crooked lip or a rabbit lip I don't know what it's called in English and it's a defect by birth can we do surgery to restore a normal look definitely yes likewise a teenager in his teens or early 20s and he has random white hair his hair is black there's no problem in dying the hair black because this is not cheating others like when someone in my case dyes his hair black and I look okay whoa if I dye my hair black I would look like 25 or 30 years younger because still now alhamdulillah with the grace of Allah I don't have any uh apparent wrinkles on my face so people would think that if I have black hair black beard that I may be 30 years of age or 35 years of age that puts some uh uh takes off some mileage off of me which is okay good no this is cheating Haram but a person who's in his teens or early 20s to do that this is totally permissible in their 30s this is when white hair starts to uh appear and that would be a little bit uh dubious and therefore it's best not to do it however you can change that I can change that avoiding black so if I dye my beard with dark brown yes if you under the spotlights in the sun you can see it's dark brown or reddish there is no problem in that it's totally Halal but to dye it in Black this is what is not permissible and I hope this answers your question question"
