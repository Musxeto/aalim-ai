  "title": "What is istijmar(Toilet Paper etc after urinating defecating)& does it impact purity Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "from the uk she says about istijmar what is this mark you know that when we answer the call of nature we either wash the area or we use dry substances such as toilet paper uh stones etc so using toilet paper is totally fine and legit even if water is present but this does not 100 percent purify the area because it is dry substance so there might be negligible amount of impurity remaining or at least the smell or the color so if someone sweats works out it may be apparent in a person's underwear so does this impact his purity the answer is no as long when he used the toilet paper or the uh hard substance to clean the place where the impurity came out to the best of his ability and then it came clean whatever remains there is negligible and allah azzawajal knows best"
