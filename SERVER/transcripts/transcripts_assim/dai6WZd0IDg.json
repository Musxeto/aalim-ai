  "title": "Is closing gaps between teeth permissible? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "i have unnecessary gaps between my teeth so can i use tooth clips or tooth align for reducing those gaps is this permissible first of all the scholars understood from the hadith of the prophet alaihis that it is not permissible to change the creation of allah azzawajal in order to beautify it more but from the other hadiths they have learned that whenever a person has a defect or an abnormality and it should be corrected this is permissible so when one of the companions got his nose chopped off the prophet alaihis wasalam instructed him to put a uh a nose of silver and after a few days you know silver when it comes in contact with moist it gives a color and a bad smell so he complained to the prophet and the prophet allowed him aslam to take a nose made of gold so this is permissible because this is removing a defect removing an abnormality and having a gap between your teeth is an abnormality therefore there is no problem none whatsoever in bridging that gap and narrowing it and insha allah this is permissible"
