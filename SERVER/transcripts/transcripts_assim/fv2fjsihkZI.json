  "transcript": "so I tried many times to advise a person which is skipping prayers due to work but I sadly failed could you please advise this person bar I don't have to advise that person if he hears the call of Allah and he's negligent and you've advised her or him so many times and they don't give heed and they don't pay any attention they don't care it doesn't matter there are so many verses of the Quran telling the Muslims those who neglect Salat to take their seat in Hellfire and prepare themselves to be tormented in Hellfire in addition to the torment in their grave in addition to the depression and uh uh confusion and uncomfort in this life while they're alive but they still don't care what would my advice do to them leave these people behind you and move on and look for righteous uh Muslims to hang out with"
