  "transcript": "hadib from bangladesh my question is like i read a fatwa in islam if the owners of a program have stated that the program needs a payment for use or copyrighted then the program is not permitted to use or make copies for public or personal use now um suppose i have a copyrighted or private windows in my laptop if i have done freelance work in the laptop with haram copy copied windows i know my income is haram but can i use the skill that i learned from the haram windows laptop such as freelancing and use that skill in other places um and will my money be halal um if i earn uh through that skill okay i have okay another part of this question but i will ask that um later inshallah from bangladesh he says that i used a software that was copyrighted so i use the hacked software and i learned from it so many things now i'm freelancing but i'm working with an original copy of microsoft freelance or whatever that is so is the knowledge that i obtained from that previous software haram and it would make my income haram the answer is no it is sinful for you to use that software at the time but now the knowledge you have gained is not something you can compensate if i were in your shoes my size is a bit bigger but if i were in your shoes and i had extra money i would buy the old uh software so that everything would be legit and allah knows best"
