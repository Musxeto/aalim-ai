  "transcript": "and today we are talking or we're going to talk about what is known in the as yet and this can be translated as in the book as offenses or as felonies and this is closer to any uh what is being practiced nowadays so a fellaini or an offense is any type of a crime committed against a person whether physically or on his property or by tarnishing his reputation this is called an offense this is a felony and the muslim scholars usually when they refer to jinaya they refer to the physical abuse as for other types of offenses usually they may include it under the prescribed mandatory punishment known as so if i slander a person this is a felony but such a felony is usually found under the headline of the prescribed punishment while ajinaya and this is the singular of jinayat jinaya a felony or an offense is usually a crime affecting a person's physical status and requires punishment and this punishment varies it might be in the form of equal retribution or a financial fine or others and an offense may be a crime leading to death or lesser harm so if you kill someone this is an offense the retribution the punishment as we will see can be as severe as death as well now the first thing the scholars talked about in such topics is the greatest and the most revered and then that is killing and killing can be murder and can be accident but it is an offense either way because someone was affected by it and there are differences so a an offense of killing is divided into three types three categories one is deliberate killing premeditated intentional murder the second one is simi deliberate and the third one is the accidental in each of these three has its own rulings and it differs from one another the end result is one we have a corpse we have a deceased person so what are the differences in the consequences of such an action firstly deliberate killing or better known as murder and this felony in it the killer intends unlawfully to kill another person using means that would most probably kill what kind of means are we talking about well scholars of and especially i'm talking about and all books of when it comes to offenses and felonies you will find details that are so magnificent and sometimes confusing and unfortunately no matter how many times you study this chapter and you teach it you're bound to forget it because it's not your day-to-day job so people ask us about prayer it's easy to respond asks us about rulings on zakat on hajj on fasting but when it comes to issues pertaining to courts and legislative issues such as what happens if a person stabs another what are the consequences what are the punishment etc this is something that only professional judges who deal with this day on day-to-day basis can be able to answer or it requires us to go and research so in the they give nine ways of deliberate killing and they say that for example to stab someone with something that penetrates the body so this is deliberate because a knife usually kills and when there's a dispute and you stab someone and he dies this is called murder it's not acceptable for you to say oh i i just wanted to wound him no this is a fight and you stabbed him secondly if you throw or hit the victim with a big rock so a pebble doesn't kill but if you hit someone with a very heavy rock in the head and he dies this is murder thirdly they say if you throw a person in the din of a lion and the lion eats it or eats him this is definitely a deliberate murder fourthly to throw that person in fire the victim in fire or in water when he cannot swim and you know that so throwing someone in raging fire and you know he cannot escape that or in water this is murder fifthly to strangle someone to prevent him from breathing whether by a rope or to put some material adhesive for example to prevent him from breathing or the likes sixthly to lock him down until he starves to death without feeding him or providing him with more with water the prophet told us islam that a woman entered or was admitted to hellfire because she locked down a kitten neither she fed it and gave it water nor she let it go away and look and search for insects to feed upon seventhly to kill a victim with black magic and we know that black magic either is used by using gin or by using potions and medications that alter a person's medical and mental state of mind so if this impacts the victim in his body until it kills him this is deliberate murder eightly to poison someone so feeding someone something that would poison him whether in his drink or in his food while he does not know then this is murder and ninthly to testify against someone which would lead to killing him so for example if we know that a person is married and we know that punishment for adultery is execution so four men come forward and they lie and they say yes we saw this individual committing adultery and they give a description of what they had seen and the judge rules that he has to be stoned to death and he's executed he's killed later on they come and say that oops listen we made a mistake sorry we uh plotted against him and he didn't commit adultery in this case this is considered to be murder so there are conditions as stated in your book for this to be considered as murder one that the killer intends to kill his victim so whether he does this intentionally or he has the intention to harm the victim secondly knowledge that the person he intends to kill is a human being who enjoys the right of life what does that mean if i'm target practicing and i shoot my target not knowing that behind it there was a man standing i didn't intend to take the life of a human being or harm that human being so this is not intentional three the means used is something that normally leads to killing so if i use a blade if i use a big rock if i use the bullet if i use an arrow if i use a spear all of these things kill usually but if i had someone with a small pebble or if i had a fan and i hit someone and he dies with it this is not considered to be murder because this is not means of killing someone if i run someone over with a car this is murder but if someone was standing next to the car and i opened the door and i hit him with with the door this is not murder because this doesn't kill usually so it is up to the judge's evaluation to consider whether this is intentional murder or not so the murder has two rulings the first one relates to the hereafter and the other one relates to this world as for the hereafter the murderer is threatened by allah azzawajal that severe torment awaits him says he who deliberately kills a believer his punishment is hell therein to abide permanently god will be angry with him and will reject him and will prepare for him a dreadful suffering so this is what awaits a murderer as in this life the per the punishment of a murderer is death by the sauce and there is a difference between pisas and prescribed punishments crisis is something that one does in order to how do you say um get even and the origin of kasas is from casas when you track a person's tracks this is casas when we know that a person went here and we track his footsteps and where he was going to this is called casas and is derived from that and it actually in in legislative definition means to do to the assailant exactly what he had done to the victim so if he had killed we kill him if he amputated one of his limbs we amputate one of his limbs and so on and this is the definition of krisas now krisas is the right of the heirs of a deceased of a victim which means that they are given the choice of three choices so a murderer kills our brother now he is caught he is tried convicted what is to be done the judge gives us one of three options number one to enforce the death penalty a life for a life and usually in islamic law the vic the the assailant the murderer is given to the heirs to do the execution if they are knowledgeable so if one of the heirs says i know how to execute the sword is given to him and the murderer is brought in front of everybody and he chops his head off a soul for a soul an eye for an eye if no one knows how to do this then yes it has to be given to the appointed person and the professional executioner because this is his job and this is merciful more merciful so that the murderer would not suffer now if we or one see the heirs are those who inherit so if someone killed a man and the man had a wife a father a mother and sons and daughters they all have to give the verdict of demanding execution so even if the children are young the man is thrown into prison until they reach puberty and can give the verdict whether to kill or to pardon but if one member of the heirs says i forgive in this case execution is stopped even if the other nine members of his family demand execution one only comes and says i forgive forgiveness prevails so it's execution if they don't want execution or one of them doesn't want execution then the murderer is obliged to give what is known as blood money or indemnity or whatever they may call it and if they don't want blood money and they say that nothing would bring our loved one back to life they may pardon so they don't demand execution they don't demand any financial means of compensation and they simply pardon the killer and the killer is out of jail on his way and there are details about the blood money or this indemnity in arabic we call it dia and the dia has specifications whether the camp it should be 100 camels the ages of the camels whether they're pregnant or not so that the value differs and you will find that in detail i personally believe that to us it is not of great importance because it is not us who is going to determine the deer let alone the ages and let alone whether it's pregnant or not what is best if one was put in such a situation meaning my brother was in a fight and he was stabbed and killed should i pardon or should i demand execution or should i take the the indemnity or the blood money this depends if a person if the murder was known to be a troublemaker and that he had previously killed someone in a fight or injured so many in a fight and i know that he this would not deter him and he would keep on killing people and harming people no you do not pardon here you demand a life for a life because by doing so you are protecting the inv the the whole community from it but if this person is or fell in this sin by mistake due to rage and usually he is a normal good normally a good person then this is up to you whether to pardon or to demand blood money because forgiveness here is better than execution i remember muhammad served him about maybe 8 years ago or ten years ago his eldest son anas was with his friend and all of a sudden one of his friends killed him we don't know the circumstances but probably it was a fight and the killer was his own friend and you can imagine how bad he felt afterwards when the sheikh was asked to come to court it wasn't night and he pardoned him in court so he didn't wait for the other for the for the following day he immediately went and forgave the killer for the sake of allah and did not even take bloodman and this shows you that the act of forgiveness is highly regarded by allah azzawajal and when it's put in its place it also brings a lot of goodness to an individual and it shows you the caliber of people and then we have the simi deliberate killing or what they call in legal terms manslaughter so what is the difference between deliberate killing and the semi-deliberate killing the biggest difference is the tool the crime weapon so the intention to harm is there it's a fight and there is an intention to harm someone but the tool itself is not considered to be a murder weapon so in a murder you stab someone and he dies in a simi uh murder or semi killing you pinch someone with a needle and we all know needles don't kill unless you use it in some place that kills but if you just simply put it in somebody's hands and he dies this is considered to be simi killing but intentional but not murder secondly in deliberate killing you have an eye for an eye they have the right to demand the execution of the murderer in simi killing this is not applicable semi-deliberate killing is not applicable because the heirs of the disease cannot demand this they have one of two either take a blood money or to pardon thirdly when when it comes to blood money it is a hundred camels with specifications but when the killing is deliberate it has to be taken from the murderer's wealth while in the semi-deliberate killing and the accidental killing the 100 camels are taken from his kinship so his relations his cousins and uncles and brothers and nephews they are the one who contribute for that blood money because it was not deliberate and fourthly deliberate killing has no expiation while semi-deliberate killing as well as the accidental killing has expiration which is once a person kills someone by mistake or see me deliberately he must expiate this by other than the blood money other than everything else he has to give one free slave he has to free a slave nowadays we don't have slaves he has to fast two consecutive months and this is expiration for what he had done so the semi-deliberate killing as we said that the offender attacks his victim with something which does not normally cause death though there is an assault he was trying to assault him so it is similar to accidental killing because of using something that does not normally cause death so what's the ruling on it again we've stated that you either or the heirs of the disease of the victim either demand blood money the deer or they can pardon there's nothing else they can do what about the accidental killing accidental killing has no intention to kill none whatsoever such as a person who drives a car and gets into an accident and someone dies in the accident he had no intention of assault he had no intention to harm anyone and it happened accidentally well this requires the same as the semi-deliberate killing it requires the blood money and it requires the expiation as well so what are the differences between the accidental killing and the other two so accidental and semi-deliberate both have no casas there is no life for a life both have blood money or indemnity and both the blood money is paid by the next of kin they differ in that semi-deliberate is intentional accidentally is not that the dia or the blood money is maximized in the simply deliberate but it is not in the accidental and finally that the similar deliberate the person is sinful at the site of allah while the accidental he is not sinful for that and also the difference between accidental and deliberate killing is the deliberate killing has casas while accidental doesn't the deliberate killings indemnity or blood money is maximized while the accidental is not the one who pays for the indemnity or the blood money is the murderer the accidental killing the person who was involved is not the one who pays it rather his or the kinship fourthly that in accidental killing you have to give expiation which is freeing of a slave if not fasting two consecutive months in intentional deliberate killing there's no expansion so even if i kill someone deliberately and the heirs pardon me i feel bad about it i would like to give expiration free a slave maybe fast two consecutive months islam says no you're not required to do this why not because your crime is far greater than to be expiated by this you had this premeditated intention to kill someone and he used the weapon to do so so no expiation is made to comfort a person and to make him express his remorse through fasting two consecutive months that's a lot of time for you as a murderer you don't get it so easy or as easy and definitely fifthly deliberate killing has a great sin behind it while the accidental one is sinless because it was done as a mistake now there are conditions and this is not mentioned in your books but it is taken from the humble they say for assass there has to be four conditions condition number one we cannot ask for this loss unless the one who was killed is protected by islam and they call this masoom so no one is allowed to attack him so if someone kills him then yes this is one of the conditions fulfilled because you killed someone who is protected by islam and who are those protected by islam we mentioned this before they are a a muslim individual any muslim he's protected by islam vin me is protected by islam al-mu'ahad is protected by islam so what are these number one is a muslim any muslim is protected in islam you cannot simply just go and kill him and if you do you're a murderer end of story number two evimi the jews and the christians who live in muslim territory and they pay the taxation known as jizya so they must be respected and their safety is honored and they cannot be attacked thirdly someone who comes in with a treaty so there is a treaty between muslim countries and all other muslims whenever they get a visa and come in they have al ahad while al-mustapman is a person that we have war with his country with his government but he comes for a particular period of time for a particular uh reason such as ambassadors who come or messengers to deliver a message or we need their expertise for a very short period of time and limited and that is it so this is condition number one condition number two is that the killer the murderer has to be someone who can be held accountable so if a an insane person kills someone the victims heirs cannot demand execution the guy is insane if a child below the age of puberty kills someone they cannot demand execution and so on thirdly there has to be compatibility between the murderer and the victim so the murderer must be equal to the victim in religion in freedom and slavery what does that mean if a muslim kills a non-muslim this is a heinous crime but he is not executed in exchange for his crime the muslim judge may punish him by throwing him like 20 years 30 years in prison this is up to the judge but not execution execution has to be a compatible between compatibility between the victim and the murderer if a free man kills a slave he's not killed for him though it's a heinous crime again the judge may do whatever he wants with this murderer but not to take his life because there are not compatible of course this is in dunya in this life in the hereafter he would definitely be punished like any other murderer and so on and fourthly among the conditions for kassas is that the killer the murderer must not be the cause of the victims existence so if the mother is the father of the victim if the murder is the mother of the victim they are not killed because they are the cause of his existence in this world they are punished through different means of punishment and this again is an issue of dispute among scholars some scholars said no no the execution has to take place even if a father kills his son and others said no and it's an issue depending on the school of thought on the opinion of the judge who is looking into this a fifth condition is that in order for it to be kassas you have to have the intention of assault and to harm and attack if it happened by accident or by mistake then this does not apply and lastly some schools of thought said that the killer has to be someone other than the muslim ruler and this definitely fits the muslim rulers well they say because a muslim ruler he is in charge of ruling the whole country and if he were to be executed that would cause a lot of chaos and problems and this is why we address such a muslim ruler by telling him for your heinous crime allah azzawajal is preparing for you torment in hellfire for eternity and allah's wrath will fall upon you and allah's curse awaits for you and allah has prepared a very bad place for you on the hereafter as for this dunya as as for this life it is not logical to spoil our world for one individual who was killed in justly by this tyrant so may allah have mercy on him he will be given paradise for his plight but we cannot execute this tyrant muslim ruler for what he had done because the the cons far outweigh the pros yes we can make justice prevail but justice has a very very expensive price and allah knows best i think we will stop here and we will take our questions in the remaining time so abdulrahman says can you list out in order all the ways for a woman and what i think we've answered this last time i i forgot to cross it out can someone have it in mind that i'm going to read the surah or what just come to mind at that time yes if i pray let's assume fajr prayer and before starting fajr i intended to recite surat uh al fajr in the first rakah and surat al-balad in the second raka after i did my tequila recited the fatiha i thought why not recite the last three eyes of surat al-baqarah no problem you are your own master you can change whatever you want whenever you want to do that without a problem allah karima says is it halal that a man puts a condition to a lady he proposed to to get married a condition like having villa or job or living in a certain country or making certain amount of money or else no marriage no of course this is not permissible nor logical the conditions are usually set by the woman and as a consequence if the conditions were not fulfilled this gives her the right for divorce so now my wife doesn't like me she goes to the judge and she says i don't like him he just says tough bananas what do you want me to do for you so you give me divorces no he's the only one who can divorce you want to bail out give him back his dowry she gives me my dowry she gets a divorce if a woman made a condition so she made a condition in the contra marriage contract and it's written down that her husband has no right to take her out of her city they got married in mecca five years later the the man said listen i would like to relocate and live in medina she said sorry i told you in the contract that you have no right in relocating me you agreed i said well i'm going either way in this case she has a full right to go to the judge show him the contract and then the judge gives her divorce because the man did not fulfill his condition a man does not have the right to put conditions simply because he has the right to divorce so to assume that a man comes and puts a condition that his wife [Music] gives him a villa or provides him with a job or to live in a certain country or to make a certain amount of money a man doesn't have the right to put such conditions because this is like demanding dowry and this is unfortunately found in some areas and parts of india pakistan and bangladesh where the men who propose to a family demand alongside with their own family that the girls family provide gifts to the groom and such a person can't be a groom he's a broom with a bee because he wipes the floors and cleans the the wallet of the girl's father from money i've seen people had having the audacity to come and say to the girls family yeah yeah we want a corolla toyota corolla 2020 the color red for our sun and you have to furnish the house and bring the appliances refrigerators air conditioning the bedrooms the furniture the whole nine yards you do all of this and the man pays the dowry of maybe like 100 rupees or a thousand rupees what is this they people come and complain to me and say that this is unfortunately prevailing in some areas of the subcontinent and i tell you that this is shocking this is a hindu practice and any muslim accepting this has characteristics of hindus no man would allow his wife to put a penny in the house or to give him a car or to demand from her father to find him a job he's not a man he is a male like any other animal to segregate genders from one another but he's not a man a man is taking responsibility and being a real man providing for your and guardians over women because of what allah has favored them over women and because of what they had spent from their own money from their own wealth so to defy this and to demand the women to pay for you shame shame on you karima says what sharia says about a man who sells all his property to his daughters before his death and keeps only the house to live in and leaving it to islamic inheritance rules no problem a person having four daughters no sons and he has siblings and he has other relatives we know that the daughters will automatically get two-thirds of the inheritance what about the third it will go to his siblings if he doesn't have a father and a mother so the man while he's alive decides not to sell decides to give his four daughters all of his properties and he changes the deeds into their names equally and he goes to his bank account and he divides it into four shares equally his brothers complain why are you doing this this is not permissible who said it's not permissible it's my money he said yes but you want to deprive us from it excuse me i'm not dead i didn't deprive you of anything if i wrote a will that would have been depriving you because i cannot write a will to my own daughters so i am giving it to them as a gift or i'm selling it to them as normal selling and buying this is my hard-earned money and you guys don't have a right to complain none whatsoever therefore there's nothing wrong in that insha allah and allah knows best ahmed says can i ask how to perform yes of course you can ask rookie is usually a recitation something you read allah that would be good do i have to put my hand on his head no do i have to touch him no just reciting it and blowing at him would do if i recite the fatiha and blow that's even better if i want to recite the fatiha on a bottle of water or a gallon of water and i recite it once and blow recite it twice three times five times seven times as many as you wish you know numbers preferably and you blow and you drink from that water and you wash yourself or the affected area with that water that would be great there's nothing wrong in that insha allah if you add to it ayatul kursi if you add to it the last two hours of surah al-baqarah if you add to it the last three calls that would be also great hussain al-amin says my mother passed away three months ago may allah have mercy on her is it permissible for my younger sister to get married now it is said in our society that if someone someone's parent passes away he or she has to wait for 1.5 years long after this certain period he or she can get married it would be convenient to understand for me if you provide me references from the quran and the hadith regarding this first of all may allah have mercy on your mom's soul second of all whoever claims something in islam is the one who is responsible for providing the evidence so if i come and say you can't get married except after 1.5 years i said says who you say islam i say allah says bring forward your evidence if you're telling the truth because i can come and say fajr prayer now we have to pray for raka's someone says says who i say islam will you believe me no you have to bring evidence from quran this is the same situation anyone claiming something in islam must bring evidence to back it up and the evidence to back my claim up is that um habiba may allah be pleased with him with her narrated that the prophet prohibited for any person to mourn a deceased for more than three days except a wife who has been widowed so for a woman to mourn her deceased husband she has to wait for four months and ten days so your sister mourning for a year and a half is definitely way away from islam yes maybe some people would out of respect wait for a couple of weeks a month what you've done is three months whoa that's a lot so definitely uh what the people the culture is saying is totally bogus get your sister married as soon as possible this is from zahra my friend wants to ask if it is allowed to get married through video call then the parents of the woman know about it can you give details first of all it's a contemporary issue it's a new issue that has risen recently because up to maybe 30 40 years ago we did not have vehicles so this is something new and it is also something dangerous imagine i go on facebook where someone sends me a message and i open the message and i find that it is one of uh one of the girls interested in me with chit chat shaytaan comes to me so your time comes to her and we should chat for a few weeks and then we fall in love so we decide to get married so i can't go to her country she cannot come to mind so we make a video call and her father is present two of her brothers as witnesses i on the other end with my two friends maybe my father and we make a marriage contract her father says the wash to cabnati i give you my daughter so and so in marriage and i say i accept her marriage to myself the witnesses are there boom we're married now the girl is married all of a sudden i change my skype idea i change my mobile number she has no traces of me or my whereabout she says wow that was a scam this was fraud i want out of this marriage you can't what do you mean i can't you can't get out of this marriage who will accept to give you divorce or to nullify the marriage no judge would do that the moment you go to a muslim judge or a court they and complain they say okay show us the manage contract i'm sorry we don't have any give me the id of the husband i don't have any passport whereabout contact number i don't have any witnesses i have two of my brothers and sometimes she doesn't have a brother she only has a father the witnesses are my friends my relatives so now she cannot prove anything and she spends ages and years going from one court to the other from one mufti to the other to find her a way out it's your mistake so what to do sheikh if all the parties are known to one another and there is no possibility of identity theft so i find a woman and she is from southeast asia from indonesia for example we like each other i said i want to get married to you she said okay let me get on a conference call with my father and someone appears to me like an elderly person he says yes yes okay i give you my daughter in marriage i accept her marriage boom done after five six months i discovered that this man is not her father she hired him to pretend that he's her father so that we can get married the marriage is void so a lot of similar cases take place if a person is studying in the uk and he's from bangladesh and his father and mother saw this girl for him in their village and he knows her because she's from the same village her father knows him because he was born and raised there so when they have a conference call everybody knows everybody nobody would doubt that oh this is shikhasam because they know him and nobody doubts that uncle so-and-so is the father of the girl because i know him so many times i've seen him i've i've been invited his house he he hit me so many times for eating from his fruit trees without his permission in this case such uh um conference marriage or video marriage are legitimate and allah azzawajal knows best so this is all the time we have until we meet next thursday which would be arafah so most likely i will not attend next thursday due to arafah but i will insha allah meet on monday yet thursday is shaky grounds if i don't have anything to do no engagement no family commitment i will post on my twitter and facebook that we will have a class on thursday but most likely we will not have a class so until we meet next monday i pray to elijah that you is a blessed aid and that allah accepts all your deeds in these beautiful 10 days where the good deeds are the most beloved to allah foreign"
