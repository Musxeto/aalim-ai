  "transcript": "now before trying to fix what is broken before correcting people's mistakes and Advising them about their errors and enjoining what is righteous and virtuous and forbidding what is vice and evil there are a number of points that we have to put into consideration Point number one sincerity what do we mean by this so many people fail to have sincerity in their actions and this is the most important and essential aspect in people's lives when it comes to forms of worship because Allah does not accept except what is sincere for his sake in the Hadith Ali Allah says I'm the most self-sufficient from having Associates whoever Associates others with me I abandon him and what he has Associated me with so sincerity is essential when we are trying to give advice because many many times we have hidden agendas some people may want to correct mistakes and errors which are truly mistakes and errors we have no argument in that regard this is a mistake that has to be corrected what is forcing you and pushing you to correct it some people's intentions are not pure they have hidden agenda so they want by correcting such mistakes to support and promote their own cult and sect or group though they claim to fight they themselves are in this they only promote their four or five and they're blinded by their mistakes and their short shortcomings and flaws that if you don't follow them then you are an innovator you're a his you're this you're that Subhan Allah and they themselves have fallen into the same trap of Shan some people want to correct people's faults so that they're promoted into being the best so when I think of myself as the Supreme the infallible I'd look at everyone's else's mistakes and point them out so she oh had this fat and this fat and this fat oh had many mistakes she Al albani oh many many scholars spoke against him sh so and so sh so and so at the end of the day there are no one else left in the arena except myself so this is self-promoting and it shows that my Deeds are unaccepted by Allah because they lacked sincerity when you give advice the main reason and the main difference between your dawa and other folks dawa is sincerity suban Allah how Allah grants acceptance and Kul in the hearts of thousands and millions of people for a specific individual that you look at in he doesn't have anything yeah he's not that articulate he's not an orator he doesn't have the Charisma he doesn't have the wow factor in his knowledge and his uh uh um books and and the likes yet Subhan Allah people adore him people follow him blindly and he walks and talks he's righteous he's practicing he's morally ethical Etc while some other Scholars some other diis highly decorated well known yet still in the hearts of the masses of the people you find resentment you don't find them liking them not because they're following the Sunnah rather because there is something in their hearts that you cannot put your finger on but you can detect it which makes the masses resent their attitude their arrogance their rudess may Allah protect us so sincerity is something that Allah favors his servants with and because of sincerity Allah throws Acceptance in the people's hearts to that individual so when they speak they have ears that listen and accept and this is why we tell people who accepted Islam and have committed themselves to it and find it problematic when they make da to their relatives their friends and their loved ones they complain that nobody's listening to us they're making fun of us they're rejecting our da we tell them be patient and be sincere because if you have sincerity Allah would open locked and closed Hearts sealed Hearts will be opened with your sincerity with the grace of Allah the issue of sincerity dear brothers and sisters is a crucial and important Concept in our religion and your intention when correcting mistakes not to become a better person speaking to them from their your Ivory Tower not to get even sometimes we advise people just to get even because they gave us an advice earlier and we did not accept it it did not go well down our throats and we give advice so that we do not seek people's pleasure through it rather we seek Allah's pleasure through it in the authentic Hadith the prophet saidat wasam that the first three to be thrown into Hellfire are the follower one a reciter of the Quran two a man who died fighting in the cause of Allah three a wealthy person who spent his money in the sake or for the sake of Allah are you kidding me no this is what the prophet said the first three to be thrown into Hellfire so what happened to them well on the day of judgment Allah will summon the F the person who recited the Quran and learned it by heart and he would show him his favors and blessings upon him and Allah asael would say what have you done in what I had given you so the man would say I learned the Quran I recited it at night and I taught it to the people in the daytime for your sake Allah says you are saying lies you are lying you did this so that people would say and praise you as a learned man as a person of the Quran and they've said so throw him in Hell the second second one is a person who was killed for the sake of Allah and Allah asks him what have you done with what I had favored you with and blessed you with he said oh Allah I went to Jihad I went for Jihad with my wealth with my health and did not come back with neither I died for your cause and Allah said says you're saying a lie all the Angels say you are saying a lie confirming and reiterating what Allah said and Allah would say to him you did this so that people would say that you're courageous you're brave and they have said that throw him in Hell the third one comes who has a lot of wealth and Allah asks him the same question and the man says oh Allah I spent my wealth the entirety of it in your cause helping the orphans helping the needy build building ma masjids digging Wells for people in famine struck areas I did all what I can for your sake Allah says you have lied and all the Angels reiterate and saying you have lied and Allah says to him you did this so that people would say oh he's a generous dude he's a generous person like so many of the multi-billionaires who publish in newspapers and put ads that we've done this we've did we have uh uh Fed so many we have built so many things not for the sake of Allah for publicity for public relations and they have said that throw him in Hell the prophet saidat after saying this Hadith oh Abu Hur these three are the first people for whom the fire will be heated on the day of resurrection and this is something that is scary so sincerity is a must is an essential thing that we have to incorporate in everything we do without allowing Satan to mess up with our heads and this is a very important disclaimer because I know a lot of people who hear this and read this Hadith or listen to it would have second thoughts and probably would come and book a counseling session with me to clarify things well I'll tell you uh uh uh up front sincerity is in the heart but Satan messes up with your heart and I always give this example to those who come to me for counseling when you're praying in the mess it and Whispers comes Whispers come to you stating that um you prolonging your Salat so that people would praise you and compliment you you have one of two choices either to break your Salat or to continue praying there's no third choice either you break or continue if you break your your Salat Satan is happy because you obeyed him Allah is angry because you broken you've broken your Salat the second choice is if you continue to pray ignoring these Whispers Allah is pleased with you because you disobeyed Satan but Satan is angry because you have disobeyed him therefore your intention is in your heart whenever you get second thoughts oh there's a breach in my sincerity this is from Shan to make you break your good deeds so what to do number one Rectify your intention to be for the sake of Allah meaning that tell yourself no I'm doing this for the sake of Allah I don't want people's praise or compliment I don't want to get even with anyone I'm giving advice I'm correcting mistakes for the sake of Allah secondly continue doing what you're doing and this is how you upset Satan and anger him which is a Good Deed by itself secondly we have to before or correcting people's mistakes or giving them advice we have to acknowledge and understand that making mistakes and making errors is part of human nature because the prophet said thatat every son of Adam is prone to error and the best of those who who ER are those who repent so so when you have this at the back of your mind before you advise before you correct mistakes before you forbid evil you always have this at the back of your mind that people are not perfect they're prone to make mistakes and errors so you must not hold them accountable for their errors as if they have failed everything in life and consider them to be failures or expecting them to frequently make the same mistake over and over and over again this is not logical you will not gain momentum nor acceptance when doing this with people rather you have to have this at the back of your head that this is human nature they made a mistake they messed up what to do I'll give them advice with lots of love respect and compassion and showing them that there is a way out of it not to condemn them that they're doomed for eternity and that they'll always go to hell and there's nowhere uh uh no way for them to escape their sins and their mistakes now having said that we have to understand as well though humans are prone to make mistakes and errors this does not justify their mistakes or errors so it's wrong for us to leave the Sinners and those who make mistakes be as they are doing what they're doing without correcting them or advising them because so many of us acknowledge the fact that people are prone to error and to make mistakes but due to this they leave them be and they would say oh it's okay they're making major sense because they're humans they're prone to a it's okay the mistakes they're doing and the sins they're falling into because they're teenagers they're youngsters they need time to grow up so let them be or it's okay what they're doing because look around you the whole world is filled with FNA and testing and calamities and tribulation and temptations so they have nowhere else to go so this justifies the sins that they're doing no this is totally unacceptable such justifications are not acceptable or valid when we say some when we see something wrong we have to correct it we have to advise those who are doing it when there are sins we have to forbid evil and vice but by doing so with the scale of Shar through the spectrum of Quran and Sunnah not through our own uh um whims and desires we have to look into things uh uh perfectly so that we ensure that everything is put in perspective at the same time acknowledging that whoever had done this had done it due to the fact that they're prone to her as human beings so we have to know that people are prone to make mistakes but this is not an excuse so we have to have this Mercy in our hearts with this thought in our minds and not to have high and huge expectations and not to condemn them for failure forever just because they made this mistake oh you're doomed there's no hope in you there's no uh uh uh chance for you to escape this you're doomed for in Hell forever no this is not the right thing to do"
