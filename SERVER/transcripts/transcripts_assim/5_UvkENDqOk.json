  "transcript": "some non Arabic speaking Muslims are confused about the getting tempted by whom they take knowledge from basically the inferiority regarding you know learning from somebody who has knowledge and and you know we have those brothers in Allah guide all of us Sarah Balad I mean who start learning people and you know how it goes especially with the reverts warning them against the Messiah what advice can you give chef Hassan to these reverts wallah he the problem is that in order for you to find the path to gender you have to ask Allah for guidance Allah who guys live live in a big vast ocean and there are so many sharks and if you keep on fighting with your brother's over the raft you're hanging - you're gonna be their next meal so what you need to do is look for a proper cuter a proper Imam a proper guide that you trust his religious practice you trust his knowledge and he's well-versed in Islamic studies and people acknowledge him to be a student of knowledge don't go for famous people like us because we were fortunate by Allah and at the same time tested by Allah and given this responsibility if we walk the talk and hamdu lillah but if we fail we'll be the bridge on hellfire for people to cross over our backs may Allah protect us all I mean so you have to do your due diligence don't look for famous people it is not the amount of hits a person's video gets it's not the amounts of subscribers to his Facebook or Twitter account if he is a religiously committed person and you can tell and if he is knowledgeable and the scholars knowledge that this guy has knowledge then follow him until you reach a level that you yourself are qualified to look into different scholars opinions and objectively decide which one according to your knowledge that you possess from Quran from Sunnah from isola fair from fair from Arabic language which one is closer to the truth and you can follow it at the moment you cannot cherry-pick you cannot just say oh shah karim said so-and-so hmm it sounds nice I like it or share awesome said so-and-so yeah this sounds a little bit off no I'm not gonna take this this is cherry-picking you have to follow an imam whether it good or bad he will he will be in charge he'll be responsible but meanwhile you have to develop yourself train yourself learn more and more until you can stand on your own two feet"
