  "transcript": "my question was [Music] regarding from and regarding AK and so he says that AKA is belief and Manaj is a bigger thing that is that AKA and our Behavior work everything comes under it but I didn't get it correctly so I want to I want it from you to explain it please do it deals with your belief your conviction so it deals with the belief in Allah the day of judgment the Angels The Messengers The Scriptures and the Divine decree whether good or bad these are it deals with everything that is from the worlds of the Unseen things that are we must believe in part of our conviction this is a so anything that deals with Allah his beautiful names and attributes his lordship of lordship of worship and the rest deals with AA manh is a new word that was not found previously or used by the salaf but it came up to IND indicate that whatever we do our etiquette our moral conduct our Behavior the way we deal with things is part of our manhaj or methodology and this may vary from one country to the other from one nation to the other from one culture to the other so it is not as important as a though it might have a wider spectrum and without it following the Quran and the Sun it has no value so whoever says and and by the way this is a huge problem nowadays everywhere you go you find sects especially among those sales who are following the footsteps of the Prophet Alam and his companions and the and yet Shan has infiltrated some of them so he caused them to to cause a big fitna dividing the Muslims targeting certain Scholars students of knowledge or duat belittling them and I've seen few video clips recently especially with what's happening in qar about some of the diis and I I I see people just sitting on their couch discrediting this di discrediting this scholar this student of knowledge he's deviant he's MF he's is and what about you oh no I'm I'm the best of the best I'm the cre and this is wrong so these deviant people though they may seem to be following the correct AA they take this man Haj this is how you usually say it he's on the wrong man Haj and they come right straight right from a comic book this is not Islam this is not how we're supposed to deal in da yes if I if if a big student of knowledge or makes an error or two it doesn't mean I have to cross him off and say this guy is a lunatic or he is an atheist or he's a cafir and then bring quotes from different Scholars and make a video clip and publish it this is not the way of calling people to Islam this is the right way to divide the Muslim and this is what they're doing and Allah Knows Best"
