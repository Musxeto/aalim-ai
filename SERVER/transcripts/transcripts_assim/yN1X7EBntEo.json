  "title": "No HIJAB, ABAYA, or makeup when suitors comes to see her for marriage interview?",
  "transcript": "What is the man allowed to see from his fianc√©e or the woman he's proposing to? The majority of scholars say he's allowed to look at her face and her hands. So the face, he would know the beauty. And from the hands, he would know the beast. Depending on the fairness of her skin, if she's fat. This is the majority. I follow the other minority that states that you can look at her as she's dressed in the home. Properly dressed in front of her mahrams. And that is what I do with my daughters. When someone is proposing, she comes with her hair, she comes with until half of the arm, and a long dress or a little bit to this area. Normal. And she sits in front of the boy and they communicate. Now, she's not allowed to wear mascaras, makeup, eyeliners, nothing. She has to appear as she really is, facial-wise. She says, okay, I have spots, can I cover it with? No. Nothing. It comes that he can see her as she really is. And, alhamdulillah, because he saw the rock bottom. So whatever she does afterwards, it's going to be extremely well. And this is what happened to me when I married my wife. That was ages ago. When I saw her, I liked what I saw. When she came on the marriage day, you know, with the makeup and hair, I was shocked. Sincerely, I was shocked. Because I was not expecting that much beauty. Because I saw the rock bottom. So whatever afterwards she puts, she's always a queen in my eyes."
