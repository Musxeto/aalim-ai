  "transcript": "does islam believe in feminism and equality between the genders this is a very generic question because in order to answer it you have to define what do you mean by feminism if it is simply demanding the rights that islam has allocated to women such as in some cultures they deprive women from the rights of inheritance in some cultures they get a woman married against her will so feminism here demands these rights yeah this is acceptable but generally speaking nobody thinks of it this way feminism usually is either liberal or um extreme they go to demands of equality so they would come to islam and scrap out half of it because it's not logical why does a daughter inherits half the son's wealth when the father dies why does she get half of it why is the blood money when a murder takes place by mistake or intentionally is half of a male's blood money why doesn't she lead the prayer give sermons why can't she be a ruler why can't she be a judge why can't she mix with men this is all not related to islam and anyone calling for such things may risk getting out of the fold of islam when it comes to equality allah says in the quran well they said male is not like a female so there's no equality and whenever women want equality then they should conceive one year and the following year let their husbands conceive when they oppose they want equality they should oppose a man marrying more than one wife which is mentioned in the quran in the sunnah that would be totally blasphemous you would have exited the fold of islam 100 therefore this concept of feminism is totally against islam and unfortunately some speakers women who are muslims they address men they speak to men without any shame without any bashfulness and never the companion females the mother of the believers have done such a a heinous thing but unfortunately it's the culture it's the system it's when you see something everywhere you become brainwashed and you fall into such a a mistake may allah preserve the muslim ummah you"
