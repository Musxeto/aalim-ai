aalihi wa sahbihi ajma'in and my bad dear brothers and sisters in islam assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh among the most famous women around the prophet alayhi salat wa salam is his beloved daughter fatima bint mohammed sallallahu alayhi wa sallam the daughter of hadiza went to Hue lit may allah be pleased with her and with her mother she was born five years before the revelation which means that she was 18 years old when the prophet Isaiah migrated to Medina she was the youngest of the prophets and his awesomes daughters and we all know that usually the youngest of our children are the most beloved to our hearts we tend to care for them love them give them more affection than any of the other children because they do youngest they're the most vulnerable and this is human nature with fatima it was different though it was human nature but she had a character that made the prophet alayhi salatu salam loved her more and more at an early age she used to defend the Prophet Alice of Salaam and take care of him even after the death of her mother may Allah be pleased with her Khadija she took care of her own father caring for him catering for his needs Abdullah namazu tells us about an incident that just gives you a glimpse of what caliber this great woman was made of he said that when we were in Mecca the Prophet came at his salat WA Salam to the Masjid prostrated to allah azza wajal during prayer so the Prophet prayed on his own he's a Muslim to them he's an infidel to the idol worshipers so he prayed on his own minding his own business and when the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam prostrated abu jahil may Allah curse him the Pharaoh of this Ummah talked to his companions and said who among you would go to the house of so-and-so and get the placenta of their camel so one of them having made me a locker Sam went there and took that Center and all the dirt that was attached to it and while the Prophet was prostrating Ali salatu salam on the ground facing the kaabah in the sacred Masjid of Mecca the Masjid al-haram he came and placed it on his head and back the Prophet alehissallaam was not startled he did not move he continued in his position of salute of the lamas Road who was a companion in slim he said none of us could do anything we were weak we were vulnerable we did not have anyone to protect us had we stood and objected to that so we remain silent with our hearts being torn apart but being unable to do or say anything until someone went to the prophet's house had insulin and informed Fatima who was a child of maybe seven nine years of age she came running removed that filth from her father's back and had and addressed the dignitaries of Quraysh this little girl addressing these fearless warriors saying to them may Allah curse you swearing at them cursing them and it shows you how strong she was even at an early age and the story as you all know from the serie that the Prophet lysozyme concluded is prayer and then he started to make dua against them by saying o Allah destroy Quraysh oh Allah destroy Quraysh oh Allah destroy crush and they went into silence mode because they hated it when someone made dua in the Masjid against them and they knew that Allah would respond and then he made dua specifically on these tyrants Allah Malika be a bjl o Allah destroy Abu jahil webinar be ashamed never be our Alwaleed Naruto Oh Mahalo but never my and the rest of the gang Abdullah and Massoud says later on on the battle of better I saw all of those whom he made duaa against killed and thrown in a well in better faatima may Allah be pleased with her is also nicht named as a Sahara and there is not a single authentic hadith authenticating that she is to be called like this yet great scholars of Islam such as a mammoth the Hobby mmm and Noah we a ma'am even kefir a member even had jar and many more used to always call her Fatima to Zara therefore Sahara means the one with the white and illuminating or shining face so there's no harm in calling her with such a name Fatima as we all know got married to the cousin of her father Olivia Talib so the Prophet has some and Ali were cousins and we know that among the children Ali was the first to accept Islam and he was raised in the house of the Prophet era so Salam so later on when they migrated to Medina he went to speak to the prophet alayhi salatu salam and he used to be not afraid but sort of having this respect great respect to the Prophet Allah saw some that intimidated him in a sense so he says about himself when I went in and sought permission to speak to the Prophet alle sammen I was allowed to I was baffled I couldn't say a word I didn't know what to say so it was the prophet who Allison said are you coming here to propose to Fatima and that was a relief he said yes so he said what are you giving her as a dowry this is his beloved daughter so it has to be something worthwhile I only said I don't have a thing and Ali was stone broke because his father abu talib though was he was one of the dignitaries of Quraysh but he has had so many children and not a lot of property or income so Ali inherited literally nothing so the Prophet asked him what about your AL helped me the shield that you had and it was of the value of 400 dirhams not not a lot she said yes I still have it so the Prophet said give it to her as a dowry and they were Wed simple dowry a simple wedding a simple furniture of the house it was only a small mattress and a pillow filled with sponge or such a material and two jars and one grinder where they put the grain to make it or change it into flour that's it this is the house of the daughter of the Prophet himself Ali salatu salam yes this is the house of the mistress of the Jenna the prophet alayhi salatu salam said in an authentic hadith this is an angel coming down for the first time in his life requesting permission from Allah to give Salam and to give the glad tiding that fatima is the mistress of all women of jenna and that al-hasan and al-husayn there are the masters of the youth of the people of Jannah subhanAllah the RIA tone bar bahama but what a blessed progeny what a blessed lineage she was the daughter of the prophet al-assad so without any doubt and she had a happy life with Adi what we know is that she had the famous al-hasan and al-husayn whom the descendants of the Prophet erase all some come from them but a lot of us don't know that she gave birth to five children hassan and husayn Merson and she also was now gave birth to two daughters Uncle Tom and Xena uncle thomé was married to Roma in the hot tub when he was extremely old and she was extremely young her father Ali gave her in marriage because Omar wanted to keep a lineage between him and the Prophet Allah so solemn through marrying her and she gave birth to his son Saint so five children she gave in the span of nine years may Allah be pleased with her and we know the status of it Hasan and Husayn in the prophet's heart alayhi salatu wa salam fatima used to be nekked name also by omaha the mother of her father how is that possible how can a woman be the mother of her father this means that she was caring for him and she loved him like a son not as a father she had so much love for the Prophet Elisha and care since a very young age it would be no doubt to us when we hear how mother Aisha may Allah be pleased with her described her she said no one resembled the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam in the way he looks in the way he talks in the way he walks more than Fatima wherever she stood up or sat down that you could tell that this is the prophet alayhi salat wa salam and whenever she would enter a room where the Prophet Adam was sitting he would stand up for Fatima and he would kiss her and he would make her sit in his seat in his place and whenever the Prophet would enter a room where Fatima is she would stand up for him kiss him and she would make him sit where she was sitting Fatima was a patient wife acknowledging that she is the mistress of the women of paradise acknowledging that her father is the best man Allah ever created and the most beloved to Allah Almighty yet this did not make her arrogant she was an excellent wife a superior mother and she used to work in her own home with her own hands without the assistance of a servant until it made a impact on the palms of her hands it became rough like a man's hands so I highly advise her may Allah be pleased with him to go and ask from your father a slave from all the slaves that the Muslims have so that she can serve you and help you with the shores when she went the Prophet SSM who had all the means to do that directed her and him adi to something that was better first of all he did not want to do any favors for them just for their relationship to him secondly he wanted to tell them and show them that life is not worth all of that and thirdly he directed the ohm at large to something that was beneficial and that would grant them the energy to behave and act so he came to them just before they went to sleep and he taught them to say subhanAllah 33 times and hamdulillah 33 times Allah talked about 34 times the total is a hundred saying it as you are lying on your bed as part of your bedtime at car would be more beneficial for you than having a servant to assist you in your work even taymiyah and many scholar said that whoever observes this vicar before going to bed at night allah azza wajal would grant him the power and energy and the agility to do what is needed to be done with a helping hand Subhan Allah and in this hadith it shows clearly as a mammoth povery says and others that the Prophet Allison did not order Heidi to provide his wife with a servant because this is not her right when it came to dowry though he can postpone the dowry make it in installments delay it a year or two he insisted that he gives gives her his shield hot Mia because this is mandatory but for the servant he did not even ask Ali to provide her with one because outside or external service it is the man's duty inside or the internal service of the house it is the woman's responsibility and duty Fatima was a woman whom the prophet alayhi salatu salam entrusted her with secrets and she would never reveal the prophet's secrets aisha tells us when the Prophet while his awesome was on his deathbed Aisha came and we can barely miss the way she walks resembling it - the way the Prophet walks Alison it's almost identical when the prophet saw her say he said hello my daughter Marhaba nobility and he made her sit next to him and then he whispered something in her ears and she cried and wept heavily and when the Prophet SAW are they saw some how distressed she was he whispered something again in her ears and she laughed so how I went to her and said what did the Prophet Elias awesome tell you Fatima said I would never disclose and expose a secret the Prophet told Sal Allahu Alem told me and later on the Prophet Alakazam passed away after his death Aisha went again to Fatima and said now the Prophet is gone now the Prophet is salallahu alaihe wasalam tell me what he whispered in your ears Fatima said as of now you're right he's dead so I am at liberty to say and disclose it the Prophet told me that every Ramadan gibreel revises the Quran with him once except this last Ramadan he revised the Quran with him twice and I feel that this is my year that I will die in so I wept and cried being sad to depart my father then he whispered in my ear again telling me won't you be happy to know that you are the mistress of the women of Jena and I laughed in another narration if I do not I hope I recall correctly he said to her that you are the first of my family to die after me and she died six months later as we know how was her relationship with her so-called stepmothers she had nine of them may Allah be pleased with them all the mothers are the believers they all loved and respected Fatima even when they needed someone to mediate between them and the Prophet and they would send Fatima mother Aisha said that one day the other wives of the Prophet Allah saw some sent Fatima to ask the Prophet I saw - Salam to be fair with all of them his wives including Aisha because as you remember men of Medina used the people of Medina used to send their gifts to the prophet alayhi salatu salam food and other stuffs when he was at it says day and house and when he went to other houses they would not send a thing to them so they sent fatima asking and demanding that the Prophet our son put an end to such a practice because it's unfair for us and it wasn't the Prophet who was asking for it it was the people who were doing it from their own selves so fatima went and said o prophet of allah as she was sitting Oh prophet of Allah my father your wives are demanding justice so the Prophet looked at her and said my daughter don't you love what I love and fatima said by allah i love what you love o o prophet of allah so the Prophet said oh my daughter I love her meaning I love Aisha and I did not do any injustice it's the people who are giving it to me so why would I stop people from doing that so she went back to the wives of the Prophet and told them about the incident so they objected and told her you didn't do anything for us go back again and speak to him and demand justice fatima says by Allah I'll never speak to him about this subject again in my life now the incident that a lot of the Muslims know about is that the prophet alayhi salat WA Salam prohibited Ali from taking a second wife and they always spread this among the people saying oh look if the Prophet our son prohibited Riley from taking a second wife then you my son in law are not allowed to take a second wife and your wife has all the right to be mad and jealous and refused this and that this is misunderstood incident you have to look into the hadith and understand it as the scholars had and not improvised or come up with opinions that are baseless the story goes that the family of Abu jahil the Pharaoh of this Ummah and the enemy of Islam and the Muslims proposed to Ali to marry the daughter of Abu jahil so he was contemplating about it and when this reached the prophet alayhi salatu salam he became angry and he addressed the people saying that my first son-in-law bellossom not revere proposed and was truthful to me and fulfilled his pledge to me meaning he did not take another wife over his daughter Zainab may Allah be pleased with her and now I hear that Holly wants to combine the daughter of the messenger of allah that is fatima alongside the daughter of the enemy of allah the daughter of abu jahil by allah this hurts fatima and whatever hurts fatima hurts me as she is part of me and a flesh of mine by allah i do not make a lahar ahhmm or Haram hala meaning that marriage is holid I'm not making it prohibited but due to the fact that hurting fatima hurts the Prophet and we know that hurting the Prophet item is an act of apostasy therefore the Prophet Isis am prevented such a marriage due to the reasons that he had given you are not the prophet of Allah to be hurt by your daughter's hurting and your daughter is not the daughter of the messengers of Allah and the one your son-in-law is getting married to is not the daughter of the of Allah so all of these justifications and conditions clarifies why the Prophet I am prohibited idly from marrying someone else when did Fatima die Fatima may Allah be pleased with her died in the month of Ramadan six months or less after the death of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and when she was on her deathbed Asma been to amaze me Allah be pleased with her told her that in Abyssinia she saw a practice that was very beautiful and that is they put a body over the deceased body they put something like an arch arch like a fence a key a cage over a woman's body and then they put a cloth on it so when men are carrying the deceased body no one can tell her figure her body her curves while she is lying on that piece of machinery or piece of equipment they carry disease over or on and Fatima loved the idea because it helps conceal her body shape so she made it in her will that when she dies they put this cage on her entire body and put a cloth on top of it so no one would recognize her body when she's being carried to the grave and she was the first one to do that she died and she was 29 years of age may Allah be pleased with her had our love Adam when his betrayal merely haslam Rasul Allah who wa sallim wa barik ala nabina muhammad why daddy he was sahbihi ajmain"
