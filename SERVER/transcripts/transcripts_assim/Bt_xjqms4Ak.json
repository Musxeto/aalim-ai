  "transcript": "What is the difference between a mosque and a mosque? What is the difference between a mosque and a mosque? Umm Aymuna from Bangladesh There are many mosques in my area and time for Iftar entered according to a timetable, but the closest mosque to my home didn't give Adhan. But other mosques gave Adhan and we heard it, so we broke our fast. Was it OK? If the Adhan is given and this is the closest masjid or the furthest masjid, it doesn't matter because any Mu'adhin giving the Adhan within the vicinity, he's entrusted with his Adhan. So he's responsible to the fact that the sun has set and it's time for Iftar. You can break your Iftar. You don't have to wait for the close by masjid. Maybe it's out of electricity, maybe the Mu'adhin is having his own Iftar first, maybe he forgot. How long are you going to stay and wait for it? So no, if you hear the Adhan from far away and you know it's an Adhan from a masjid, you can break your fasting. And if you're in a place where you can't do it, you can't do it. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it insha'Allah within the following two days or three days. And I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all."
