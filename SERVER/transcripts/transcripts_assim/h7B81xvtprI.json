  "transcript": "zainudine from the UK and individual who the local congregation they look for a mosque they could not find one yeah gave them a Masjid to pray five times in however this person whenever they go to pray the moment they stand out to pray gas is released all the time and this is not a doubt this person certainly knows something came out and this only happens whenever he prays this the first this individual contemplated over rich and real and realized that Satan was trying to make him stop praying so he tried to fight it By ignoring it but then it kept on coming and coming and coming every time he stood up to pray something came out whether silent or loud so he no once did a lot of things in order to try to counteract this but he wants to fight this so what's what should he do and how can he fix this this before it goes to us first of all it is mandatory upon men to pray in the Masjid now you cannot pray in the Masjid unless you have Voodoo you're in the state of purity if this person whenever he stands to pray in the Masjid passes wind and he knows that this happens only when he's in the Masjid while if he prays home this doesn't happen there's something wrong usually people can suppress this and stop it from coming out especially for these few moments during prayer hypothetically if a person during the first 15 minutes of the time of the prayer after that then nothing comes out and when he stands to pray he starts to pass wind and he cannot control it if he goes and perform wudu and come back the wind still comes out and if he leaves the message it stops in this case he is Exempted from praying in the Masjid and he should pray home but as I said this is not logical or normal there is something wrong happening here whether it's in his mind in his subconscious he's imagining things he has to do something about it and Allah Knows Best foreign"
