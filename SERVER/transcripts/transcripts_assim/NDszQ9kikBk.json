  "transcript": "riot says a tradition here people say you can close you can lock or you can circle a house or a property buy versus and stuff too so to keep the property or house off limit to gin is this allowed or even sahi well I don't know of such a security system that locks or circles the house like you have this describe what I know is that if a person enters his home at night and closes the door saying bismillah the Devils say to one another you don't have a place to spend the night in and if they sit there is the the humans to eat and say bismillah the a the Devils say you have no place to eat nor to sleep and if a person does not say bismillah they invite one another to come and have a meal and they invite one another to spend the night in the house so saying bismillah when you close the door blocks the way for the jinn from entering also reciting the last two ayahs of surat al-baqara chapter number two a man arose allah be Mon Cala he marabi he will mock me known to the end the Prophet told us a little of some that it prevents the Devils from entering your home for three nights reciting the whole surah also prevents the Devils from entering your house but it does not limit it to a period of time so we don't know how long but we know that it is effective so when you move to a new home you should recite the fact the surah al-baqarah the whole thing but every single night part of that car of going to bed that you recite the last two ayahs and this would lock your house insha'Allah in the face of the jinn other than that I personally do not know anything else"
