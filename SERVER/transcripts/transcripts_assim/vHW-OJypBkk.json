  "title": "Used to Misbehave, Bad Mouth others, must I seek their forgiveness after repenting? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "nami from bangladesh says that she misbehaved and badmouthed mouthed some of her friends and relatives and she doesn't want to be a two-faced person so must she after repenting to allah go and tell these people technically yes so that they would forgive you because the prophet told us allah that whoever transgresses against a muslim he should seek his pardon before the day of judgment where there are no currency no money it's either good deeds or bad deeds so you don't want to give them from your good deeds this is technically however scholars say that if the cons outweigh the prose meaning that i want forgiveness i want redemption so if i go and tell my cousin that i've bad mouthed him or backbit him and this would cause him to sever kinship ties with me or cause a bigger problem then in this case islam tells you don't it's sufficient that you seek allah's forgiveness repent sincerely and show remorse and whenever their mentioning is mentioned in front of you say good things about them just to compensate and allah knows best"
