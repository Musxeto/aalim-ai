  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] AC [Music] alhamdulillah utensils or Al it is a chapter found in the books of f or Juris prudence and it's found after mentioning the types of waters pure and impure the question is why and The Logical answer would be because the water is always carried by a container and this is why we have to know whether the container that carries the water has any impact on its Purity or not generally speaking the vast majority of containers that kept water at the time of the Prophet Alam and afterward Woods where skin waters so any container made of skin we have to look into this skin was it tanned or not was it from a Halal animal or a Haram animal because if it was from Pig's skin immediately anything we put in it it's njis dogs skin Lion's skin Haram animals we cannot use their skin and it's nudes what about if it were from cows camels and sheep well we have to look into whether it was standed or not as it's an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion is if it was slaughtered in a Halal way then the Hive uh um the hide I think it's called the the skin is pure whether tanned or not if it was a dead cow or a sheep the skin is NIS until it stand once it stand it becomes pure to use this is why Scholars spent a lot of time discussing these things then we will take this in a more lightly way inshallah so when we want to talk about utensils they also mention the permissibility of using such utensils so any type of utensils whether made of precious stones or of metals Etc they're permissible to use the prohibition is only restricted to gold and silver utensils where the Prophet sallallahu alaihi Al wasallam said that do not drink in Golden or silver utensils and do not eat in its plates because it is for them in this world that is for the disbelievers and to us on the day of judgment and also the hadiths that warns that those who drink in ut silver utensils that they will drag their guts uh um in Hellfire may Allah protect us all all of these indicate that it is totally prohibited to eat or drink using gold or silver utensils whether it's spoons forks knives plates or any other type of of utensils whether this is for men or for women they're all alike now in the past they used to weld some of their utensils with gold or silver so what's the ruling on that using gold is totally prohibited even for welding a small crack in your utensils using silver to close this Gap is permissible due to the Hadith of the Prophet Sall wasallam that he had a cup that broke and he wed it with some uh uh chain of silver now as we are discussing the issue of Purity let's assume someone has water in a huge bucket of silver or gold and he performs wood of it or from it is his woodo considered to be valid it's an issue of dispute however logically speaking it is valid because it has nothing related to the purity of the water this the the action is sinful but using water from such gold or silver utensil is not impacting the validity of the W okay coming back to the issue of utensils can we use utensils that belong to the disbelievers and the answer is there's no problem if it is pure and has no NASA in it in the Hadith of Jabber may Allah be pleased with him he says that we used to go on Expeditions with the prophet Alat and as part of booty of War we used to gain and collect utensils from the disbelievers and the enemies of Islam and we used to use them and nobody said anything about it which meant that the prophet approved using such utensils that belong to the disbelievers so as long as it's pure and clearly pure there's no njasa on it then there's no problem in using it the problem is when we are doubtful they may have consumed intoxicants or pork or dead meat in this case we wash it thoroughly until we're certain that there is no impurity in it and then we can use it because when the prophet was asked about a similar situation he said if you can find something else then do not eat from them but if you cannot find anything else then wash them and eat from them meaning the utensils so it all goes back to or goes down to whether there is an impurity or not and you can Cascade this to everything I live in a a campus with non-muslims can I use the microwave well we look at the microwave is there any impurity in it that may impact negatively the food that you use if it's going to get in direct contact with impurities then the answer is no and you go on and on and on until you feel satisfied that it is Pure Clean I've washed it thoroughly then you can use that without any problem and Allah Knows Best [Music] [Music] for [Music] for"
