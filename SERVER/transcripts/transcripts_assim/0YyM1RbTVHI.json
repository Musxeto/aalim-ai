  "title": "If I join the prayer while imam is in ruku position, without reciting Fateha? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "if I come and the Imam is in record position should I recite the Fatiha jeopardizing the possibility that the Imam may say some Allahu Liman Hamidah and I miss rapport with him or should I skip it while knowing that the Prophet said I'll assume that there is no salat without reciting the Fatiha I'm in a dilemma the answer is very easy one of the prophet's companions alayhi salatu salam entered the masjid and by when he entered the door he heard the prophet some say Allah Akbar and was in the required position so the man immediately from from the door of the message said Allah Akbar and performed record and walked in the position in the core until he was in the row with the worshippers so the prophecy Sentinel on him having then continued the prayer after concluding the prayer the Prophet s salaam turned around said who made Recor at the gate at the doors of the masjid and we know that the Prophet sees was given the ability to see those behind him while facing the Qibla alayhi salatu salam so a man said o prophet of allah i did this and by allah i only intended good i didn't know what to do I saw you in Recor I could not stand up and walk while you were in record I had to do something exactly like you so the Prophet smile area so Simon said Zadok Allah who her son may Allah increase you in being careful and steadfast do not go back to doing that again meaning that it is not befitting of a person to walk while in the record position you look weird maybe you're gonna fall in your face so don't do this again now the Prophet did not say alayhi salatu salam repeat an extra raka because you missed fatiha which is the vast majority of scholars stating that one is exempted from reciting the Fatiha if he finds the Imam in the position of rocker and he joins the congregation you don't have to pray the Fatiha I didn't hear it share it's a silent tracker shake it's a silent prayer shake even though say Allahu Akbar and prostrate and and and go to Luke or share one one Allahu Akbar - Allahu Akbar this it's okay both so if you do allahu akbar for takbir a telegram and then allahu akbar for rock or is valid and if you say allahu akbar for tak-tek Pires Laham and ruku as well and go for recall without repeating it it's valid both is ok no problem so this is an evidence a second scenario which is the Imam was standing up reading the last part of the surah by the time I said Allahu Akbar he went to rock or so I prayed with him standing up but he immediately went to record if I pray Fatiha I will not catch up with him in this case you're exempted go ahead there's no problem show so I hope this answers your question"
