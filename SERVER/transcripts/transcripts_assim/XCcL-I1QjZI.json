  "transcript": "Bella from Pakistan is 13 years of age and he is masha'Allah a smart young man he had a question and he went to the right people in shala to ask while the millions of Muslims just sit there and do nothing he took action which means that he's positive masha'Allah and he has a very bright future in front of ahead of him now his question is that my parents are not scholars and I find scholars saying things while my parents say otherwise who should I follow at this stage Abdullah you have to follow your parents until you reach a level of knowledge where you can differentiate between what the scholars are saying and what your parents are saying so now they tell you you have to do this and the scholars say no you must not do that and you do not know where either party is coming from from the Quran or Sunnah you don't have evidence if your parents come up with an evidence then you can hold on to that if the scholars come up with an ayah from the Quran or from the hadith that orders you to do something and your parents tell you not to do it then you have to come back to them with politeness with respect and ask them yeah any for example you want to go and pray in the masjid the scholars say it is an obligation the Prophet as Salam did not even pardon a blind man from attending the the hotbar the the daily prayers and he said you hear that at the end the man said yes that's you have to respond so you go to your parents any person no don't go we will look into their reasons why you don't want me to go they say because this will affect your studies it's an invalid reason we don't want you to go because here to the message it's very dangerous so and so and our neighbor so-and-so and our relative so-and-so were kidnapped and then ransom was sought after until they paid the ransom and they got their child back and this is happening it used to happen now I think Pakistan is much a safer place at hamdulillah and a lot of these crimes are no longer they have a good grip on security so yeah even the terrorists don't find a nice breeding place to breed in hand Allah may Allah social protect Pakistan and the people of Pakistan and to protect Islam in Pakistan but if this is their excuse then this is a valid excuse if they are afraid of that so you have to look into it basically speaking you have to study more Abdullah you have to learn your religion more you have to learn how to evaluate the evidences from your parents and from the scholars and also how to overcome your own feelings and desires at this age which is early but keep on learning the Quran learning the sunnah of the prophet Isaiah and eventually insha'Allah Allah will guide you without any problem"
