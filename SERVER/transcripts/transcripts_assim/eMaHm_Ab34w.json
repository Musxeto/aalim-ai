  "transcript": "Are any sound effects that are made from a digital digital audio software like the sound like effect you hear if you go to question right or question incorrect uh these sounds are made from instruments in a computer software is it still halal to use and intentionally hear these sounds because they don't give us the same effect as music Omar Omar Omar the problem is musical instruments this is what the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam prohibited so if I have a guitar and I pull one string and the string says is this music? No, this is one tone. But if I make a chord and I start to play, this is music. Likewise, digit digital um invented or created sounds. When you have a multiplechoice question and you choose the wrong answer and you digitally make a sound, this is not music. There's no problem in that. Or if you have a correct answer, it goes, there's no problem that there is no music. There's no beat to it. There's no feeling of sensation listening to such things. A fire siren, there's no problem in that. an ambulance. There's no problem in that. And I hope this answers your question."
