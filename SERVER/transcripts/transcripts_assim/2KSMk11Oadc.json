  "title": "Brother (13) says he reached age of puberty, Can we take his word & travel with him? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "we're going to be traveling soon and my dad was supposed to be the one to travel with us but he's unable to so the next to be able to travel with us would be my 13 year old brother who i'm not sure has hit adulthood and the problem is if my parents ask him he might say that he has even if he hasn't because i know that he wants to leave the country right at the moment so i wanted to ask if he does say he has hit adulthood we wouldn't have any other reason not to believe him because he does look like it due to a deep voice his sideburns coming in etc along with his age which is really close to 15. so should we just take his word for it and travel with him or doubt him 13 is probably um in like 80 percent had hit the age of puberty so if he says yes that he had reached the age of puberty and his father knows how to communicate and to know that then in this case you take a word for it and you can travel with him inshallah without any problem"
