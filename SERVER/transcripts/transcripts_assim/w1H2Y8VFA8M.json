  "transcript": "Bailey from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. Sheikh, can a woman expose her voluntary ibadahs to her husband and mother? Is there any benefit in doing so? Should she do it? There is no problem at all in exposing our voluntary forms of worship if there is benefit from it. For example, if I'm fasting Mondays or Thursdays and someone says come and join us for lunch and I say I'm fasting, there's no problem in that, none whatsoever. The problem is that to go around people's homes knocking on their doors and saying listen today I'm fasting so if you're going to invite me, don't. You know I fast every Mondays and Thursdays and sometimes three white days and alhamdulillah this is not difficult. I've been doing it for like 20 years. Oh, this unfortunately takes away all your good deeds down the drain because you are boasting about it. You are showing off without any legitimate reason. you"
