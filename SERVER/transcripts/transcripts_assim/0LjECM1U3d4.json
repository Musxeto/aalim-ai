  "title": "Procedure to take back a wife once a man has divorced his wife? Ruju or reconcile? | Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "our first question for tonight is from brother Norman and this was from last programs questions or emails he says what is the procedure to take back a wife once a man has divorced her rude or or reconcile first of all it is important to understand the concept of marriage and divorce and this may take a while so if there are people who are interested in calling they might be put on hold for a little bit of time marriage in Islam is one of the easiest things that can ever happen because people frequently need it and whenever there is a need for something is LA makes it easier so breathing is essential for our lives so it is the easiest thing to do just inhale and you are breathing drinking water is very essential essential in our lives but it is of a lower degree of importance so you can find water but not as easy as you're finding air now when it comes to marriage if a man is interested in marrying a woman and everything has been done the due diligence and everything is had been taken care of the proceeding is as following the guardian of the girl with her consent proposes to the boy so he says I give you my daughter I give you my sister in marriage the boy accepts and he says I accept her marriage in the presence of two witnesses or more the marriage is done so marriage is verbal and it's a commitment once the transaction wants the contract once this operation has been done she's his wife legally they can assume their marital life as a man and his wife now Islam gives the man the right to divorce and he has three chances of divorce divorces or takes place by uttering it so the intention does not qualify someone says what lie I intend to divorce you to his wife this is not a divorce I will divorce you this is not a divorce I think we have to get divorced this is not a divorce it has to be a statement or a verb in the sense that I divorce you done or you are divorced boom done tell us it's over but he has three chances so if he says I divorce you the divorce took place one down two to go yet there's still man and wife until their eight-day period is over and what is it Derrida is the waiting period after the divorce if a woman is not pregnant her right the period is three monthly cycles if she is too old so she is in her menopause or she's too young to have menses in this case instead of three monthly cycles her idea or waiting period is three months if she is pregnant in this case her head the period ends the moment she gives birth and this may be seven months six five three four two depending on her pregnancy now it is prohibited for a man to divorce his wife when she is in her menses or when she is in the state of purity yet he had intercourse with her in that state of purity this is called Poliquin bhaduri innovated divorce does it happen the four schools of thoughts say he's sinful but it is effective it is valid so if a person wants to divorce what does he do and this is part of the wisdom of Islam if I want to divorce my wife god forbid and I'm angry at the moment yet we had intimacy a few days few weeks ago Lahm tells me wait until she gets her menses after she's pure from her menses now she's in the state of purity that we had no intimacy in now I can divorce her in 99.9% of all divorce cases are cancelled because of this because in a state of fury and anger or rage people tend to forget and forgive after couple of hours but if he divorced on the heat of his anger then we would have broken the house the marital house the marriage etc the second permissible type of divorce is when a woman is pregnant because usually men when they find their women pregnant and they're angry and they want to divorce they always remember the child that is coming to this world soon and they feel regretful to have this child born into a divorce so they usually hesitate but if a man says to his wife I divorce you or you're divorced while she's pregnant this is a hundred percent valid divorce so sure what what to do we've already divorced I already divorced my wife what to do now I want to reconcile well as long as she's in the state of it dad you're still man and wife she lives in the house you're not allowed to take her out kick her out to her parents house she is forced to they in your house you can look at her she looks at you she cooks to you you talk like man wife everything is as normal except that there's no intimacy at all so for these three monthly cycles usually a couple of months a little bit less a little more there still man and wife they see each other every single day they sleep on the same bed or in the same room inevitably things would come back to normal in sha Allah usually they kiss and make up after a week or two maybe a month or so but inevitably because they see each other they still feel the fire going on so they reconcile how to reconcile either verbally by telling her that I have reconciled with you or by having intimacy with the intention of getting her back her knowledge of revoking the divorce or reconciling is not essential so if he goes if he divorces her today and at night he goes to his friends or his family and say listen I divorced my wife tonight but between you and me I have reconciled with her so I revoked my divorce so this means that she is his wife but maybe he does not want to tell her so that she would be reprimanded for the things that he had she had done and he's utilizing this one divorce out of three to the benefit of the marital life so that it would be a long-term marriage rather than a short-term marriage this is okay there's no problem does the woman have the right to reject revoking her divorce or refuse to come back know that she has no choice in it this is not her right she has to come back and comply he did this once one down two to go he divorced her again the same procedure two down one to go if he utters the third divorce it's over game is over they immediately turn into men Muharram total strangers and he cannot revoke them the divorce and in order to marry her she has to marry a different bloke a different man a real marriage lives with him and whenever they are divorced a real divorce not with the intention to go back to the first guy then they can remarry with the conditions of her consent the consent of her guardian new maja a dowdy and two male witnesses or more now one usually ask what's the ruling on divorcing my wife more than once so there are so-called quote unquote men or if you call them male that would be better because men is a higher level than a male you get gorillas males and donkeys as males but not men men is a title given that you have to earn by taking the right decision by measuring the consequences of your actions and of your words before doing or saying any of that so some so-called men divorce without thinking and not once maybe ten or fifteen or twenty times so when he's angry with his wife I divorce you you're divorced divorced divorced and he repeats it ten times and after half an hour he's still enraged said I divorce you another ten times so this is like a Kalashnikov ak-47 so many divorces in one push of a button or a trigger now all of this is an issue of dispute whether the three divorces take place or not and the more authentic opinion is if this issue was displayed to a Mufti usually the most authentic opinion is the mufti says like the ruling of the Prophet RS rostrum only one divorced counts if the case goes to a judge it depends on the country he is in so in some countries like Hanafy school of thought they would say three counts as three so it's permanent and the guy is just married last week and they say you cannot go back together you cannot revoke the marriage and this is also acceptable because this is the ruling of the Muslim ruler in that country so it's binding you have to stick with it because this is the ruling of the country you're in so you have to be careful before issuing this statement of divorce you have to utilize the period of waiting period if you already divorced and want to reprimand your wife and want to remove any misconceptions or misunderstandings between you so that you don't divorce her again the following month what's the point then of this first divorce if you did not utilize it and a Muslim man should be careful weigh the consequences before uttering this word and Allah Azza WA JAL knows best"
