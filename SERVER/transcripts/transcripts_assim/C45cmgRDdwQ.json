  "transcript": "you are and this shows you when the prophet smiles when he laughs that our religion is not a religion of depression or of Sadness and Sorrow it's a religion of being optimistic being positive feeling the mercy of Allah and this is why despite all of the prophets worries and his tasks at hand despite all of the things he was thinking about how to run his um and spread his darwah U despite all of that he would still have the time to joke with his wives and Companions and spread an atmosphere of mercy and optimism says the companions once said to the prophet oh prophet of Allah you joke with us as if they were Amazed by that how is this possible when you are the messenger of Allah and someone as serious as you are yet you joke with us and the prophet acknowledged this and said yes but I only say the truth meaning he would never joke while saying a lie all what comes from his mouth is truthful"
