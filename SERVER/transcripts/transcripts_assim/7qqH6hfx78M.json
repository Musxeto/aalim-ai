  "title": "Am I hypocrite & punished for advising others to stay away from sins & commit them myself Assimalhak",
  "transcript": "he says i try my best to advise people to keep or from keeping away from sins but if i commit those sins myself am i considered a hypocrite and the punishment of allah for this kind of person is that he will be wrapped in his own intestines in hell will this apply to me as well munir each one of us is ordered to do four things one to advise people to do righteous things to himself do these righteous things three to stay away from haram for that he himself stays away from haram so these are four things if one of them is lost it does not justify losing some other part of it so for example if i don't pray fajr in the masjid this doesn't mean i do not advise people to go to pray in the masjid there's great reward there's this there's that and if you don't pray in the message this will happen and this will happen just because i don't do it does not mean that i don't advise people to do it likewise if i fall into sin if i smoke it doesn't mean that if my children start to smoke that i say okay i don't want to fall under the category of assam the hadith of osama bin zayed may i'll be pleased with him and with his father where the people of hell saw a man with his intestines splitting out and he is rotating like a grinder like a mule rotates around the grinder and they said what is this weren't you in the dunya in life didn't you advise us to do good and prohibited us from doing evil he said yes however i used to advise you and enjoin virtue and righteousness but not do it and prohibit you from vice and sins and fall into it this is a a true full-fledged hypocrite but when we ourselves fall weak when we are not as strong as we think so we can share with the muslims what's good and what's bad and tell them to stay away from what's bad and to do what's good but we ourselves are unable to do it then this is a weakness in us us and it's not hypocrisy so don't let shaytan come to your head and whisper to you and tell you that okay if i'm a sinful person if i listen to music i shouldn't tell people not to drink intoxicants or to party or to go to nightclubs if a woman is not wearing hijab she says to she shouldn't tell herself that well if i'm not wearing the hijab then if people gossip or backbite or do haram things let them be it's not my business no we have to do these four things to the best of our ability and allah knows best you"
