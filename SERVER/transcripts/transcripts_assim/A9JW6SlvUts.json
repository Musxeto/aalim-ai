warahmatullahi wabarakatuh and welcome to the 54th class of our last book on the Islamic  and we stopped last time at maintenance and this is not related to your house maintenance this is not related to your car mechanics it is related to what is known in Arabic as enough up your expenditure who as a man you are responsible to provide for this is the maintenance that we are talking about and this is a big chapter that all people doing counseling especially when it comes to issues of divorce and custody et cetera they have to have knowledge in so we have an Africa when usually mentioned we always refer to providing for the wife and the children but also we have other means of naraka for example we have an Africa over the parents and this is something that one is obliged to do an African over the relatives when they're needing an Africa over animals as well which is also something that people usually don't pay attention to there are a number of hadith governing this issue for example a boomers Rodell body may Allah be pleased with him said the prophet salallahu alaihe wasalam said when a man provides and spends money over his family and he anticipates the reward with Allah it is a charity most of us don't put this in mind we go to the supermarket we fill our shopping cart with food and groceries and vegetables we pay at the cashier we go home take the bags put them in the kitchen that's it some may feel depressed and whenever they talk to the children by the way today's groceries were so much expensive it was a thousand riyals why are you doing this why are you saying this to your kids they don't know that by saying this you're depressing your children you're depressing your wife if you were smart if you knew religion well you would have felt happy painting this because this is a charity you're eating from it you're feeding your children and your wife and you're getting rewarded for that and the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam also said whoever refrains from asking people Allah will make him rich and you have to begin with those first you sponsor so the prophet when he said that is salat wa salam 1d nod you spent on your kids another dinner you spend on your right a third one you spend upon your companions so the Prophet Assam began with the best the family the children the essential things in your life your ride your your animal you etc your friends all of these are in the cause of Allah what you spend and the Prophet said that is so some in an authentic hadith which was narrated by santim wo past may Allah be pleased with him he said that the Prophet said that is Saleh versa there isn't any money you spend anticipating the award from Allah seeking Allah's face except Allah would reward you for it even the morsel you put in your wife's mouth so people have to know that the issue of spending on the family not only it is an obligation but it is something that you will be rewarded for what is na ha ha considered to be mandatory over so is buying cosmetics for my wife considered to be enough AHA is taking her once a year on summer vacation considered to be enough haha or it's only the essentials scholars say that naka is the support you give to provide food clothes shelter and medications and other needed things so these things is an obligation upon the man even if his wife is rich even if she has a fixed income whether it is from her family or from her inheritance or from her job allah azza wajal says in the quill and launched them in a section of where you dwell out of your means and do not harm them in order to oppress them so it is a man's responsibility to shelter his wife and children and the companion of the Prophet came to him at a solemn and asked about his wife's rights over him so the Prophet said Ali his salat Oh sir you feed her as you feed yourself give her clothes as you have do not hit her face and do not abuse her verbally you may not boycott her except at home and this hadith by itself if we were to go into details that would require like 3-4 sessions because this is one of the great advices of the Prophet Allah still a person that would teach men their obligations towards their wives bearing in mind that such obligations are not limited to what was mentioned see it's not only okay I'm feeding her from what I'm eating I only like to eat falafel so breakfast lunch dinner is only a sandwich of falafel it's like three Rios that's excellent for my budget no this is not fulfilling your obligations this is the minimum and life and marriage is not upheld on such minimums she could also do the minimum for you and that would not be very satisfying to you if you don't do the same to her so there are lots of things that men and women must learn in order to get their marriages correctly and to have a happy marriage a sister a few days ago had a counseling session and she was opting for divorce in less than fifteen or twenty minutes all what I had to do was to open her eyes to what are her rights and what are her obligations and this is normal alhamdulillah she immediately understood and she says now I can see there was like this haze in front of my eyes all what I was thinking of is why am i crying all day night all day and all night long and how can I seek divorce from my husband but now I know my obligations I thought that he was not providing for me while he was I thought providing means a more lavish life not a shelter and food and clothes and everything essential that I need is there so I was wrong so a lot of the confusion that comes arises from lack of knowledge of the Sharia and this is what we are trying here in our classes to clarify so let us go to the hadith of hint bill truth man she came to the prophet alayhi salat wa sallam complaining that her husband abu sufyan is a stingy man and he doesn't give her what suffice is her and her children so can she take from his money and the Prophet said that I saw some yes take what suffice is you and your children in what is considered to be a mouth in what is normal and this makes you the judge over what you're taking and would make you accountable a day of judgment so for example if the husband does not fulfill his rights is that does not fulfill his obligations towards his family the wife is permitted to steal from his wallet what is essential and needed and this is very unfortunate because I get a lot of problems and questions where the husband does not pay does not support his wife and children even if he's living with them in the same house it is sufficient for him to know that his father-in-law is sending his wife money so he depends on that whenever she asks for money she says your father is always sending you money what she wants groceries ask your mother what about the school fees of the children well ask ask them they love their grandchildren and they would be more than happy to give them what about my hospital fees I have to go and see the doctors ask them they're rich oh you have savings or sell some of your gold all of this is Haram totally hollow to the extent that such a husband it does not deserve to be obeyed and she can refrain from giving him intimacy because of his irresponsible behavior Allah said in the Quran a result of comunidad de la laa ilaha illa bima alcohol women and performing am wali men are Guardian over women due to what Allah has favored them over women and due to what they had spent from their wealth to provide so if a man fails to do this a woman has the full right to refrain from obeying him and from giving him his rights in bed now when the Prophet said Alice was to take what suffice is you and your sons or your children in ma who in what is acceptable normally this means that if a wife needs money she can take from her husband's wallet or savings without him knowing but she has to do this fearing Allah so she needs food she buys it she needs medication she buys it she needs or she desires a big steak from a fancy restaurant no this is not the norm she wants a wedding dress to attend a wedding of a relative though she has like 1015 wedding dresses but she says that people had seen them all I word that I wear only one dress in a lifetime this is Haram this is extravagance she wants to send her mother money so sure so she takes from her husband's wallet this is Haram so we have to know what is al-mar'u here so Judas for example say she needs money for medication or dr. chicken tikka she needs money to do cosmetic surgery she cannot take this is not something that is mandated or essential she wants to travel to her family in a different City so she takes money from his wallet not permissible okay can she ask him she can but it's not his obligation to take you there unless you made that as a condition in the contract in this case yes it's a different issue before getting married before the actual signing of the contract the guardian says i stipulate the condition that you bring her over to her parents house where they live once a year or twice a year and he says yes I agree then it's his job to provide for her a woman sees her husband's wallet she had never gone for Hajj in her lifetime so she wants to take money to go for Hajj not permissible this is not a man's responsibility towards his wife he's not obliged to take her for Hajj chef she's poor she doesn't have money then she will never perform Hajj which is a pillar of Islam no problem because it is not essential for her to perform Hajj except if she is capable and she doesn't have the money this means that she's done able to do it and there's no Hajj mandated upon her so what about if she's a working woman she has a good job she's a manager of a school she gets paid well in this case the man is obliged still to provide for her but if going to her job means that she will compromise her duties at home in this case there is a room to reconcile so the husband says honey I have no problem in you going to work but someone has to clean the house to cook the food to take care of the house shorts and you work ten hours a day you come tired and you don't have time or the energy to do this so you need to pay for the mate she says no I'm not paying for the mate you have to pay for the mate so no I don't have to pay for the mate it's my responsibility and it's time to provide for the house and it's your responsibility to take care of the house if there is a conflict then I as a husband have the authority to order you to resign your job and sit home and take care of me and my children so usually women would say hmm quitting my job meaning that I won't have a salary no I don't not want this yeah okay I'm willing to compromise I'll pay for the mate I'll pay for the driver to take me to school and get me back okay no problem usually men don't ask for this but if they do it's their right because they got married to a woman who would take care of them and their families in her home not a manager or an employer an employee that goes out like the man comes back home like the man this is not what we got married for some scholars but this is a minority said that she can work and she can be married to a man even if she does not give him his rights of intimacy he is still obliged to provide for her for example I'm married after one year of marriage my wife left the home without my permission went to her family and stayed there for a year some scholars say during this year I am obliged to provide for her the majority of score says no why would they provide for her she left without my permission and she's not coming back so what is this a charity why would I provide for her I need my wife to be with me home and this is the most authentic opinion now the one who's entitled for full maintenance even if she's not home is a pregnant woman because she's pregnant with my child so it is my obligation to provide for her whether we're on good terms or on bad terms whether she's on in my home or she is at her parents home whether we're fighting or not I have to provide for him likewise if I divorce a woman and this divorce is revocable so it's either the first or the second divorce during her waiting period as we spoke earlier in previous meetings and sessions that yes it is mandatory upon me to provide her with her maintenance now what about the maintenance of the parents the vast majority of scholars say that it's an obligation upon the children collectively not upon one child which is unfortunately oops microphone is gone which is unfortunately I get a lot of questions about people saying to me that our parents are old and needy and we are seven siblings one of us is working in the Gulf and he's the one who's providing for my parents paying money for the house for the maid and the other six are passive I say this is haram this is a collective effort the other six should also contribute financially it should be divided upon them as when dividing the inheritance some scholars say so the man pays double what his sister does according to the inheritance and some say no they have to be equal and the most authentic opinion is that one has to pay according to his own ability so a rich boy pays according to his wealth and someone who's barely earning pays according to his earning and wealth now some scholars say that even if the parents are not needy it's an obligation upon the children to provide for their parents and this is not true if the parents are well-off and they have enough money or more than enough to give them an honorable and decent life and they're strong they don't need a mate they're healthy yet they insist that the children send them five hundred dollars a month each from their earnings well if the children are wealthy and such an amount would not burden them or cause them any hardship I would definitely say do it for the sake of Allah to please your parents and you reward it for that but if it is not if the children do need the money and they don't have much to spare because they have children they have a wife they need to take care of their families they need to save in this case they are not obliged to provide for their parents and a lot of the Muslims misunderstand the hadith and tell a man Luka Leah beak when a man came to the prophet as Sam said and my father watch they take money from me against my will so the father's that the Prophet said a son until a magically a big you and your wealth belong to your father some of the scholars misunderstood this hadith and thought that it means that it gives a carte blanche to the father to take whatever wealth from his sons earning and savings and this is not true the vast majority of scholars say that he cannot harm his son so if I have savings of a hundred thousand and my father comes and wants to take half of that this would jeopardize my savings my plans to buy a property or a plot to invest etcetera and this is a lot of money yes if my father is really needy and he wants something to get even with just any to make the month for he comes and ask for five thousand I'm obliged to give him so what is your answer share for you and your father belong to you and your wealth belong to your father the hadith is referring not to my wealth because if I and my wealth belonged to my father to access and to do whatever he wants with my wealth this means that the moment I die he should take everything which is not true the wife gets one age the children gets this this much after I get as a father once one sixth or one-third depending so I don't get everything which means that in life I don't even get everything so the hadith is to be understood that one has to go out of his way to please his father when his father is in real need not when my father is a multi-millionaire and he comes and sees one of my cars or one of my properties and he wants to confiscate it as I need it no this is unfair and it's not part of Islam okay then we move on to supporting poor relatives now this is an issue of dispute because some made that mandatory if this relative I can inherit what do you mean sure let's give an example I have a brother who's poor and I have a father who's alive who's middle-class and I'm rich can I give my zakat to my brother or can am I obliged to provide for my brother as per the cat that says yes I can as per being obliged to provide from him the answer is no I'm not why Allah mentioned in surat al-baqara chapter 2 when it was relating to the verses of suckling a child for two years and then allah azzawajal was talking about whose responsibility is it to provide for this child and his mother and if there was no father of the child to provide for the suckling who would be in charge Allah Allah says in the Quran while aware if he miss Liu phthalic meaning that the maintenance of the suckling infant and his suckling mother is upon the one who would inherit if this child would have died so if I am one of the heirs of the child and I'll give another example my poor brother we spoke about earlier my father is dead so if my brother were to die who would be his heir his siblings which means I will then had it which means I'm responsible to provide for him I cannot give him second but I can definitely give him charity and when we talk about sibling kinship up over him what is more sibling to your kinship than seeing your own blood your own relative needing and you are rich but not providing definitely this is a thing that people should pay great attention and deal to as well finally we speak about maintenance for animals and people say that they have animal care associations etc Islam is proud to have set the foundations 14th centuries 15 centuries ago and this is a well-known fact in Islam the Prophet told us Allah is Allah to say that a woman was admitted to Hellfire because of a kitten she had a cat she locked the cat in a room not feeding it and at the same time not letting it go to eat from the insects outside or from the garbage containers or whatever until the kitten died Allah through this woman in hell because of that and on the other side a man and in another hadith a prostitute once saw a dog so thirsty and this man or this girl gave that panting dog water not from their container rather they went down the well fill their shoe with water held the shoe with their mouths and climbed back again only to give water to that panting dog and allah azzawajal forgave their sins and admitted them to jannah a prostitute Allah forgave her sins for such an act of kindness and in another hadith when the Companions were amazed and shocked so they asked the prophet alayhi salat wa salam o Messenger of Allah will we be rewarded for what we do to our animals and the Prophet confirmed that by saying alehissalaam you have a reward for everything you do for a living creature so this shows you that taking care of your animals whether it's a camel it's a cow it's a mule it's a donkey sheep when you feed them when you graze them when you water them when you take care of their health that you are rewarded for such expenditure and spending the money in such means with the grace of Allah but of course what mainly concerns us is the fact that as men we have responsibilities and our responsibilities are to take care of those whom Allah made us in charge of so yes the man has a very difficult life and row to earn so that he can provide for his wife his children his parents and maybe if he is well-off relatives and also if he has livestock or he has animals that he is keeping in the house as pets he has to provide for that as well so when we talk about maintenance it's like 99 percent related to men but yes also women when they're responsible for the children there's no one else to provide for the children they become obliged to do this among other things well wahoo and then when it's between me alayhi assalam we move on to the questions question 38 jimena abu bakr says is it okay to have mortgage because in the UK it's not easy to have the cash to buy at one time I heard fact why you can do this if it's a living house and it's only one house well such fatwas require evidence from the Quran or the Sunnah mortgage without any doubt is prohibited and why is that because mortgage is something that deals with Reba it's a interest-based loan so to come and say okay it's once-in-a-lifetime and it's a residential house and you cannot buy two properties only one where did you get this from they said chef this is essential this is part of life so that the Muslims can live in Europe or in America so subhanAllah and you justify Haram because a person wants to live in Europe or in America so if I'm unmarried and I live in Europe Horan America and I'm literally frustrated because I don't have a wife and I'm I only want to relieve myself so you give me a permission to like visit a brothel once a year or once every six months because medically this is okay what kind of logic is this allah azzawajal threatened to war wage war against those who deal with Reba so let us ask a crystal clear question is mortgage RIBA based loan or not nobody would say no it's not it is so is it one of the major 7 cents in Islam said yes if I don't take mortgage would I die no there will be hardship share there will be this will be that I won't be able to save who cares whether you are able to save or not will you be able to pay rent every month yeah but then what about my children's Han a lot why think about your children now who provides for you what happens if you die now who will provide for your children so this is not acceptable what you're saying what you're saying and what you're doing is totally prohibited I myself with the grace of Allah do not possess any property I don't live in my own house I pay rent and I've been paying rent for the past like 38 years now I don't have a plot I don't have a house to own out nothing and I'm living a beautiful life no complaints I have everything I want I have everything I need with the grace of Allah so it is not an excuse for someone to cross the line and to face a larger waging war against him just because he wants to live in a property whether it is in the UK or elsewhere bacillus in my mood says I know a person who when angry always screams and tells his wife that she's divorced and when his anger cools down after a few hours he comes back normally what should be the advice to such a sister and a brother why they are in real danger I would advise that day immediately stop any relationship between a man and wife until they get a solid verdict they have to go to the Muslim court or they have to see the authorized Islamic Center both of them so that the Imam could hear from the man and from the wife herself in order to say whether this is an irrevocable divorce and they have to separate or this divorce did not take place and what I see is that this had taking place maybe tens of times and this is problematic they face the possibility of being living in Xena but it's with the same person they were married to so there's no fun in it if one would say that it should be fun she has a major sin so committing zina with the same man you were married to because he divorced you and you're still living with him in Haram this is problematic now anger is one of the reasons that Islam allows divorce not to take place but not any anger everyone divorces his wife did so when he was angry no one divorces his wife while he is happy in having a good time but the anger has to be measured correctly in order to know whether the divorce took place or not meaning sometimes not sometimes all of the times people come chef I divorced my my wife and I was so angry that I divorced her so I said what kind of anger is it because in the hadith the anger that does not allow divorce to take place is the one that is close to intoxication when a person is drunk he makes decisions and regrets them because it's not sane at that time like why sometimes people and I had cases like this where people divorce their wives and could not remember after waking up he said I don't know who broke the LCD screen you did Wow who throw my mobile on the wall you didn't you broke it and you divorce your wife mmm the guy's shocked yeah this divorce doesn't take place but whenever she cooks food and forgets to put salt in it and you make an issue and you start to shout and scream and divorce you have to go to a psychiatrist to get a medical report or an evaluation usually people are selective in their anger so this product he says well I share when I'm angry with my wife I can't see I can't speak I don't remember anything I have these attacks of rage that overwhelms me so I say okay if you're driving down the street and somebody cuts you over and you start shouting and maybe gesturing to him and you ask him to pull over he pulls over you come out of the car wanting to fight but you discover that this guy is six four bodybuilder and scars all over his face and this guy is trouble what do you do so I say good morning and I get back in my car and drive where is your bridge attack where is your anger evaporated same thing if a policeman pulls you over and starts to swear at you say bad things about you would you knock him down or you would refrain yourself because you know that this is a felony and a crime same thing if you are at work and today is the evaluation of the employees where your boss gets to grade you so that you may get the increment in the race and the bonus or not and he says obscene things to you not offensive thanks to you would you swallow your pride and put your tail between your legs and go or would you pick up a fight and stand for yourself if in these scenarios you said no I control my anger but I fail to do so with my wife then your anger is not real it is selective and you need to get a fatwa on that and Allah knows best I know Nasir says can I can a girl say Salaam to other grandma hum like family this is not recommended unless these are sitting with other moms so you come into the house you're wearing the veil and covered and you see your parents and your cousins may be an uncle sitting and you say Accela malik when you got you who so you intend with the same everybody not your nun Mahon but everybody this is ok but if there's only one than Muharram in the room and you say assalamu aleikum this is free mixing and it's not permissible neither Nadeem says I wanted to ask the sonder storm bring evil with it this is an Allah's knowledge a thunderstorm is a thunderstorm it has a lot of benefits it has a lot of good in it it brings rain but it also can have have some devastation and destruction and it puts fears in the hearts of people so this is only in Allah's knowledge Allah knows best Abdul Basit says how can I have a cat if buying it is prohibited is it Haram or makuu is buying a cat and selling a cat is prohibited in Islam how to buy how to get one well a lot of the people who breed cats in their homes they have cats every single year they call us say chef I have a/c ami cat or a Persian cat or this or that I have like six of them they are very young the mother gave birth a couple of days ago and I don't want them would you like one sometimes I take two or three and I give to people so every community has such donors such people who don't want to keep children of their cats in their homes so you can get that you can also go to your shelter if your city has one and you can select a stray cat and you can take it for free for adoption inshallah thirdly if none of these two above work you will not die without a cat so it's not something of a life or death or something that is essential in our lives to get that allows us to cross the LOC the red lines and do something that is column which was prohibited by the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam nor it have such as the person born with white skin tone and this stone remained almost eight years but due to burn by sunlight long time skin tone became darker is it permissible to use any whitening products for turning the previous skin tone I'm afraid that this is not tangible meaning that you cannot control the whiteness of your skin and if you have a problem as such simply stay away from Sun and in couple of weeks to four weeks time you will gain your natural white color but to use such chemicals which are usually dangerous and causes and cause skin cancer and at the same time you cannot guarantee that this is your tone and not whiter than it is supposed to be yeah I believe that this is not a an essential thing to do if the resource man says is it permissible to imitate with your parents or with your partner let me rephrase that is it permissible to intimate to be intimate with your partner after doing everything of marriage except the party the hotma please answer well if you're asking about consummating the manager having intercourse with your wife after the marriage contract has been done so you pronounce legally man and wife meaning that the guardian says I give you my daughter so-and-so in marriage you say I accept her marriage there are two Muslim men witnessing this the marriage is not she's your wife but if she is still living in her father's home and he is not giving her to you until the wedding night and you're not supporting or providing for her shelter food medicine clothes yet because she's still living with her father in this case you cannot and you must not consummate the marriage you may visit you may sit with her you may touch her you may kiss her you may talk with her for hours without an end she's your wife but consummating the marriage is not permissible because the norm of the countries of the cultures of the communities that she is not your full wife until you consummate the marriage and announce it maybe you go and visit and sit with her haven't of course she becomes pregnant and you divorce her and now she's pregnant that people would talk and tarnish her reputation she got pregnant and she's not mad at she did not consummate the marriage how did this happen she must have fooled around and that's why he divorced her all of this is not permissible and Allah knows best amantadine says is it permissible to make du'a in our own language even in prayer making duaa whether in for prayer or voluntary prayer is a recommended Sunnah making dua in other than Arabic is permissible only if you do not know how to make duaa in Arabic so my language is English my first language my mother tongue is English so Institute if I want to ask for forgiveness I know in Arabic is not built firmly a lot more fiddly if I want mercy a lot more happening I know this in Arabic so I must say it in Arabic I cannot say oh Allah forgive me or have mercy on me because I know how to say it in Arabic but if I want to ask Allah something that is way above my ability in Arabic so I'd like to ask Allah Azza WA JAL to guide my son to work hard I don't have sons but yeah for a change to guide his heart to becoming a regular in praying in the Masjid I don't know how to say that in Arabic so I ask Allah that in my own native language without any problem Faisal says if I pray with your three records then after completing my second record prostration sujood after that without sitting in the Shahada in the second record when I stand up for starting the third raka can I do Ragini in the third raka so his question is simply as follows we know that raising the hands prefer getting inside has four places one in the beginning it never happens again the Korean telephone Allahu Akbar the second and the third happens in every single record when I go for the core Allahu Akbar when I rise up somehow Allah will even hand me that and this happens every time so the first one happens once in the beginning the second and third happens every rock on the fourth position when I raise my hands is when I'm praying mother it or lover answer origin why because there are two tashahud in these four prayers so when I'm through with my tisha hood sitting and I want to stand up to the third record I raise my hands and say Allah and this happens once in these four prayers now fight cells question is I understand this and I know this I'm asking about praying with your three lockers combined we know that we sit only in the third raka so the first and the second we don't sit we stand up so while I'm standing up from my second record to the third raka do I raise my hands the answer is no because you did not rise up from the shout you rose up from sujood and this is like the first record completely and Allah knows best his second question was what happens to the miscarriage of six weeks to four weeks baby six weeks four to six weeks such embryo is not a human being yet so scholars say that if the pregnancy is below 40 days this is not a human being it can be aborted miscarriage now we know from the hadith that when the pregnancy is 120 days an angel sent to breathe in life in that embryo so it becomes a human being so if the pregnancy was four to six weeks old this is not a human being this is not something that is considered to be impacting your prayer and your purity and after such a miscarriage the blood that comes is not postnatal bleeding that prevents you from fasting and praying rather it's just a bleeding that requires you clean yourself after the athan before Moodle and prayed Malcolm says I'm going to coaching easily we are studying in a group there but I'm not offering prayer in the Masjid due to this pandemic because messages are closed am i sinful or not coaching's are open methods are closed I don't see where your question is Martha if you're asking that you're going to attend the coaching class or going to the gym or doing anything and you feel guilty because the messages that are closed and you shouldn't be doing this no there's nothing wrong in that you can do whatever you want as long as you pray in the prescribed time you can go to coaching you could go to the gym you can do whatever you wish without a problem what this is from Elena's CSUN what about reading Donna from authority after forethought is it considered thicker if it was prescribed by the Prophet Alice awesome to be read after the salat then yes it is thicker but if you yourself say for example a banana Jennifer Doudna Hassan of activity has an open 11 not after the salat this is drawn and you should not do that and it becomes a an innovation as well Zaid zubayr says about the hadith which says that the best time for Dora is when after followed prayers and during night this hadith is authentic but I often tell the people that the translation is wrong the hadith if I recall correctly is a bird or a dog or a Salah watch what he's awful ail and if I'm not mistaken this was narrated by maybe I'm a Muslim but it's authentic there's no doubt in that so those who translated it do more Ocelot translates to at the end of the salat so it can be understood before the salon or after the salon and whenever there is a confusion there is a possibility 5050 that the best of Dora is at the end of the salad and the end of the salad can be interpreted into before salon meaning during the salad itself or after the salon so which one would we recommend we have to go for a decider and what is the decider the hadith of the Prophet himself is also another hadith the Prophet said sallallahu alayhi wasallam after you conclude offering salutation upon the Prophet s son that is in the last sitting choose whatever dua you want hmm this means that the Prophet is advising us to choose the door after finishing the salutation before offering Salah which emphasizes what we always repeat and remind people that before the Salam during the prayer this is a place for dua after the Salam when the prayer is over this is time for Vicar and Allah so Allah knows best this is all the time we have for today and until we meet next Thursday I think I will leave you via Manila with Salaam aleikum wa rahmatullah wa barakato"
