  "transcript": "side says there's a game which my brother plays it has a gun named as Armageddon which most most likely is the Christian name of the malhamatul kubrah the big battle in the at the end of times is there anything wrong in playing such games just because of such a name the answer is no the name itself has no significance whether in Arabic or in English so if I call my car there's no no problem in that because I'm not referring to the battle itself it's just a name and like uh so with Armageddon but when you come to video games nowadays it is a bit problematic because it is based on violence so whether it is p-u-b-g [Music] Pub or whatever they call it or Fortnight or whatever it is based on killing your opponent using different techniques hurting others now one says okay this is again and the answer is yeah it is a game I'm not actually doing it of course but what are the implications of playing such a game what is the psychological impact on our children it would increase their violence it would make them violent and their is almost certainly a lot of music involved and maybe sometimes some nudity introduced and a fighter can be a woman the one who gives you the prize can be a woman in a bikini or something like that so destruction killing and maybe sometimes if it has to do with Islam it tells you if you bomb a Masjid you get a hundred points and if you bomb a house in Baghdad or in uh Kabul in Afghanistan you get 50 points so it turns you around and against your Islam without knowing I personally believe that such games are bad influence and we should not allow our children to play with such games and Allah Knows Best"
