  "title": "Saying BismillAllah before eating or drinking and before Praying - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "there are two issues here and there is the ruling of saying bmah and saying bmah it is mandatory it is a must and if a person forgets and remembers remembers what uh eating he should say which translates to in in the beginning and at the end and is what is the ruling on saying it in our minds the vast majority of Scholars or if you wish if you can you can say that all the scholars of Islam say that you have to actually say it so you have to move your lips and saying it like this but if you just you know keep your lips tight and you say it in your mind this does not count and not only this verdict is in saying bah but it is also in reciting the Quran for example a lot of people you find them when reciting the Quran they keep their lips sealed and the vast majority of Scholars I have not seen any scholar stating that this is permissible they all say that whoever does this his prayer is invalid so if you keep your lips sealed and you recite the fa in your mind and you recite the Surah uh afterwards in your mind and you say sub also in your mind the majority of Scholars say that this is not valid and your prayer is invalid and that is why you have to always state or say it by moving your lips"
