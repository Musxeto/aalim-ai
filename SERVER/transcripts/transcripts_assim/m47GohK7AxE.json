  "title": "The Role Model || Who is your Role Model? || Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "alhamd I may apologize for maybe misfiring every now and then because I'm jetlagged I came all the way from Saudi Arabia how far is Saudi Arabia so all the way from Saudi Arabia alhamdulillah but I'm still recovering from uh the trip that's why I'm a little bit sleepy if I sleep in the middle of the lecture yeah I'm a an old grumpy grandfather wake me up and I'll continue inshallah the topic is a very very important topic in our lives the role model now the topic can be interpreted in many many different ways actually I don't care about you I care about myself and each and every one of you should have the same feeling because it's it's a sign of sincerity that you care for yourself would you like to be a bridge on top of Hellfire connecting the two edges where people walk on your back to safety would you like to do this yes what will happen people will go to safety but you will burn you're the one who's burning I don't care about people going to safety the hell with them all seriously I just want to be saved I want to be the one who makes it this is why the role model is not something that you work for and this is something that the youth a lot of the youth don't pay attention to how can I be a famous di like you don't if this is your intention to be a famous di stay home don't because this is not something you work for rather this is a byproduct now one of the greatest favors and blessings of Allah upon us is that he guided us to Islam and this we never contemplate or think about when you see the amount of misguidance in the world and you look in the matter what do you say when you see people dancing in nightclubs partying all night long drinking like a fish smoking like a chimney doing something like a rabbit what do you do what do you say you've selected me you've guided me the greatest upon us is that we're Muslims is that we pray in the Masjid is that we make our is that we wash our limbs five times a day and the prophet is one of this these greatest favors and blessings Allah selected the best of the best and he sent him to us to be our teacher our mentor to be our role model he is the one whom we're ordered to follow his footsteps Allah says in the Quran there has certainly been for you in the messenger of Allah an excellent pattern a role model for anyone who hope is in Allah and the last day and who remembers Allah often this excellent pattern this role model is what you follow what you take as an example in everything he does in everything he says and a role model can be good and can be bad and this is why Allah says an excellent pattern he specifically because there is so Allah specifically described him to be a good pattern s now take into consideration every human being by Nature every one of us is prone and designed to take a role model whether you like it or not everyone of us has this buil inside mechanism who should I follow who should I mimic who should I try to imitate and everything and if you look on the way we dress on the way we speak on the way we eat on our Hobbies even when you play sport those who play football if they accidentally score a goal yeah this happens once I Room moon sometimes in their own goal but let's not yeah go into details if you score a goal you find yourself doing some gestures like a famous footballer a striker some of them crawl on four limbs some of them fall on their chest some of them do this some I don't know I don't watch this nonsense alhamdulillah I don't have time and I hate a game where 20 adults run after a ball yeah they fight for a ball buy each one of them a bowl and go home and give them a cookie they will go away why fight over aable and I but this is a game they like it alhamdulillah so those who are weak need a role model that is strong and whenever you imitate someone it shows your vulnerability and weakness and it shows the strength of the one you follow and this is how the disbelievers wear when their Messengers called them to Islam they called them come follow the right religion follow the scriptures from Allah what did they say they say as Allah says in the Quran and similarly we did not send before you any Warner into a city except that its affluent said indeed we found our forefathers upon a religion and we are in their footsteps following so they rejected the truth because of their imitation of their role model who was their role model their fathers their forefathers their ancestors this is what destroyed them and prevented them from going and following the truth look at your uncles look at your aunts look at your elders in the family uncle what you're doing is Haram it's shik you're going to dgas you're asking peers for help you're going to soothsayers to tell you about the for uh the the the future and they say no no no no they know we found our parents or grandparents following this we're following now we Muslims are different because Allah is the one who guided us and this is why Allah says in the Quran and and they will say praise to Allah who has guided us to this and we would never have been guided if Allah not guide us you think you're here because you're strong you have muscles you have intellect it's only a gift from Allah Allah chose you Allah selected you now what are you going going to do with this gift are you going to be grateful are you going to pursue it further and increase it and make it flourish or are you going to put it in the drawer and watch it being reduced and diminished until it's gone now we always praise Allah Asel that he sent us the cream of the cream sallallah alaih wasallam he sent us the best messenger so that we would take him as our role model Allah told us to take him as an excellent pattern and a role model and he himself ordered us to do this so many hadiths one pray as if you seen me pray now people pray in different ways some put their hands on their sides some put them under their belly some put them above their belly some put them at you know choke hold what are you doing good for come on please this is MMA you where did you get this from so where do we get our prayer from from him we pray as if we had seen him pray did we see him pray no but the companions told us says the prophet used to put the right hand on the left hand on the chest the chest is from here to here but definitely not here and definitely not on your private part I've seen people praying like they what are you a goalie yeah someone is is going to shoot a goal at you and you're protecting your crown jewels it's not going to help you follow the Sunnah he also said you may not see me after today this is in the farewell Hajj so take after me your rituals how to perform ha how to throw the pibbles how to go to to Min blah blah blah all of this you take from me why because he's the excellent pattern and the role model and if you go to his show me one one little defect in him you'll never find show me something that is bad or negative never you can find something like that and no one on earth can be like this except himat if you went to war he was the bravest although he was over 50 he's in Middle 50s and above whenever it got tough aliali the greatest of all Warriors said when the tough started to materialize we used to cover take cover behind the prophet Alam we would say oh I would protect the prophet with my body Ali said he used to be behind him because when you see death coming all of these bravery and words would vanish and Subhan Allah in F we see this in fer in my Masjid once we were praying fer and the im's beautiful voice masallah very nice you know when f is quiet and all of a sudden we started seeing people jumping and hitting the ceiling because of a coach where is your bravery where is the Jihad a coach came and everybody was jumping and shouting no Salah no so what do you expect if this was in the battlefield I will protect the prophet with my life you won't do that you will start to look at the closest exit and fire escape to run away except those whom Allah has blessed Ali says we used to take him as a shield our cover because it was so fierce and if you look at how he dealt with others he was the peak in forgiveness and pardoning imagine you walking in peace and somebody all of a sudden startles you from behind you are not waiting you're not someone coming from in front of you someone from behind you grabs you from the back pulls your cloak or whatever you're wearing so that it scratches your skin and leaves traces it's hurtful not only that he says to him yeah Muhammad oh Muhammad give me from the money you have it's not your money it's Allah's money so he talks to me like this yeah you crazy you I'm she what are you saying he talks to to Muhammad the greatest man ever to walk the earth he says yeah Muhammad and he says give me from the money you have it's not your money it's Allah's money what kind of disrespect is this if I had a sword I would have taken his head off what did the prophet doam he's our role model he was the excellent pattern he looked at him smiled and ordered his companions to give him money end of story now how many times do we deal like this with our wives when they speak loudly to us or disrespect us how many times do we do this with an ignorant imbecile while driving he does this to us this is okay no pixelation it's okay so what do we do how much tall do we have he's our role model he is the one who we learn from generosity she I need money I I don't have my wallet it's in the hotel so nobody comes and says she I you just spoke about generosity give me this I don't have my wallet she you have Apple watch can we have Apple pay that's it's in real it's not in din look at the generosity of the Prophet Alam after the battle of Han H in he was standing on top of a hill and a nomad a beduin random person comes and stands next to him and there was a herd of sheep filling up the valley yeah 3,000 2,000 sheep imagine how much that would cost in ha a lot of so the man you know with with his jaw dropping looked and the prophet looked at himam and said you like this then said yes the prophet said it's yours the man did not even ask come on guys what kind of generosity is this and how much do we do the same people have to beg us for sodak people have to beg us for our duty they have to bake food to bring it and sell it so that we can take the money to Gaza true they have to work so that they can extract some money from us the prophet gives it without what this is Gen he's our role model and you would expect with all this wealth that he would have like a Bugatti you know Armani suit he has Rolex he has this how did he live Ya Allah did he go every year to Geneva to spend 3 weeks or to the Cod can n monoco Monaco to spend the summer did he travel for vacation he lived wah we can't live like him but why because he is the role model he walks the talk he's the real deal and food would not be cooked in his house in the nine wives houses for 2 months no cooking no no fire is lit what did they eat water and dates and maybe somebody would give them a gift a glass of milk that they would all share it this is how he lived if he wanted he could have had the whole place made of gold all that he has to do is ask but no I'm a servant Prophet not a king prophet he he was given the choice he used to sleep on a mattress made of tanned hide filled with palm fibers imagine sleeping on something that has a sound of cracking branches and it's hide leather it's not cotton or silk or something soft this is his pillow his mattress and his thob was to the middle of his feet his legs you know how short that is this is the knee this is the foot his th was to this much yeah really really short and he used to tell his companions uplift your garment it's too long it's below your ankles and they would say oh prophet of Allah it's an old garment he says don't you have a role model example in me the companion says so I looked and I found it to the middle of his legs so he himself used to give an example by himself to the others he used to say the best of you is the best to his wives those best of you are the best to their wives and I am the best to my wives so he's telling us I am the role model take me as an example sallallahu alaih wasallam nevertheless he told us that there will be a generation that will come after him that are going astray they choose other than his Sunnah they speak other than what he says the prophet saidat there is no Prophet whom Allah sent to Any Nation before me but he had disciples and companions from among his Nation who followed his path and obeyed his commands then after them came Generations who said what they did not do and did what they were not commanded to do whoever strives against them with his hand is a Believer whoever strives against them with his tongue is a Believer whoever whoever strives against them with his heart is a Believer beyond that there is not even a mustard seeds worth of faith those who go against the Sunnah of the Prophet The Way of the Prophet Alam are Ro model must be fought either with the hand or with the tongue or with the heart so as a Muslim it is not enough for us to follow the prophet full stop we have to go the extra mile I think we have to turn this off or one this off the one the whistling the microphones I think we we have to turn them off it's commercial break okay so a Muslim strives to go the extra mile how yes we follow the prophet Alat wasam to the letter step by step but we are ambitious that we become also role models to others why you remember the Hadith the prophet says the prophet says whoever sets a good predent in Islam will have the reward for that and the reward for those who do it after him without that detracting from their rewards in the slightest what does this mean each one of us has to be a devout follower of the Prophet Alam this is a given but each one of us has to also aspire to to be better than that in the sense Allah says IM Allah says and those who say our Lord grant us from among our wives and Offspring Comfort to our eyes and make us an example for the righteous make us a leader for the righteous you want to become an Imam for those who are righteous and look at the interpretation of this Ayah by IM alkari in the he said make us leaders that people we follow so that others would follow us we follow Whom The Prophet The Companions the the we follow them but you will never be an IM until you follow so that people would follow you if you find someone being followed by the masses that's good mallah he's a good IM look at whom he's following if you find that he's following Prophet Muhammad you know that he's an IM but if he's following someone else he's not following the salaf then he's not an Imam because you can't be an Imam until you follow those who were actual imams our children when they open their eyes at a young age they follow their parents and usually a son or a daughter is a reflection to the house rarely you will find a father who smokes and his children do not smoke rarely they've must have tried it in their lives if not continued to it because he was their role example and the biggest problem is that we have a conflict of interest in the household in the Muslim household the father says something the mother says something they're fighting they're always arguing and who's watching the children and who's being negatively affected the children Allah says in the Quran about Prophet says to his people and this is the Cornerstone of Da he says and I do not intend to differ from you in that which I have forbidden you I don't tell you to do something and I do the opposite this is the worst da you could ever present how would you learn from a a who's teaching you Quran and sunah while sitting next to a woman and chitchatting and cracking jokes she's a d as well by the way what kind of Da what am I missing why why they do they all get the good things and I get say give me a break so they sit in conferences and crack jokes with women and what is this oh she it's a different time different era different da this is not an who does this you are going against the basics of Quran and Sunnah how can I learn from you you have to walk to talk you have to be at the Forefront of interpreting the Quran and the Sunnah not to go against it and I do not intend to differ from you in that which I have forbidden you if we look at our households we will find catastrophes we have failed miserably in upbringing in our children unfortunately we've never been role models for them yes we might have been a role model in one aspect but deep down in their hearts when they see us fail miserably in 99% of other aspects this good aspect would go down the drain if I tell them uh be truthful and I'm truthful but at the same time I abuse my wife and I lie to my work and I cheat and I miss Salah in in the Masjid and I watch Haram stuff and I smoke and I do this and I do that everything that Islam is telling me I'm doing the opposite so when it comes to only be truthful might as well it's a wholesale no it's a package deal for you as a parent it's not an easy task to be done raising children is not something you put in the microwave like popcorn in 2 minutes you get it mallah done no it has to be marinated it has to be put in the oven at 400° and it has to be checked every 3 4 hours and until the meal is good and unfortunately we the worst a girls they are raised in a house where the mother doesn't abide by the hijab there is free mixing with her cousins with her in-laws there is not praying on time wearing nail polish and making woodoo on it what is this it's okay it's okay so how can they be ever committed to the religion when the father himself he cheats in his business he lies and he gives lame excuses when he lies and he knows his children know that he's lying when he doesn't Pray when he doesn't go to the Masjid except for J and rarely when he swears and curses and uses profanity and he always tell his children no you should not say this this is taboo you're saying it all day long you are saying it all day long you are the role model what do you expect this is what we have in our homes and the problem does not stop here it's not limited to our homes let's look at our community at society when the ruler does this when the judge cheats and takes money and bribes when the CEO of the company signs deals under the table when the supervisor tells you to Hash hush and gives you a commission and takes commission from himself and the company's losing money when the athlete who everyone looks up to does this when a an artist whether an actor whether an artist or someone of a celebrity status does this these are all role models that the society look up to them and respect and this is the biggest problem because Allah divided rulers well divided leaders IMS in the Quran is divided into two types Allah says and we made from among them leaders guiding by by our Command when they were patient and when they were certain of our signs good imams or bad but people are asleep take some coffee black coffee is good it wakes you up see I've just read an Ayah and everybody huh I read it again and we made from among them leaders guiding by by our Command when they were patient and when they were certain of our signs these imams are good or bad they're good mashallah now listen to this second Ayah and we made them leaders inviting to the fire and on the day of Resurrection they will not be helped good or bad but Allah called him what Imam so both are imams every one of us is an Imam whether you like it or not so you when you come to the Masjid and study Quran and teach the youngsters Al F and try to participate in the activities of the community in Islamic uh uh way you're an Imam and if you sit home or with Gatherings and teach the brother how to play guitar and how to play piano or how to play poker or how to download illegal movies you're an Imam but what kind of an Imam so at the end of the day I think I took more than my time at the end of the day what is your legacy that you will leave behind how long are you going to live seriously the problem is is look at me I am old but I feel young why because the older I get the more deeply rooted my roots in the ground when I was 50 years ago you could have taken me from the ground and I would have died no regrets I had no fear of death now my roots are so deep if you want to up root me take me out of my roots difficult I don't want to leave so what is your legacy you are going to die since when H since Allah brought you to this life since your mother gave birth to you she gave birth to you to do what to die no one lives forever where are you going to die uncle you're 90 when are you going to die oh I've heard of no he lived like 950 so yeah another couple of hundred years Subhan Allah when is it where you sit relaxed and said alhamdulillah I lived my life I'm just waiting for an SMS to come and leave when so what is the Legacy are you you're going to leave behind who among your children you anticipate to be an Imam of the Muslims what will your colleagues at work say Abdullah died yeah yeah he died yesterday yeah alhamdulillah he used to spend two hours in never worked he used to leave at 10:00 where are you going said make and he comes at 1:00 where have you've been I was doing Sunnah for 3 hours what is this even can't be that long he never worked good he was nothing some people die and you hear of them uh so and so died who's he oh he was our neighbor he used to pray in the Masjid we never heard of him what are his achievements zero nothing so yes you can be rich you can be a good businessman you can be an entrepreneur you could be a good athlete what is your legacy that you anticipate to be with you in your grave Diego Maradona who she one of the best footballers of all times what is his legacy he's a footballer then what end of game we Muslims don't have this one of the brothers was saying to me once alhamdulillah My Grave is fully furnished alhamd there are lights air conditions and small refrigerator and it's cozy it's very all what I'm just waiting for is to plug the electricity my grave is fil why you said I've been giving da I've been Distributing Quran I was feeding orphans in Africa I was doing charity work and I do all for Allah and he's sincere but he's joking when he says My Grave is fully furnished what will you find in your grave how many DVDs oh you guys are young but you don't know DVDs now Downstream she how many movies you've seen how many songs you've downloaded how many Haram you've done how many people you've cheated how much money have you consumed of bribes stealing lying and you go to bed sleep like a baby yeah yeah I didn't do anything Allah knows Allah knows this is the biggest problem that Allah knows so what have you done what is your legacy so my point is so that we can in conclude our session are you a role model yes or no and if it is yes are you a role model and an Imam to goodness and to Paradise or the latter may Allah protect us Al"
