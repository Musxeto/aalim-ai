  "transcript": "brother sakif hassan does not gain basic knowledge of akida or understands the meaning of the quran this is a very important question because it gives you the difference between a person with knowledge and a worshiper the majority of muslims nowadays are worshippers at best if we look at the best of them they are worshippers they pray a lot they give charity they may fast but without knowledge and they are at the brink of collapsing or going to bad and evil ways once they are truly tested except those whom allah azza would make them steadfast on the straight path why is that shaytaan fears a scholar more than he fears 70 worshipers because he can fool those who claim to be worshippers but scholars people with knowledge it's very difficult for him to interrupt their knowledge and to interfere with their desires and lust etc they have the knowledge that protects them with the grace of allah azzawajal look at the hawari and they are the people who assassinated may allah be pleased with him and with his sons al-hasan and al-hussein he was the fourth caliph and he was assassinated by one of the hawaris whom the prophet explained to us the danger over the ummah and he warned us from their evil acts by saying and describing to us that they pray more than you pray and they fast more than you fast and they recite the quran but it does not exceed their throats it's just plain mumbling and it has no effect on their lives or on their understanding and look what they had done they killed one of the best 10 people to have ever walked the earth after the prophets and the messengers of allah what is best and what is the ruling on this we say it's very dangerous for people to engage in thicker recitation of the quran without knowledge because as stated earlier they would be at the brink of collapsing or retreating or rejecting islam once being tested with something that exceeds their knowledge the first thing you have to do is to learn your apida your creed who is allah who you were eating your money and they're being richer and richer while you are remaining where you are you have to learn about the fib you have to know is it this where i have to put my hands in prayer or under my belly or i should not put my right over the left at all what did your prophet do at this assam don't look at tom dick or harry don't look at imam or sheikh or so on who they did this or do that or they say this follow the sunnah you have knowledge you have the means follow the sunnah the authentic sunnah if you do this you will be far better than what you are today and above all you have to understand the quran that you are reciting this is the miracle and allah azza has revealed this miracle to remain with us until the day of judgment so understand what allah wants from you don't just seek barakah from it without understanding it don't rely on people telling you this is or this is haram maybe this is the best what you could do but if you you know your abilities you know your powers so at least give a portion of the quran a day give it some concern give it some attention by reading the interpretation because if you remain on just simply making vikrant you may fall in the several traps of shaytan without knowing that"
