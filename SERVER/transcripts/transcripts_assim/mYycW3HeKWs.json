  "title": "Dying without taking the Pledge Bait  / Bayah - does this apply to us in current times?",
  "transcript": "Rashaad from Bangladesh Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum Walaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Sheikh my question is related to Bayah, oath of elegance. It is narrated in Sahih Muslim 1851 our beloved Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam said whoever dies and did not make an oath of elegance to the Muslim leader has died a dead of Jahiliyya. So I hope you understand my question that our situation is not matched with the text. So in my mind two things is popping up. First that this act is not for us because our situation is not matching with the text and second that it is enough to intend in your mind that you give the elegance to the Muslim ruler. So can you please clarify. The Hadith is authentic every Muslim has to give his pledge of allegiance known as Al-Bay'ah to obey the Muslim ruler and if you are in a Muslim country then your Muslim ruler is your Imam and you have to give him the pledge of allegiance in the sense that if he orders you to do something and it's not against the Quran or the Sunnah you are obliged to obey him. You don't have to go physically shake hands with him and give him the pledge of allegiance as this is not practical nowadays but it is a commitment that you have in your heart to such a ruler and Allah knows best."
