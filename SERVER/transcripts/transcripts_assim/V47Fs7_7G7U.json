  "transcript": "muna's question every day i tell my daughter to offer prayer but she does not listen to me i tell her to offer prayer and make dua but she ignores me what should i do how do i make her offer prayers again this is one of the areas where islam is totally clear on the stance of it in the non-muslim world they would probably say it is their freedom it is their right to choose whether they want to pray or not this is up to them there is no compulsion or religion we must not order them to pray if they don't want to pray it's up to them this is totally unaccepted in islam this is totally unaccepted the most important pillar after the shahada is prayers establishing prayer is the essence of islam without prayers there is no islam the prophet said alaihis salatu that the pledge between us and them is prayer whoever abandons it is a kafir a disbeliever whoever does not pray at all is a disbeliever and those who pray on and off are hypocrites the only part of the ritual the only ritual of islam that was mandated in the seventh heaven is prayer everything else such as zakat pilgrimage fasting was mandated on earth the prophet tells us instruct your children to pray when they are seven years of age and beat them when they are ten meaning if from 7 till 10 there's no physical punishment but if they reach the age of 10 and still they refuse to pray we must beat them i don't know how old your daughter is but definitely if she is like 15 or 17 this is not the age of beating anymore however you must not compromise you must not give in or surrender to her negligence you have to draw the line you want to save her from hellfire even if you force her it's your duty even if she doesn't want to it's your duty imagine to those westerners and disbelievers who claim that people have the right to choose imagine if you see someone in america wanting to commit suicide would we say he has a right to choose it's his free will of course not this is a crime and if he were to be caught he would be taken to prison for killing trying to kill himself euthanasia is a crime in most countries which is killing yourself due to the pain that is intolerable so you get the help and the assistance of a doctor to euthanize you merciful killing they call it it's a crime so when a child says i don't want to pray we have to reprimand when a man or a woman says i don't want to pray this is a betrayal of the religion and this is grand treason to the community and we have to correct this even by force it has to be corrected so you have to look into your daughter's routine and lifestyle and start to introduce punitive measures in order to correct her and generally speaking your husband is the controller of such measures he's the man of the house he has to force his daughter or we will have to take punitive measures no allowance no mobile no internet access no uh permission to leave and and see your your friends until you establish your relationship with allah because this is the last straw that would break the camel's back prophet salallahu salaam said that between a man and kuffur and blasphemy is prayer so once a person leaves prayer then he's not a muslim anymore so this is not something to be taken lightly like if she started smoking for example yes this is sinful this is harmful harmful for her health but it's a sin unlike leaving prayer this is really serious and it has to be taken seriously as well"
