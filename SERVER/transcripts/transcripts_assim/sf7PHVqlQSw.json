  "transcript": "Yusuf from Ghana Alaikum Assalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh please is it authentic from the Sunnah that if someone is going to join the congregation and The first line is four It should pull someone from the first line to help him form a new line Where should the first person joining a new line should start the new line from right left or middle The Prophet Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam said Whoever completes a Row or a line may Allah complete him and whoever cuts a Row or a line may Allah cut him Which means that when you come to the masjid and the last row is fully packed There's no place for you to squeeze yourself though most if not all Rows in the masjid if you just come to the sixth one from the end and you tap him on the shoulder and you bring Six people or five people closer together from the end of the row. You will find a place or a spot for one or two But Hypothetically assuming that the row or the line is fully packed and there is no Small gap for you to squeeze your in and yourself in In this case Allah says in the Quran Fattaqullaha mastata'tum Fear Allah to the best of your ability. My best of ability is the row is full then you go immediately behind the imam and make a row of your own and pray alone and This is what Sheikh al-islam Ibn Taymiyyah concluded in his fatawa by saying that There is nothing else you could do But to pull someone that is totally prohibited and forbidden"
