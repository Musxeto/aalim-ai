  "title": "Times when Duas can be answered - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "man wish says what are the various times do as can be answered well allah azza wajal is close to us and he responds to whomever makes dua even to the disbelievers can you imagine this if a disbeliever a kafir makes dua especially when he is in distress or someone has wronged him a lot responds to him the times of dua are so many and it is it would not be sufficient for us to mention them but I'll just give you a small hint the duaa on lailatul utter the night of decree in ramadan the door is answered but before I continue there are three types of answering dois and we've mentioned this so many times before so if I say o Allah cure my illness Allah can cure my illness or Allah can deflect something equivalent to curing my illness so if curing my illness requires a thousand-euro there is another calamity that it was decreed upon me that would have cost me a thousand euros and Allah deflected it but I'm still making dua thinking that Allah is not responding to me no Allah responded but you did not know thirdly Allah so gel may store this may store this for you on the day of judgment so all like you're my illness you're not cured and nothing was deflected away from you but when you come on the day of judgment you'll find a lot of good deeds and you say I didn't do these and you will be told that this is part of answering and responding children so you can make draw on lailatul cutter the night of decree in Ramadan it is answered between adhan and yama yama announces that the actual prayer so even if i am at home and the time is due at 1 o'clock and i make dua until 2 o'clock a whole hour then I start my prayer of the or whatever then this is a time where a lot responds and answers your dua if it's in the Masjid it's well known it's about 15 to 20 minutes between a 10 and a Palma also Allah responds to the door at the last hour of Friday so just before sunset of Friday an hour before that if you are in the Masjid praising Allah offering salutation to the professor I am making dua a large Dajjal answers this Allah answers your dua in the last third of the night as in the authentic hadith Allah says isn't there anyone asking me I should give is is there anyone seeking my forgiveness where I forgive him etc so in these last third of the night just before I than a fetcher this is a really high time it's the peak time for answering to us at the time of raining when it rains Allah answers the door when you hear the roaster making it sound just before Fechter the Prophet said I some whatever you hear the roaster praying or making a sound then ask Allah from His grace because it has seen an angel so it's time of Durham also at the end of 4th prayers and also volunteer prayers but the hadith stated clearly that at the end of our prayers Dober assalamu tell mokuba and this is what made some people think that the hadith refers to after the for prayer when and we've said this so many times that the hadith is understood in the light of other hadith where the Prophet told the Salish sermon that after offering salutation upon the Prophet asaram during salat and before Salam before concluding it this is time of dua where Allah answers those who call him not after Salam because after you finish your prayer and concluded it is time for Vicar as scheffel's empty me and I became had chosen also among the favorite places of dua is when you are Institute the Prophet had said addisam the closest you are to Allah while you are in frustration so choose whatever you wish it is worthy of Allah so gel answering you and this of course as we've also mentioned before just reminders that is within the salat nowadays is an innovation a new trend after fajar prayer after it's concluded people are making they care after 5-10 minutes all of a sudden you see people frustrating they're not in Salah and they prolong their prostration after finish friend my friend come what are you doing you say this is frustration for Dora say but you're not praying said yes this is a separate prostration this is Haram this is innovation it's not acceptable you have committed a grave sin others repeat this all and alone and say that this is prostration of gratitude of sugar and again this is an innovation when you are blessed with something that is not reoccur in the Sunnah is to offer one sister one prostration of gratitude if your boss gives you a paycheck at the end of the month you do not perform salute the sugar why because this is occurring if your wife cooks a good meal some would say that this is not reassuring but generally speaking this is a reoccurring blessing you do not prostrate for gratitude or for sugar but if someone tells you that your uncle who was in ICU for six weeks has woken up from his coma and now masha'Allah he is communicating and he's becoming better then you may prostrate because this is one in a lifetime occasion that requires showing expressing gratitude to Allah it's a trend a larger knows best"
