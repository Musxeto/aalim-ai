  "title": "Ruling on ayahs of Sajda in the quran",
  "transcript": "we have a question from nigar Boran and he says asalam alaykum I'd like to ask about the sjas in the Quran do we have to read The Saga and offer the prostration of recitation every time we pass by it or can we collect all of it he says all 14 SAS at one time first of all there are a number of verses throughout the Quran where the Sunnah is that we offer frustration when we recite it or when we read it uh the brother said that it is 14 and some Scholars collect it as uh 14 but the most authentic is that there are 15 sjas and what is the ruling on such a saga it is recommended it is Sunnah but it is not mandatory as explained to us by Omar may Allah be pleased with him so the ruling is if you pass by a verse which contains a s you have the right to do it and this is recommended this is the Sunnah and if you don't offer this prostration you're not sinful if you were listening to someone next to you in the Masjid and you're paying attention and he passes by a verse that contains SJ but he does not offer it you should not offer it while if he offers the Saga as he is the reciter the Sunnah in your case is to follow it so to answer your question no it is not permissible to collect all these prostrations the all 15 of them after you finish the Quran so if you recite from Surah fa chapter 1 until you conclude with Surah Nas chapter 114 and then after that you offer 15 s 15 prostrations this is not the Sunnah and it is not permissible because you have passed the location where you should have prostrated"
