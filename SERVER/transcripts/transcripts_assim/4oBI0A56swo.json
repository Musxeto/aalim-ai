  "title": "Is watching football haram if it doesn't stop me from doing my obligations? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I I have another question related to football um I heard from a lot of shakes that playing no the watching football is considered as Haram if it makes you lose time and if the people that play doesn't cover the a so what's your opinion on that um on that matter because I was going to watch a a football match today h and I did not inshallah did not going to skip any prayer in the Masjid so I don't know if you could tell me what's your hook about that wasting time is not something that is recommended in Islam however it is too generic to say waste of time reading a novel is a waste of time sitting idle in your home doing nothing just watching the ceiling is wasting time taking a walk can be considered as wasting time so you cannot say that this is Haram per se yeah it it's not recommended it's best you do this and that it's best that you utilize your time in something that's useful but the heart rusts and every now and then we need to um entertain it with things that may not fall under the category of Haram rather in the category of permissibility so as long as you're praying in the Masjid and you're observing your obligation watching an hour of football once every week or so is not a problem inshallah as for the it's an issue of dispute yes the the thigh is a the thigh of a man is that we are not supposed to look at though some Scholars say that this is not a and they have evidences to prove it but the most likely opinion is and the safer opinion is to consider it as and not to look at it nevertheless lots of the footballers today cover almost the whole thigh with uh uh stretches or L leggings they call it I don't know what they call it um and then they wear the shorts above it which also goes NE near to the knee and the a is covered almostly if not all of it therefore I see no problem inshallah in doing that and Allah Knows Best"
