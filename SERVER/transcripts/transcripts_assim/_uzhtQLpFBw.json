  "transcript": "was asking about the issue of washing the back of the neck so if you ask one Sheikh whom you trust and you feel that he is knowledgeable as we believe in Sheik Muhammad Salah Allah protect him and and and preserve him for the Islam and the Muslim then you should not go and ask others because you're only confuse yourself and you would discredit the other Sheik and what the Sheikh said is exactly correct and this is what all the scholars of Islam said beginning from the nawi and he mentioned this in his book Al and he said that this is an innovation and also IMD sufan they all stated that this is an innovation it is not part of Islam as for the clip you saw on YouTube where the the Sheikh says that ibar said in an authentic Hadith which was authenticated byb haar I went back to the Hadith the Hadith is not authentic at all and in his book he also stated that this is a fabricated Hadith it's so this gives you an indication that whoever authenticated this Hadith is definitely not knowledgeable and that you should uh uh stay away from him because he is relaying to you false information and this also gives you a hint that don't take your religion from YouTube or from Facebook or from Twitter take your religion from Scholars whom you trust whom you know their religion and piety whom you know their righteousness and knowledge"
