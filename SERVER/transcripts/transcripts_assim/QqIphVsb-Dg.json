  "title": "Were narrations of Hisham Ibn Ammar baseless fabricated Did he take money to narrate assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh uh is it true that Hashem never narrated Hadith unless he was paid under all these narrations were this you were baseless who's he uh well I actually I haven't met his acquaintance I have no idea whether he is one of the narrators of Hadith or not whether he never narrated The Hadith unless he was paid and I don't know where you guys get this information about who cares is I don't know this guy so yeah I thank you but I would highly recommend an advice not to go into these little trivial things it has no value to us those who are mountains to us Allah are well known and they are imams of the Deen they are accepted by Imam bukhari Muslim and we know of them those who are way way below that or those who are not known or their contribution is little or they are merely used by the people of innovation we should avoid them personally I'm ignorant in this field because I am not a student of knowledge in the uh Elmo Regal yet this to me doesn't have any impact let's assume this was a man of knowledge and that he was one of the men of Eternity or whatever and and he charged money for whatever Hadith he gave okay this is not a thing that would have any benefit for me because I'm not a contemporary of his I don't know his background or situation for asking for such money whether the reports are true or not and if the great imams accepted this Hadith then he's accepted if they relate rated him as fabricated or what bar or a kazab or the the likes then this is their job not ours and Allah Knows Best"
