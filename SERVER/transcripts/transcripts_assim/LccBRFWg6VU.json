sisters in Islam assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh among the women whom had an impact on the life of our prophet salallahu alaihe wasalam we're two of the first women the Prophet actually had his first encounter with the first one is his mother and her name was Amina bint web been abdomen Afeni Sahara even okay Labib Nomura M no carbon uru I even knew her labor and they say that she had only one brother in his name was yahudim Nawab the tribe of Zahra or Banu Zahra they say that we are the maternal uncles of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam because Amina was from them and we know that the prophets father are in his salat WA Salam his maternal uncle's were from Medina so the Prophet who used to say that my maternal uncles are from Medina now historical resources did not document a lot about the prophet's mother sallallahu alehiwassallaam due to the fact that it was not a time of documentation and no one knew at the time that she would be the mother of the greatest man ever to walk the earth all what we know about her is that she was a woman of high and prestigious lineage she was an a woman of honour and a great family and this is why most Arabs usually look after the Prophet said alehissalaam of salaam a woman is sought after due to her beauty due to her wealth due to her lineage and due to her religious practice so get the one with the religious commitment or may your hand grab on dust meaning that if you choose other than the one with proper religious commitment then as if you have gained nothing therefore Amina was sought after we do not know anything about her private life how beautiful she was but we know that she comes from a very honourable family how did she get to marry of the law even though Abdul Muttalib the stories say that Abdul Muttalib had one son and this son was called al-harith but first of all who is Abdul Muttalib we know that our prophet's name is Sal allah as allah mohamet amino Abdullah even Abdul Muttalib even Hashim so what is Abdul Muttalib and was there a God that the pagans worshiped by the name of al-muttalib actually al-muttalib is the name of his uncle and the father of of the lodge name was Shay Batu Hampton hasha minal Muttalib we're brothers and Hashim married a woman in Modena and she gave birth to Abdullah she gave birth to al-muttalib let me rephrase that so Hashem the grandfather of Abdullah who's the father of prophetess Alam got married in Medina and he had a son by the name of Shay battle hampt soon after Hashim died so his brother al-muttalib when Shay battle Hamed grew up to be a young man of fourteen years of age traveled from Mecca to Medina to fetch his nephew and bring him back to his country so when they traveled back to Mecca when al-muttalib and his nephew who's a fourteen year old boy by the name of Shay battle haven't entered Mecca the people of Mecca recognised al-muttalib recognized those who were with him but did not recognize this boy so they thought that this boy was a slave which al-muttalib bought on his journey so they called him I would Elmo Polly and al-muttalib kept on saying no no this is shea butter hand he's my nephew he's not my slave so the name stuck to him and his name became Abdul Muttalib the slave of al mualim so al-muttalib now grew up to become a very respected honorable man of Mecca he was one of the dignitaries of Mecca and the master of the people of Quraysh the master of Banu Hashim and Banu al-muttalib Abdul Muttalib had a son and he saw in a vision someone coming to him telling him about Kaiba about Birla about this about different names and then in conclusion told him to dig up them them now we all know the well of Zamzam and the story of Hodja and her son Ismael peace be upon him when left long long time ago centuries ago in Mecca with there was nothing in how gibreel came and dug the well of Zamzam which kept on giving water to the Muslims ever since so he saw the location he got the command in his dream to dig it up so he went to dig it up and it's close to the Haram to the Kaaba so the people started shouting at him you're insane what are you doing and he told him that this is Zam Zam I was told to dig it up they didn't believe him and they ridiculed him so he dug it up once the water started gushing people started saying that we have a share in it he tried to defend it and say no this is mine I was the one who saw the dream and I want I'm the one who did it so I'm the one responsible for it they would not listen to him and he had only one son so he had no protection so he vowed that if Allah were to give him ten sons that he will slaughter one of them as a sacrifice soon after he got married he got children and now he has ten of them so he has to fulfil his vow so he drew the lots to know which one to choose from ten and it fell on Abdullah the youngest and the most beloved to his heart so he did not know what to do the people advised him to sacrifice ten camels but first draw the Lots between ten camels and Abdullah and Lots came to Abdullah so they said add another ten so he added ten becoming twenty camels again Abdullah thirty fifty ninety one hundred and then the Lots fell on the camels so he sacrificed one hundred camels joyfully and saved his son from being slaughtered some say that since then the blood money for someone who kills someone by mistake or intentionally is one hundred camels till date and this is in our Islamic Shariah being happy with his son being freed he went and chose to him one of the best of piraeus women and that was a mean abattoir he was for 24 years of age and she was 13 years of age and this was normal for girls to marry at an early age as early as nine or ten he stayed with her for ten days then he left with a caravan to Syria for trade on their way back he fell sick stayed in Medina for a while only to die and to be buried there Amina was two months pregnant with our prophet s awesome she heard the news heartbroken she lived on the memory of these ten nights that she had spent with the love of her life the pregnancy was quite easy and not difficult once she gave birth to our Prophet Muhammad alayhi salatu wassalam she as many of the women of Quraysh sent her newborn infant to be suckled at the badiya the Bedouins who lived on open land in tents so that their bodies would become strong immune to diseases and the tongue would be fluent in Arabic not corrupt due to the different languages and we will come to the story of how he was given to harima acedia the prophet alayhi salatu salam as a child used to be brought every year so that they can take the wages of taking care of him and for him to see his mother and to see his grandfather maybe for a month or two and then go back with his family Halima and his father through suckling when he was six years of age the training if you may say was over and now he is back with his mother his mother took him to visit the maternal uncle's of his father they stayed there for a whole month and on their way back Amina fell sick and she died and she was buried at an area called el agua now the prophet alayhi salatu salam did not live long with his mother and you can say that he did not know her that well when she died at the age of 20 and he was about 6 to 7 years of age however we can guarantee and we are certain that she gave him love affection and care that remained with him fifty years later in so he had him a Muslim the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam once traveled and passed by the agua and his companions saw him weeping and they said o prophet of allah tell us what is happening so that we can weep and join you as well he said I requested my Lord to seek forgiveness for my mother and he denied me so I wept and we know that the Prophet SM was denied because the Muslims are not permitted to seek forgiveness for someone who died as a non-muslim and we as Muslims would pay anything we possess we would sacrifice our own parents and loved ones just for the mother of the Prophet Isis I am to be accepted as a Muslim but this is not something that we feel and hope for because it's the decree of allah azzawajal and no one can be or merciful than Allah Almighty and this is religion yes we would have loved that the prophet's mother would be admitted to Paradise and that what he would be granted the permission to seek forgiveness for her but it's not in our hands this is a large law this is the authentic hadith in Swahili mmm Muslim then the Prophet said alehissalaam I sought permission from Allah to visit her grave and Allah gave me permission to do so you can tell by the amount of sorrow in the prophet's heart Allah saw some that made him weep and cry over a mother he had not seen or been with except for a few months yet the amount of love she gave her son still resonated with him even after five or six decades down the line this is how men feel about their mothers how strong emotions they have towards their mothers and this is how Islam honored the mothers now the other woman is had EEMA and it's an issue of dispute whether she accepted Islam later on or not and insha'Allah she is a Muslim and among the Companions Halima bint ABI - Abe and her father Abu Abe's name is Abdullah have nel hair if she tells us about how she got the Prophet are in solid was Salam and was honored to be his mother through suckling she said we came to Mecca as we do every year pitching for a newborn that needed to be suckled and raised in the outskirts where the grazing land is where all the herds are this is the habit of the people of Mecca so we all went I she talks about herself had a son and he never let us sleep because I could not give him any milk because we were in drought and famine we went to Mecca on my mule and we had a camel which had no milk in her to feed us at all when we came to Mecca we came late because of how tired the mule and the camel were so everybody went ahead of us and every woman from my tribe that they showed her the Prophet Muhammad they asked where is his father when they were told that he was an orphan they rejected him what would we do with an orphan when we want money from his father and his father is not alive when she arrived late there was no other child to take so she took the Prophet Muhammad alayhi salatu salam so that no one would say that she came back empty-handed that night the moment she received the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam her breasts were filled with milk the Prophet drank and had his full his brother drank and had his full and went to sleep the first night day had slept in months not only that even the camel the she-camel her husband went and milked it and they all had their meal to the full and he told his wife this boy is a blessed soul take good care of him he went and he was raised there in the open ground in the grazing grounds playing with the children nothing so special but things that made people suspicious once Halima went to look for her son Mohammed and he was not around and it was so hot that the herds and the camels were on the ground resting after some distance she found him with his sister and she said to his elder sister what are you doing in the middle of the day under the hot Sun she said mother I didn't do anything he kept on walking and there was this cloud on top of him whatever he stood it stood and wherever he moved it moved shading him and then she tells us about the miraculous surgery that the Prophet had on the hands of jbeil and is fulfilled peace be upon them just where he was five or so years of age two men came and they made him lie on his back opening his chest to his bellybutton and extracting his guts and washing it in a ball of gold with Zamzam water then extracting his heart and taking something black out of it then replacing everything back and stitching it all as it was Halima and her husband were terrified when they came to the rescue and found the boy there a little bit pale and they asked him he told them what had happened so they took him back to his mother and his mother told them that this is nothing I know my son we'll grow to be something else because I saw in my vision this and that and she comforted them they took him back and then when the period or the training was over they brought him back to his mother only to lose his mother when he was again 6 years of age to be taken care of by his untie his grandfather Abdul Muttalib until he was 8 years of age then to die his grant his grandfather's death was also one of the tragedies that the Prophet asaram had undergone only to be taken care of by his uncle Abu Talib and we all know what happened afterwards two great women who took care of our prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam who had a print on his life an impact on his upbringing to women around the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam had Allahu Alem when especially in melee he Aslam sallallahu sallim wa barik ala nabina muhammad wa salam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
