lessons in fib today's chapter is the seventh chapter of the book beloved maram and it deals with the manners of answering the call of nature it's a very long title the manners of answering the call of nature which tells us that there are certain things one should do when he answers the call of nature regarding location regard regarding direction regarding other aspects that we will insha'Allah deal with in the following hadith so who should read the first hadith i'm brother nor yes smellorama nor him narrated honest with Malik radiallahu anhu a Lhasa messenger sallallaahu re wa sallam used to remove history when entering the lavatory okay of course the lavatory means the toilet and we have to remember that the Prophet SAW Selim at this time they didn't have any toilets bathrooms they used to go out of the city out of the neighborhood to a place in the wilderness in an open area away from the people's sight and they used to answer the call of nature now if we look at this hadith the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam used to remove his ring now did the Prophet has a ring let me rephrase this did the Prophet SAW salam have a ring that we use like every day yes i think i think he had a small ring and is a right little finger okay I met the Prophet used to wear a ring okay do you by any chance most of I know why no I don't know Fadi I think it was like a signature right it's a seal serum so lots of people nowadays think that it is soon enough to wear a ring whether in the right hand or the left hand and the actual thing it is not a Sunnah the profits of our salaam had this ring as a seal whatever he sent messages he used to put his seal on it and it has the inscription it it was written on it allah rasool mohammed of course they put the name of Allah Azza WA JAL at the very beginning what but actually it should have been Mohammad Rasool Allah Muhammad is the Prophet the messenger of allah but to glorify Allah's name they put the name of Allah first Rasul Muhammad and this was a seal so it is not a Sunnah to wear a ring and of course this hadith is not authentic it's regarded as weak so but we will still go through it because the meaning is correct which is that one of the manners of answering the call of nature is that whenever you go into the toilet bathroom the place where you will answer the call of nature whether you urinate or defecate you should not have anything that has the name of Allah you should not have anything that has the name of Allah or of the Quran and this is a sign of glorifying Allah not even a written thing would we would not allow it to enter a place that is filthy such as the tallest in the bathrooms and this tells you that Muslims glorify Allah they glorify the Almighty the creator of the Earth's and heavens and that is why we are offended that is why we are offended with anyone curses our Lord Allah or says a joke about Allah or even relate Allah to humans by saying Allah has a child Allah has a son this is an offender we are offended by it and we do not accept this because we glorify Allah even to the extent when entering a bathroom we remove anything that relates us to the name of Allah yes brother Mustafa well I want to ask a question sometimes people wear a necklace where it has like like ayat of the Quran I just want to ask is it permissible to to wear it I are you talking about males or females both both okay as far as males are concerned it is forbidden to wear necklaces whether you put Allah's name or you put a cross or the David of the Star of David or whatever or just plain necklace why because you are imitating you are copying you are doing what women do and in Islam any man imitating or doing something that resembles females this is something that is worthy of being cursed by Allah OSHA so if when someone wears a dress he is immediately cursed by allah azza wajal when someone it makes his sound as a female though he is joking he is cursed by Allah because anyone that imitates the other sex is cursed so if a woman cuts her hair short as in the Navy or the army and imitates a man she is cursed if a woman wears a man's suit or clothings she is cursed so wearing necklaces for men is completely out of the question wearing bracelets wearing earrings the the Lee's are all out of the question men cannot do this it's for completely forbidden we go to the other side of the question which is women wearing necklaces of course women may wear whatever jewelry they would wish to do it's permissible this is their nature they have to beautify themselves they're originally beautiful but they have to put these ornaments to make them more beautiful so if a woman wears a necklace and she hangs something we have to look at the things that she's hanging if she's hanging the verses of the Quran for example either curtsy then this is not permissible why isn't it permissible it's very simple Allah has revealed the Quran to be read and by hanging it you're not reading it why are you wearing it the answer would be for protection for protection yes for protection I don't want to have any evil eyes I don't want to have any harm coming to me so I keep this ayatul kursi in my neck and this is a misconception that a lot of Muslims have if you go out to the parking area and you open the glove compartment of most of the cars you will find a copy of the Holy Quran wow that's great no it's not if you open it you fly you will find flies coming out of it and Dustyn that symbolize that they have not opened it in ages if you ask the owner of the car why do you call that do you keep a copy of the Holy Koran in your a glove compartment he would tell you so that my car would not be stolen so that I would not have any accidents so that Allah will protect me from any harm coming from to me and this is not allowed Allah Allah has not revealed the Quran to be form of protection you know a bulletproof vest I'm putting it in my pocket why so I'm bulletproof I don't have any bullets coming to me nobody can blow me up or whatever and so I can't be burnt alive I have this holy book Quran this is wrong I know personally a lot of pilots Muslim pilots keep a copy of the Holy Quran in their flight kits and they never read the Quran except from Ramadan to Ramadan once a year and maybe they don't finish it completely they just read portions of it why do you do this well they say we what we want protection to our planes so it does not crash this is unacceptable hanging verses of the Quran in your living room on your body under the pillow before you go to sleep other protection this is not the doing of the Prophet sallallahu Salam it's not the doing of the companions it's the doing of Shaitaan who wants you to be away from the Quran and the only relationship between you and the Quran is protection that is it don't treat it don't do what's in it just keep it as a blessing and protection if you hang anything else for example some people hang the name of Allah Allah they just put it as in their necklaces again this is not bad this is there's nothing wrong in it hanging in the name of Allah it's okay it's as if you're writing it but you have to be careful when entering the toilet bathroom because then you will expose the name of Allah Almighty to that filthy place the bathroom or the toilet so it's preferable that you do not do this and again our connection a connection with Allah our relationship with Allah Azza WA JAL is not limited in few verses that we hang or put in our pockets or wallets it's not limited to hanging few verses on our the walls of our living rooms our connection with Allah social is far greater than this we have all our TOEIC all submissiveness dependence support from Allah the Almighty and we depend entirely on him come back to the topic though the hadith is weak yet the meaning is true it's preferable that when you go to the bathroom or toilet that you remove anything that has the name of Allah written on it scholars say that there are exceptions for example if I have a wallet and in my wallet there are credit cards and money and in in Arab countries some of them you might find the name of Allah written on no currency like the reals or dare harm or whatever you might find the name of Allah so is it advisable before entering a public toilet that you put it outside and you entered it to relieve yourself and find yourself completely relieved of everything even have your cash of your credit cards its caller saying that this is an exception if there is no safe place to put it in tuck it in your pocket then enter the toilet or the bathroom similarly the Quran if you have a copy of the Holy Quran with you should I leave it outside or enter the toilet scholars say well if you're afraid that it will be stolen then you may take it in because of the fear of being stolen and there is no big or strong or authentic hadith preventing us from doing this because that it is not authentic yet still we glorify the name of Allah we still we glorify the words of Allah we try our best not to allow to enter such filthy places unless it is extremely impossible to leave it out side I believe we have a short break please stay tuned and we will be right back inshallah assalamualaikum warahmatullah and welcome back to lessons in fib we have the following hadith hadith number 78 narrated and Zamalek rhodiola 1 the prophets Allah lawyers and lemon entering the lavatory used to say alone in the owl will become in a hopeful Harbor if oh Allah I seek refuge with you from devils males and females or all offensive and wicked things evil deeds and evil spirits of course reading it depends on how the meaning ends so if you say Hobbs what about it is different than a horse what about is one means males and females of the devil's the other ones me or the other one means the wickedness of an evil things now this hadith teaches us a supplication that all of us should say before entering a bathroom why it's very simple a bathroom is a place of filth and dirt and that is why the Devils reside in them and it's like their common room they usually spend most of the time there for chatting and communicating and so whenever you go there you try your best to stay away from it you don't stay and and you you are going there to do something you're going there for a task you're not going there to stay that's why you should go quick and come out quick lots of people and this is really funny I once went and visited a friend and I requested to go to the bathroom and I went in there and near the toilet seat I found a pile of magazines and comic books so I was you know is this substituting toilet paper what I don't really know so after I relieve myself and went out I asked him what is this said well I usually spend like an hour and a half or two in the toilet so I want to make use of my time so I read an hour or hour and half in the toilet what are you doing what is this you're doing constructions and digging canals or what this is something that you should do and get out of the toilet you should not spend so much time there so it's a place of Filth the Prophet salah salem says you should say this supplication okay what else there's another hadith narrated by I Lee Miller pleased with him said that the Prophet sets of allah salem saying bismillah is a visor between our hour and the site of gin meaning when you say bismillah while entering when you take off your clothes your private parts your Allah the jinn cannot see it because bismillah would impose a visor it would prevent them from seeing your aura my sing bismillah so this is the Sunnah whenever you enter the bathroom you say bismillah al do belong I mean hope see what have I've what do we learn from this hadith we learned that there are jinn and jinn are creatures of Allah and there are Muslim jinns and there are non Muslim chains the non-muslim jinns are the devil's shayateen that causes problem what is the origin of jinn nor what is the origin of jinn the origin of jinn what are they created from from I say close close but not close enough fire fire fire that's correct jinn are created from fire and humans are created from ready from mud or clay and angels are created from from light and these are the things that they're created from as reported to us by the prophet sallallaahu they sell em so we believe that they exist now do we see them we do not fortunately we do not they have their own world and they have their own lives we believe that there are males and females and they reproduce they have children we don't know how they look like and actually you're not interested let them be and live in their own world so what's the connection between us in them there are few connections such as one the prophet salallahu sallam told us that they have animals and they have they also eat and he told us allah llahu is Elam that they're there animals eat the dung of our annals and the Jin themselves eat whatever bone is found that has been slaughtered the animal that has been slaughtered so when we slaughter sheep and we eat the meat and we have only the bone left and we throw the bone the prophet saww son told us that the Jin come to this bone and find this bone filled with meat for them not for us so that is why they eat it and we also believe that as the Prophet told us is awesome that they can transform they take different shapes and they they can move from one area to the other in a very high speed as in the case of well peace the queen of Yemen and the the prophet of Allah Solomon when Solomon asked who me who can bring me her throne from Yemen to a sham or to whatever and it's a distance of thousands of miles and one of the jinn said I can bring it to you in less than a minute or two before you you stand up I can bring it to you they have this power to transform to look in different shapes and they have the power to move from one area to the other our prophet told us that is awesome that they have the ability to inflict diseases on us so plague the well known disease is from the jinn the Prophet says that it is from your Brethren's is from the jinn the inflicting it on you the plague the well known disease but unfortunately some of us have magnified the role of jinn to the extent that any problem takes place we pinpoint jinn and said well they caused our cars to crash the cars caused our children to fail their exams they caused me to divorce my wife they did this they did that and this is wrong Allah says Allah says in the Quran true there were persons among mankind who took shelter with persons among the jinns but but they increase them in fully to the extent that people fear jinn some of them slaughter animals to them and this is one of the notifications of Islam there are lots of people when they're building their houses just before they move in they slaughter sheep and they take the blood of the sheep and put it on the pavement on the steps or some of them while building the house they take the blood of the sheep and they paint the pillars the foundations of the building with blood and when you ask them why are you doing this they say oh it's just symbolic it keeps evil away then you've slaughtered this sheep for the evil for the jinn and this is shirk this is associating others with Allah and it nullifies your Islam a lot of people say touch wood whenever they want to compliment you or something to say touch wood knock on wood and what is this this is to prevent gin from heating it when you knock on wood we talk gin is not heating what you say so you don't you you won't be harmed by them and again this these are things are not acceptable in Islam the more you fear gin the more effect they have on you and we have a Arabic saying that whoever is scared of a genie a genie a genie comes pops out to him you have to connect your heart and faith to Allah so you feel no one but allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala and the best way to prevent Jen from affecting you and your life is to supplicate to Allah reciting the supplications in the early morning and at the evening time and let scar if you do this you have sheltered yourself in a castle and no one can penetrate this castle you have to do this when your children are going out and you have to prevent your children from going out between Maghrib and Isha a lot of Muslims don't know this your children should not go out between MRIB and Asia why is that is it located for them to go out after Asia yes it is is okay to go to after before Margaret sunset yes but from sunset to the time that the ratio prayer is called which is about an hour to an hour and a half they should be kept in houses in their house why the Prophet told us told us re so sad that the Djinn spread in the cities and the streets and they capture these and they possess those children the vulnerable children that don't know how to recite the supplications of the Quran and they possess them god forbids also the Prophet SAW Selim tells us to mention the name of Allah let's go Allah when we close the doors so when you enter the door you just you don't just slam the door and start shouting at your wife no this is the wrong way to do it you slammed the door and you say bismillah because sate Satan cannot open a door that the name of Allah was mentioned on you shouldn't mention the name of Allah say bismillah when you enter the house you should mention the name of Allah when you eat when you drink when you ride in your car when you have intercourse with your wife all of this you should always mention the name of allah azza wajal so that you are preserved and protected from the jinn yet by saying this we do not magnify their role we do not give them more that we do not credit to them more than what they deserve jinns and us humans will be questioned on the day of judgment as mentioned in the Quran as mentioned to us by the Prophet salah salem yet they live in their own separate world and we live in our own separate world lots of people have their superstitions regarding that there are connections and there are marriages between jinns and humans and they have kids and you know what's what would the result be of a marriage between a human and a jinn you know one eye and one ear the creature that flies and does this is all fiction and not Priya no realities there are different species they have the different worlds to reserve your faith connect your heart to allah azza wajal always continuously say the vicar that car the the supplications and allah the almighty will protect you from any harm to come to you I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program until we meet next time film Angela was Salaam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
