  "title": "Can a woman get into an elevator (lift) if there is a man or two men inside? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "she says I live in a building with 15 floors and while taking the elevator sometimes there's a man in the lift and I have to get in otherwise I'll have to wait for a long time for the lift to come back is it permissible or will it be which means seclusion what if there are two men can I take the elevator then first of all seclusion between a man and a woman is totally prohibited by the authentic hadiths and the consensus of all Muslim Scholars they all agree that a man being alone with an unmahram woman in seclusion is prohibited and what is the definition of seclusion so if I were in a an elevator or a lift that has Glass Walls panoramic view and everybody can see us or if I were with a woman in a car and the windows make everyone see what we're doing inside would this be seclusion the scholars say yes because seclusion revolves around what goes between us which a third party is unable to listen or monitor what we are saying so I could be doing anything or saying anything and nobody knows what is happening this is what Islam had prohibited when the prophet said no man is in seclusion with except the third person with them is Satan and what do you expect when Satan is present he would not tell you to read the Quran or learn from her the Hadith he would definitely do his thing so this generally speaking answers your question if you're in the 15th floor the lift comes or the elevator comes and there's a man inside you have one of two choices either to go in and disobeying the prophet Allah saving some time with the possibility of the lift does not work or it's stuck between floors as in so many cases that took place and is still taking place and after two three four hours maybe more maybe less it works or the emergency um Authority comes and rescue you with television and radio and the cameras and they're shooting you and this man in this that elevator with a report that you have been there for three four hours this is not good for your reputation let alone for your religion option two is to wait and this would waste few minutes you will either have it empty or if you had two men inside you can go in this is not seclusion if there was a man and a woman or more this is not seclusion seclusion is when you have a man without anyone he may fear or be ashamed of to be with you so if he had a an infant for example three-year-old that would be still seclusion because his three or year old would not deter this man from saying or doing anything and Allah azzawajal Knows Best"
