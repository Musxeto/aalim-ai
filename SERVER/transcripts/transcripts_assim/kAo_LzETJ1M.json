You should not at all engage in trying to save others by putting yourself in danger. This is crazy. So it's like someone saying, Sheikh, can I check all the porn sites available to report them so that they close them? When you check porn sites, what will happen? You will look at it and your heart would be tarnished and hardened and maybe killed and it dies in the process. Why are you doing this? Oh, to save the youth from such filth. Yeah, but you've got yourself into that filth. It doesn't make any sense. Save your skin. Stop going to such comments or chat boxes or whatever, and do not engage in it at all."
