  "transcript": "among the things that the prophet hated is argument and it was reported in a number of hadiths when people talked back to him in an argumentative way he would be upset and that would be seen on his face as in the case when he visited his daughter and his son-in-law and recommended them to pray night prayer instead of sleeping and Ali me Allah be pleased with him the cousin of the Prophet is said well our souls are in the hands of Allah whenever Allah sets us to wake up we will pray and this is not an appropriate answer one should have said inshallah we will do that and the prophet left and said that man was mostly argumentative that's amazing instead of being a cooperative and saying we will do that likewise the prophet's face would change when he sees sinful things when a sin is committed as in the case when he saw one of his friends wearing a ring made of gold you can see that he hated this on his face he went there and took it off and said why would anyone put a stone of fire in his hand and tossed it away this is something that we also have to have in US nowadays we see Vice and evil things happening all around us in our own homes in the streets in the malls we see Haram being committed the mixing of men and women the music the entertainment all of this is something that Allah hates and the prophet saws hates and it's a sign of hypocrisy not to hate it when you feel that whoa this is cool this is fun I am I'm enjoying myself and you don't see any signs of hatred on your face to such sinful Acts in this case this is a huge sign of hypocrisy may Allah make us among those who enforce and enjoin virtue and righteousness among the Muslims"
