  "title": "Can a woman speak publicly to raise awareness about sexual harassment",
  "transcript": "baffa muhammad says is it allowed for a muslim young lady to speak about sexual harassment openly like to enlightened people first of all it is totally prohibited to speak in front of men so opposite gender is totally out of the question secondly if she is addressing only females and she is truthful in what she's saying and this does not include any exposure of her own sins so she wouldn't say that i used to mix with men and we used to ask to have a boyfriend we used to go to school and and this happened this is exposing her sin she should not address this thirdly lots of these experiences when it comes to harassment may involve um provoking lust and desire you don't know who you are addressing when you speak about he did this to me and i did that and i tried to uh avoid it and he continued you don't know what fantasies would go into the minds of those listening to you so in a sense i believe that such sharing of experiences uh to enlightened people is not healthy you can simply abide by the quran and the sunnah teach girls not to free mix not to communicate with nan mahram to always protect their chastity and cover themselves probably even in front of mahram and to avoid anything that is dubious or weird and strange"
