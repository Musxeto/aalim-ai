  "title": "Interview with the opposite gender in a room with glass walls where everyone can see | AssimAlHakeem",
  "transcript": "that last question is straight to the point I live in the UK it's a non-muslim country and I apply for jobs and I get shortlisted they asked me for an interview but when I go for the interview I see that the one conducting the interview is a female but the meeting room is all glass walls and people are going and coming and employees are all of around us so actually I'm inside the room no one can hear what I say but everyone can see what is happening in ideal situations Abdallah this is not permissible if this was in a Muslim country or in a country that you're not desperately need for a job and most likely most companies would conduct such interviews with the opposite gender iji would generally say that this is not permissible because in that room you are in seclusion with her so whatever goes between you two is not shared by the others and this is Huell one this is seclusion however if you look at the case on the ground it is almost impossible to find a company in the UK that would grant you an interview according to what you want and it would be impossible to ask her to keep the door open or to bring someone in with you so insha'Allah for case is of necessity this is permissible but if there is a way out for you it is not permissible if this is a situation that is reoccurring and you are unable to get a job because of this and sha Allah this can be tolerated because some scholars have given the fatwa that seclusion is in a place that people cannot see you in so this is why some scholars though this is not the right opinion this is wrong some scholars allow the woman to travel in a taxi because everyone can see them driving around the city so this is not considered halwa but this is wrong yet because there is a difference of opinion among scholars and due to the necessity in the hardship coming out of this this is insha'Allah your any manageable and Allah knows best"
