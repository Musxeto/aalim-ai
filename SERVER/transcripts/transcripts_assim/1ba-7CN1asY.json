  "transcript": "a sister says I have started wearing the hijab and she has pictures before wearing the hijab all over the place on Facebook on laptops of others and classmates what should she do personally I believe that going to them and talking to them about it would only make things worse call us as long as you're wearing the hijab whatever you can remove on your own without stirring the problem or bringing their attention to it do it otherwise if you bring their attention to it they will keep a copy and they will always say oh this is a hijab' woman but if you neglect it let it go inshallah it will be forgotten"
