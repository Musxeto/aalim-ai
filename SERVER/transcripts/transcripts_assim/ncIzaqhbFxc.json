  "transcript": "from Bangladesh what's the ruling on saying Bismillah before doing any good thing this is something that the scholars have differed upon for example I start my speech withhd and some say that this is not from the Sunnah however that the prophet said in a Hadith anything that is started without it is cut Scholars of Hadith said that this is not authentic it is weak some authenticated it so saying orah is found in so many forms of worship before intercourse with your spouse a man says before eating before committing performing before so many things so some Scholars said that it is a source of Baraka because what does bah means it means in the name of Allah in the name of Allah what so if I'm going to write I say in the name of Allah I start to write bah I start to write to eat with in the name of Allah I begin to uh do this in the name of Allah so some Scholars say that saying Bismillah before you do anything is something that brings Baraka and it is beneficial because you're mentioning the name of Allah and there is no shik in that and Allah Knows Best"
