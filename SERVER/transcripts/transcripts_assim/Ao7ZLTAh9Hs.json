  "transcript": "Yusuf from Ghana. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. How are you? What can I do for you? Alhamdulillah. What can I do for you? Alhamdulillah Sheikh. Please, we don't have a clear picture of our deen, but Alhamdulillah we have the basics. Sometimes we come across some issues that are so confusing, and sometimes we don't know how to stand in between, especially when you don't have a scholar to call and then have any confirmation from what you heard. Recently, I landed on a certain clip. Basically, when I'm asking such questions, I don't want to mention sects, because these are the problems. Recently, a Sheikh was asked that why Mother Aisha is not, for their sake, they didn't accept her as the Ummul Mumineen, but he mentioned so many hadiths that they are from authentic sources, such as Bukhari, Ibn Majah, and so many authentic sources. Now, my problem is, after I watched the clip, I said something to my heart that, okay, if what they are saying is true, then no woman would be perfect than a woman that is married by a prophet. But in the same way, I said something to myself that Prophet Nuh and Prophet Lut. Your wife disobeyed them. [ ], they are prophets of God, but your wife disobeyed them. Yusuf, Yusuf, did you read Bukhari? I didn't read Bukhari, but I'm... How do you dare accept people slandering Mother Aisha and speaking, belittling her, quoting a hadith, numerous hadith from Bukhari, from Muslim, from different sources, when you did not verify, when did you not read the original sources? So if someone comes to you and says, I have so many evidences to prove that your father is not your biological father, would you accept this, yes or no? Not really. So how dare you relay what these blatant liars, disbelievers said about our Mother Aisha, and you're getting confusion about this. Fear Allah. If you have little Iman, you would brush it off and don't even ask about it. So come on, be realistic. Someone says something to you about Islam, go and check it. In Sahih al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, Muslim Imam Ahmad, Muwatta Imam Malik, the four books of the Sunan. Then if it's there, go ask the scholars. They said this hadith number, this hadith number, I verified it. What's or how to remove this confusion? And then you can have a conviction. But to shoot from the hip without even asking questions and assume that what these hypocrites or disbelievers are slandering and lying is true. There's something wrong. And have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it, inshallah, within the following two days or three days. And I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all."
