  "transcript": "so what is the format of Salah Tallis despot it is like 8 prayer the Imam has described earlier takes the people to an open area like leat same time as 8 and he offers two rakahs with 7 tech beers in the beginning in the first second and five tech beers in the second record so he says Allah Akbar takbeer little Allah he recites throughout his sifter it's a Hanukkah lamp and it's a vodka smoked a legitimate Wilke and then he offers seven times in one school of thought and another school of thought six times and the most authentic opinion singled out as a number without adding to it to the other huh and in the second Locker he does this five times and we did not say four times because they did not add to it took me a little movement the movement from salute to standing up otherwise Allah said six so it does seven times Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar after each time any places and in the second bracket he does the same format but five tech beers instead of seven and he said so little Hacha and then he concludes his prayer and then he gives one hot bath some schools of thought say that he gives to hot bar exactly as in as they had said in eighth prayer that it is composed of two foot bus and this is not the most authentic opinion the most authentic opinion is that it is only one single foot but as you remember the Prophet did not erase or some have his minimal taking taken out to the public so it wasn't taken with him and hence he did not have a place to sit down so he only delivered one hota some scholars say that the second hot bow was the hope of the women but this was not part of the heat it was either something that was random or done once or it was a separate way of addressing women because of their distance from the masala then he delivers a hot bath and in this hot bath he reminds the people to repent Allah to Allah he glorifies Allah solution he expresses the need of the people and begging to allah azzawajal to grant them the rain that they need to sustain their lives he to ask a lot of forgiveness to mend their ways and to fix their lifestyles so it's a reminder and also to give people hope yes we are begging allah azza wajal and we are seeking Allah's forgiveness and Allah savers and blessing but at the same time we are optimistic and we believe that and you see someone going out with an umbrella because it's confident that Allah will make it rain and at the end of the sermon while making dua it is Sunnah if you are wearing and outer garment a cloak a hoodie a jacket something that is usually worn not this soap something extra sometimes you wear it in black sometimes it's in beige and it's part of the Sunnah to turn it upside down so I take it off and I put the right shoulder on over my left and the left shoulder over my right so I twist it and I wear it upside down because the Prophet did this array salat wa salam and he did this as a token of good omen so he's doing this as to indicate that oh allah we believe that you alone can change things and we're changing our outer garment accordingly being optimistic that you will change the drought we're in and that it will rain so this is the sunnah to do it only at the end of the hotbar as the imam does it is it for the imam and everybody else or only for him though it's for everybody else as well because the prophet would not do something and the Companions just watch they would definitely and immediately follow suit as in the time when he prayed with his shoes on and he took it in the middle of the prayer because gibreel peace be upon him told him that there was Nagesh on it so it's the same way the same thing the same concept that the Companions are raised to do and that is to follow whatever the Prophet does are against Allah to was set up"
