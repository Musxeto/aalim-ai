  "transcript": "Medina from Germany so you kind of answered this but I I'm still unsure so you know um how should I handle uh questions about Islamic rulings from people who know who know less than me when I I I'm when I'm unqualified to answer I I know some opinions but I'm sure i'msure if I should share them so because it's also hard to sometimes reach reliable Scholars and asking can sometimes lead to a lot of F so what how should I just leave them with their questions or what like is there a better approach either you know the answer yourself so you can confidently give it to them or you don't know the answer but you've researched it from a trusted website such as Islam qa. info and you give them the fatwa for them to read and follow or you're hesitant you're not certain or you know the ruling but you don't have the evidence or the scholars who said it you refrain don't give them any wrong information that may hold you liable to it on the day of judgment so if you know something that is everybody's uh uh Common Sense the ruling on stealing killing uh lying you can say the ruling without any problem if you don't but you have the fatwa from Islam qa. info give them the fatwa or say to them sheh so and so said so and so exactly that fits their question but if you're hesitant or not sure you don't say anything to them"
