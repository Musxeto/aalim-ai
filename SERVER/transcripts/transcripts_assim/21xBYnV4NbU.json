  "transcript": "fornication well actually she's asking about adultery a woman uh who was married she cheated on her husband and committed adultery and he came to know about it and she repented and she sought for Allah's forgiveness and the husband seems to have concealed the issue but he's still reluctant whether to continue to live as a normal life and forgive the woman for what she had done or divorce her and she says how can we convince the the husband I don't know this is not an easy thing that you simply can kiss and make up this is a a man's honor when his wife commits adultery she has broken every piece of trust between him and her and it is far more difficult for a woman to commit adultery than for a husband to commit adultery and both are major sins but it is far worse when it comes from a woman because it is like glass once broken it can never be fixed so if the husband knows from himself that he has the guts to forgive and that he has the power to tolerate and pardon completely without any strings attached and most importantly he knows that his wife has truly repented and she has this remorse that is toring her apart because of what she had done and he knows that it was a mistake and she would never ever do anything similar or even close to that in this case yes if he forgives and he conceals her sin Allah Asel would forgive him and conceal his sin"
