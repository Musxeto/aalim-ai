  "transcript": "uh Su says how to know if Allah has accepted our Salah or not well so this is not possible because there aren't a particular sign or a number of signs that we can confirm whether Allah accepted our prayers or not however Scholars say that there are hints so Allah says prayer forbids evil things and sinful things so if your prayer is being established and yet you're still indulging in Haram and doing sins then this is a hint that your prayer is unaccepted I used to know people who used to pray five times a day and who used to fast in Ramadan only to go out with their dates after Sunset hello what are you doing he said I fasted I broke my fast so during the night time I can party and do whatever I want and this is of course a Twisted way of understanding Islam one of the things that may hint to you that Allah has accepted your prayer is when you find yourself observing prayer on time and the same paste andu and submissiveness whether you are in the congregation or not whether you are in your country or abroad on your own whether you are being watched by others or in the privacy of your own room when you see yourself consistent doing it for the sake of Allah that's a hint that Allah has accepted your prayer and finally when you see that you're getting closer to Allah day by day becoming more righteous more fearing of Allah more practicing indulging in more Good Deeds uh bit by bit this is also a very positive uh hint and Allah Knows Best"
