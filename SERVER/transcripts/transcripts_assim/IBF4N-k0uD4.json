  "transcript": "happy peace and blessings of Allah be on my solo beyond happy la rahmani rahim alhamdu lillahi rabbil alameen Ocelot assalamo a lil mama Ruthie rotten lil alamein nabina muhammad anwar al ajillo sabias may a marathi brothers sisters in islam assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh today we will start to study a beautiful hadith that illustrates the mercy of the prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam and we can learn from it some of the rulings of our beautiful religion the religion of Allah the hadith was reported in sahi Halima Muslim and other books as well so it is as high as it can be in levels of authenticity the hadith was narrated by mahalia in El Hakam may allah be pleased with him he says that while I was praying with the messenger of allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam so it was congregational prayer a man in the company sneezed I said Allah have mercy on you in Arabic your ham Kamala and this is what we usually say when someone sneezes and praises Allah Almighty the people stared at me with disapproving looks so I said whoa be upon me why is it that you are staring at me they began to strike the hands on the thighs and when I saw them urging me to observe silence I said nothing when the messenger of allah salallahu I you are you seldom would give when the messenger of allah salallahu janio you seldom had said the prayer for whom i would give my father and mother as ransom I've never seen neither before him nor after him a teacher who gave better instruction than him I swear that he did not scold me he did not beat me or swore at me he merely said talking to persons is not fitting during the prayer for it consists of glorifying Allah declaring his greatness and visitation of the Quran or words to that effect I said o prophet of Allah I was till recently a pagan but Allah has brought islam to us among us there are men who resort to Karen that is fortune-tellers or soothsayers he said do not go to them I said there are men who take omens they believe in bad omens that is something the Prophet said which they find in their chests but let it not turn their way from freedom of action I said among us there are men who draw lines he said there was a prophet who drew lines so if their lines coincide with his lines so be it and there is another paragraph to complete this hadith but we will not have time to comment on it so I will leave it in sha Allah to the next time we meet in this beautiful hadith mahalia is telling us may allah be pleased with him about an incident that could happen in any Masjid where someone did something by mistake and this thing that Marya did was known in Islam as a cash meet and this is in response to a person who sneezes and says alhamdulillah and this is part of the etiquette of Islam Islam is based on your connection with Allah the Almighty we remember Allah every single time every single breath with every single step we always remember Allah a soldier because we know it is our conviction that our existence is dependent on him the Almighty in his hands lie our souls and fate so Islam is built on remembering allah azzawajal i do not know any other religion that does this every single thing you do you mention the name of Allah no one else you don't mention the names of priests or messengers of prophets unless the Prophet tells us that Allah told us to do so so we have what is known as of car supplications we have a whole set of them to say in the morning and to say in the evening we say them before we go to bed so it's a religious ritual that we do every single night we say certain sets of supplications or F car after every mandatory prayer not only that before we eat we say bismillah after we conclude eating we praise Allah Almighty with certain supplications if we want to go to bed we say certain supplications when we wake up immediately we say these applications before entering the lavatories and after exiting before entering that message it and after exiting before leaving the house when you write on your car in your car or on your horse or your right or whatever there is a certain victory you say even before having intimacy with your spouse there is a vicar that you praise allah azzawajal and you say it so everything we do in our lives is connected to Allah the Almighty and this shows you the strength and the amount of conviction Muslims have that they attribute all goodness to the Almighty Allah in everything they do unlike those who worship Allah only on friday or on a saturday or on a sunday and then they neglect him they turn their backs to him without paying an attention muslims are not like that muslims are god-fearing people it's always under conscience because they remember allah azzawajal 24-7 so it is like what psychiatrists may call stereotyping but it is a positive stereotyping it is filling your heart with goodness and with the love of allah azzawajal by acknowledging his beautiful names and attributes so one of these supplications is connected with sneezing and one who say why sneezing what's so special about sneezing doctors from long time ago used to say that sneezing is something that is beneficial to the human body and they have explanations I cannot understand or relate to but they say it's a sign of health unless it comes with cold but if someone sneezes due to allergy due to any other reason other than sickness and illness it's a sign of being healthy and we're also told in the hadith that allah azzawajal loves sneezing and allah azzawajal hates yawning yawning is loved by Shaitaan by the devil because it's a sign of fatigue it's a sign of laziness it's a sign of wanting to sleep which may not make you a person an active person so a person who always sleepy and drowsy is not going to be active in doing good things neither in this life or for his hereafter in terms of forms of worship allah loves sneezing and why is that because it's a ritual in Islam it is the right of every Muslim it's the right of every Muslim if you hear him sneeze and he praises allah azzawajal you must and you're obliged to say to him your ham okumura and then he would reply to you by saying yadi Kamala while you sleep alikum so this exchange of praising Allah so jeal and invocation is loved by Allah every time someone sneezes says alhamdulillah anyone who hears him it becomes mandatory upon each and every individual to say your hammock amala of course unless there is some sort of fitna so if a person hears a woman saying alhamdulillah and there are there is no one else with them and he says your hammock moola this is inappropriate one should refrain he should say it in his heart because Shaitaan may build on such an exchange of praising of allah azzawajal and fitna must be avoided but generally speaking this is hypothetical however you should not say your hammock whom allah may allah have mercy upon you unless you hear that individual saying at hamdulillah why because two men once sneezed in the presence of the Prophet Ali salatu salam one of them said alhamdulillah so the Prophet Elisha replied to him by saying yahuh mokume allah may allah azzawajal have mercy on you and coming from the prophet re salatu salam ala will answer this for sure the other one the Prophet did not say anything to him so he objected o prophet of Allah we both sneezed in your presence but you prayed for that person and you did not pray for me why is that so the Prophet said to him because he praised the law and you didn't and in a hadith that was also reported in sahih muslim the Prophet said that is awesome whoever sneezes and praises allah azzawajal then you should do the act of Tash meet saying your hammock mula and whoever does not praise allah azzawajal do not say that to him and this by the way should only be said to a Muslim because we know as Muslims we may ask Allah for anything good for non-muslims in this life so if there's a non-muslim a friend a colleague or a relative and I go to visit him and he's sick I may say me a locker you may Allah heal your illness if he is indebted may Allah pay off your debt and grant you money if he is blessed with a child may Allah make your child blessed may Allah guide him this is totally permissible and it is part of a religion to be nice to others however when it comes to asking for forgiveness or for the mercy of the disbelievers this is prohibited by quran and allah azzawajal forbade his messenger ibrahim from seeking forgiveness for his father as a who died as a mushrik and likewise the Prophet I sir Sir I'm was prohibited from seeking forgiveness for his mother and hadith his a Muslim so we have to abide by the rules and regulations we have to stick to the commands of allah azzawajal therefore we cannot say to someone who is a kafir may Allah forgive you may Allah have mercy on you this is prohibited this is something between him and Allah and Allah so agent would hold him accountable and we're restricted from saying such such a thing this is why why the Jews used to sneeze in the presence of the prophet alayhi salatu salam trying to make him slip and say to them may Allah have mercy on you but the Prophet would not say anything except may Allah guide you yuridia Kamala while you sleep abanico may allah the almighty guide you and this is permissible there's nothing wrong in that so the etiquette of sneezing and answering is something beloved to allah the almighty in the hadith mihari I said your ham Kamala to the man next to him who sneezed and most likely the man said alhamdulillah but no one said anything to the man who sneezed and said that hamdulillah why is that because alhamdulillah is part of the things said in the salat in your prayer so it is not something outside of the prayer unlike your hammock mala this is a forum or a phrase that you're addressing someone else so it is not in line with the salat it's not in line with the prayer while praising Allah so L by saying alhamdulillah is definitely in line with the prayer when we are we did what he had done the Prophet did not tell him Ali Salah to Sam to repeat the however the consensus of scholars is that whoever speaks in the prayer with phrases or sentences that are not part of the prayer then his prayer is invalid this is the consensus but they made an exception that they say that with the exception of someone who does it by mistake he's unaware of it or due to ignorance and how would a person be ignorant with such a thing in the case of mahalia it's very logical and understood at the beginning of time when the prayer was first mandated they were not prohibited from speaking and talking with in the prayer itself as in the authentic hadith the Companions used to stand in prayer but greet one another while they are in the congregational prayer so they would say how are you how's the family how is this how is that and then go back to the prayer listening to the mmm or if it's a silent prayer this was common and accepted until it was abrogated when allah azzawajal revealed the ayah wahoooo elahi ana teen so stand in silence to allah azzawajal and since then speaking was totally prohibited in prayer however scholars say that if someone does it by mistake unintentionally so someone probably is in the midst of his prayer he's contemplating and all of a sudden and this happens a man comes into the message it and as loud as he can shout in the message assalamu alaykum warahmatullah this person was so involved in prayer he was startled by the Salam so without him feeling or knowing he replied by saying I alaikum Salam rahmatullah after the prayer was over said he what have you done he said well why I did not even notice that i just spoke without thinking and by allah i did not intended so do we say repeat your prayer dancers know his repair his prayer is valid and correct because it was done by mistake allah says in the quran rabana led to a hidden in a Cena a la donna oh Allah don't hold us accountable if we make if we forget or make a mistake inside him a Muslim Allah replied to them by saying I have done so meaning I have forgiven you so it's the grace of Allah Almighty that he pardons us if we were to make something out of mistake or out of ignorance and in the case of mahalia it was surely out of ignorance he did not know that it was not permissible otherwise he would not have done it in the hadith he said that the people when he said your hammock amala he tells us that the people started looking at him now this would be a little bit strange definitely the people at the back at the front would not be able to look behind them because this would nullify their prayer it was the people to his side and probably he felt the heat of their looks from behind him because those beside him might have looked to the site so he was saying woe be to be to me or be upon me why are you staring at me like this so he didn't even notice that they were angry of him talking because he didn't think that he did something wrong so he started talking to him why are you staring at me look at the hand who are you talking to so Subhan Allah they did not know what to do except striking their hands on their thighs so it's like clapping but you're striking your thighs and he noticed that all of them are doing this so he understood that they want him to simply shut up and so this was what he had done now the prayer was over and then the mercy of the prophet alayhi salatu salam is illustrated he himself says that I am ready to give my father and my mother as ransom for the prophet alayhi salaatu so and this is an Arabic expression because if you were told the profit is ranch is a hostage and they want ransom for him what are you willing to pay the most valuable thing in your life is not your wealth it's your parents so it's an Arabic expression to say to someone that you love I am willing to give my father and mother as a ransom for him not that it's required but this shows you how important he is in their lives so he says by Allah I'm ready to sacrifice my family for the prophet alayhi salatu salam he did not scold me he did not beat me and he did not swear at me or curse me and usually this is the doing of tyrants this is the doing of hard teachers or teachers who do not know how to up bring on and raise generations so if you have a teacher like that you are in trouble a teacher that does not speak to you or with you without slapping your face or a spanking you with a stick or at least ridiculing whatever you say there aren't such teachers whenever you speak they make fun of you even if your question is legitimate they make fun of you and of what you are saying so that next time you do not even ask or you would not even have the guts to stand up and answer a question the Prophet Alice awesome was totally unlike this though what more we had done was a grave mistake and we would not say that it's a sin because he didn't know but it was something that was unacceptable all of a sudden in the middle of a prayer where everyone is concentrating on their prayers you speak loudly like this and say while looking at me like this so the normal reaction would have been few words of reprimand man reprimanding him but this even that did not come from the prophet sallallahu I Hawaii Oh Salem on the contrary the Prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam told him that this prayer of allah azzawajal nothing of man's talk is suitable in it it's only praising Allah glorifying Allah saying takbeer and reciting the Quran this captivated the heart of mahalia the way that the Prophet spoke to him at his salatu salam the way that the prophet taught him because mahalia was not one of the close companions of the prophet or a slow son had he been one of those close companions he would have known the ruling of speaking while in prayer but he was someone who just came in like any other Muslim yet the prophet alayhi salatu salam went out of his way to explain to this person the essence of salat which made him narrate this hadith on and on and on two generations until it reached to us and it gave us a glimpse of the mercy of the Prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam who was sent as mercy for mankind we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back Swilley rahmanir rahim assalamu alaikum and welcome back the lines are open for your questions if you have any we have a question from for han he is saying that his parents opened an account without his knowledge a saving account in his native country and they told him that it was a current account so there were no interest to be deposited in it but after a while he discovered that they even made a mistake or lied to him it was a saving account and the interest was pouring in to that account he says a my sinful for that the answer is if you had no say in it no you're not sinful second question can he use the account in order to register for paypal or to buy something from Amazon without using the account answer is yes inshallah there's nothing wrong in that if you have full control over that account you must see and calculate the interest take it out and cleanse your wealth by spending it in means of charity without intending the reward from Allah because there is no reward in money that is earned through Haram you simply want to cleanse your wealth from it and Allah knows best Muhammad from Saudi Arabia hello Esther dominica Santa ma shake I have five questions yellow team as first question is regarding a jollier date and consumption of water after that I will according to an authentic hadith if we eat five as what dates in the seven as what days and do not drink water after that on empty stomach we will be protected from poison on that day I would like to know how long do we have to refrain from drinking from water to get this protection okay and my second question is regarding interest-based death and hugs i maxed out one of my credit cards long time ago and accumulated some interest based death now i'm planning to perform hajj this year do I have to pay this debt and full before going to Hajj are you paying it I hey Mohammad are you paying it and in installments no I stop the payments long time ago it's been like 12 years now okay and thirdly I would like to know is it permissible to pay emphatic Sunnah after paying the higher tone must leave before budget when we drape the congregation okay and it's bodybuilding allowed in Islam just weightlifting or even with see religion anabolic steroids no steroids just weightlifting and muscle building okay and my last question is regarding evening of Scott when is the best time to say evening a car is it after uh sir or after maghrib ok I will answer you insha Allah thank you you're quite welcome of him brother Mohammad from Saudi Arabia is asking 5 questions the first question is regarding the Dada dates and the hadith of the Prophet is awesome whoever eats early in the morning seven as whoa dates then on that day he would not be harmed by neither poison nor a spell meaning magic or black magic and the hadith is authentic however i do not know anything related to drinking water and I'm trying to look in some of the hadith references whether you should not drink any water afterwards and I could not see that so to my knowledge this is not authentic the authentic thing is that the first thing you do after waking up is consuming these seven dates but if you eat them and then drink water afterwards there is nothing wrong in that if you have your breakfast then eat them this does not work you have to eat them on an empty stomach but after eating them you can drink in sha allah his second question that he has a debt that he did not pay and its interest based his reasons for not paying it is beyond me but this is something that he has to be held accountable on the day of judgment though it is Reba based the capital which you have borrowed from them you must return it to them the interest is an issue of dispute and depending whether you can evade it as skip it or not but you have to pay the money to the the lawful owners of that money but does this conflict with his hatch as long as you can find money to go for hajj you can go and perform hajj there is no problem in that this that does not affect your house your Hajj is valid but this is a sin that you will be accountable for Aisha from Egypt sample la oh my question regarding the perfect mom with the linearity the new parent okay oh wait that it seems what I like what yeah Islam cream right okay hello yes so what idea position Islam a dream within Muslims oh okay oh no I will receive inshallah okay Muhammad third question he says that are we allowed to offer soon littell fetcher after the heytell masjid in federal time okay there is a hadith which was reported in the sunan and the Prophet said array salatu salam forbade praying between a van and a comma a fetcher except the Torah cos of sunnah which is known as rly battle fader or some metal fetcher however if a person enters the masjid after the event and he did not pray it he must pray these two records of sunnah and nothing else what about the greeting of the message the two records of Tahiti machine well these two rak'ahs are embedded in the two rak'ahs of sunnah why because the Prophet did not salala Mario Salem tell us to pray a specific or individual prayer for greeting the masjid he said that whenever any of you enter a masjid he must not sit until he prays to rakas that's it so if I printer the message while they're praying fault and I pray with them this suffices if i enter the message and i pray 2 rakats optional feature this suffices but if i am at my home and the event is called and i pray 2 rakats of sean artificial in my home as the Sun is and I walk to the masjid and i enter the message then their karma is not given i cannot sit there for I have to pray to rock eyes off soon a little message it or to hate and miss you I have prayed so nitrogen in my home this is why it's permissible now to do it but to combine both separately meaning praying's the heytell message then soon it'll feature in the masjid this is not permissible told reform the Emirates Torah told her from the Emirates yes I could ask a ninja good afternoon yeah please I have a question I want to ask because I'm I'm non arabic so I'm reading the Quran in Russian so I want to ask it very much is the same or list can you read Arabic I can't I don't speak and I can't read okay i'm living in UAE and i'm reading the Quran in Russian only okay i will answer you inshallah please thanks salah from qatar hello yes so I Salaam aleikum Salaam to LA I am the clergyman in the Soudan in Saudi Arabia and our government ordered the education of the shift lever what is difference is between you and remember we are all Muslims in and and the perfect age Melania tamil merle muslimiinta light element I seriously want you to pour here salah salah you want to ask you a question a simple question what do you think of mother Aisha the wife of the Prophet are a solid wassalam and what do you think of abu bakr and overall mark and of men and the rest of the Companions of the Prophet Alice awesome are they Muslims will they be with the profit in Jenna what do you think of them okay so i probably made in a statement and i will answer his question charla alia from Saudi Arabia Salaam alaikum chick re como se llama la la la I can shake I have to question yes can my mother give the things to my father of my father to the needy ones without his permission permission as he is not using it and my second question is six when we offer Salah if we for God surat suppose i am reading big surah after surat surah fatiha in first rocket if I forgot that surah can I read another suitor ok I will answer in sha la la abdifatah from Iraq calamari co Santa Lovato I wanted to know if this is right that you've got money from Saudi Arabia because we blow blow blow blow again well I are you are making me laugh you are making me laugh because all what you say is saudi arabia saudi arabia saudi arabia what is it with you guys what's the problem what's the beef you have can't you ask questions related to the topic or at least to Ramadan or at least to Islam things that do with politics you and I don't have any say in it you don't have any say in what happening in your country if you can take care of your own country that would be a great thing to do so i Goti beg to differ but this is becoming a nuisance in a sense Muhammad from Saudi Arabia asking about bodybuilding I think you should ask about mind building with these lunatics calling every five minutes and as if they are advocating or defending their cause they are adding fuel to the fire and this is what they want bodybuilding is something permissible in Islam to be in a state of physical fitness is something encouraged in Islam and the Prophet told the saddest asaram that a strong believer is better than a week believer and this is in all aspects whether mainly it is in a spiritual and religious aspect but this doesn't also contradict with being strong in wealth strong in knowledge and strong in physics and the physical ability however if you're doing it to show off or to impress women or to boast about it this becomes a sin if you're doing it for self contentment and satisfaction and just to be able to be strong and whenever the call for jihad is being given you're always there and ready and prepared then this is a good thing to do farida from Saudi Arabia I think we lost farida last question of muhammad may allah reward him is what is the proper time for evening of car this is an issue of dispute some scholars say it should be after a sir some scholars and very little of them say it should be after war but the main two groups are saying that it should be between after answer or after maghrib those who say after a sir they say because they are called evening of car so when the Sun sets and you did not say them then you're not protected but but if you say it after a sir then you are fully protected others say no it's called evening because it's after sunset and when you do it then you are protected with the grace of Allah Sojin and the time gap is very short which is the matter of prayer and both opinions are strong I personally choose to say it after maghrib most of the time but sometimes when I have a lecture after maghrib and I know that the time would not be sufficient for me to say say them after the salat I say it after a sorcerer el hamdellah the room is there for maneuvering I assure from Egypt says that she wants to know about the parents of the prophet alayhi salatu salam and before we go to Asia we have Freda again after now they don't love me they have done many things farida should I leave them alone funny I keep on with my kid fareed i did not heed your question you started hitting the road running i am saying i was not a muslim my husband converted me to islam by then my family hated me alone after now they don't love me they have done many many things should I give them alone and I keep on with my kids okay any more questions that is my question she I want you to know please inshallah I would answer you inshallah and so I should sing about the parents of the Prophet I did salatu salam we have no knowledge of anything except what Allah tells us or the messenger of allah sallallahu wasallam tells us so we also believe that the most authentic book after the Quran is suhail bihari and say a Muslim we have also NSA tirmidhi a Buddha would and even measure what Parliament Malik muslimah etc but these two main sources of hadith are the most authentic and to come and say that no this hadith is not authentic or week or two talk negatively about it means that we are talking negatively about everything else in the religion therefore we have to accept whatever is there and in sahih muslim the Prophet himself told us that his father and his mother are in hell so do we know more than the prophet Isaiah salam we cannot do this do we wish that they are in paradise definitely we do but this is not what we wish it is what Allah had commanded an Alonso gel knows best for dos or for dosa from Somalia for dosa from Somalia I said I'm not even sure how are you you can sound phlebotomy finds a collage it uh my question is for that I will you hat hello yes fort Eloise what is question during our do you play d play and 11 check out or 21 because some messages are different from each other okay i will answer you inshallah we have half saw from nigeria half suck have some okay I think we've lost half stuff Tara from the Emirates she says that she reads the quran' in russian and this is a if i may correct you there isn't any or an in russian or in English the only Quran is in Arabic that's only Quran we have you have a translation of the meaning of the Quran in other languages which means that what you're reading is a translation it's a human effort of translating their understanding to the arabic or an into your language and she says she does not speak Arabic and she cannot read Arabic so is she rewarded by reading the translation of the meanings of the Quran in Russian and the answer is yes insha Allah because Allah does not burden us all beyond what it can bear and this is your ability so Allah rewards you as much as you're able to do but i would strongly advise you to enlist in schools or colleges or places that give arabic lessons you are in a great blessing and favor of Allah being in the Emirates which is a Muslim country and you have a possibility and ability to learn Arabic more than anywhere else and this gives you an advantage over most Muslims because then you read the Quran and then understand it directly in Arabic as it was revealed and so is for the sooner so it's a little bit hard but try your best and Allah would be with you Nora from the Emirates hello phenomena commence a sample ah I have a question I am now sitting on either and I wanna do it because insha Allah so I wanna know is it is it i'd offer you at home Nora is it ready for what we do ok ok and you want to go for a teacup yeah yeah and I want to do I I want to know if I it is possible to do at home ok any more than what time you started the Ada and ending I am in what they started of the epic up and ending time ok I will not even sure anymore questions and no more but I want to clarify that i am saying at a home alone with my daughter so may attend you Sneed i have two years odd like that so and then what what is the things that i should avoid you think with your son or your father my son two years old ok we are alone at all ok ok thank you very much you're quite welcome are you since Allah from Potter he's saying something about she and what is the difference between Shia and why is the Saudi government ordered the execution of sheikh nemir or whatever I I don't know what you're talking about but I know that there was a cleric who made blasphemous statements about a prophetess oh sanam and he went public against mother Aisha about all the companions and he did something that went to court and the law said its verdict so what's wrong in that we have courts here so if the judge gives a verdict of flogging someone of executing someone this is the law it has to be respected it has to be followed let alone that that infidel made a blasphemous statement he cursed mother Aisha he cursed abu bakr umar uthman and this is what the hardcore la fila whether they are ethnic or a mamiya do if they don't do it let them come in public and say so you cannot say no we're alike where muslims we are we are we alike let us see compare Apple to Apple we believe in El Hassan will Hussein to be the masses of the youth in gender in paradise do you believe in that should definitely so hamdillah we do not curse any of the idol bait do you cursin of the elevated no definitely we love and believe in the wives of the prophet has chosen to be our mothers do you believe in that said no aha why said hafsa the daughter of rumor aisha the daughter of all bakr they're all infidels their cafard there in hell and they're cursed are you crazy these are the wives of the Prophet Arizona so not only that all the companions are liars and there are traitors and they have betrayed the prophetess m except I'm marnya said except salman and Pharisee except four or five of them and the rest are all in hell are you a Muslim whoever believes in such things that I have just stated is a kafir take it from me to the United Nations he is a kafir if you add insult to injury open their biggest book which is al caffe which is like cycle bihari to us and it says in black and white that the book the Quran that we the Muslims read is nothing related to what Allah has revealed to gibril they have their own Fatima Quran and they say that this is 70 times bigger than the Quran you have and there is not a single letter of what you have in it now one of the two either you believe in this then you're a full-fledged kafir and your inhale and we cannot say salaam to you and you cannot eat your slaughtering whether you pray five times or ten times or a gazillion times a day because this is conviction this is belief or you say Noah hey this is a fabrication we don't believe in this and in this case you have to come up in the public and say this is a fabrication we Shia do not believe in a coffee we do not believe in a tub Rossi oil collini or whatever names you have because they have said blasphemous things in this case we have no no beef with you agree we have no problem with you but to come and say no we are alike and we're a minority why are you doing this this is blasphemy this is coo for to talk against abu bakr umar oh who else is there to carry Islam to us other than these great companions whom the prophetess ram is pleased with and died while being pleased with and if you insult the honor of the prophetess m Aisha and half so who else is there to protect so okay jaani I think you and you look like in your mid 50s or 60s you have very few a little time left it's time to reflect and see am I on truth for am i following the main hatch and the way of these rough Allah which is based on a vengeance and hatred they are full of hatred to all mankind and they are full of a vengeance though something you and I were not involved in but they want to avenge they want to kill they want to hit themselves and shed blood as if this is part of religion and it is not Abdullah from Saudi Arabia Santa ma my question is we know they say if you have a slave what you hit them with what you eat and then you grow them with what's your way well how about somebody will work for you and we see them their monthly seller is it luck was like a like the plague that no question ok I would answer in sharma and then i'm leaving the i mean gintama really i really want to stay the Quran in the maiming I don't know if they have any location it did a baby daddy offer that so if you could help me with that so alpha will send some of my time learning the Quran and Chuck got your question shall I will answer you in sha Allah I don't think we have time for more calls alia from Saudi Arabia she says that can her mother give sadaqa from her father's wealth without his knowledge something that he's not using for 34 years can she disposed of it in charity without his knowledge answer is no it's his you have to take his foot permission first and she says that if a person while reciting a long surah forgets it forgets an ayah can he jump to another surah there's nothing wrong in that providing he says bismillah r-rahman r-rahim and he as a divider between the two so that he would not mix two suitors without any legitimate reason so by separating by saying bismillah r-rahman him and moving to another surah this is permissible inshallah farida from Saudi Arabia she says that she is a revert and her in-laws or her parents her kinship are abusing her because she's a Muslim and they're not and they're making problems to her and causing him a lot of trouble so she says do I have to still see them and connect to them or should I stay with my kids and lead my life in peace the answer is if you're talking about your in-laws no you don't have to see them and if you don't see them at all you're not sinful at the sight of Allah is urgent your kinship your parents your siblings your cousins your uncles and aunts you must connect to them to the best of your ability so if you're in a foreign country and you can't see them SMS them call them every now and then use skype whatever means possible if you're there then occasionally a visit of a couple of minutes just to break the ice and leave before they get the chance to harm you or abuse you or say what angers you is good but you should not cut their your kinship for those that says taraweeh is it 11 or 21 the prophet alayhi salatu salam used to pray either 11 or 13 as per the hadith of mother Aisha and even our best may Allah be pleased with them yet he never restricted that and you have to be careful if someone tells you how many times in the Prophet al-islam perform Hajj you'd say once so if someone says in this case you must not perform more than one hatch in your lifetime otherwise you would be innovating this is nonsense the Prophet encouraged us to perform Hajj a days or so as much as possible and he also encouraged us to pray night prayer without giving us any limitation and therefore if you pray 11 this is good if you increase that to 23 there is no problem if you increase it to more than that then they have you have no problem at all with this inshallah we have a few remaining questions I will address them tomorrow insha Allah and until then fee amanillah Salam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh and blessings of allah be young p7 love and blessings of Allah"
