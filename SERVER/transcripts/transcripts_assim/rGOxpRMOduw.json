  "title": "Why does Quran speak about things in the future in the past tense - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign this is something that most likely you will find the answer for in the books of tafsir however it's a form of the beauty of the language in Arabic when the Quran speaks about things in the future in the past tense to confirm and emphasize that this is as a done deal so when I say I will go tomorrow to Europe this is something in the future when I say oh I went to Europe I didn't go but it is so confirmed and uh going to happen without any shred of doubt that I'm talking about it and addressing it as if it already had taken place so this is one of the ways of Arabic in addressing things that are definitely going to happen as if they took place on Allah Knows Best"
