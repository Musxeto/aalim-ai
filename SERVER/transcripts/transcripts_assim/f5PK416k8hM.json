  "title": "Who to follow, the Prophet ‎’sﷺ Sunnah or the 4 rightly guided caliphs? | Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "so ahmed from south africa he says we have an issue which is the prophet alaihis salatu orders us to do something so his sunnah is fixed then the four righteously guided caliphs whom he the prophet hassam told us to follow his sunnah and their sunnah do something that is different what are we to do this is an issue which means that you can do either one and both are correct according to the ishti had of the muslim ruler for example the prophet al-islam in flogging the one who drinks intoxicants they used to flog 40 lashes when omar came and people used to drink like fish and 40 is nothing so he consulted the companions and if i'm not mistaken ali may allah be pleased with him the fourth caliph said when a person drinks and gets wasted he starts to slander and slandering's punishment is 80 lashes so you can go up to 80 lashes and he did so and since then everybody is being flogged 80 lashes for getting drunk or consuming intoxicants if the muslim ruler thought that no i'd like to go back to 40. would that be okay that would be a okay this is the son of the prophet if someone says no i'm going to stick with 80 because all the companions agreed upon it and nobody went against it this is okay so it is dependent on the ishtihad of the muslim ruler likewise the prophet alaihis saud time you say to your wife i divorce you thrice or divorce divorce divorce the prophet used to count it as one alice abu bakr used to count it at one rumor may allah be pleased with him in the beginning of his reign he used to count it as one then when he saw that people are making it easy to throw three divorces at once he said no as a punishment it's three and many schools of thought adopted this opinion and it continued nowadays it's up to the muslim judge to decide which one to take and both opinions are fine so when it comes to the adhan if the imam of the masjid wants to have one of that this is fine because the second event which was introduced by uthman was for a reason and this reason does not exist anymore but if he might wants to maintain the sunnah of uthman that's perfectly fine of having to advance and if he wants to let that or limit that to one event this is also fine and there's no reason to fight over it"
