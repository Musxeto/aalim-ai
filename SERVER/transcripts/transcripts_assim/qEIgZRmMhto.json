  "title": "Whoever imitates a people is Part of them - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "and one of the guidelines is the Hadith of Allah be pleased with him and with his father where he said that the prophet said in a long Hadith I quote so this is the part that we're interested uh in whoever imitates a people then he is part of them from this Hadith and many other narrations for example when the prophet so may Allah be pleased with him and with his father and theith is narrated in Muslim he saw him wearing two garments that were dyed with zaffron and this was known to be worn and used by the idol worshippers so the prophet was outraged when he saw this great companion wearing this look at the way he addressed him because he's his disciple he's his student he said to him did your mother order you to wear this immediately the man understood his fault so he said oh prophet of Allah shall I wash them the prophet said no burn them washing them would have sufficed but the prophet Asam wanted to make an example of wasting such money by burning it so that people would know how severe the sin was and there are so many examples that I could give and relate to you but this is not the time if you look at the Shar as a whole you will see that the prophet orders Us in so many incidents to go against the Jews and the Christians and the disbelievers so in breaking your fast you have to make it as quick as possible go against them in postponing and delaying your pre-dawn meal as much as possible which will bring us to ay's question this is also recommended as Sunnah growing the beard to go against the Jews and the Christians and the fire worshippers so many this is not a time for that in essence we are told to go against them"
