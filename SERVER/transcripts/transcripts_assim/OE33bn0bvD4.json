  "transcript": "now sh I wanted to ask about um women performing H and um um I it's not compulsory or is not allowed for them to cover their face for example for a woman who uses in a club on a normal day so someone who now later did this cover a face is it sinful is aced is valid okay first of all it is a misconception that a woman who is in the state ofam for performing Haj or must not cover her face this is totally Bogus the hadiths are against it meaning that theith ofak of that we used to perform ha with the prophet or and whenever Riders used to pass by us we used to cover our faces and when they're gone we would unveil which means that covering the face during the Hajj and the omra for a person who is in hisam is mandatory now what is not permissible for a woman in the state of to do is to wear the as it is not permiss isible for a man in the state ofam to wear a shirt that has sleeves but he can cover his arms and shoulders no problem but he must not wear something that has sleeves to it likewise a woman can cover her face even with a veil that touches her face but she cannot wear the nikab which is a face cover that has an opening for the eyes this is not permissible for a woman inam so to answer your question yes a woman in the state ofam must cover her face if she's in the presence of nonaham men so that they would not look at her and Allah Knows Best"
