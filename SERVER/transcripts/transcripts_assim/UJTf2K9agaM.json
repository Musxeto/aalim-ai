  "transcript": "or whatever from india says what's the difference between sadaqa tuljari and sunnatul hasana these are two different things sadaqa tuljaria is continuously generating good deeds charity so i build a masjid and i go home and sleep people come and pray in the masjid i get accredited with good deeds i die i'm in my grave people pray in the masjid my continuous deeds are the meter is running likewise if i dig a well to uh people to drink from if i build a madrassa my programs on zad tv or on huda or in peace i'll be in my grave and the meter is running with good deeds from people who are learning and spreading and sending a link here and there i'll be getting all these awards why because is something totally different a sunnah is something that people follow you in what you do and this has basis in the sunnah whether this particular sunnah has been worn off people don't do them anymore because of negligence for example i remember like 25 30 years ago when i was a teacher there was this particular teacher in my school who's an arabic teacher not a practicing bearded brother normal brother yet every day at 11 o'clock he would go and make wudu put his mat and pray to raka's boha at the time it struck me really hard whoa this guy is praying and you the sheikh you prayed once every blue moon this is not a good thing from that day till date alhamdulillah i pray it every single day and i know that this man is being accredited because he was the one who initiated this in me with the grace of allah so this is a sunnah that people have neglected had forgotten and he revived it by doing it not by doing a buddha this is from the sun of the prophet so whatever you help people initiate or remind them of this is a sunnah hasanah unlike sadhaka tuljari this is a charity that is ongoing and allah knows best"
