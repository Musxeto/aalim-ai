  "title": "Can we pray absentee funeral prayer (salatul ghaib) for those who were lost at sea AssimAlHakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "mahfoud from indonesia regarding the sunken indonesian navy submarine incident authorities said the sailors in the submarine have passed away in the sea although we haven't seen the bodies physically uh for that can i offer absentee funeral prayer or salat individually at my home for them okay first of all is performed upon those whom no one has offered funeral prayer so for those sailors who died in the submarine and i read a couple of days ago that they found a grease box for the telescope or a virus scope gyroscope or whatever they call it which may indicate the vicinity of the submarine which will lead inshallah to them finding the submarine and retrieving the bodies once this is done there will be a funeral prayer offered if this is not done if they don't find any traces of it like the malaysian airliner that was uh that fell four or five years ago so what to do in this case we as a government or as a country would conduct s but not individuals in their homes so this has to be done in congregation with a coordination of the authorities and allah knows best"
