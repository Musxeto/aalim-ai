  "title": "Prayers Hajj Zakat invalid if you cut relationship with your muslim brother? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "she we all know that seeing the kingship relationship will not allow Allah will not allow us in Jenna but somebody told me that even if you cut severe relationship with your Muslim Brothers if you don't talk to them you don't do Salam to them then your prayers and your H and your zakat are invalid which I said it is not so so I just wanted to ask you about this sh first of all the Hadith relating to sing ties of kinship is authentic the prophet said a person who does not or a person who cers his kinship ties will not be admitted to Jenna and this as part of our belief as is not for eternity because he's not a cafir but it is for a prolonged period of time and such a sin is under the Divine will like all other sins if Allah wishes he forgives and if Allah wills it they will be punished in Hellfire for a per period of time and then be admitted to Jenna except shik and kufur this is not under the Divine will because Allah had already pre-ordained it that they will be in hell H for eternity as for boycotting the Muslim brother if there is no legitimate reason as we've mentioned earlier in the Hadith of Malik if it's not done for a legitimate Islamic reason the prophet sallallahu alai wasallam gave those two Muslim individuals who were fighting or disputing over an issue and they were mad at one another Allah gave them the natural period to vent out and calm down and that is 3 days so it is permissible for me to avoid and boycott and not reply to a Muslim brother a stranger for three days and nights after that when we meet it is totally prohibited to give our backs to one another or to ignore one another or not to reply to the Salam of one another so if I see my brother after 5 days this friend of mine and I sayam allum though I angry with him he's angry with me if he looks the other way and does not give Salam back then he is at fault he's committing a major sin but this has nothing to do with his prayer fasting and Good Deeds rather his good deeds will not be elevated to Allah until he reconciles not that they are void or unaccepted or rejected so I hope this answers your question"
