  "transcript": "now what is obligatory on those who are present with the dying person after he dies there are a number of things that we should pay attention to when a person dies the scholars say that I'm going to list them and then we we may go to details or not first of all you have to verify that he died because this is a big problem if you consider someone to be dead and you go with the proceedings of his preparation and you bury him and then he is not dead once I was researching um you know in at night people who work at night what is the name of their shift graveyard why is it called graveyard I had a passion whenever I hear something I'd like to know the origin of it so that was a long time ago I don't know if it's true or not but this is what I remember long ago when people died they did not have means of verific verification whether they did or not so if someone is not breathing or he seems to be not breathing not moving they considered him dead and they used to put him in a coffin and bury him and they discovered later on that some of those buried when they opened their coffins they found scratching on the cover of the coffin from the inside which meant that the person was not dead he woke up found himself in a grave in a coffin and he tried to get out and could not so they decided that they would tie a rope or a string to the deceased finger Barry him and the end of the string would have a bell at the graveyard yet they discovered that the Bell was so weak nobody heard it because a lot of those who walk up in in the middle of the night rang the bell rang the bell nobody heard they suffocated and died so they appointed someone to sit at the graveyard at the night time so if he hears the ring he knows that the person is not dead and they would take him out and that is why they called it graveyard shift so whether this is true or not you have to ask she Google and he inshallah would uh uh be able to tell you what to do so first of all you have to verify that he's dead now in uh the uh first point it says that you have to close his eyes and supplicate or make Dua for him the origin of this is when sallahu Al wasallam visited Abu Sal and Abu Sal was the brother of the Prophet Alat wasam of suckling so who is else Hamza the three are brothers from suckling Hamza the uncle of the Prophet so he visited him while he was on his dying bed but he died and as he died he looked upwards and the prophet Alat wasam said that uh verily when the soul is snatched the eyes follow it and and these are the final delicate moments of a person's life as his soul is getting out there are reflections there are sents in his eyesight he sees his soul coming out and that is why the majority of people when they die they die with their eyes wide open and usually looking to the sky why because it's watching its Soul departing the body and it's not a very pleasant thing to see so the first thing to do is to close the deceased eyes either by two fingers or by the hand itself because in Islam a deceased way of looking has to be protected so if he is scary if he is intimidating if he gives you a bad feeling Islam tells you to cover all of this up and that is why we close his eyes and the prophet said do not call on yourself we we went through this now he's dead the angels are there they're saying aan so you have to know what to say and Subhan Allah uh um Sal she says that when Abu Sal died and he was among the first to migrate to Medina and he was the companion of the Prophet Alam he's his brother from suckling when he died this was a Calamity and she says that I heard the prophet sayat wasam whoever is struck by a Calamity and says verily we are uh to Allah and to him we shall return I think the translation in your hands says Allah give me refuge and refuge is different than reward me the right correct correct translation do you have it or maybe it's I'm ahead of schedule a little bit so okay we will pass by it inshallah so she said oh Allah reward me in my Calamity and substitute me with something that is better than it she said when I remember thei of the Prophet Alat I said this because he taught us how to say it whenever you're struck by Calamity but then I said who can be better than Abu Sal in her eyes no one is better than the companion of the Prophet one of the first to to migrate to Medina so and so and so but she said this believing in the Hadith of the Prophet Alam who substituted him the prophet Alam soon afterwards the prophet proposed to her and she became the mother of the believer Subhan Allah so always remember this Dua there are so many times that we have places that we're supposed to say something and we don't say it the prophet tells us in authentic Hadith that if you make W and sleep and you wake up in the middle of the night and you say and you supplicate Allah will give you whatever you wish uh Allah give me raise Allah will give it to you a better job Allah will give it to you you just supplicate say this and you try it I have brothers coming to me saying that it's been two months now and nothing happened and I asked them do when you wake up do you say the Dua said no I'm when I wake up I just go to the bathroom I wash I make W and then I wake up and say okay now I make the door it's too late the minute you wake up while you're on your bed you say this Dua first of all second of all do you go to your bed while performing wo no if I make wo I will not sleep so I have then how do you want Allah to answer your supplication you have to follow likewise there's a Calamity the minute you go out this is not a bad om but it's an example you go out you find your car smashed and the man ran away what's the first thing you say may Allah curse him may Allah burn him in Hell may Allah say you never know what Allah Allah is a provider you never know what Allah will bring you and provide you so this is a reminder always learn the Dua always learn how to connect your heart to Allah with in every small and big thing you will be amazed of the results inshallah so okay one of the supplications that the prophet said at that moment he said oh Allah forgive Abu Sal and raise his level among the rightly guided and what do you have the translation hello after lunch usually all the blood goes to the stomach for digesting so a lot of the people say they're like zombies so try to wake up huh follow with us what is what does he say okay and and what and let the remaining offring be like him the meaning to substitute or to take the place of so the most correct translation is not to make his offspring like him because this Dua is said to who to any dead person so if the deceased who just died was a rock star I would say oh Allah make his offspring like him would this be suitable no so the best translation in Arabic meaning that you Allah substitute or succeed him in his uh Offspring meaning now he used to take care of his offspring he's dead who takes care of his offspring Offspring I'm asking that Allah takes care of your Offspring so this is one of the greatest Dua if a person dies the most thing that he takes care cares about and worries about is his offspring so if he knows that people would ask Allah that Allah would take care of his offspring instead of him the deceased he would feel much better uh with that inshallah and expand for him in his grave uh how do you expand the grave is this big it's not going to be bigger would it physically no but you have to be careful that this is a transitional period between this life and Hereafter it's called means barrier so it is the barrier between our life and the Hereafter in the grave there isn't enough space to sit down sit down right but we know that the deceased the dead person is being made to sit up by the two angels and he's being questioned so when you you say expand in his grave this is true for the deceased in the life of bar if Allah subhana taala wishes he will expand the grave to that righteous person and he will open a window for him from Paradise and he will get from its fragrance and and and and beautiful air to the extent that he says Allah make the S make the day of judgment now I want to go to my Paradise may Allah make our Graves like this so he says that expand his grave and illuminate it for him it can be as dark as night and it can be lit as if it's daytime I was speaking to my wife couple of days couple of nights ago which is something I rarely do but I was telling her about death and the grave and she was terrified and she said oh I'm afraid of death and I tell her honey what why are you afraid of death she said oh it's dark it's lonely may Allah have mercy on us all this is a grave and you have to go to through this phase whether it's dark or light this depends on your Deeds Good Deeds make it day time makes it as wide as you can see as far as you can see but if you're sinful if you have lots of bad Deeds you have to be afraid so you think and conceive you contemplate on what you want in your grave you have all the right to do what youever you want to do but be certain that whatever you do you are actually filling your grave with it fill it with good deeds W you will have Paradise in your grave fill it with bad Deeds you know what will happen Okay um now the did not mention this but the books of the majority if not all mention this thing that when a person dies the first thing I do is close his eyes the second thing I do is I pull up his lower jaw and tie it to his head with a string or with a rope because when a person dies all the muscles all the joints in the body are loosen up if we bring someone on here and we tell him lie on the uh on the desk on the table and pretend to be dead he cannot he will maybe he dangle his tongue maybe there are people when they die they dangle their tongue you can see the tongues coming out they have no control and all the muscles are gone it's reported that there was a funeral being carried on the necks of men and it passed by a knowledge knowledgeable person so he said this man is not dead get him down so we washed him we shrouded him we're taking to bury him so no he's not dead so they took him down they put the bed down and he brought a whip and he started beating him like crazy and the people say he that person what are you doing and he did not listen to them few minutes later the guy Shook and and woke up and the and and the and he said to them the man was not dead so they told him how do you know he said when you brought the funeral in front of me his feet were erect and when a person dies he the the the the joints are loosened and the muscles are loosened and that's why if you see in uh atrocities and and and in places of war in TV when you see someone's dead killed on the ground you find them lying in a in a in a position that we cannot imitate you find someone's arm Twisted in a way his leg is in a different way which shows you that no no one can be like this except if he is so loose and that's why Scholars say you have to first of all uh uh U one of the signs that you know person is dead that this uh what do you call this torso Temple okay this this place goes inside now this is is is sound and mallah good but if you die it goes it concaves inside why because the muscles and the joints of the jaw are loose and the first thing it goes is his lower jaw is released so part of not scaring people and for the protection of the disease from anything coming inside his stomach insects or whatever you should gently push his upper jaw upward and you tie his jaw to his head with a string or with a rope understood inshallah okay part of the things that you should do when a person dies immediately is to loosen up his joints now remember if he dies Allah forgive him and have mercy on him but I'm I have to wash him I have to take off his clothes I have to shroud him so he has to be sort of flexible because if he's stiff like this I cannot get his arm down down so what do I do I have to loosen his limbs his joints and this is done by coming to his arm and pull it this way and then his shoulder pull it this way so it's not stiff I do the same to the other arm and I do the same to the feet to the leg and to the thigh itself this is what is done usually now remember is this is this Sunnah did I say Hadith no it's not Sunnah an invasion no when it comes to dealing with the deceased we have one two instructions from the prophet Alam wash him with water and Sid lutus that's it okay how how many times uh can we use soap or not uh should the water be cold or or hot can we wash him in the open it has to be in a tent nothing is mentioned wash him so if I take the disease and dip him in the swimming pool and take him out I've washed him is this okay yes it's okay shroud him with you have to make cff shrouding him so one piece two pieces three pieces five pieces the sunah is does not say anything so I just shroud him does it have to be white can it be red can I shroud him in his own clothes so what governs this is one or two hadiths the rest is not an innovation rather it isad from the scholars out of practice because we've been washing the dead for how long say Adam this is something that is very easy to do but we complicate things or we make things difficult or we make it easy so though it is not from the Sunnah but this is out of practice the best way to treat or to handle a dead person so we loosen his joints also it is recommended that we take off his clothes though we're not burying him yet we're not washing him yet but we take off his clothes Scholars say that this is highly recommended because the warmer the body is the closer and faster the Decay would come to it it would become decayed and rotten faster so they take off the clothes so that it would not keep the temperature down and the Sunnah is to cover him with uh uh an ample cover that covers all the body again after that part of the Sunnah is to place him on the bed that we will wash him or what do you call this the desk or whatever you know what I mean there is a a special bed where we usually wash the diseased and it's made of logs aluminium iron whatever though it has opening so that the water and whatever would come uh down freely so they say that once he's dead you should Place him on that but this is not a Sunnah so if I would like to place my uh uh relative on his bed cover him up until the time for of washing this is permissible among uh this these are part of uh the sunnas covering the body with something that uh uh covers the whole body this Hadith we have uh that the prophet himself was covered by a stripped Yemen cloak uh that was drawn over his body uh not stripped that is striped so B it it has to be striped now do we have to cover our decease with this is it part of the Sunnah yes or no or it's an issue of dispute it's an issue of dispute no now this happened with the prophet Alam it so happened that they had this striped cloak uh from Yemen there but this doesn't mean that all deceased people we have to cover them with a striped uh uh cloak if it's one color it's okay if it's red if it's green if it's blue regardless this is not part of the Sunnah to be specific in that type of covering the deceased body and there is a difference between sunnas there are two types of Sunnah Sunnah that is a form of worship if you do it you're rewarded because you believe in the reward and [Music] it's part of the sun of the Prophet Alam and there is a Sunnah that if you do it you're not rewarded but the prophet used to do it okay why am I not rewarded because the prophet did it out of tradition out of human nature out of custom so if you do it this is not something that you rewarded for for example the prophet Alam used to go from one place to the other on the back of a mule he had a mule it's called juljul that's the name of the mule they used to call everything they used to even call their shirts they had camel known as or the horse is know so and so so everything was given a name so if someone Sunday morning rides the mule and goes to work to his office in imats he works there and he's coming on what are you doing I'm doing Sunnah what's wrong with you you don't know the the Hadith the prophet used to go from one place to the other on a mule back is this a Sunnah will I be rewarded yes or no no this is part of the prophet's way of living it has nothing to do with is likewise the prophet used to wear he used to wear the turban now a lot of the brothers when I pray usually I don't wear this in Saudi usually I go uh Tess meaning I don't put anything on my head and you know what I mean so people when when prayer comes in so many places they tell me she you pray and I refrain I don't like to pray and I know people don't like me when I pray without anything on my head they said no no we want you to pray so people come after prayer sh you know that you have to cover your head and the prayer so no you don't have to cover your head so the prophet used to wear a turban yes but he never ever indicated to us that turban orama or kfia or whatever is essential for prayer or it is recommended never so it is not part of the religion the prophet used to wear uh what do you call itra the the apron or uh the lower garment so if I come in Friday wearing what our friends wear it in in in in India or in Indonesia and I would like to make my Friday sermon would you think the people would say that oh this is this is sunah they will pull me down from it most likely why because this is not the C so you have to differentiate whether this is part of the religion or part of the custom of the Prophet the Arabs at the time of the Prophet The Companions used to Plate their hair in braids the Arabs you get someone like Omar or some with long braids now if someone does it today would it be acceptable in part of the Sunnah no they would say that this is he's doing a ponytail what is this this is imitating the kufar so you have to differentiate but between what is part of the dean and what is part of the culture okay now covering the body this is done for all except for someone who died in the state of a person performing pilgrimage or performing The Prophet Alat said about that person who was Ina he was on his camel on the day of ARA What a Beautiful Death yeah it is one of the most beautiful death a person could have in his in the day of on the second month of supplicating he's thrown over his camel's back not only that the camel stumbles on him and kills him so the prophet says to them Alat uh the Hadith wash him with water and Lotus blossoms number one instruction wrap him in his two sheets of cloth but do not put perfumed oil on him nor cover his head the Sheikh says and face for verily Allah will resurrect him on the day of Resurrection making T tbia is saying so in this Hadith the prophet clearly indicates to us that we do not add anything more to him than his two pieces of cloth and we do not cover his head and Hadith and face albani authenticated the insertion of faith meaning that you are not allowed to cover his face other Scholars said no this addition face is not authentic and they verified this by saying why did the prophet forbade them from covering his head because he's in the state ofam if I were in the state ofam can I cover my head no can I cover my face can a cover his face yes if I'm sleeping and I would like to cover my face only this is permissible the instruction is not to wear the Hadith how do we know what to wear and what not to wear when a man came to the prophet said what should a wear the prophet flipped the question and he said a should not wear a turban a shirt a sah pants a cloak with something to BOS that covers the head and the shoes so the prophet told us What Not to Wear so now did he say do not cover your face no he said don't cover your head but covering the face itself this is permissible this is what may Allah have mercy on his soul says that for a it's okay if you're C in especially or in M that is when when you you want to sleep and it's cold you may cover your face but you may not cover your head and likewise for the person who died while in the state ofam he must be uh uh shrouded in his to but not to cover his head the face it's okay to cover and Allah knows best among the things that we should do when someone dies is that we should hasten in his preparation as the prophet said hasten the funeral rights this includes everything that is washing shrouding preparing him for prayer and burial and the more it is quicker and faster and easier the more a good sign that is inshallah uh uh that it's it's a good um death inshallah not generally but mainly speaking among the things that must be done that they should bury the funeral in the town that he died in it and they should not transport him to anywhere else because this opposes the instruction of hasten the funeral rights mother may Allah be pleased with her when a a brother of hers died in abisinia in one of The Valleys They Carried him all the way back to Mecca and she said that I I do not regret anything more than if I had the choice I would have buried him where he died and nawi also said that it is not authentic to transport a dead person from one place to the other he should be buried wherever he dies and this answers a question that came earlier in uh the Q&A session they asked what is the ruling on transporting uh uh um the body the corpse to a different place she albani says that this is completely forbidden other shakes other Scholars say that we have to see if it is part of his will he requested this in his will"
