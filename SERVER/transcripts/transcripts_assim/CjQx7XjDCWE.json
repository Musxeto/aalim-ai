  "transcript": "Okay, Abdel Malik from France Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh First of all, I want to thank you because I learned a lot with you because you know in France the lie about Islam, about the beard, about the age of Aisha, things like this, so I want to thank you a lot, I learned a lot, I prayed five times a day to Majid thanks to you, so thank you. So I want to address the issue of marrying in France, it's almost impossible to get married halal way because even if you're a millionaire, you pray five times a day to Majid, you are good in Islam, most of people get married by talking to women and not by mukabbalah you know, so even if it was possible, the quality of women is not, there's not a lot of good quality women, it's very few, few, few women, they wear full makeup with hijab, I don't know women that pray five times a day, hijab with leather leggings, they claim, they even claim to be non-virgin on video and TikTok, things like this. So what's the question, Abdel Malik? How can I get married? I want to do hijrah inshallah in two years, how can I get married the halal way if it's not possible in France? And you know it's very urgent because Okay, okay, I got your question. So Abdel Malik is asking how to get married in France. First of all, if I ask women to counter what you've said, they say no, all men are useless, they don't work, they live on benefits, they want women to work and they don't care about anything except the hijab and their beard, but they themselves play PlayStation in the house, they are not real men, so each one has their own argument and it's not at all fair. France is a big country and the Muslim community there are one of the largest in Europe, they come from different countries, they come from Algiers, from France, from Tunisia, from Lebanon, from Syria, from Africa, so there are so many many Muslims there in the millions to come and claim they all wear makeup, the women wear, I don't know about the men, the women wear makeup and they don't observe salah, this is totally unacceptable. There are hundreds and thousands of decent families upon Salafiyah, upon Tawheed, upon Islam, women don't leave their homes or mix with the others because of their hijab so that they would not have to compromise it. You need to go to proper Islamic communities, don't go to masjids or Islamic centers where the imams are appointed by the government because they're saying the same rhetoric and they have no Islam to provide you. Go to real masjids and approach real imams, practicing imams, practicing Muslims who are not neither extremist nor liberal, people upon the Qur'an and the Sunnah and they're known and their attitude is known and the way they talk and their kindness and their softness is also known. These people can guide you in a heartbeat to decent women who are interested in getting married."
