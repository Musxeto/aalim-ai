  "transcript": "Say it from India. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Barakatuh. So we know Sheikh that in a masjid where there is a congregational du'a at that moment we have to leave the masjid. Like my question is regarding if like in the mosque, if the mosque is full and I like to be in the forefront rows, like in the first sofa and like in order to go out we have to cross all the people. So like we'll have to cross. Okay I understand your question Sayyid and the answer is if you are in the masjid and you're in the front row or the masjid is packed and they're after the salah engaged in congregational du'a and it would not be possible for you to stand up and cross all the rows to the end and the du'a usually takes like 20 seconds or 30 seconds. There's no problem for you to sit down but you don't join them in saying Ameen. Rather you engage in making your own dhikr until they're over and Allah Azzawajal knows best."
