  "title": "In Wudu, is water just entering the nose sufficient, how far",
  "transcript": "Munib from the US. My question is in Ghusu, is it required that water reach the soft cartilage where the hard bone starts? Is it the minimum requirement or just water entering the nose does the job? We don't have a specific place to determine where the water should reach. In the hadith of Laqeet Ibn Sabur, may Allah be pleased with him, he stated that the Prophet ï·º ordered him to exaggerate in rinsing his mouth, in inhaling water up his nostrils, unless he's fasting. So if you're fasting, don't exaggerate, which means that you just insert the water in your nose. How far? This is up to your preference and estimation. So just entering the water to the nose area would be sufficient, In Sha Allah, and the more you do that and blow your nose with your left hand, that would be even better in following the sunnah. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it In Sha Allah within the following two days or three days and, bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
