  "title": "Will we be rewarded as the companions if we hold on to Islam in these evil times? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I just have a question now because especially during our this is the end times so there's a lot of evil going on so I saw somebody that says that they give glad bitings to the one who didn't see me but believed in me like seven Club Tidings and at the same time like the one who holds this thing in this time will get like the reward of 50 companions yeah so my question is does this mean like we have a chance or like you know to get us a lot of good deeds just like the three favorite generation ad like to get the high status and stuff if we stick to the team and Jessica of course Homer there is a very big chance that we will be rewarded as the companions may Allah be pleased with them but this would not mean that we will be in the same status because we can do a lot of good deeds the quality of the Deeds we're doing are unmatched to the quality of the Deeds of the companions so even if the companions did this much even if we do that this much it would not be the same why the prophet said said in an authentic Hadith do not hurt or harm my companions for if one of you were to give as much as mount uhud in gold for charity that would not be equivalent to a mud from one of them or even half a mood so imagine this much of wheat or barley in charity from them is still greater than Mount Hood of gold from us and that Hadith was by the way addressing Khalid who was a great companion not to say or do anything against who was one of the ten Heaven bound so you can see the difference therefore yes the prophet is giving us the Glad Tidings of no matter what we do it's going to be magnified and multiplied and much much more as if this is the doing of 50 of the companions yet our status is still unmatched compared to the companions because they are way up there but we are hopeful in Allah's generosity uh"
