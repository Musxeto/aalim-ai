  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Uzbekistan. My question is that since last month \nNon-Mahrams were working in our home I had to cover myself every \nday while passing by them and it was a hot summer day. As \nyou know it's somehow difficult to cover oneself in hot weather. Once while talking to my \nhusband on the phone I said   I'm fed up with covering myself in hot weather, after some time I pondered over \nits meaning and I was so scared Did I become Kaafir for saying those words? Did I go against Allah? Immediately repented, I \nrepented and said my Shahada I don't know what to do. After that I have started questioning \nthe validity of my marriage as well. Is it still valid? Jazak Allahu Khairan Okay she's gone. What her question was about \nis a typical scenario of an OCD session that I usually give. People come \nto me with the same problem. Oh Sheikh I did something, I said something, now I'm doubtful whether I left the fold of Islam. So I took my Ghusl, said my Shahada, repented, but then it's escalating, \nis my marriage valid or not? Are my children born out of wedlock or not? Do I inherit my father who died a couple of years \nago and I took his money because I was a Kaafir? And it's like the house of cards that falls down it's a Domino effect. And all of this is nonsense. But these people need counselling. They need someone to open their eyes. First of all, are you a Muslim or not? She said yes I'm Muslim, I was born Muslim My father and mother are Muslims I said okay keep this aside. Your Islam is certain or doubtful? She said no it's certain, I pray five times I love Allah, I read the Quran. This certainty cannot be affected by doubts. So have you exited the fold of Islam \ncertainly and for sure or you're doubtful? She said no i'm doubtful. But Sheikh said... Don't 'but' me. As Queen Elizabeth said 'but \nme no but' or Queen Victoria who I don't know. No this is not what to say, answer in full stop. But don't go on with the procedure of Shaytaan. Stop, your Islam is certain. Doubting whether you exited the \nfold of Islam or not is doubtful The rule of thumb: 'Certainty \nis not affected by doubt' and hence you're still a \nMuslim until proven otherwise give me a proof \"Yeah sheikh but i \nsaid I'm fed up with covering up\". Are you fed up with the ruling of Allah? \"no no no no\" I believe in Hijab I love it, I wear it all the time. Are you fed up with the heat and being compelled \nto wear the Hijab due to the circumstances of Non-Mahram labourers working in your home? Yes Sheikh, so where is the Kufr? Come on, and if you even let's \nhypothetically say committed kufr   and you repented and sought \nforgiveness from Allah. Who said that your marriage is affected and that you have to make a new contract? All of this is from Shaytaan \nmessing up with your head so don't worry about any of this."
