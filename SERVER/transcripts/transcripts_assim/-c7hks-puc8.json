  "transcript": "Adiko Nall from Nigeria. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa'alaikumussalam. I have an English Arabic visual dictionary that has a you know lots of words and vocabularies so I intend giving this you know book as a present to you know Muslim but my question is it has you know different pictures like for instance for sports you know we have women in bikini you know marriages you have different you know pictures where we have it's more or less like a visual dictionary so my question is with this kind of a book where we have you know little little pictures you know that's me you know that may not be so good you know with that you know from an Islamic perspective is it fine for me to gift this? The rule of thumb Adik you know is that we do not share anything haram with others so that we do not gain the sin that they may gain when they watch or use that haram thing. Alhamdulillah there are so many dictionaries that don't have such visual photographs or images and at the end of the day it's not something mandatory this non-muslim is not going to accept Islam because of it you're just hopeful so it's not something of a necessity and therefore I would say that no you should not give it to anyone in order not to gain any sin and Allah Azawajal knows best."
