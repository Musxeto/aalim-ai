  "title": "🆕 He teaches his kids Mothers Day, Birthdays, etc is not from Islam but wife opposes",
  "transcript": "Brother Abdul Hamid from the UK. My question revolves around the celebration in Islam. So I have a brother who is a practicing Muslim and he made it known to his family that he doesn't celebrate, but he tried to teach his kids this part of Islamic teachings. However his wife is resistant to the message and sort of sometimes argue with him. But the point of this question is that the wife celebrated birthday hugely for the children recently and the brother decided not to participate by leaving home. The birthday was done on the Saturday but the brother left home on the Friday with the intention to go back home on the Sunday because he doesn't want to participate and be there. But this is causing a sort of backbiting and slandering towards this brother. He's taking Islam to an extreme and the Prophet did not forbid us from doing that. So the brother is like very confident in what he did. We just need a sort of guidance from people like you to understand better that what he has done, is it right or is it wrong for not participating and collaborating with his wife in this birthday celebration for the kids. Jazakum Allahu Khairan. Wa Jazakum Akhil Kareem. First of all, Allah says in the Quran, يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا قُوْ أَنفُسَكُمْ وَأَهْلِيكُمْ نَارًا O you who believe, protect yourselves and your family, your household, your wives and your children from hellfire. So this is an instruction, an order, an obligation that the guardian of the house, the man, has to protect his womenfolk and children from whatever may lead them to hellfire. Secondly, celebrating such feasts and events is not part of our religion. Actually birthdays were adopted from other nations. It is part of their customs and traditions. And the Prophet had said in the hadith of Abdullah ibn Umar, may Allah be pleased with him and with his father, and whoever shall imitate a people, then he is from among them. This does not relate to wearing a watch or driving a car or using glasses to see. This is related to whatever is considered to be part of their customs, traditions, religion and so forth. And birthdays are not part of our own customs or traditions. This is taken from the non-Muslims. Therefore celebrating them is not permissible, otherwise we would have been celebrating the birthday of the Prophet, which is the most noble of all birthdays, and the birthdays of Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, Ali and the whole nine yards. But this is not part of our religion, therefore celebrating such birthdays, Mother's Day, the Labor Days, Halloween, Easter, Christmas, New Year, Valentine, and the list goes on, all of this is totally prohibited and not permissible. Thirdly, it's a man's job to enforce such conviction and beliefs in his household, in his home. Unfortunately, I've been doing a lot of counselling sessions and I get a lot of brothers like your friend, from the UK and elsewhere, who accepted to be treated as a doormat. I am shocked, sometimes traumatized, when the brother says to me, well my wife did this, my wife did that, and I say, wait, wait, wait, wait. Is your wife earning? She says, no, I'm the breadwinner. Does she chip in, in the bills, in the rent, in the food? I say, no, no, nothing. I give her allowance and I give her a credit card and I give her a car and I bring her a maid, but she does this and that, she refuses to obey me or to listen to me, she kicks me out of the house. Akhi, if you're a wimp, if you don't have a spine, I can't help you. When it comes to halal and haram, we love our women, we love our wives, we are willing to swim oceans and climb mountains and cross deserts for them, but when it comes to disobeying Allah, this is a red line that I'd rather never cross, even if it was for a woman I love. And if she insists, well, another one bites the dust, I could get someone younger, smarter, more religious and much, much, much more beautiful and they're cheaper by the dozen and no disrespect is intended, but this is reality. If you fail to find your purpose in life, in obeying Allah, in implementing Sharia in your life, with diplomacy, with being polite and kind and easygoing, but never, ever allow anyone to cross the red line. Simple as that. Now these brothers are seriously a doormat. Their wives control them, shout at them, slander them, say lies about them and they come to me and say, Sheikh, what should I do? Man up, Akhi, learn how to be a man. I'm not talking about being a tyrant or being abusive. A'udhu Billah. Deal with them like the Prophet used to deal, alayhi salatu wasalam. He was the kindest of all men, but when it came to red lines, he would never compromise his religion. It is an issue of zero tolerance when he comes to the home and he finds curtains that have live portraits of animals. He doesn't enter and you can see anger in his face and mother Aisha says, the most beloved woman to his heart, oh Prophet of Allah, what have I done? I seek Allah's forgiveness. He says, Aisha, don't you know that the owners of these portraits are being tormented in hell? End of story. She takes them down, tears them up, put them in a pillow and that's it. Stuffs pillows with it and that's it. It's torn. It's totally deformed. So this is what you need to do. Explain to them. Show them. But at the end of the day, you're the man of the house. Put your foot down. Who says you have to leave the house? No, I'm not leaving. I'm not an ostrich. Whenever there's danger, I just put my head in a hole in the ground and say, whoops, it's dark. I can't see anything. Everything is fine. No, it's not like this. It's your home. You're paying the bills. They have to comply and obey whatever you say, not you fleeing the battlefield and letting them do whatever they want. So tomorrow they say, we would like to have a party and we would smoke or maybe have some pint of lager every now and then. And you say, okay, I told them and I advised them, they wouldn't listen and I leave the home. Put your foot down. Be a man and act like a man within the boundaries of Sharia and Allah knows best. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
