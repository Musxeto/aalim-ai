  "title": "What is Orientalism? Shaykh Assim al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh zeno dean from the uk my quest it is about orientalism can you explain it please okay i'm not very well versed in such orientalists and they are people from the west with christian background generally speaking or jewish background who study islam history the different sciences and what's happening in the middle east and they put their own views and spices uh over that these are the orientalists or i don't know how they pronounce it and some of them may academically produce something that is beneficial knowingly or unknowingly but the vast majority of them usually put the poison in the food where people consume it not knowing that it's harmful for them and this is why we always say what muhammad ibn may allah have mercy on his soul the religion or the the knowledge that you learn is religion so be careful and aware who you take your religion from if i want to study the sciences of hadith or or tafsir or akida these are all sciences of knowledge that are branches of the religion of islam i cannot learn such sciences from tom dick or harry because i would be taking islam from people who are not reliable or not trustworthy this is why muhammad immisri and the great scholars of the salaf used to highlight not to take your knowledge from people who are unknown their methodology their apida their way of teaching is dubious don't learn from people who keep on changing their colors to the highest bidder stick with those who stick with the quran the sunnah stick with those who are humble down to earth who always point to the great scholars of islam and quote the great scholars of islam not those who simply brush them all off and say that they're men and we are men i could stand and debate anyone i could do this i could do that such arrogance and prejudice you cannot learn islam from such people or from people who speak without knowledge or people who've been exposed hundreds of times for their mistakes and akida in miscoating things so this is why you do not need such orientalists to look into their books or to their work because we have much more bigger fish to fry we have lots and lots more important things on our plates we have the quran from the self we have the apida we have the the firk we have all these beautiful sciences from our respected trustworthy scholars why do we need these guys we don't and it is as simple as that and allah knows best we you"
