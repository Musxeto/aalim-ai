  "transcript": "uh a questioner says some Pakistani Scholars are using the concept of Law of Attraction and saying this is permissible is this correct now I don't have time to research what the law of attraction is because you may have an idea of it that's different than the answer I would find on the net so I would be answering something which you think that is coinciding to what your understanding is therefore when you ask such questions you have to elaborate what do you mean by the law of attraction is it what magnet does to iron or is it love at first sight when you see a woman and you get attracted to or is it that things by their own nature have an effect and impact on other stuff because if it's the latter and that what you do impacts your destiny in the sense that I can change my destiny I can change my fate I can do things that would have an impact on the whole world this has right and wrong if I eat I will not starve hence not die but if I think that I will not die because only because I'm eating and that my eating is my own doing and nothing else changes the fact Allah has nothing to do with it my destiny Etc has nothing no no wait wait wait hold your horses down this is like saying that oh karma is a  what do you mean it means that if you do something it's going to come back to you who said oh this is obvious if you're evil you're going to be punished for it if you're good you're going to get things good coming to you who said yes this is this happens but as Muslims we believe in this life to be temporary stage and that we have the Hereafter to live for eternity so if someone like Hitler who is allegedly had killed in the Holocaust as they claim 6 million and I personally believe that this is way exaggerated what are you going to do this is history and history and historians may lie 6 million is a lot of people if you look at the people in Haj there are 2 million when everything is normal and open and you see as far as you can human beings do you mean to tell me that he killed three times this amount this is impossible yeah okay he killed 6,000 he killed 60,000 in cista in Bosnia herzo under the eyes of the DCH United Nations Soldiers the serbs killed 6,000 and look at their graves and the masses and the what happened you mean to tell me he killed 6 million anyhow I'm not going to go into this because it doesn't have any relevancy to us but Hitler killed so much what happened to him he died he committed suicide at the end of the day or somebody killed him so what is that a sufficient price for killing so many people of course not then where is s saying karma is a no so many righteous people who do did good all of their lives ended up being executed or tortured is this fair is this the Law of Attraction no so the concept of Law of Attraction as I've just explained it is bogus everything is happening because of Allah's pre Destiny when Allah Wills something it happens and generally speaking yes Allah sometimes most of the times the good is rewarded in this life and the Hereafter as well and evil is punished in this life but also stored a great huge punishment in the Hereafter as well but not to say that no I can change my destiny I met once a who Mah was a a a good brother and he said I had cancer and I managed with uh NLP neurological linguistic planning I think I managed through NLP to cure myself I said come again he said yes every day I used to repeat I'm fine I'm good I'm healthy nothing's going to harm me I I can do it I can beat it said Subhan Allah where is the Dua where is the r where is depending on Allah said yeah yeah I I managed to cure myself this is a breach in and it's a very serious thing"
