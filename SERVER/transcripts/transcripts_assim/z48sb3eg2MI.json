  "transcript": "his second question is what's the ruling on hanging a sticker so sometimes we see in cars stickers saying what's the ruling on such stickers i would say that this is permissible especially if it were to be with the intention of giving dawah and calling people to islam however they should be in a proper place not in a low place not in a place where they can be dirt on them or filth coming onto them so putting them on top of your back rear window might be okay because this is always kept clean and away from dirt and allah azzawajal knows best"
