  "transcript": "Hamza says is keeping a beard for door soon nein Islam if we want to talk about Sunnah and define it and fault and define it so the five legislative rulings al accommo Tecla fear mandatory muster hub or recommended permissible makrooh or not recommended and haram these are the five five legislative rulings so when we come to formed and sunnah the definition is fort or worship is the same for and worship are the same identical the definition is what when you do them you reward it and if you do don't do them your sinful you'll be punished Sunnah is a lower degree if you do it you'll be rewarded if you neglect it you will not be sinful so when we come to these definitions and try to apply them to the beard without any doubt got all growing the beard is mandatory it is rajab shaving it is totally prohibited not only in my point of view but also in the point of view of the Hanafi school the Shafi school the medical school and the humble school the four schools of thought which most likely you are definitely the follower of one of them they all agreed that shaving it is totally prohibited so it is mandatory but when we come to look at it in terms of did the Prophet do it definitely the Companions without any doubt so this makes it a Sunnah meaning that the way of the Prophet not that you have the Liberty to go and shave it know it is mandatory but is fetcher prayer for prayer the way of the Prophet yes then this is a Sunnah because the Prophet did it was hatch soon yes because the Prophet did it so everything that the Prophet had done is considered to be Sunnah but whether you will be sinful if you don't do it or not this takes it to another level of definition which is mandatory or fourth and Allah knows best"
