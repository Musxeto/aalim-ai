  "transcript": "Adi Kunal from Nigeria Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh my question is with regards to downloading softwares and books that are normally sold but e-copies actually can be downloaded online and for softwares that can be downloaded online is it allowed to use these softwares or books? If these books or software are copyrighted and you know that the owners of it would not approve of it then this is not permissible for you to download because it's similar to stealing If these are like in PDF files and it's a book that you may read in a library or read elsewhere and you're not sure and the possibility is that it can be an open source and you're not using it to make money rather it's for your own reading like when we read newspapers and when we read certain material found on the internet Inshallah this is permissible because it's found I did not hack the system I did not forge or violate any copyright it's there in front of me and I'm not making money out of it so it's like reading it from a library and Allah knows best Thank you for watching!"
