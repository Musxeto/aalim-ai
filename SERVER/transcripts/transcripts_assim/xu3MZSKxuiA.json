  "transcript": "Oh the smell out of mana Rahim hamdulillahi rabbil aalameen soul allah wa sallim wa barik ala sayyidil awwalin oh what a feeling to be in a muhammadin wa ala aalihi wa sahbihi ajma'in in my bad I like to welcome all other brothers and sisters to inshallah this feature session tonight entitled the big debate life the big debate life inshaallah is going to be between our two esteemed guests we shall introduce shirley shareable sama and share a similar Hakim and the Charla it will be a clean contest inshallah ok so what is the big debate live and why have we chosen to do this one of the main reasons behind this is to help people appreciate the etiquettes behind debating and different amongst one another and often we as Muslims we differ with our fellow brothers and sisters on issue some of them beg some of them small and one of the things that we lack in that we fail in is displaying the correct etiquette the etiquette of differing with one another and sometimes it may be over a legitimate issue it may be over something which one should even differ but either way we should always maintain that correct etiquette and so that's inshallah one of the aims of this session to provide you with a legitimate difference of opinion amongst the scholars but to enable you to also see how people who are learning people have studied Islam how they will differ with one another and the etiquettes that they display when they address one another when they speak to one another and even though at times they may joke with one another they may even take fun out of one another it is all done in a spirit of brotherhood of love a wanting God for one another and so there is one of the main primary objectives from this another of the main primary objectives is so that the people the brothers and sisters can appreciate the depth and the beauty of Islamic knowledge and so sometimes when an issue comes to us we are very quick to dismiss it to say it's right or wrong halal or Haram and we haven't really studied the issue we haven't really looked into the issue we don't really know anything about the issue and so by presenting their cases inshallah the speakers will also show to you and display the depth and beauty of Islamic knowledge how it's not always so simple how there are many verses of the Quran many a hadith of the prophet sallallahu aleyhi will sell them that can be used to support different positions and let the etiquettes that we display in not only providing this knowledge but in receiving this knowledge as well and so we shall there is something which we will seek to do throughout today and so the topic that we've chosen for today's debate as as we mentioned to you is the topic of the niqab and since this theme of the conference this year is about Muslims in the West and the issues that pertain to us living in the West then I'm sure you'll agree that one of the issues that has recently had a lot of media attention is the issue of the niqab this piece of Plus has caused so much problems amongst the Muslims not only in this country but throughout Europe and throughout the rest and so sometimes we're very hot-headed and very emotional when it comes to the issue but we haven't really studied the issue we don't even know what the Islamic perspective is on the issue and so we've chosen the issue of the new table and so insha'Allah both of our esteemed guests hold differing opinions over the niqab as to whether the niqab is rajab whether it's something which is obligatory upon our sisters to wear or whether it is not obligatory upon them to wear and that is what they will be highlighting our two esteemed guests on my right is our own chef chef oboro-sama most of you obviously probably know him for those of you that don't he was born in New Jersey in the United States of America he embraced Islam in 1986 and then he was blessed by Allah subhana WA Ta'ala with being able to go and study at the Islamic University of Medina where he graduated after studying with a number of scholars there such as Shalom or ferrata I wish a happy Assad him and many of the others of the great scholars of Medina at that time since then he's been very active in Dawa being an imam in many massages not only in the States but also in the UK and alhamdulillah we've been honoured and privileged to have him with us including Masjid for the past few years where he's been our regular Habib a lecturer and I'm sure those of you that attended a Masjid we'll know how regular he comes to this question and how much he participates in our activities and events and then in my left we have chef awesome al Hakim was introduced you in the previous session but just for fairness I supposed to be just to be just are going to the weights later but to be just insha'Allah share Hassan Hakim is from Jeddah Saudi Arabia he also graduated from Amalapuram and since then and before then he's been a hottie in Jeddah for many many years the chef also teaches and he has programs on piece TV on and wada TV and he teaches for a number of institutes and he travels all over the world giving Dawa so these are our two esteemed guests Shaham Hakim wanted Iranian and he wanted to know how much each other way but we were able to facilitate that today social law we have to just take take them on merit as they say okay so the format for today's debate inshallah we will be strict with the timings simply because we don't have much time but the timings insha'Allah will be will begin with a five minute introduction from both of our speakers in which they only shall not clarify the etiquettes of differing and the etiquettes that we should display and the true or the correct concept of debating in islam and then after that we'll move into the actual debate on your table they will each have 15 minute sessions 15 minutes each to present their case for whatever position that they're holding they will have 15 minutes and they will take alternate turns after that there will be a 5 minute rebuttal session where they can answer the evidence is brought by their opponent by the other party and they can if you like in a way answer the case that they brought to you as an ishshah' after that if we have time we will take questions from the audience for the questions I would request that you write them down so it will be a lot easier for us to accept them and if you want them addressed to chef abou sama please write on there for shockable sama and likewise for sure are similar Hakim write them down and pass them to my right where the name is sitting towards the right of the stage and if you pass them towards the right inshallah we will then look and we will give them alternate questions if time allows Russia is at 10:43 shun law we need to finish before then but I shall I hope that we will be able to take some questions chef abou sama was very gracious and he allowed she asked him as the guest to have the choice as to whether to go first or second eye shadow asked him chose to go first so inshallah Hassan will begin with a five minute introduction on the etiquettes of different and then inshallah we'll pass it over to chef Abu salmon salam ala rahim hamdulillah salat wa salam ala rasoolillah he wa ala he Goswami humanity before Jehovah bank I do thank Sheikh Abu sama for allowing me to start but this is age before beauty so may Allah bless him for this is Allah hair people now are calling me uncle so and I'm appreciating that the the issue of debating we're not debating because it is not my opinion it's not his we're just simply discussing and in lodging and expanding our knowledge over a topic that a lot of the Muslims and the non-muslims speak about so it would be the least we could do is to learn a little bit where everyone is coming from and the art of debating was there since the beginning of time and the Companions did it not only that even after that the scholars used to do it for example it was well known that I might have been humble may Allah have mercy on his soul and one of the great scholars of his time is happy bin raha or they call it raha way it can be pronounced both depending where you're coming from they once debated over an issue and at the end of the debate Ahmed ibn Hanbal took the stand point and the position of his heart and his heart was convinced of his standpoint so he believed and embraced that simple as that because they came with an open heart although before coming here I was thinking would it be a left hook and a right jab but then I said no no no I have to come with an open heart he's bigger he's stronger and this is for the sake of Allah so let's make it for the sake of Allah Shafi may Allah be pleased with him and have mercy on his soul Yunus Assad Assad afee he says that I debated with him once at night and we departed in the following morning he came to me he took my hand and said Yunus can it be that we differ in a point of an opinion yet still be brothers in Islam he said I've never seen anyone smarter than a Schaffer II meaning that he is masha'Allah even if you differ with someone in opinion you can still be friends not like we see today you differ with someone you don't even give him Salam you don't pray behind him you don't even consider him anything but the scum of the earth no proper Muslims they treat allah azza wajal and those who differ with us we can give them an excuse here or there I'm giving you two minutes of my time well Allahu Alem solo salam ala muhammad bin Laden lava Serato Salam I don't know soothing that in my seven minutes insha'Allah want to make four points first of all top of the list and present in my side of the equation the side of those people who say that then the table is not wagging in this issue other than this issue the goal and the objective should never be for any of us to push away and to reject them to deny the truth when it comes to you ayat I'm not here to reject an ayat that the opponent or the other side has this is from the kabocha and this will lead a person to destruction and is against what we believe in to be a salafiyyah women are Adan victory Fenella whom are ishutin Blanca anyone who turns away from the vicar of Allah the Delille the proof comes to him he turns away from it he's going to have a tough life that's the first point second point is that issues like this these issues of knowledge the knowledge based for those people who have been endowed and blessed with levels of knowledge where they're not just regular people who blindly follow but they have some ability to look into the books they're not real Emma then these issues are determined not by tuck lead blindly following what the sheriff said where the mother HAP says what your culture says what your message says what your community says it's not based upon what's going on in the environment necessarily because everyone is doing this then that necessitates that the ruling is that or the other no it's not based upon issues like that and it's definitely not based upon a person's desires it's based upon people making wholehearted efforts doing their level best to try to arrive at the truth and then they make their decisions point number three is the statement of the imam of allah sunnah the imam of Alisoun and imam ahmed rahim allahu tada in the art of different the etiquettes of different he said rahim allahu taala lion buddy milf aqui and yak millon nice ah dammit Abby he it is not acceptable it is not acceptable for the person who's a fee a scholar a person it's not acceptable acceptable for him to compel and force the people to take his position his opinion and this is what we see unfortunately it has happened with many of the people even people claim a connection to a set of fear people fighting and boycotting and pronouncing rulings on people simply because I don't agree with what your share says and I want to say that since embracing the Deen and coming to the truth of the way of Allen hadith and Hum do not since that day we still stand firm like it who like it hate hate it we don't blindly follow your share we're going to say some of the Imams so you want to is some of the names today and imam ahmed el Imam Shafi you want to hear the names of mountains of knowledge we don't blindly follow them that's indicative of the fact that share takes the position and I take a position so what do you think is the case when we come down where there are great scholars we connect ourselves to and connect you to but we are allowed to disagree with them we don't have to take their opinion fourthly and finally I'm dealing with the side of what I believe what I believe that the niqab is not wedge it and although that's what I'm here to put forth to you and do you expose you to it it does not mean that I believe in the Sephora Vanessa that this position means the niqab is not from Islam or I'm encouraging the women not to weigh in the club and it is a vote for people to describe our scholars who take this position is Volm oppressive if the scholar takes that position or person takes that position and you take the other position and then you come and say you're calling to lewdness so for the record here in this fourth point for the record when some of those ignorant people from the muslims and i use that description very sparingly with a big question mark it's only because of the men had a palace sunnah that we are even Mutara did them with the huffin those people are the monkey rule mooc they make the in car of the hijab they said a few months ago that the niqab was not even from allah slab the niqab is from the figment of the imagination of the Taliban the border pop is from the Arabs and they oppressed the women with it has no position Islam we came to this member right here and we used the Delisle that the ship Assam and Hakim is going to use the show then it copies from al-islam so if you didn't know was from Islam remain silent and don't make those crazy statements because the niqab is from Ali's lon but is it watch it and is the ladies sinning for not wearing it here lies the essence of what we're here to discuss in sha allah wa tada so as he mentioned with Imam Shafie again and when he said to the great scholar Eunice Rahim my say as well the whale Imam and Schaffer he said and he used to say I never debated a person except that I hoped that the truth was with him because I had the ability Shafi say to take the truth if it comes from him but I don't know does he have the ability to take the truth when it comes from me we're going to see because we're going to slay him ok certain love it that's why I'm sitting in the middle ok so not that I do much good to me for anyway so shall I move ahead for the introduction I think both speakers took less than the allocated time which Allah is a good indication for the rest of the evening shall I will pass it over to chef as when I came for 15 minutes to present his case certainly sooner of man Rahim hamdulillah salat wa salam ala rasoolillah he wa ali was happy he won many Tara who dahua by do before I start my 15 minutes we have to come with an open heart not open ears and we have to decide not by putting in the back of my mind that my wife wears it or does not we would like to know what Allah Azza WA JAL wants first of all we have to agree and I believe that we all agree that truth at the side of Allah is one it does not multiply so you cannot say that on this issue one is halal or permissible or not permissible at the side of Allah it is 1 now scholars may differ they make may may make the effort and they may be rewarded once if they make a mistake but Allah will reward them twice if they were correct in their effort for you as an individual it's not for you to choose you have to follow and if you look at the issue is it mandatory or not you have a lot of different schools of thought going in some say it is some say it isn't and whenever we have a problem Allah tells us refers back to the Quran to the Sunnah not to the scholars not to different schools of thought not of interpretation of Tom Dick or Harry and handle a they don't interpret any of these things therefore when we look at the issue of hijab and nabob we look at it from this standpoint it's an issue of difference among scholars let's go to the basics to the Quran and Sunnah we all agree that the mothers of the believers may Allah be pleased with them the wives of the Prophet Allah thought of Salaam it is a must that they cover their faces there is no dispute among any Muslim on this topic we also mean at the Shahan I agree that covering is better than uncovering we I believe in hope that we also agree that whenever there is the fear of fitna temptation lowering of the opposite sex that it becomes mandatory and this is what all the scholars stated so if you're an ugly woman or an old woman we're not discussing you here and all the sisters are going to cover now therefore we start with a lie Atul Muhammad the thirteen verses of the Quran because Allah tells us in Surat and Imran that there are verses of the Quran that are certain and they are the fundamentals of the book al-kitab and there are verses of the Quran that are dubious or uncertain so those who follow the dubious or uncertain verses are on great danger and it's a well-known fact that every single issue in Islam there is a difference among scholars so if I hold to something that is possible and refute and reject what it is certain then we have a problem so from these points that I've mentioned to you let's go to the first ayah the first ayah is in surat inaud verse 20 of chapter 24 verse 31 Allah says to the believers the believing women what translates to and tell the believing women to lower their gaze and protect your private parts and count with me not to show off their adornment except only that which is apparent this is number one and to draw their veils all over you behind 'no and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands fathers husbands fathers and the husbands fathers in their sons their husbands sons etc to the end of the chapter of the verse though there is another evidence in it but here Allah is mentioning two types of adornments the one the first one in arabic allah says voila you've dina zina tahuna illa ma fahara mina and he did not use the arabic word of Haruna Mahara is by accident of Hara is on purpose so Allah in the first adornment the first zina allah says do not show except something that happens without your intention in the second adornment allah says do not show your adornment except to your father's your husband fathers your husband your sons your Neph use your it goes on so there Allah did not repeat it for no reason now some would say ahi Xena was interpreted by some scholars by some companions such as if not as Mallory pleased with him as the face and the hand the eyeliners and the ring so this means that this is Xena well if it must wrote me all of you pleased with him said no it is the clothes she the clothes she wear and this is apparent because the first one you cannot hide your clothes even if you wear a value an outer cloak it's still going to be Xena and by chance by wind by lifting your leg by extending your arm some of your inner garment your your dress would appear and it is Xena so Allah says that this is something you cannot conceal not only that the word Xena in the Quran you all remember or recite the ayah where Allah says who do Zeenat a calm and cool a Masjid ya bani adam' color wash revelatory for hulu genetic um and kali masjid what is the meaning of this the Xena if we are saying that Allah is addressing the sons of Adam to take their adornment which is the eye lining and the ring whenever they go to the message whenever that we pray no they used to make Tawaf they used to go to the Masjid of al-haram nude and Allah told them to conceal that with an outer garment to conceal their hour which means that the Xena is something out than the body itself so I cannot say that my biceps is Xena because this is my body but I can say that my throat my shirt is a Xena it's something external and Allah would not tell you to show something external intentionally therefore the face and the hand is not mentioned here at the end of the ayah Allah says in the Quran and let them not stamp their feet so as to reveal what they hide of their adornment women used to wear things in their ankles like horses when they make a trickling noise and with horses okay you know there is a horse but when a woman does this you start imagining things so a lot Oldham this sound lures people lures men so don't even go there now I don't know if the sound is more attractive than the face of a beautiful woman or not I'll not go into there yet the second ayah I'd like to address is verse 53 from surat al-ahzab where allah addresses the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam firstly he addresses the believers not to enter the houses of the prophet alayhi salatu salam and to go uninvited and at the very end Allah says subhana WA Ta'ala and when you ask the mothers of the believers the wives of the Prophet s Sam and when you ask for anything you want from them ask them from behind the screen the purpose the reason Allah says that is purer for your hearts and for their hearts your heart addressing the Companions abu bakr umar uthman re their hearts addressing the wives of the prophet is awesome Aisha have saju area may muna umm Salama Zainab etc now if you look at this the other school of thought says that this is only for the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and his wives and we say this is debatable because whenever there is an instruction to the Prophet area salatu salam do we say that this is for the prophet or its general when one is being addressed this is for the whole Ummah when Allah says ya you Hannah be all you prophet of Allah worship Allah and don't associate others with him because if you do then you are doomed and you will be among the losers does anyone there and say no no this is for the profit erase a lot of Sarah definitely not and if you look at the following on the previous verses of the Quran you will find that it is addressing the wives of the Prophet Allah salatu salam and also the women of this nation and that is why allah says to them do not speak softly so those who have illness in their hearts would not be lured by you or be tempted by you does anyone dare to say that this is only for the wives of the Prophet Allah so Salam but your wife and mine can speak softly so that they would nor others definitely not and you can go on and on speaking but the time does not permit and this topic needs more than 15 minutes but I'm not going to whine about it also Allah the Almighty says in surat al-ahzab as well verse 59 yeah are you by the way the veil for the move the wives of the Prophet are a salat wa salam some say that the previous verse that i've mentioned this is the only indication and it's only for them so they agree with us that this verse mandated the veil upon the mothers of the believers we agree about with them on this but we differ whether it's only for them or for the rest the following verse from the same surah verse 59 allah azzawajal says o prophet sallallaahu are you seldom tell your wives count with me and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks that is veils this is the translation of the man who translated the this verse but it is not the veils clothes Gulabi be hidden to draw their cloaks all over their bodies the justification of allah that will be better that they should be known so as not to be harmed or her last and Allah to the end of the verse so Allah is given an instruction to whom is this instruction to three wives of the Prophet his daughters soul Allah Selim and old women what do we believe in seeing it we believe that to draw down as its States to draw their cloaks all over their bodies what is a cloak worn on its on your body so to draw down what does it mean it's already on my head so scholars say that has even a bad said in one of his narrations that was authenticated by a number of scholars he said that it is like this showing only one eye or two eyes meaning that should cover the face and the justification was that at the time of the revelation of this ayah the slaves female slaves used to go out with their face showing and also where the free women so those bad men those thugs would see them and harass them so allah azza wajal instructed them to cover their faces so that they would be identified as being free and not to be harassed and roman hapa may allah be pleased with him at his time he used to hit slave women wherever they cover and say do not look like free women you should not cover your faces unveil your face but for free women they must cover their faces so the justification again is given here so that they would not be harassed and how would we identify a woman by her face and Malaya harem we are you kidding me anyhow logically speaking when you get want to get married you ask about the waist size of your what future wife or her foot size or what's the best thing that puts you on or turns you off well about among other things the most important thing is the face so they tell you that she has the best physique and the the most beautiful skin a touch in color and so on but she has a crooked nose a nose and a mouth on one side of her head and an eye on the other side no one would marry such a person you look for the beauty of the face when you see a woman even if she is in complete veil a completely job but uncovering her face the gestures the laughter the sadness everything happens in the face if she only bites her lower lip just saying this makes you just saying it imagine seeing it imagine seeing that on the streets yeah this is more graphic but I'll stop here I have a lot of evidences to go through but unfortunately at the time inshallah the chairman would be fair with my opponent also lost in the work had to be in Honda Circle O'Hara like function awesome and I apologize having to stop him when he just got to the exciting part okay so inshallah now we will have two minutes from Chicago Sam hamdulillah was slapped with sin am anniversary lap I need you brothers and sisters here to pay attention in to latch on to the last description in the last statement of our brother and share her father with all awesome and Hakeem when he put forward where is the beauty of the woman and he emphasized that if she would to bite her lip you don't want to know what size her shoe and other than that where is her beauty and that is an indisputable fact so the first Delille that I bring to your attention that clearly indicates in shows that the niqab is not wedge it is the authentic hadith has been collected by Muslim the authority about the Lucknow baths and la be pleased with him and his father in this tremendous hadith the nabi alaysalam was performing the hajj and it was the day of an hour the end of the Hajj when the people are not in Iran it was at the end of his life so it was after the ayat of hijab had been revealed the Nabi on this auspicious illustrious day he was with Abdul agna Bass's brother and father who was known amongst the Companions as being a man who was extremely extraordinarily handsome the people were coming to the Nabi Saleh lot he was said while he was on the ride and beasts and photo was behind him a lady came this hadith inciting Muslim said she is from the hami tribe she had a question God also Allah she proceeded to ask a question as she put a question forward abdullah dinar basses brother i will follow a be not bad Ravi Allah and him he said I was looking at the lady I was impressed with her beauty he told his brother I was impressed with a beauty I was looking at her and she was looking at me and the prophets are a lot of some upon notice and this he looked and he saw what was happening so he did what was right up upon him nothing could be said or done that was wrong and he witnessed it except that he had to stop it it was magic upon him Majid because if he remained silent and meant that that thing was okay if he gave his tacit approval and that's part of the Sunnah the swimming is what he did the Sun is what he said the Sun is what was then in his presence and he was quiet he smiled he gave his test of the proof oh it was wedge of upon him to say don't do that because if you remain silent about anything that's from the Dean that thing is okay he saw further looking at her he saw her looking at photo he physically took the chin of phuddle and turned it photo said I looked again the Prophet turnt it he said I looked again he said I turned it he said I looked again the Prophet turned it he said and I continued to do it his father and I bad Segarra so la la after the incident why did you do that to the neck of your cousin he said I saw a young man and I saw a young lady for Lemon a shape on Allen Hema and I was not secure that shaitaan would not get inside of the mix that's the first Delisle that the lady's beauty was what attracted and fatherly been a bath someone may come and say it didn't say that our face was exposed and that's true it didn't say that but as a  awesome said where is the beauty in the lady is it plausible is it imaginable that he was looking at her body in that type of a way he was looking at that woman that he mentioned that lady who had an extraordinary level of German and Huson that's the first Delisle the second allele honey is the fact that this issue right here the hadith of father Abbas how would the nubby subtle body would sell him allow this to take place with so many people around this beautiful woman is out like that and he doesn't say something hey lady hey lady put the veil on hey lady what you're doing is not acceptable on the day of the Hajj how Hodja gets destroyed his heart just gets destroyed how is that something that's possible again and being fair and just no one can come and say this hadith clearly says her face was exposed but it's the mushroom of the hadith is one of the strongest proof so the people who say that the niqab is not waging another example honey is the fact that and another authentic hadith of the nebesa variety was sending them our mother aisha radi allahu and her she said in this authentic hadith that was collected by imam abu dawood and other than him that her sister s mat the other daughter of abu bakr siddiq may allah be pleased with them all she appeared in front of the nibby sallallahu said them with a fold that was very caught it wasn't covering the way it should have been covering it wasn't covering up her body the way that it should have been islamically like the ayat of hijab has suggested the nebesa wasallam came and aisha saw in his face on his face that he wasn't happy which goes to show that the woman the wife she has to have the ferocity ability to see what's going on what makes her husband upset and he has to have that same thing being able to read the unspoken word to hear what's not being said aisha said made my mother my father be sacrificed shadow so allah what is it that makes you upset he said ya Aisha if a woman becomes of age if she a starts to have her period Akram o Kamala or she starts to develop ummah to islam even if she doesn't have a period but she's developing physically if a woman becomes of age nothing should be seen of her except her face in her hands in all fairness and honesty this hadith by itself is dice dive there are number of problems in the chain of narration there is a number of problems in the chain of narration no doubt is DYFS but it has multiple chains of narrations and the early mother hadith in this issue in this regard that's why we're proud to be from the people I love hadith because the fifth of the hadith is with Allah hadith and the ability to determine is a hadith we cannot weakest with al-hadith whereas people who give a lot of emphasis to fit only they rely on weak hadith and we don't see the permissibility of using weak hadith in a can in a key the info dialog mal no was authentic that's it so with the existence of many narrations that support this this weak hadith reaches the level the level of being authentic acceptable as an imam at the heavy said as a lumen and be haughty said and that is what mm a little Benny he put forward and unfortunately people believe that a little Benny was the first person who took this position there are many scholars who took this position to the point where the three met haps the three met hands Hanafi Shafi'i Maliki the Medhat is that the niqab is not wedged and with the humbly mother have as well there is a narration that mmm Ahmed said is not magic as even one flick said in his book a dab of Sharia even who pood Amma said in that tremendous hum buddy book but that doesn't mean that is the truth was not the truth this is just to make it nice with the issue that's all the format I hid the majority of the real Emma the Jim horde will love other male the opinion that is not legit but that doesn't make it wager but not that the majority said or the minority didn't say no because from each Medhat there are scholars who took this side and scholars who took the other side so the point here is other scholars said that this hadith of Ayesha is authentic and from them as I mentioned al-bayhaqi and an imam at the heavy so this hadith is clear in the issue the authentic hadith etna be said to aisha radi allow an however subtle of wali he was seldom yeah Ayesha the woman becomes of age by later she becomes Bali nothing should be seen of her except her face and her hands in addition to that honey was shows that the niqab is not watching the Haditha photo living abasa was impressed with the beauty of that lady to the point that he kept looking at her face I saw a young man who's handsome I saw a young lady who's also beautiful and I wasn't I was afraid the shape on fitnah the hadith of Aisha number three and they're two hadith similar to this that shows it the same incident the Nabi Saleh lighting Selim performed their eighth prayer their eighth prayer could have been before the hijab was revealed could have been asked I love Adam could have been this could've in that so no one can stand with strength and say it was definitely vase it was definitely that could have been this could have been that he performed their eighth pray he prayed the salat first and then he gave the hook but he told the men to do the right thing he told them to feel a lot and so forth and so on and then he left with Bilal and he was leaning on be loud a bloodbath ruddy Allah and who said that they went to the women which is the swing on the day of their aid to address the women he went to the women and he told those women hey you women you have to give sadaqa you have to give sadaqa they said that a lady in the middle of the sitting and the Assembly of the women who had discoloration in her chin in her cheeks her face her cheeks were discolored with some blackness something was in her face that lady spoke out why didn't he say some other lady because she's the one who spoke out she said Yara so Allah he said give sadaqa because I see you people who are the majority of the occupants of the Hellfire the ladies say why is that yato so Allah he told us a little of what he was something because you women you women you are not appreciative you you complain a lot you complain a lot you were complaining and your not appreciative for what's being done for you by your husbands and so forth and so on so the point here and the Delille here is the fact that the lady's face was discolored and they had the ability to identify that they had the ability to identify that particular issue if her face was covered how would we know it's possible as possible before the hijab it's possible that is what the Hassan mentioned that she was slave girl maybe she was a slave girl that's possible but there is a principle in a Sulha that principle says in that what are the lists email button a list applaud if a possibility presents itself then using it as a Delisle shouldn't be done meaning you cannot emphatically stand on that issue they kind of equalize and neutralize each other I can't say this is a clear Delisle because I can't prove that that lady wasn't a slave and she doesn't have to wear niqab if she's not a slave and he can't prove that she was asleep I can't prove that this hadith was before the hijab after the hijab was revealed you can't prove better what so it kind of neutralizes each other which forces us to go back to the clear proofs of Abdul odnarb ass of even clearer than that the hadith of aisha radi allahu anhu which is a must in the issue allahu taala told the nevi so i Solomon described him to us in the prominent the naked vicar v2 bailina Lina's man newsela alayhim we revealed to you this poor on so that you can explain what was revealed to them the nuddy is the explain of the whole religion and he explained those I act of the Quran that were mentioned already and I go back to them now in my closing statement he explained them a shaykh hassan beginning the talk by talking about the ayat that i come at the clear ones there the mother of the book hello I had every new Muslim knows what that means I feel like he shook is there any doubt about Allah everyone knows what that means Alif LAAM Meem we don't know what that means there are other ayat we don't know what that mean but the clear ayat unlike the Bible unlike the taurah the injeel in the torah you can't understand those books quran is not like that most of it is easy to understand so when a beast of a lot is seldom explained those other two ayat that we mentioned the is three that he used already he explained them when he told I assure of the Allah on her about the hijab of the woman nothing should be seen don't allow your zina to be presented in front of the people accept what must necessarily appear you're facing your hands so some of the scholars like Abdullah bina bass he said it meant she can't show anything or like Abdul rubbing in my school she can't show anything but scholars took the other position from the Companions so that hadith I think is the one that really sets the issue straight but again in having the Amana and elmia being fearing just there is Kalam in the hadith from the Rena marvelous lamb but I'm of the opinion of those people believe it the hadith is authentic Allahu Allah is Allen Adham psychological persona the love we've had like 15 minutes or more less 15 minutes from both speakers presenting their cases in Charlevoix you'll do now is that a 5 minute rebuttal for Machado from each side so she has him back office still on handle no salatu salam ala rasulillah i do thank about Chamizal ahead for being upfront and frank regarding the issues that he had made because i don't have to go through them he apologized and he for the sake of Allah so Jill said the truth that the first evidence of the hasta Mia the woman at hatch there's no evidence of whether she's strong evidence whether she was veiled or unveiled but then he went on to the second hadith of Aisha and a smack going in and she threw clothes in front of the Prophet allosaurus Allah her brother-in-law but he's the Prophet imagine a woman who is 18 or 20 years old going to the Prophet in such clothing - she is the sadhika and the daughter of a cid deep yet is Allah here again he said that this is a weak hadith though authenticated by some of the scholars it is good that he said that it was reported in a Buddha wood and you know that I would is one of the six books of hadith Sunan I be there would and I would I would himself graded this hadith as weak he himself the one who reported it said that this is not an authentic hadith and finally the third hadith Zala here about the woman who had discolored cheeks he also said that there is no evidence in this because she might have been a slave woman she might have been an old woman which reminded me of a verse I did not recite the Salah here it's in Surat a note now listen to this beautiful verse Allah says and as for women past childbearing Jonnie 60 or 70 years of age and over who do not expect wedlock they do by no chance no one in his sane mind would propose to them Allah says it is no sin on them if they discard their clothing in such a way as not and in such a way as not to show their adornment we were back to the issue a dormant so it is permissible for them to take off the face veil providing they don't put any paintings any makeups any adornment and then Allah says but to retain that there is but to refrain is better for them and allah is all-hearer all-knower so this is a clear indication that even women who are not interested than men are not interested in them it is permissible to show their faces but without putting any adornment and without attracting people and it's better for them to cover and this is exactly what half soften Syrian one of the greatest abilene said and explained when people came to her to visit and she took and she failed herself and they said you are among those who Allah mentioned in the Quran by saying and for women past childbearing and who do not accept wedlock so why do you cover she didn't tell them because covering is ok uncle edik not they did not tell her in the big why do you cover in the first place they told her that okay you have the permission by Allah because you're old to uncover so why do you cover she said please read the the remaining of the ayah they said but to refrain is better for them she said this is what I am doing and this is how she covered her face so I said have time how much time done I'm seeing 11:15 nothing well anyhow the issue here is look at the verses that I have recited to"
