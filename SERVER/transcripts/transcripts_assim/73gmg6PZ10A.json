  "transcript": "a Russa says if a person is murdered will he be considered as a shaheed shahid means a martyr the one murdered was a practicing Muslim and was killed while he was praying it is without any doubt that the real martyr is the one who dies on the battlefield when Muslims are fighting with the disbelievers the enemies of Islam but the Prophet told the salicin that there are other types of martyrs who do not die in or on the battlefield among them is the person who dies under a falling building or in a burning house or who dies by drowning or by being affected by the plague or by stomach illness or a woman dies while she's giving birth etc and also among those who are considered to be martyrs those who died defending their wealth someone wants to take your money and you fight him and he kills you someone wants to attack your family attack your religion and you defending yourself these people who died defending themselves are considered to be martyrs scholars say even those who are assassinated or killed whether their knowing it or not so if someone was killed unjustly someone comes from behind and stabs him and kills him he is a martyr someone who in prisons another until he dies he is a martyr anyone who has been treated unfairly and was killed as a consequence he is considered to be martyred insha Allah so this brother if he was praying and he was killed while praying insha Allah he this is a good death and he is a martyr"
