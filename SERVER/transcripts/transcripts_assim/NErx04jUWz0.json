  "transcript": "SJ says my mother tells me that if we drop the Quran by mistake we must give the kafara of the quran's weight in salt or sugar is this authentic this is not authentic I most likely this was fabricated by a grocery shop owner who was not selling a lot of groceries so he thought of a trick or an innovation where he could sell salt or sugar there is nothing in Islam to do if you drop the Quran of course nobody does this intentionally so if it's dropped unintentionally the vast majority of Muslims do this Innovation they pick it up they kiss it and they put their forehead on it and they call it the the the uh the minor or the small prostration and this is an inovation kissing the Quran is not part of the Sunnah yes out of respect some Scholars said that this is permissible but it is not from from the Sunnah at all IB T says nothing was reported to be kissable from abstract or from solids except the black stone so this is not part of the Sunnah for people to do and we should avoid such Innovations"
