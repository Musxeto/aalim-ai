  "transcript": "We'll take a few more and then Insha Allah we'll call it a night. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh. I wanted to ask you, when we finish the Qur'an in Ramadan, could we dedicate that Khatmah to a person who is deceased in the family? This is an issue of dispute among scholars and the most authentic opinion, and this is the opinion of Sheikh Ibn Baz and Ibn Uthaymeen and the greatest scholars of Islam, is that you yourself don't know if Allah accepted this Khatmah from you or not. So how would you grant the reward to it? The things that we can give to the deceased are limited. Number one, making Dua. So any type of Dua, Allahumma expand his grave, fill it with light and fragrances of Jannah. Oh Allah forgive him. Oh Allah ease his stay. This is accepted. Number two, charity. You see someone in need, you give them a thousand Dirham, and say, this is on behalf of my deceased father or uncle or cousin or whomever. This is accepted. Number three, Umrah. So I've done gazillion Umrah in my time, I go and make Umrah, this time for my mom. I said, Labbayk Allahumma Umratan an Ummi. And I make the Tawaf, the Sa'i and I shave my head and that's it. Number four, Hajj. And I do the same if I performed Hajj on myself, or I give money to someone who've done Hajj before, would like to go this year. I give him money to make Hajj and I tell him, make it on behalf of my grandfather. This is all accepted and legitimate. Insha'Allah Sheikh, JazakAllah khayran for that."
