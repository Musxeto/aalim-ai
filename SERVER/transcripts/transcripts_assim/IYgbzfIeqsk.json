  "title": "Can a traveler be an Imam for residents & Must traveler pray full behind resident Imam Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "and likewise a traveler can be an imam and lead a residing person the traveler is gonna shorten his prayer by default but the resident after the second raka is over and the Imam gives it a shaho at the salaam that resident has to stand up and pray his third and fourth raka and the opposite is true if the Imam is a resident in this case a traveler praying behind him must complete the prayers and pray full for raka even if the traveler misses three rokkes like I'm a traveler and I come into a message and the Imam who's a resident is in the third or or in the fourth raka so I see Allah Akbar and I join me in the fourth raka after Salam shouldn't I only pray one raka because I'm a traveler the answer is no you have to pray three full records because your Imam was a resident and this was attributed to our beloved master even our best may Allah be pleased with him and with his father"
