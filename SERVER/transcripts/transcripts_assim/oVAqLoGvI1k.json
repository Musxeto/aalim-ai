  "transcript": "he's asking about the famous game the snake and the ladder and to those who do not know it it's a board game where you have the drawing of a ladder taking you to different levels and there's a snake intermingle between the ladder and if you happen to step on it you have to go to the beginning or to a lower level and you lose the levels you have progressed in a game as a game it's nice its firm it's it's beautiful it's enjoyable however the problem is that it involves dice and there is an authentic hadith where the Prophet said alayhi salatu was-salam it is best for a person to dip his hand in the blood of a swine of pork we know that pork is haram and it is it is nut juice rather than to play with dice and this means that it is prohibited to use dice some scholars said that and this is problematic but unfortunately not all scholars say the right thing all the time they are human and they are not infallible they may make mistakes so some of these scholars said that it's not not logical to prohibit playing with dice so most likely the prohibition is for gambling but if i gamble through playing cards whether it's poker or to a blackjack or whatever and it does not involve any dice in the process does this mean gambling is hard no so too claimed that dice is haram because of gambling this is not true it is haram because the prophet told is haram so what can we do well I don't know if you can play it with other means but dice is essential and hence it is not permissible you can and likewise with monopoly with other board games that involve but gammon is also a pretty widely spread in the Arab world and it uses dice and it's prohibited assalam you can use any other games that do not involve dice such as Oh No for example Oh No seems fine there are no drawings it's a nice game it has a lot of hit-and-run tactics in it so it seems to be permissible and I don't know what's available in the market but I presume that there are many more and Allah knows best"
