  "transcript": "Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala protecting myself. Ameen and you as well. Ameen yes I would like to know the last time for morning and evening adhkaar because unfortunately sometimes I wake up later so I would like to I would like to know the last time we can do the morning and evening adhkaar. There is no such thing as last time for someone who oversleeps. So if you oversleep and wake up at 10 o'clock in the morning you can say it. If you wake up at 11 o'clock in the morning you can say it. There's no problem in that. Ideally speaking it should be before Dhuhr time. Ideally speaking and for evening or it should be before Isha time or some say before midnight time. So whether it starts after Asr or starts after sunset it's an issue of dispute but either way it should be before Isha time or before the first third of the night or the middle of the night and the likes. It's an issue of dispute but it doesn't matter as long as you've said it the moment you woke up or the moment you remembered. Alhamdulillah you're safe."
