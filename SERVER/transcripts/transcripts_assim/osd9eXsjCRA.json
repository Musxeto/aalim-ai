  "title": "What to do if sexually harassed, touched in public places (masjid haram etc)? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so he says that there's a sister who performed hajj and after coming from hajj now she claims that she has been harassed and um somebody touched her inappropriately and she did not tell her husband she did not tell anyone after she came back to canada she asks what should i have done well anyone in such a condition would have shouted and raised their voice and made a scene out of it someone gropes you someone touches you inappropriately whether you're in haram whether you're in the masjid whether you are in the highest court this is not an excuse you have to shout turn back and scold that person make a scene out of it so everyone recognizes what he had done but coming after a day or two or even an hour let alone after months and bringing it up this has no value because there's no one to talk about and there's no way of verifying what had happened so yes i would advise anyone who gets harassed like this to make a scene on the spot shout and call people to help you and acknowledge who the assailant is"
