  "transcript": "Julie from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh If we say Subhanallah 10 times and then make dua, the dua gets accepted. Not true. This is not true. Who told you this? No, no, no, no. There's nothing as such. I don't know where you got this Julie. Saying Subhanallah 10 times has nothing to do with your dua becoming accepted. Whether it's between Adhan and Iqamah or in the last third of the night or in Sujood. No, it's not related to your dua acceptance and any hadith in such manner or relating to such a topic is not authentic."
