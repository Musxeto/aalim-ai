  "transcript": "you mentioned you touched upon the the rights that the husband has over his wife yes yes we went over all of the year so maybe the share could touch I mean obviously you know to go into great detail but ever you could touch on the on the opposite side of the of the questions they say soon and Rahim Hamed Allah help banana mean Salaam Salaam Baalak Allen Muhammad al-amin nabina muhammad in wine early he also happy edge main Zack mala here for having me and it's always nice to be back on Hoda TV they say it takes two to tango Islamic Lee it has to be through in a sheet and it has to be with your wife but it's true you cannot do it on your own so we always focus on the things that matter to us most and this causes imbalance in a marriage as a husband I go to my wife and I say you have to obey me you have to do this you have to do that and neglect what I have to do so I always take care of my rights and neglect my obligations and this is why we have lots of divorces we have lots of trouble trouble that's why a lot of the women complain about their husbands because they're not being given their rights and the Prophet is awesome told us exactly what to do and what not to do and he was a role model so any fair person who would go and look at how the Prophet is also I'm used to deal with his wives and follow his footsteps he's in the clear what are the rights of the wife over a husband the basic rights and this is the bare minimum is that you feed her is that you clothe her is that you provide her with the shelter is that you take care of her religious duties and protect her and preserve her from anything that can harm her which means unlike what a lot of the brothers do you do not force her to work and I've seen this personally when the husband sits back home playing with his playstation or xbox and he lives off benefits of course and he from a Kaffir government huh he lives off the benefits and he bashes the government day and night over notice that and he usually has two or three wives in the same you know the same thing unannounced who or who all unannounced and they're all claiming that their husbands have left there as we touch upon it and I hope he licking me think that they claim that the husbands have left them and they have to go and claim that they're a single mother my husband's that are done a runner as they say well he'd like you said why he just goes from house to house on his xbox and and then he forces the wife to work not only that to give him alimony to pay for the rent to pay for the school to pay for the groceries and this is totally against Islam and when it comes from someone who claims to be practicing this is an insult to the Muslims to Islam and to everything that we know of so the basic rights for a woman is to be the queen of the house she's the one who served she's the one who is given money and being protected and it's the man's job to work his backside off trying to make a living and trying to provide for her among the basic rights now I'm not talking about what is the top I'm talking about the bare minimum he is not to strike her to beat her it's not permissible for me he's not even permitted to insult her or to say that your face is as ugly as a monkey's face or whatever like a lot of people say this is totally prohibited in Islam but people are not doing this they keep on insulting their wives when it comes to beauty look how fat you are look how ugly you are you untidy and this is against the prophets teachings he told us not to do this and he told us not to abandon a wife in the house so if I'm having a fight with my wife a disagreement I don't like her response to me her argument her nagging so I leave the house for a week this is totally prohibited it's it's not a hotel that you come whenever you wish this is your house this is your family you're obliged to come and sit even if you don't like it be a man act like a man and talk to things over so these are the basic rights of course you build up from there upwards and you add to that kindness generosity courage looking the other way which is one of the things that the Muslims must implement in their lives if they want to have a good marriage not only that if they want to have good relationship with others it's called an advocate telephone and it is the top of moral conduct and excellent character which is literally looking the other way she said something she did something look the other way pretend you did not see it not because you cannot react or respond but because you have a good character and people make mistakes and you look the other way pretending nothing happened"
