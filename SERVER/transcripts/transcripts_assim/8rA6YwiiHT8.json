  "title": "Having Two Jummah Friday Prayers in the SAME Masjid Twice, those who disagree",
  "transcript": "[Music] i saw in another video of yours that said that two or more friday periods cannot be conducted in the same masjid so after learning this rule i told this to my relative but he said that islam is not strict on these matters because it is a necessity due to social distancing the pandemic and the fact that they are less massaged in the area i did not fully agree with him but but i'm a bit confused and sheikh can you please describe what it what is a necessity in islam and in which cases we are allowed to use it okay i will answer inshallah from australia he says i've heard that you say it is not permissible to pray jumuah in the same masjid twice and this is not my fatwa i don't give fatwas from my own this is the fatwa of the grand committee of ifta in saudi arabia and they say that jumu'ah is designed to gather the muslims in one place so it is not permissible to have two jumwas where two imams give two separate khutbah this divides the ummah so either have one jummah and you can pray outside of the masjid in extensions and whatever or if this is not possible then you pray afterwards if there is no place so he says his friend or relative doesn't approve of that he says this is not logical i with all due respect can't help it if your relative is a scholar or memorizes the quran or have completed reading the sunnah or have done degrees in fundamentals of or studied one school of thought the whole thing from cover to cover maybe but if your relative with all due respect can't even speak arabic and he wants to give a fatwa because the it's logical i can't help him i don't shoot from the hip this is what the scholars said about this issue on alano's best you"
