  "transcript": "I have a question you know I I'm an expert I'm an Indian and I work here in Saudi Arabia and alhamdulillah I've been keeping the beard you know which is kind of my wife likes me to have a very big beard long be and always SES like you know grow as long as possible and alhamdulillah but I work in a corporate and I go for I know visit a lot of customers no one says anything but can I trim and if keeping a long beard is is it mandatory um if if so why people here in Saudi they all trim and they don't have all long beards okay first of all as Muslims we do not take a country or a people as a role model because they are fallible they make mistakes you can't come and say why do the country of so and so smoke or have nightclubs they're Muslims why do their women don't cover who cares they're not messengers of Allah and this is why Allah has sent us the Quran and the Sunnah of the Prophet Alam and the favorite three generations so that we can judge things by and Implement in our lives now when it comes to the issue of the beard there are two respected opinions one is that we must leave the beard as it is not trim it not shave it not do anything but honor it by brushing it calming it perfuming it maybe sometimes put some creams on on it no problem in that and the other opinion is that it's permissible to take whatever exceeds a fist this is a fist so you take from the bottom of your fist not from the top as most of the people do no you take whatever exceeds the bottom of your fist and this was reported by abdah Omar Abu and others but the vast majority of companions did not touch it or trim it the vast majority of Scholars say that has to be kept according to the Hadith of the Prophet where he instructed us not to grow it some people put medication that would enhance their beard growth and this is not required Allah did not say to you grow it Allah has said to you leave it honor it Let It Go all of these just to let your beard go so this is the most authentic opinion now in some cases where a person's beard is really long and it jeopardizes his safety such as an employee in a factory where are machines and conveyor belts and it might be caught in one of the machines or a person who's driving and his beard comes and covers his face or sometimes as we've SE I've seen this with some brothers when he eats it's too long that it comes within the food and he eats his own hair it might be funny but it's irritating in this case I personally am inclined to say that yes due to the hardship you can trim your beard to a length that would make it possible for you to live normally and Allah Knows Best"
