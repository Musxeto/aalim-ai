  "transcript": "they would say the truth unfortunately us Muslims we're compelled by religion not to say a lie the Prophet that is awesome saw a woman once telling her child come come take this because you know when we want to grab our children we just pretend that we want to give them something wrong now I got ya well the prophet saw her and said what do you want to give him she opened her hand he said a date o prophet of allah and there was a date said by Allah if there wasn't anything in your hand it would have been recorded as a lie at the last sight now imagine how many lies do we say not our children to our bosses or subordinates to our neighbors at work to the police and it becomes like a habit people lying to their wives this shows you the split is there and no one thinks of Islam as a priority it's always at the back seat if not in the trunk like two minutes and I wanted to bring this specific topic up what about what we call in America I don't know if they have it in the Muslim world but I think they do we call them ramadan Muslims you know in Ramadan we go to the masjid and pray and we see these faces we've not seen our whole life where did they come from you know suddenly for the days of aid for example the mission is pouring out into the streets these people that you've never seen them seen them before and i mean we're talking about giving islam or absolute best what do you have to say about them about that situation unfortunately we do have a lot of those seasonal worshipers and we have to be a little bit careful because we don't want them to abandon worshiping Allah for good it said ok you don't want me to see me wrong with that I'm not going to come home with as well that we would like we have to draw the line here now most of the Muslims are worshiping Allah by tradition not by belief that's why lots of the reverts are stronger in belief and commitment to Islam than the actual born Muslims unfortunately for example there are lots of muscle who are women who are wearing the hijab covering up from head to toe but they're not doing it for the sake of Allah and the evidence behind this or that backs this up is that the minute they get on a plane traveling to the west to England to Europe after five or ten minutes of take off they go to the restrooms and they come back you know what is this yeah old trousers and blouses and makeup and you know for sure that these are not practicing Muslims and they are closer to be sinful if not hypocrites in Islam is not this way at all you'd find a Muslim in Mecca the same attitude as the brother said the same behavior the same a commitment to Islam if he's in Siberia or in Alaska or in the u.s. it's the same thing he would not for example compromise we have a problem in compromising a lot of our beliefs because they are do not have commitment or we not simply true believers will just it's our fathers and forefathers practice so I think you've managed to get to the heart of the problem then when we're looking at Muslims not putting the best foot forward for Islam it's because of this issue of compromise and maybe we're just following your tradition and we're not really thinking about what we believe does that seem to be the the consists mostly yes okay very good we're our studio audience now and see if they have any questions for our to guess go ahead brother I'd like to ask you the same is the Sheikh a question at the very beginning said that every one of us in the society have a rule to give a slam his best and you said also you should do this role perfectly the question is how can we do this rule perfectly did I say that you said it okay okay well you have to perfect whatever you do and regardless of what you're doing if you're a janitor you have to clean the floor pretty well and don't look down at generators because it's an honest job if you a CEO of a company you have to make sure that everything goes as scheduled and as clockwork perfect now for us as Muslims we as well have to perfect our tasks whether it is forms of worship so when you pray you don't pray in a couple of minutes instead you you give the prayer it's do you have to pray on time you don't pray at home you pray in the message when you pray you don't wear the worst clothes you have you put perfume so you have to perfect your prayer when you make Dawa you have to propagate Islam in the best fashion because as brother amar said to that man who looked at the man and the woman and said fear Allah now he gave the good advice but was it the perfect advice it wasn't because it caused the man to backfire and commit a major sin if not notifying his Islam so by saying that you have to perfect whatever you do meaning you have to put your heart into it Islam if you give it some of you it will give you nothing if you give it all of you it will give you something Islam isn't in is not in need of us you have to be very careful now Islam doesn't need us it's the religion of Allah whenever you look around you and you see that calamities befall upon our brothers in the Muslim world they are oppressed they are being executed killed their lands is being confiscated and taken unjustly from them you think that why is happening well it's not because we have to work for the sake of the people we have to work for our sake so Islam doesn't need us Allah will have this religion prevailing over all and this is mentioned in black and white in the Quran you have to firmly believe this but now where is my role would I be part of this change part of this effort or would I be with the spectator just watching some nice show no Islam wants you to be part of it you Islam wants you to make the difference and to give everything within your capability to support this cause very good do we have another question of course we do go ahead every one of us wants to give Islam his best but the prophet mohammed al ano salam said that our hearts got our hearts got rusty just like steel and iron how can we get rid of this rusty hearts and refresh our faith well if you continued the hadith the Prophet gave us the remedy he said that the heart crushed then you have to remember Allah so the Prophet is giving us the answer so if you want to remove this rust and if you'd like to revive your heart you have to remember Allah social and remembering Allah is not simply seeing subhanAllah hem de la la but by the tongue while your heart is singing a song it has to go you know a heart and soul with this and this includes all types of a vicar will that include for example Salah and reciting the Quran and saying good deeds giving advice and what we're doing now this is also thicker because we're remembering a line is all for the sake of allah so jealous so it's a wide perspective very good"
