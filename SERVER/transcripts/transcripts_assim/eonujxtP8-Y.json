  "title": "Attending Mixed Gatherings in which people free mix assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Like in so many Muslim countries, \nunfortunately, it is free mixing.   So the men and the women, they're all in one \nhall. Each one of them is wearing the best of   attire and clothes. The men are wearing \ntheir three-piece suits or the [ ] and   the women are, you know, full-fledged \nmake-up. This is totally haram,   whether it's a wedding or it's a Aqiqah or \nit's a gathering or it's homecoming or it's   a school reunion. All of this is haram in Islam \nbecause when you see such things in front of you,   if you claim that you don't have any desire \nfor the opposite gender, either you're gay   or you have a problem with your hormones. And \nthe third option is you're a blatant liar.   So this is natural. It's human nature that \nwe are attracted to the opposite sex. This   is how Allah created us, and this is why Allah \ngoverned the relationship between men and women.   He didn't say go to your temples or to \nyour houses of worship or to your churches   and never ever interact. No, you want to interact? \nYou can marry. You can interact with your mahram.   You're sister, you daughter, your mother, your \naunt. But to interact with non-mahram, it's   putting fuel next to fire and hoping that \nnothing ignites and this is not possible."
