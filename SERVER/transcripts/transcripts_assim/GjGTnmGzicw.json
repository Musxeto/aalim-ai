  "title": "We post daily reminders on our social media, is this an innovation? #islam #islamic assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "like uh in our Facebook group we give reminders like find it's time to prayor WE Post like the time has start prayor as it is good to pray as early as possible we do this five times a day we also give other reminders like the da in comment WE Post like read 100 times we do this every day is this Innovation reminding people is a good thing to do and if you do it occasionally that is fine but out of experience this may work for a week top two weeks after that when people get the reminder they're neglecting it and ignoring it because it pops up every single time and they're bored and fed up with it so they don't pay attention to it so I would highly recommend that you very reminding people so that they won't get bored of it in the Hadith Abdullah may Allah be pleased with him and so did Abbas and the companions used to every now and then remind the people not every single day and they would demand more and they would say to them no we don't want to bore you you will become bored when you hear reminders every single day it would make you numb because these reminders are like a whip someone is fogging you after the 10th whip you don't feel the pain you become numb so I would highly advise you not to purposely do it on regular basis so that people would not become numb is it an innovation reminding people inshallah is not an innovation I wouldn't do it myself and I would not recommend it but I hope if someone is benefiting and they're using it to remind them for for certain then inshallah there's no problem in that"
