  "transcript": "Ahnaf from Bangladesh, what's the \ndifference between Quran, hadith Qudsi and   the normal sunnah duas? [Sheikh:] okay \nI would answer inshallah Ahnaf enough   from Bangladesh what's the difference \nbetween Quran, Hadith al Qudsi and the sunnah? Quran is Allah's words that \nare not created that Allah spoke with and   the meaning and the letters are totally from \nAllah Azza Wa Jal and you cannot pray except   with the Quran. Al hadith al Qudsi is an issue of \ndispute among scholars. The most authentic is that   the words and the meaning are from \nAllah but they are not as miraculous   and challenging as the Quran. Allah has challenged \npeople to produce like the Quran or one surah even   so it's challenging and its miraculous al-hadith \nal Qudsi is not like that but it is from Allah   Azza Wa Jal and also you cannot read it in the \nQuran you cannot read it in the salat you can   read it when you are in the major ritual impurity \nwithout a problem, Quran you cannot. Sunnah the   meaning and the revelation is from Allah Azza \nWa Jal because the Prophet doesn't talk ﷺ except   with Allah's approval and the wording is from \nthe Prophet himself sallallahu alaihi wasallam."
