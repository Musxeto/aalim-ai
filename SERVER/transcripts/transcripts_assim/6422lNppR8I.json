  "transcript": "question from india he says he's got ocd in purification and was was in reciting the fatiha and knowing whether it is the second or the third so is this because of shaytan the answer is yes can we ignore it if it's frequent the answer is yes now he said in the beginning that he consulted the psychiatrist and he had counseling session from experience the best way to counter attack these whispers and the ocd is knowledge all the counseling sessions i do i tell my people to watch the series of um and it's free on youtube and may allah reward peace tv and dr zakir for allowing it and sponsoring it it's free you can listen to it once you listen to it and learn from it all your doubts will go because all of what you're asking about can be checked and cleared in a counseling session or if you sit with a student of knowledge in or a scholar who would just communicate with you and you tell him well i have these problems in making wudhu he will identify that this is shaytan this is shaytan this is shaytan stop yes but i'm afraid maybe i didn't your fear is not part of islam throw it in the dustbin you're sure you've washed it yeah but maybe maybe put it in the dustbin maybe you were born out of wedlock maybe your father did not marry your mother how can you say such a thing so maybe so no there's no doubt in that alhamdulillah you weren't present when you were born were you how do you know everybody says this it's knowledge it comes back to knowledge whether it's a written document marriage contract whether it's the people testifying whether everybody knows about it likewise when it comes to tahara when it comes to salat when it comes to fatiha when you know that this is the work of shaytan and you're still adhering to it all what you need is to communicate with a scholar or a student of knowledge or someone who's expert in these things and in 10 minutes it's all gone with the grace of allah you"
