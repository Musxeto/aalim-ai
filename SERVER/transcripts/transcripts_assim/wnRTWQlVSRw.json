  "transcript": "awesome scent not me that is a question saying lately I've been thinking about this religion is always blamed for things that happen in the world with the amount of hate religion gets I honestly feel scared to admit that I'm a Muslim because people always pick on religion going as far to call it the root of all evil it almost makes me want to leave my religion well I he awesome bye this is problematic this is sad when a Muslim does not have the confidence the honor the pride of proclaiming that he is a Muslim Allah says in the Quran women accent : there is no one better in rhetoric than this person who calls others to Islam to Allah and does righteous deeds and proclaims I am among the Muslims there's no one better than him and you are telling me that you want to leave your religion because of what because of what is displayed in front of you of the media you remind me of the race horses that they put blinders I think I don't know what they call by their sides so that only thing they see is what you want them to see what you see in the media is blatant lie a handful of terrorists that were made cultivated and presented to the world by the Western intelligence by the Kafar themselves so that they would tarnish the reputation of Islam a handful of such terrorists make you doubt your religion think of your religion to be the root of all evil what kind of man says is this any Tom Dick or Harry who comes on the media and says that Islam is this Islam is that it's the root of all evil this is what they themselves called fake news sad this is horrible look around you on this globe 1.7 billion Muslims if their religion instructed them to annihilate and to kill others no one would be alive believe me our religion is a religion of peace with honor and pride a religion of strength without weakness a religion of honor without any arrogance this is a religion it's a religion of peace but there's no weakness in it but what is happening now that you're brainwashed and you think that is my religion true or not you my friend are ignorant you have not read the Quran you have not read the Sunnah of the Prophet as or his biography you do not know anything of Islam except that it is attached to your passport under the category of religion Islam Allah knows if you pray or not because how is it possible for someone to doubt his own religion and to be afraid of it this is not the way of the believer at all certainty is an essential condition of la ilaha illa llah saying it without conviction and certainty like it seems that you are doing does not avail does not help you at all in this life or in the day of judgment okay I advise you to recite the Quran more and more I advise you to walk with your head up high being proud of Allah's religion that he selected you from among all others to be Muslim look at the numbers and you will be confident of your religion the fastest growing the most peaceful the only religion on earth that its scriptures the sacred holy scriptures are in the same language that it was revealed in and it is still spoken by hundreds of millions of Muslims as their native language they understand it without the need of monks or priests to interpret it to them and it is in their chest and written in books no other religion has this luxury you have the Bible no original manuscript Aramaic Hebrew Latin and then to contemporary languages such as English and during the process so many things change and alter alter not the Quran it's the same thing so be confident of your religion your religion is a religion of peace without weakness it is a religion of strength without violence it is a religion of pride without arrogance"
