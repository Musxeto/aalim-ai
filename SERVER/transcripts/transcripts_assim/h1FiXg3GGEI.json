  "transcript": "Abu Muhammad from the Emirates Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh, my friend told me secret and he want me to swear by Allah, I will not tell anybody and I swear for him but after a while he came to me and told me you can't tell anybody Do I have to make kaffar if I tell anybody after that for my yameen or no? As long as you took an oath by Allah not to tell anyone If you were to tell anyone, yes, you have to give kaffara and this is sinful because breaking the trust of someone who entrusted you with a secret is haram, it's a major sin Right Sheikh, but he came after, before I told anybody, I didn't tell anybody My friend later came and told me you can't tell anybody, not big deal, no problem So in that time if I told I have to make kaffara, he give me the permission The same person, the same friend It seems that you have made an oath and you have to stick to the oath, whether he permits you or not Okay, okay, Jazakumullah khairan Sheikh Jazakumullah khairan"
