  "title": "Taweez with Quran & Hanging Quran on walls (even in Makkah & Medina) assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "four some people recite the quran and give the reward to the dead and this is an innovation the living are more deserving of benefiting from the quran than the dead some of them even use the quran to make amulets and talismans and tawis and this is a form of shirk it's not permissible others honor the quran so they claim by hanging it on the walls as a form of decoration and sometimes you enter a house with so many verses and you ask the individual what is this and i said i don't know can you memorize any did you ever read any he said no likewise in masjids so many decorations verses of the quran nobody pays attention to it and allah did not reveal the quran to be a form of decoration even on the curtains of the kaaba you find beautiful calligraphy but you can't read it you don't know what's written it's so complicated even for us arabs and this is not what quran was revealed to and unfortunately those who recite it who read it they simply put it and keep it in their glove compartment in the car or under the pillow as a form of protection again this is not permissible and this is a form of abandoning what the quran was truly revealed for you"
