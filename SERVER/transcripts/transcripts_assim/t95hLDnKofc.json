  "transcript": "Aafia from Saudi Arabia Sheikh, first of all Alhamdulillah, Barakallahu feekum that I have studied and benefited from your playlist of Arbaeen-An-Nawabiya, Tawhid, Aqidah and large-juz sub-zir. So my basic question is like I have understood the large-juz sub-zir but I wanted to understand more about Quran. So can I take Tafsir Ibn Kathir book English and study self alone? Can I do self-study with that? Okay, first of all it is permissible to self-study. There's nothing wrong in that. What is wrong is to take whatever you study for granted because your understanding might be a little bit off track but in 85% 90% of what you read you understand it as it is which is good. It is wrong for people to say no no no don't study Tafsir, don't study Fiqh, don't read books of Aqidah on your own because you'll be misguided. This is not true. You have to do your due diligence by reading such books but at the same time in parallel to that whenever you find something that is ambiguous or not clear you should check it out with the scholars or the students of knowledge so that they would clarify it to you so that you ensure that what sticks in your head is the most authentic opinion of scholars and I hope this answers your question. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it that's good for you. If you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
