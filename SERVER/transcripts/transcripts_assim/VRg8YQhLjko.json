  "title": "Can we go to a restaurant that has music and free mixing in it? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Anjem says is it permissible to go to restaurants which are mixed and have music playing almost all restaurants have these nowadays first of all Anjem as far as mixing there's no mixing in restaurants the concept of mixing is different to what you are thinking because what you're describing as mixing can be found in airplanes so does this mean I cannot travel because I'm in the same airplane where where there are none muharram women it goes with buses public transportations trains it even goes to harem when I'm making tow off there are so many women around me so it's this mixing that says no there's no mixing here because this is not planned for we're not communicating we're not chit-chatting we're not exchanging gifts or anything else so there is no free mixing in a restaurant they sit on their table I sit on my table and that is it I don't have any mixing with them as far as music is concerned we've mentioned this before all types of music is Haram however if you go to non-muslim countries and unfortunately even to Muslim countries if you go to Egypt if you go to Malaysia or Indonesia or anywhere else you will hear music 24/7 even when you are in the elevators of your hotel room there is music and elevator if you go to the restaurant there is music if you go to the gym there's music if you ride in the car with the taxi there's music the malls there's music everywhere you go to a particular shop in the shop there is different type of music so unfortunate people are hooked to music their being addicted to it they can't live without it and you can see that this clearly if a person's driving and all of a sudden his radios off and he cannot hear any type of music he will feel nervous disoriented because he's not listening to what he's used to 24/7 so this is a dilemma some people say I don't need to go to restaurants I can sit and eat home I can buy delivery from restaurants and I eat in the comfort of my hotel room or my room or my house without being exposed to Haram music and this is a respected view other people's other people say that there is a difference between hearing and listening so if you hear music and do not pay attention to it and it's unintentional and you have no hand in it then you're not sinful while if you listen to it if you pay attention and enjoy it or you request it or you don't demand it being turned off then you're sinful and this is what Chiklis Lanvin taymiyah has made this distinction the difference between a Samar and an esteem are hearing and listening hearing is something that is random I'm in my car I'm at a traffic light someone next to me in his car is blowing the music to full blast so I have to listen no but it reaches my ears and I hear it and I'm not paying attention to it I'm not sinful for that this is different than someone tuning the radio or listening to a track that has music and he is enjoying it he is liking what he hears and listens to then this one is for a sinful person so this is up to you and to your preference if you want to go to such a restaurant I personally prefer that people do not go to such restaurants if you are a name is Lim country and you go before entering ahi please turn it off so sorry we can't there are other customers Salam alaikum and you leave if you are in a non-muslim country most likely they will be serving ham and wine and it's not befitting for the likes of you to be in such a place and Allah Azza WA JAL knows best"
