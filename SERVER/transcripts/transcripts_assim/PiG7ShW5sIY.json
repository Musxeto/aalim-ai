  "title": "Can we listen to men singing (nasheed) without musical instruments? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "buddha from saudi arabia he asks a question that he asked on the website and i said to him i'm going to answer it again the prophet alaihis prohibited us to listen to women sing and this is proven from the sunnah grown-up women their voice is prohibited to be used in singing or in speaking softly and maybe this is why the call centers usually put and appoint women because men's voices are not as attractive and as soothing as some women not all so women singing is haram accompanied by musical instruments or not it doesn't make any difference so his question is what about if men sing without musical instruments of course if it's without musical instruments we have no problem because musical instruments are prohibited on their own so it is not necessary to be accompanied by lyrics or someone singing listening to beethoven mozart uh um or or whatever alone is hana without any singing or lyrics musical instruments is prohibited in islam and this is according to the quran hadith and the four schools of thought we don't have to reinvent the wheel what's haram is haram what about men singing well men singing without musical instruments is called nasheed and nasheed in islam is poetry sung with a melody's voice so if this poetry is constructive and has good words and meanings then it's if it is destructive and had vulgar words and bad meanings it's haram so if a man comes and sings a song praising jihad praising allah praising being generous and courageous praising being good to your parents all of this is okay there's no problem in that the prophet saw whenever he traveled there was a man called anjasha and he used to lead the camels that the mothers of the believers used to ride so in order to make the camel's stride faster he used to sing them poetry but sometimes the tempo was so fast that the camels ran a little bit quickly so the prophet used to say to him and take it easy with the delicate cargo you are leading because such striding and in a fast pace would probably harm the ladies so this was an indication that anja shah was doing what is known as which is saying poetry with a melodious tone and allah knows best"
