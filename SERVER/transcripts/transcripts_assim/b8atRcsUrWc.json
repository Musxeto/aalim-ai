  "transcript": "[Music] all [Music] Allah the prophet started by signing treaties with those who are surrounding him he started signing treaties with the Jews he signed treaties with the uh Pagan tribes around Medina simply a treaty of understanding that we do not attack you and you do not attack us we do not assist others in attacking you and you also do the same you practice your religion and we practice ours the prophet alham fought many B all these battles were at the sight of Allah and that is why it's mentioned in Surah 4:76 Allah says those who believe fight in the cause of Allah and those who reject Faith fight in the cause of evil whatever Islam calls for you would always find it on the positive side no one would say well Islam wants to take your money take your wealth Islam wants to uh uh take your life lives Islam wants to bring Justice to humanity and this is exactly what was manifested in the battles of the Prophet s in Islam we do have rules of engagement in the sense that we are not allowed to kill elderly we are not allowed to kill civilians we're not allowed to kill women or children and in one incident the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam passed by a woman who was in the battlefield who was killed so he was outraged and he said who dared to kill this woman who should not have been killed women are not to be killed in Battlefield so they've explained to him that she was carrying arms against them so she was killed in selfdefense if they did not kill her she would have killed some of the Muslims so this was acceptable and also Al forbidden in Islam to kill discriminately so throwing a bomb at civilians in order to kill one soldier is not acceptable and that is why we understand and and every Muslim worldwide we we we we have like what 1 uh uh 5 62 billion Muslims worldwide every single child of them know that it is forbidden for us to kill children and women and that is why when someone says that well Muslims are responsible for the 9/11 or for the 77 and I don't know what our more numbers are they're bringing maybe two fives or whatever whatever something of of of a terrorist activity uh takes place they claim and blame the Muslims this is UN Islamic we don't have to go out of the way to to say that whoever did this that has nothing to relate to Islam because it's in black and white we do not kill discriminately we do not attack children or women it's forbidden for us to demolish or attack houses or places of worship churches and synagogues and so on it's forbidden for us to kill priests and and monks and so on this is in black and white so to say or to claim that Islam is responsible for terrorist attacks this is unacceptable our Prophet told usam not to do do these things so whoever disobeys him he's not considered to be a practicing Muslim also part of the Rules of Engagement in Islam is that you do not torture you do not mutilate uh uh um prisoners so if you have a a person who died in the battlefield a non-muslim you cannot come and chop off his ear or nose just of sort of Mutilation this is unacceptable in [Music] Islam Allah Allah Allah Allah Allah"
