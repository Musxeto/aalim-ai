  "transcript": "Yunus from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Wassalam I asked earlier, I'm not quite sure what to do and I didn't say one very important thing So, please let me finish Your urine splashed over the ground And it dried, you didn't see where it was, okay I walked over there with wet feet sometimes And I said, okay, I don't know whether I hit the impure spots Now, the thing is, if I now pour water over there, more and more and more, until everything is unchanged and mixed Do I have a problem? Or must I also wash every place I walked over with wet feet and other places? And if you ask yourself, why did this imbecile didn't wash it right away? Now, the thing is, last week I got beaten with a stick on my head And it bled really badly I can't just pour a bucket of water at home on the ground anytime without consequences I hope you get me Shukran Akhi, you are putting yourself in a corner And I will try not to be rude I'll try not to be harsh But sometimes, not sometimes, a lot of the times OCD people must not be addressed in a soft manner Because it only expands So, you have to be harsh with them And you have to slap them so that they wake up This is what shaitan is doing to you Now, you say there are splashes of urine on the ground Why didn't you remove it? Well, last week I did put a bucket and I was beaten by a stick by my parents Why would your parents beat you with a stick until you bleed? Because you've done this a gazillion times And it's not working You have a problem mentally Now, if we assume that there are dried impurities on the ground Avoid the place where it took place Oh, I don't know where it is, Sheikh Estimate and try to guess Well, it's here Most likely it's here Now, I'm not sure It can't be here, it can't be here But I believe to the best of my ability, this is the area Avoid walking on it Well, Sheikh, I did walk on it, see? You're the one who's doing this to yourself And then you want an answer? What can I do? I'm not a magician I cannot help you in this Now, if you said, well, I walked on different places with wet feet If you're not certain 100% that you stepped on the najasa And it transferred to your wet feet And your wet feet took it elsewhere Then the default that it is pure How could it be, Sheikh? Because you are not certain If we start doubting things Then the doorknob, then the light switches Then my comb, which I use to comb my hair Then my pen, then my blouse, then my t-shirt, then my mug Everything, there's possibility of not being pure Not only that, your mom, who you kiss and hug every morning Yes, she beats you with a stick until you bleed She might be not your mahram How is this possible, Sheikh? She might have adopted you when you were young When you were a child She might not be your biological mother No, Sheikh, I know she's my biological mother Do you have a DNA test? No Were you there when you were born? Did you witness it? No, but everybody says, Sheikh So, is it certainty? Again, look how shaytan messes up with your head You open the door to shaytan You invite him in You say to him, mess up with my head It's a whole playground for you Take your time I'm willing to respond Allah says in chapter 14, surah Ibrahim Verse number 22 Allah has promised you Who's saying this? Shaytan Allah's telling us about when the people of hell Complain and blame shaytan You are the reason that we're here Shaytan says, he stands up to give an oration To give a khutbah He says, I did not do anything Allah promised you the truth Fulfilled his promise I promised you and I betrayed you I had no control over you Except to call you And you responded and answered me So, don't blame me Rather, blame yourselves I'm not going to benefit you You're not going to benefit me He states clearly, I had no control over you If he had no control over us Then, what are we doing? We're missing our own lives Not only that We're making the lives of our parents Of our siblings, of our neighbor As miserable as it can be Everybody around us Look, look, look, look He's a practicing Muslim Look what Islam is doing to him Messing up with his head Everything is najis One drop of urine He thinks that, oh, this is acid The moment it falls on a thing It burns it It burns the floor It burns the ceiling It burns the mattresses It spreads This is coronavirus, akhi This is mouth and foot disease This is not a drop of urine You are exaggerating things So, Selevi, this is life This is your fault, not mine This is your fault, not mine"
