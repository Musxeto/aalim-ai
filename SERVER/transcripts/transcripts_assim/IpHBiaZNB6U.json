  "title": "Can we pray for Jannah for parents who committed Shirk? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Mumma says can we pray for Jenna for parents who committed shirk this is problematic because this question to be answered we have to first of all get something out of the way which is your parents are dead correct yes they used to commit ship correct yes do you have any evidence that they knew that this was ship did any Island Scholar a Muslim judge labeled them as mushrik no in this case we assume that they died on Islam because in order to label someone as a mushrik we have to fulfill the conditions and remove any obstacles preventing us from doing this otherwise I asthma Hakeem would go and label the vast majority of all Muslims as mushrik because they go to dargahs they ask peers they may deal in magic and many many of them don't know that this is Harlem so it's not easy just simply to say ah I remember my uncle and he used to say when a bee he used to swear by the Prophet as a son so this is this means he is mushrik and hence I am NOT going to ask Allah for forgiveness no this is accusing someone condemned endemic him being the judge issuing the verdict being the executioner at the same time this is this doesn't work like this so if a person committed shirk while he was not knowing that it was we would not label him as a machine if a person abandoned Salah died without crane but not knowing that this is an act of Cofer and no one has told him this or established that he knew yet he still was defined and insisted on it it would not be labeled as cover but let's assume that someone is a blatant Muslim he knows that going to graves and worshipping them and sacrificing for them his ship we showed him the evidence from the Quran and the Sunnah he acknowledged but he said this is what my pet forefathers used to do and I don't care about your Islam this is my Islam and we tried our level best and he died upon the artena of Sheikh after fulfilling the conditions and preventing any obstacles in this case you cannot ask Allah for forgiveness for him Allah says in Surat October what translates to it is not for the Prophet Solomon and those who had believed it's not up to them to ask forgiveness for the polytheists even if they were relatives after it has become clear to them that they are companions of hellfire once a person is labeled as a mushrik or a kafir and a companion of hellfire you cannot pray funeral prayer over him you cannot ask Allah for forgiveness for him"
