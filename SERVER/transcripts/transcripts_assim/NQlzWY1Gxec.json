  "transcript": "it's hard from india so can you please advise on what kind of questions should we ask the potential spouse during the marriage interview process to understand if she's practicing girl and it's suitable can you please share a few examples okay from india he says during the interview what should i ask the wife to ensure that she is the right woman well this goes for the wife to be and the husband to be these interviews are not made for interrogations are not made to make sure whether this person is knowing all the answers and checking all the boxes because from experience as a a a former director of human resources i used to enjoy doing the interviews and i used to usually alhamdulillah with the grace of allah i was blessed in knowing a good candidate from a lousy one from the interview not from the questions and answers just from the body language with from experience i tell you it is very possible to fool those who are interviewing others so i hear people and i know people that would win every single interview they make even if they know nothing in the job so the moment the persona the way they talk their body language this their selection of words their confidence makes you feel relaxed and that this person knows what he's doing yet probably he's not qualified so this interview is not made to decide whether she is the right one or not whether she's islamically suitable and it's not a a multiple choice exam so uh a sister this is a test it won't take you more than 10 minutes just it's asking you about your aqueduct it's asking you where is allah is asking you about your belief on the torment of the grave if does it exist or not if it talks about the attributes of allah azzawajal a few things about the manhattan you do this they'll kick you out so sure how do i know listen this interview usually does not exceed an hour usually it's like five ten minutes in best case scenarios half an hour what am i supposed to do you're supposed to do your due diligence before the interview so you check in her school among her relatives among her friends at work everywhere and you can tell if she's going out and her best friend is a sufi or she always celebrates christmas and new years and she has this in her instagram or her facebook you know that this is not good she's not the right one for you but if you know all what her posts about what she so and so says about circles of knowledge about akida about giving dawah the one she mixes with are known to be of correct al-qaeda and people on the right manhatta and the right sunnah following then that's good when you go for the interview it's just to see if there's chemistry or not and most people who go through this traditional way of marriage i did this twice in my life and it was totally successful with the grace of allah had no prior relationship or exposure or anything the first minute you sit there and you look at each other and you talk to each other you know that she's the one that's it you go and press the hara and wait for the green light they say yes we are okay with the proposal alhamdulillah we're okay let's get it over with but sometimes you do your due diligence everything is fine you sit with her she doesn't like you she doesn't like your tone of voice or the way you look you may not like her pitch of voice that she speaks or her accent or the way she speaks to you or the way she disrespects her father something is not right and it doesn't work so this is my the way i see it in allah knows best"
