  "title": "Can we lie to a relative who wants to visit but is known to do black magic by saying we are not home",
  "transcript": "a relative of mine is involved in black magic and once left at a wheeze an amulet in our house which we discarded alhamdulillah she after a long time wants to visit us again i don't want her to come at any cost can we lie in order to avoid her for example by saying we aren't at home etc how to avoid her if that person is well known to be an evil person someone who deals with magic someone who has a history and this is proven not speculated in this case there is no problem in dodging her and avoiding her coming to your home especially if she's a relative who is far you can visit her yourself you can give her a call every couple of weeks to maintain ties of kinship and if she wants to come and you feel for yourself and for your family you can dodge her visit by saying that i'm going out on that day and you can just go out of your door and come back and that would not be lie but to say a straightforward lie this is not permissible and allah is a virgin knows best you"
