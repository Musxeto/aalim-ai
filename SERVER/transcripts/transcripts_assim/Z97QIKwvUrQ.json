  "transcript": "Adi Kenol from Nigeria. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. There is this thing that people say, you know, concerning women, you know, on working. So that there are situations whereby maybe in the future the lady may actually lose her husband. And if she's not working, if she hasn't worked all her life, it's very difficult for her to adjust, you know, to start, you know, taking care of herself and the children or the orphans rather. So is this a good basis for a woman, you know, to work, you know, even when the husband is working so that, you know, things like that. Because there are actually lots of issues, you know, in the society where we have, you know, orphans that are abandoned, you know, widows that they've not worked all their lives. So at that point in time it's really very difficult for them to take up any job or any skill, you know, to fend for themselves and their orphans. This is hypothetical, Akhi. We cannot build our lives and communities on a hypothetical situation. So what is the percentage of women who get married and became mothers that they would need at one stage of their time to work because they got divorced or they become widowed? What's the percentage? It's negligible. And from those who are misfortunate, they will have families to back them up. They will have parents, they will have siblings. So those who are totally stranded do not constitute one in a thousand. For this one in a thousand, do you expect us to encourage housewives and women to work, to mix with men, to compromise their religion, to compromise their marriages and upbringing their children just in case something that may happen in the future and it may not happen? This is not logical at all and it indicates a lack of trust and reliance on Allah Azza wa Jalla and Allah knows best."
