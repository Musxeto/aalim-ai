  "transcript": "Consider Subscribing :) [Sheikh] Namira from Oman? [Namira] So I \nhave a friend who was divorced, and her   ex-husband, [Sheikh] yes? [Namira] and her \nex-husband had used to take like pictures and   videos of her when she was sleeping or when she \nwas changing clothes and now that they're divorced   they were irrevocably divorced and now she was \nsupposed to get married today and um he had sent   these pictures to her to blackmail. He had sent \nthese pictures to her cousins and friends to   blackmail her and now he wants her to get married \nto this man and get divorced to him so that she   they can marry again, but she does not want to \ndo anything so he had he had told someone that   if they don't divorce within a month he would do \nsomething so my question is, is she uh allowed to   tell this new husband of hers that um he might get \nsome pictures or videos something? so because this   ex-husband might try to create problems? [Sheikh] \nFirst of all this is a legal matter. Alhamdulillah   that these pictures and video clips were taken \nby an ex-husband and not by an ex-Boyfriend   which developed through a haram relationship so \nno matter what this ex-husband sends of her no   matter how filthy or heinous these pictures are, \nit was with her husband. She didn't do haram,   especially if it was taken without her \nconsent. Now, can she tell her husband?   The answer is yes, but I would even escalate \nthis further by reporting this to the police   and this is a crime worldwide the man would \nbe placed in jail especially if there are   evidences like a witness this \nmediator this person who came to her   and told her that if she does not divorce her \nhusband after a month he will do something bad   this person heard it from her ex-husband \nso he's a witness and she has emails she   has text messages all of these must be \nreported to the police and they would   in sha Allah put him in jail and confiscate all \nsuch offensive material and Allah knows best"
