  "title": "In hunting can we eat part where hunting dog caught the animal or is the part impure assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "there's an authentic narration attributed to the prophet Muhammad Islam in regards to hunting in which he said and I quote when you set off your trained dogs recite the name of God while sending them off then eat that game end quote now I know the saliva of dogs are impure so my question to you is what would I do with the part or area of the animal that the hunting dog bit would I avoid eating that part of the animal no you can eat that part as it was not mentioned in the Hadith or by the doings of the companions that we should purify it or cut it off or wash it off which means that as long as the Sharia did not elaborate or address this issue it is Forgiven and neglected and you move on with the grace of Allah"
