  "title": "Is it Correct To Memorize The Quran Simply By Listening to it? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Muhammad from India. Sheikh, I'm just starting to learn Arabic and I memorized the Quran simply by listening to it. So my question is, is it permissible to memorize the Quran by listening? Jazak Allah Khairan. Wa Jazak. The Quran initially was learned by the companions, may Allah be pleased with them, by listening. And this is the best way of learning it, to listen, to mimic, to duplicate what you have heard. And this is called a talaqee, where you learn through reception, receiving the Quran and duplicate it and recite it similar to how you've heard it. So there's nothing wrong in that at all, insha'Allah. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it insha'Allah within the following two days or three days. And bi-idhnillah, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
