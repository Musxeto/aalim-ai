  "transcript": "okay there's your ideas we say that Allah said that the two names in the main side are abdulrahman and Abdullah is the best name so I want to know in the female side which name is the best the Hadith that you're referring to isma in Allah and another narration elsewhere from the sahih was and the most truthful names are as for women we don't have a similar Hadith therefore the sky is the limit you can call women as you like preferably and this is what I like to be Arab names Arabic names that are related to the female companions so that they would have some sort of a role model to look up to and Allah Knows Best"
