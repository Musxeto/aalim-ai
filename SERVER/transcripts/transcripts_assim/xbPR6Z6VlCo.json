  "transcript": "Umm Amina from the Emirates Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So I started looking into other fields, and now I'm volunteering to learn about child-care and stuff like that. But I noticed a lot of the nursery schools here do the same. So what do I do in this place? I'm getting a little bit overwhelmed. What is your relationship with these places? Are you studying there? I'm doing training, but I'm going to be working in some of, maybe one of them. And as a Muslim, you don't do these things. But you do your normal things. You teach math, you teach English, you teach religion, Islam, and the likes. There is no problem in that, inshallah."
