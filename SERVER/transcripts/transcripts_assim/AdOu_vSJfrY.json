  "transcript": "drinking is something essential in our life we eat and we drink and the prophet used to drink however there are etiquettes for drinking that the prophet also taught us and practiced it sallallahu alaih wasallam number one from his Sunnah he used to love sweet water and unlike what the super super uh uh sufis would say because they would say no we don't drink anything sweet we don't drink anything that is luxurious so we would like to eat salted water uh rotten food or food that is not some old bread all of this is not part of Islam the prophet used to love to eat meat especially the shoulder he used to love to eat sweets and he used to love to drink sweet water which means that as long as Allah made things Halal for you enjoy it why make life difficult oh because I'd like to be closer to Allah and who told you that making life difficult for you gets you closer to Allah Allah made these things Halal for us to enjoy without extravagance so you can do that without any problem among the eates it is to drink while sitting down an Malik says the prophet Alat prohibited people from drinking standing up and Abu Hur said the prophet saidat one must not drink standing up but there are other hadiths that conflict with this for example Abbas may Allah be pleased with him says the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam drank zamzam water while he was standing up narrated by I Abbas reported in alkari and he says I came and met Ali and I brought him some water so he started drinking standing up so he noticed that I didn't like him drinking standing up so he said there are people who hate drinking standing up and I saw the prophet Alat did what you've just saw me done what you have just seen me do meaning I saw the prophet drink standing up number three Abdullah may Allah be pleased with him and with his father says we used to eat at the time of the Prophet Alat while walking we used to eat and we used to drink while standing and abdah may Allah be pleased with him and with his father says I saw the prophet Alat drinking standing up and sitting down and also what im Malik reported in Hisar Ali Omar Zu may Allah be peace with them all used to drink standing up and and reported that and thought that this was totally permissible so after all of these authentic hadiths how can we combine between what seems to be conflicting ABD said it's very easy because whenever we have conflicting rules like this it means that the Hadith of prohibition would be degraded into not a recommended and the Hadith of doing it would mean that it is permissible and this is the best approach whenever we have two conflicting evidences is to try to combine between them and this is one of the means of combining"
