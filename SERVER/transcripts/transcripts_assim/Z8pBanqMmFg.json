  "title": "Listening to subliminal audios (sounds of rain, wind) for weight loss & other things Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "his sister says these days there are so many subliminal audios on the internet to be used to control your subconscious and get desired results for whatever purpose one wants like weight loss etc guide if this is halal doing it if we do it for the weight loss only and it's the sounds of rain etc not music i personally believe that listening to such sounds like the chipping of birds or rainfall or rivers moving or the leaves and the winds listening to these sounds may relax a person and there is nothing wrong in that there's nothing haram in that but listening to it with a specific desire such as weight loss this is not scientific nor it's logical so listening to it with such a purpose can be one of two either there are hidden messages that you cannot hear consciously but your subconscious hears and this is like hypnosis you know when sometimes there are whistles that you use that we humans don't hear but the dogs can hear and come sometimes they may embed such messages in certain speeds or frequencies that you may not hear but your subconscious takes it and hears it and follows it so this is similar to hypnosis and this is haram or there's nothing as such it's just rain water falling on the ground or the roof or a stream of of water and you're convincing yourself or someone convinced you that this helps you to lose weight and that would be part of the minor shirk when we believe in something that has no reality to it so this is my shift like the ring of energy people wear on their chests or a special bracelet that fights um joint ache and rheumatism and whatever illnesses they come up with and doctors and physicians says that this is all bogus or certain stones that you wear in your ring that gives you sexual power or heals you from certain illnesses such belief is minor shirk because it's not part of the healing process that allah has given us because healing and protection can either be through sharia evidences such as drinking of honey consuming of black seed cupping milk and urine of camels etc or it can be through natural tangible medicines so we know that panadol or tylenol cures headaches scientists explain how antibiotics attack bacteria and infection this does that medication is known and proved scientifically but when you come up with something that neither the shariah backs up nor the medicine or the medical sources back up then this is minor shirk if you believe that it is a cure from allah and it's a major shirk if you believe that it is a cure by itself without allah azza and allah knows best you"
