  "title": "Can we visit Taj Mahal and what are the ONLY 3 Masjids Muslims can travel to visit? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "yahya says is it permissible to visit taj mahal taj mahal to my knowledge is not a masjid it's a monument it is a building that some rajah or some king or some ruler built to honor his wife and then i think he buried his wife in in there so it's not a masjid so that we can say that no it is not permissible to pray in such a masjid and it's not a grave by itself though there is a grave it's not a graveyard or a cemetery so it's a place of amusement an architectural design to commemorate someone to remember someone if people travel to visit and to see i don't see anything wrong in that insha allah because the prohibition in islam is to set for travel to any place of worship other than the three messages of mecca medina and of al-quds and messenger nebui and masjid these are permissible for me to pack my bags and set to travel to them but i can't go to travel for example set get my bags and search for a journey to al hussain masjid in egypt or muhammad al-ham is in morocco though they are messages and phases of worship traveling to them is prohibited for the sake of ibadah as the prophet said islam traveling is not permitted except for three masjids meaning for the sake of so visiting taj mahal is not uh a problem insha'allah allah knows best you"
