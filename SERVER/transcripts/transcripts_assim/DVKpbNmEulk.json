  "transcript": "so some people say to new Muslims that they aren't expected to pray five times a day immediately or fast Ramadan completely but rather to take it easy and build up these habits gradually so just praying sometimes and fasting some days and they reference the fact that rulings in Islam were revealed over a course of many years therefore people should also introduce the rulings gradually in in uh their own lives so is what they're saying valid or correct what they are saying is totally bogus and baseless because Allah although in the beginning had gradually given the commands of Islam on the 10th year of Hijra just few months before the prophet's death Allah revealed the Ayah that says today I have completed your religion so now no one has the right to say listen I'm a new revert and I used to drink a lot of booze so we know that Boo's prohibition came on three stages so can I follow that no muslim in his right mind will say yeah sure don't uh um overdo it in the first stage in the second stage Don't Pray when you're intox intoxicated and in the third stage it's Haram for you no it's Haram on the spot when someone accepts Islam he has to accept it wholeheartedly we don't say to him okay you're a revert we'll give you like 6 months eight months pray F uh uh when you wake up you don't have to pray and skip this and skip that this Ramadan it's good if you do 10 days 20 days is on the house this is not Islam this is cherry picking and whoever say such things to revert they're ignorant imbeciles they know nothing of Islam don't be confused don't be distracted by their titles or their position because they're totally ignorant of the rulings of Islam and Allah Knows Best"
