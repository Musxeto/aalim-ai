  "transcript": "alhamd I think we had a long break and hopefully that we will be able to move on to the characteristics of a husband now it is the time for the ladies to have fun first characteristic that are required in a man and each one of us must yeah U not utilize scrutinize himself and see does he fit these conditions because I believe the last session you were only nodding your head and looking down whenever I mention the quality of the wife said nope nope nope everything is no so now you're thinking am I leading a happy life should I continue in this marriage before you take a decision let's check your checklist yourself so among the characteristics of a husband he should have moral conduct and good character and what is meant by moral conduct and good character he should be a nice person to live live with there are certain characteristics in an individual that makes it very difficult to do so I have friends among my friends there are people that are so sensitive I do not want to be friends with them yeah some of my good friends now alhamdulillah I managed to change them with the grace of Allah but it was very difficult at the beginning because after every time we meet when I go home I receive a phone call you said this and this was not appropriate you know I I had it in me I had to tell tell you about it I feel very sad because you said this joke or because I'm looking at the guy he's not looking at me because it's the phone why are you doing this so I feel guilty whenever I sit with him I am always conscious of uh let me not say anything wrong but then I found out that this is not a good quality I as a person I'm never offended if you come to me and you say she you're this you're that and you laugh and you joke about me I'm an easygoing person if I don't like it I'm going to tell it to you in your face not instead in in in in reference to disrespect no no I'm talking about if you make a joke about me that I do not like I'm going to give you another joke in your face but I'm not going to go home depressed and when I meet you next time I'm I'm going to do this to you now I'm going to plot how can I undermine his work how can I do this and and Destroy no there are people like this there are people who you fear talking to and that is why the prophet said among you you will find the worst of men are those who people avoid being afraid of their foul language or of their evil acts there are people good Muslims Mah practicing but when people mention their name so oh don't invite him he's bad company we would like to have you know our comfort and we have to sit we'd like to sit together if he comes he's going to destroy it some husbands are like this no a real husband is easy going if your husband I'm Excuse me husbands if your husband is the one who's picky you're making your wife live in hell I know one of my close friends and relatives when he goes home if he sees something like this he go in front of his wife so the wife is always intimidated in fear everything has to be the the smallest detail if the wife cooks for 3 hours in the kitchen and brings the food and happy and puts lce and puts cucumbers decorating it the first bite is no salt the second bite it's not cooked well the third bite he grabs the dish and he throws it in her face W I know this I have I have lots of stories to tell you but I don't want to make the brothers you're not married afraid no let us continue so we H he has to be in an excellent state of moral conduct and good character give me examples I'll give you examples he has to be generous so generosity is a beautiful attribute in a man and so many I repeat so many of your shortcomings disappear when you're generous now married people when was the last time you brought a gift to your wife less than a month raise your hands mashallah come on don't don't H if you if you think and you okay uh less than two weeks raise your hands the same people so less than one week mashallah okay less than six month so we have a problem huh the prophet says complete in Arabic nobody knows Arabic mean give exchange gifts and you will fall in love and this is something I love in the people of India I don't have this huh so please do not do this to me whenever they come and visit me the brothers that come and visit me in my home they bring gifts when I come here bring me gifts you're making me embarrassed we don't have this culture in Saudi Arabia yeah we don't exchange gifts the people of India from all types of India they always give me gifts small gifts which very good but this is embarrassing because I cannot repay them for this but this shows you that the the Muslims of India have love in them because they exchange gifts and Allah loves him for this so the husband has to be generous now being generous that does not mean that he spends his money unwisely no being generous to your wife could be very little yeah whenever I travel on the plane there are sales for for air sales so I get the catalog and I look at the cheapest thing and say I want this one I want this one and I take two it has to be the same price unfortunately because I don't want to go to hell it's this is difficult well think about it again huh even the perfumes the five R difference not good has to be exactly the same so I have to and I bring it to my and they're so happy with this they love it although it's nothing if I see and this is not very often but sometimes you know they sell flowers and you if you ruin the car and necklace of flowers this is an Egyptian uh way of doing it and then it's it's happening five r i buy one and one I have to hide the other one because it's not in the day of that one it's a lot of pain and headache but it has an impact it has an impact on your spouse now compare this with someone who does not give gifts with someone who makes very ration he rations the food he brings and every time he checks the the the the refrigerator yesterday there were five uh uh sodas now there is one who drank the four she says I I drank two and your son and we had the guest why did you drink two two is too much come on we have to save money we have to do this we have to do that now this is a very bad character in a man it's a very bad character now second part of moral conduct he has to be truthful he has to be honest he has to say the truth and a lot of the men lie are professional Liars now saying this lying is permissible in Islam only in three cases one to reconcile between two who are having a fight so you lie to him you lie to him and get them together good two in war and three husband and wife which is a minor War so we have major war we have minor War so a lot of the brothers misunderstand this Hadith where are you uh I'm at work he's telling his friends when are you coming I have late shift and some of them come to work please come we have a lot of job to do and he hangs up he said the prophet said lying no this is not the lying that the prophet meant what kind of lying then it is the beautiful permissible lying that increases the love my wife comes to me wearing a dress she said how do I look I say if I pose then I will get one of the high heels just posing so imagine if I say what is this come on this is 15 years old dress someone who's 15 years you are a grandmother what are you wearing you're crazy people will laugh at you this is bad so seriously when my my wife comes with a an U dress she says what do you think I said mashallah you're making the dress look very beautiful she smiles and looks at me says liar she knows she knows how I often try to make her happy by lying but this is alhamdulillah halal lying now imagine if this kind of lying is not there would they love each other sometimes the husband you know after coming from the toilet putting on his shirt he's doing this in the mirror she says honey how do I look she said you look like a be a big piece and chunk of meat what what do you look instead no a a a a wise and sensible wife is mashallah you are my night in shining armor this increases the love and so many times truthfulness is a cause of destruction of your marriage and the people people come and say well I don't want to lie I I my wife told me do you love me asked me she do you love me I said no I don't want to lie no this is stupid you are truthful in everything else but when it comes to your love to your wife no you have to sugarcoat it you have to be diplomatic so that you would increase the love and this is halal but in other things no you never lie a Muslim never lies so many times I see Brothers going out the young child 3 years 4 years Daddy can I come with you said no no no I'm going to the hospital to take an injection he's lying what would the child do I don't want to go I'm not crazy but this is very bad because the child would grow up on lying a friend calls the child answers yes Daddy it's it's your friend tell him I'm not here my father says he's you're teaching your child to lie a true practicing Muslim never lies so the third is uh lowering the Gaze so many times I walk in the market in the streets in the souk I find a a brother with a practicing sister Mah walking and the guy you know awax you don't know awax because we're from Saudi we know a lot of military stuff aox is a plane that has a radar on top of it and this flies all over and it controls all communication and it monitors anything that is flying this man is like an aox and whenever he sees a woman he looks her up up and down with his wife a lot of the sisters call me she my my husband is doing this and it's hurting me it's it beside the fact it's a sin it is killing me that I'm walking with my husband and he's looking freely to women no part of his moral conduct and good character that he lowers his gaze because if you allow yourself to do this then you may might as well allow her to do this as well would you accept this no why I'm a man doesn't seem so it being a man does not permit you to do this and the last point it's not the last it's one of so many but this is just an example he should be tolerant he should should be tolerant tolerant to what to his wife as we've seen the prophet do with AA when she was jealous did he react very tolerant didn't do anything not only that sometimes your tolerance is your survival AA was with the prophet in her house Z bin J may Allah be pleased with her the cousin of the Prophet H she so she is related to him and she's one of the most beautiful wives of the Prophet Alam she comes and she starts to curse AA you did this you always take him with you he loves you most you and she starts and AA says and I'm looking at the prophet I'm not replying I'm not saying anything respecting the prophet until I saw the prophet's face change as if he wants me to what to answer back and when I saw this I gave her and I returned everything that she had and a little bit extra and I can see the satisfaction in the prophet's face and he and and when I finished he said this is the daughter of Abu Bakr being proud of her so he tolerated Zab he didn't speak why because we need tolerant husbands I don't think tolerant husband do they need huh don't get me wrong women need tolerant husband why men would justify this yeah yeah sh because they have little brains and they no it's not because of that their nature is full of passion compassion love and impulsiveness they don't hide they speak on the spot if you're like this the house will ignite so the best way of having a good marriage is compromise if the husband pulls the wife lets go and when the wife pulls the husband pulls no you also let go so this way you have the perfect marriage you'll always be happy if you tolerate your wife you will find out that she will come and appreciate it in a very strange way my wies will not watch this so inshallah I have no problems sometimes one of my wives would be so angry she would curse she would break a dish she would say bad things about me and I would not open my mouth one word nothing until after an hour or two she comes down what does she do she comes and kisses my foot W I didn't do anything she kisses my foot and says I'm sorry I I know I I crossed the line for tolerating Me Now do do you think this is easy for me as a man to tolerate not that I'm a good husband I have a lot of shortcomings if she talks woo you will listen to to to many stories more awful than this but it's hard for me to tolerate but I do this first of all for the sake of Allah second of all because I know her character and whatever she's saying is not correct people come to me sh I divorc my wife why she she kept on saying divorce me divorce me divorce me for 3 hours and I say okay then what did you do a divorc her okay what did she do she started crying you divorce me this is natural this is nature human nature when a woman asks for a divorce do you think she wants divorce no but she's impulsive when she asks for divorce you tell her W I will not divorce you I love you liar you do this you do whatever you do I still love you calm her down calm her but if you divorce her or if you fight against her then this is not what a woman needs this is not what a woman wants you have to be tolerant and this is the Sunnah what is the evidence behind or uh uh this one and this one the Hadith of mu fa if I'm not mistaken may Allah be pleased with with her she came to the prophet Alam and she said that I have two proposals one from from mua Abu sufyan and one from Abu Jam may Allah be pleased with them both what did the prophet say he told her as for muaah he is broke he doesn't have any Penny which means that he cannot be generous because he doesn't have money so he's not your type as for Abu jaham he is a man that never takes his stick off his shoulder it has two interpretations two people always keep their sticks on their shoulder one is a person who always hits people with it which means that he's intolerant and he will hit you with his stick so you don't want him the second interpretation is he is a second person who puts the should uh the stick on his shoulder meaning he travels a lot so you don't want a husband who is 2/3 of his uh life away from you traveling all the time no you need someone to be with you so these These are uh the two characteristics that are required in a person when he has good um uh moral conduct and good character the second characteristic is he should be practicing a woman wants someone who's practicing one these are in one so this is my question is why is importance is not uh in category so the brother is asking why didn't we put the first things first and and so on this is when I wrote it I didn't any think of categorizing it uh or putting it in order in regard of what is most important but definitely uh it might be also because see I can always find I'm good in interviews H it is not it is it might be it is the Hadith order the prophet said in the Hadith whenever someone comes to you with good moral conduct and character and Dean so the prophet made it number one so I'm following the Sunnah sorry um yes okay this is the Hadith by the way so this is order of the Prophet but linguistically and whenever we have two or three it doesn't mean that always the first one is a priority because in some ayats we have and we know that m is the majority of mentioning har mus and it's mus first but there are one or two places in the Quran where harun is preceded and the scholars say in Arabic the word the the letter wa this is conjunction huh and this does not mean order while means order fa means order uh and uh yeah there are many many examples I can give you so here it doesn't yet mainly speaking usually it it is that's why the prophet says when he climbed sa he he recited the Ayah he said after that I begin with what Allah has begun with that's why he started from Safa and then Mara because this is the order but in Arabic no it does not mean it has to be uh in sequence what what are we talking about ah being practicing I don't know if we have anything else no practicing meaning that he has to be a person committed to his religion not necessarily a scholar not necessarily A not necessarily even someone who is literate he can be illiterate the prophet was illiterate but he was the best of mankind so with when we say practicing meaning that he knows that this is Haram and he stays away from it and he knows that this is mandatory and he does it now if I have someone with mallah degrees and experience and an orator yet he doesn't pray on time he doesn't lower his gaze he doesn't speak the truth all the time would I call him truthful I know a lot of Brothers with this long beard that are the biggest Liars this is a sign of hypocrisy huh and also among the sisters you know a lot of sisters among you that may lie that may cheat that may never keep a promise that when they have a dispute or an argument they excel in evil the Prophet sayam this is a very big defect so Allah says in the Quran this is too small uh okay bad statements are for bad people or bad women are for bad men and bad people are for bad statements or bad men for bad women so this is by default this is the norm and this can be in this and it also can be in the Hereafter because one would complain and say okay Prophet L his wife was prophet n his wife was likewise so how can we combine we combine by saying that this is the norm there can be exceptions or we can say that this is on the day of judgment so only the righteous man would have righteous women but tely speaking you have to have this as a choice now unfortunately we find the defect in marriage when sisters compromise so the sister as in the question she's religious she's practicing her the one proposing to her is not as practicing so we get sis I get questions sisters coming and saying uh a man proposed to me he's a good family he's Rich he's so and so but he works in an interest based bank that deals with clearcut triba no doubt in that or he works in TV and he shows he's part of showing movies and music and Haram stuff or he sells forbidden things alcohol Works in a a a restaurant that sells un Islamic food pork Etc so is this permissible and the answer is no she says he says but I I will inshah try to guide him the answer still is no you should only take someone who is practicing a lot of the sisters unfortunately disobey my advice they go and marry and they either deteriorate or divorce they would give in compromise do not compromise your religion Allah would send you someone who fears him thirdly lineage so now the brothers are looking into their lineage a woman should take someone in her same social status or better but is this a must no it's this is part of being or having a perfect marriage when these conditions are f fed and in some schools of thought if a woman marries someone who is below her social status the cousins have the right to nullify the the the the marriage contract imagine that they have the right to go to the judge and complain and they say our cousin married this man and he's not from our type he's not from our status and we're affected by by that that's why we would like you to void the contract and the and the and the does this and we have cases in Saudi Arabia like this this is not correct this is not authentic but it is found in the schools of thought so when you take someone take someone try your best to take someone that does not offend the rest of your family because you do not come from you're not an orphan you come from a tree so you have to honor the whole uh family as much as possible among the characteristics that is required in a husband he should be strong and honest and this is mentioned inah when Ms peace be upon Him fled Egypt he found two women unable to water their sheep so he volunteered and then he went to a tree to rest then one of them of the girls they she suggested to her father to hire him she said oh Father hire him verily the best of men for you to hire is the strong and the trustworthy so these are two characteristics a woman requires in a husband being strong that does not mean he has to be a bodybuilder this is not the what is meant by strength though it's it's nice to have but not necessarily why if you remember the Hadith of the Prophet Alam a strong believer is better than a weak believer and in both of them there is there is goodness what is meant by a strong believer Scholars say a strong believer physically emotionally economically knowledge wise fighting skills wise so all aspects he's considered to have strength so if you have a a five foot tall husband and he weighs 45 kg you don't file for divorce said no he's not strong whenever I walk with him the air comes and the wind blows I have to hold him with a string like a kite and sometimes no no no no no look at the other features how is he when it comes to honoring your family oh she he mallah he respects my mother and my father loves him so much he's strong how does it how is it when he is in his office oh masallah he's very good he has good position respectful and the managers love him and his subordinates respect him good how is he financially how then this guy is strong it's not necessarily physically the second is he should be honest and honest is different than truthful truthful is what you say honest is am I can trust you and that is why"
