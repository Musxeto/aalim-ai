  "title": "Giving Officials \"gifts\" to benefit from due to their positions | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "his second question is that in Ramadan there's a practice in his country where people give officials gifts and these gifts is given either through other government officials but from their own pocket money so what's the ruling on that well it depends if before assuming these positions they used to give one another gifts during the month of Ramadan ordering and eat some food some clothes some gifts of any sort of there's no problem in that but now because this particular person is an official whatever you give to him is dubious we look at it with suspicion why did you give this official not give me I'm the share give me something so the welfare you're not in a position to help me or to scratch my back so that I can scratch yours ah then you're giving this official because you intend something like when I go and visit an official in a company and I buy him a set of expensive pens why am i giving it to him I don't know him am i giving it to him because his eyes are black or blue no I'm giving it to him because of the position someday one day I'll utilize this gift in some form of service or favor he can return to me ah this is a bribe but if this gift is normal and natural before he assumed that position you every single Ramadan he used to give it to him there's no problem in that what about if it is a bribe and he took it and brought it home his family can eat from it because it's totally halal for them it's Haram only on the one who took it and earned it and Allah social knows best"
