  "transcript": "Denmark so I recently learned about that I think it's called and the rise of other Muslims and before I really knew about that I would like hurt Muslims right not like seriously but I would basically cause them pain for fun like trip them scare them slap them in the back of their neck with my Muslim family and not with my Muslim friends for fun right so not injure them but like cause them pain temporary pray right um so do I need to go I'll apologize to them now or is because we're still on good terms like we're still friends and everything so do I need to go and apologize or is it does it suffice if I make Dua for them or like what do I need to do here translates to the rights of individuals and any transgression I do against a Muslim or a non-muslim I'll have to be held accountable to that on a day of judgment and they will take from my good deeds and I will take from their bad Deeds due to this aggression I had done towards them and this is why the prophet said Whoever has some beef between him and his brother meaning that I took his money I beated him I slandered him I did something that I would be accounted accountable for then I have to try to make things up and reconcile with them asking for forgiveness giving in compensation whatever before the day of judgment because on the day of judgment there is no currency there's no dollars or Euros there's only good deeds and bad Deeds so if you had done something bad to others you have to weigh the pros and cons sometimes a simple slap on the back and fighting and wrestling in a jokingly fashion is acceptable and nobody holds a grudge against you especially if you're in good terms with them they most likely have forgotten it or forgiven it but if you had taken money or you seriously injured people and they still hold the grudge against you you have to ask them for forgiveness and Allah knows best Adam from France"
