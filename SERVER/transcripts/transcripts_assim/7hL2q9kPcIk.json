  "title": "Selling counterfeit products on Amazon if everyone knows - Haram? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Abdul Hadi from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh, how are you? Wa'alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu, Hayyakallah So Sheikh, recently me and one of my relatives were starting a business on Amazon and we found a product that we wanted to sell. Now in Amazon they have two listings, one was the brand and the other one was non-branded. So from where we imported our goods, we were selling the non-branded ones and the customer knows that okay we are selling the non-branded ones and they are not original but the non-branded ones had the logo of the original brand and when it was out of our control to actually change it but when we asked the brand do you allow this because there were other listings of the brand of unbranded products as well. They said that we know and we have trademarks on our logos but it has been over I think almost a year and the listings have not been removed. So I want to know if this is haram and if it is, I was assuming that it is and I told my relative about it. They said that nothing will happen, you don't need to worry about it but I was a little bit skeptical about this and I want to ask if it is haram then because my financial needs are fulfilled by that relative and if I want to start a business again, can I take the money from them if the money is haram from them? First of all, it is not permissible for you to sell counterfeits as this is violating these companies' copyright. So this is a legal thing and upon its legality you can say it's halal or haram. So if legally it is halal and the company gives you permission or says it's okay to sell our counterfeits, we have no problem with the logo being violated and the rights are okay, then it's halal. If they say no, you're not allowed to do this, then it is haram. Point one. Point two, if your relative's income or they deal with haram and they are sinful for their earning and haram income but if they give you money as a loan to work with or to operate as a partner, there's nothing wrong in that because the sin is on them for earning haram money but there's no sin on you in it as long as you're doing halal job and Allah knows best."
