  "title": "Shorten & Combine prayers while traveling or delay and pray them when I'm in my city - Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "harlot says while returning from a tour I reached my city at 3 p.m. our time is 245 should I offer throw her on the train or after reaching my home I should combine the prayers with a sir if I combine should the Lahore be shortened or not now the scenario is he's out of city limits his own city limits which means he's a traveler he's entitled to shorten and combine while going back to his hometown though her time was due so he has one of two options either to pray on the train shortening his door into two Rakas and he has the option of combining a sir - it also two rakahs or delaying and postponing his law so that he can pray it at other time when he reaches home which is best well those who travel a lot know that it is almost difficult if not impossible to stand up in a crowded train face the table and pray normally this is difficult if not impossible so the best scenario would be that you wait until you reach your home you pray for recover and then you pray for a cancer and you have done the Sunnah without any problem in that insha'Allah whether you shorten your door to two Rakas once you arrived your home or not this is an issue of dispute some scholars say because it was mandated upon you as two Rakas when the time was do you pray it two rakahs even if you reach your home but the vast majority of scholars say that you have to pray them full and this is to be and this on the safe side as well"
