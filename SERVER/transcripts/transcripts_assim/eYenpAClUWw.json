  "transcript": "Josefa says tell us what is your opinion of closing to avoid the contained contamination of coronavirus we spoke about this so many times and said that the authorities running the country are stuck by between a rock and a hard place they have two choices either to let people do whatever they want in the absence of a vaccine or a true cure and a medic medication for that pandemic and end up like Italy or France the biggest problem is not in people falling sick the biggest problem is in the medical facilities that are not equipped to handle so many patients such influx in number so the ventilators are one of the most important medical devices used to help patients if in a whole country you have only 500 ventilators and the people falling sick are 10,000 so you have to be selective in choosing which 500 to live and which 9,500 to die this is what's happening in Italy this is what's happening in most countries that are facing big problems if this outbreak happens in America it's a catastrophe they're not equipped the doctors have to decide who to live and who to die definitely they will go to people over 60 and say sorry we don't have a ventilator for you and reserve the ventilator for someone who's 20 or 30 years of age they would face the ethical dilemma of who to choose some of these countries the youth are happy because the elders are dying we can get houses now when they pass away we can get jobs we can save money instead of giving them retirement and other welfare expenses so this is option one the second option is to lock down everything which was would cause a lot of discomfort agitation and also economical burdens for people who cannot work cannot earn but quarantine is the best treatment for such pandemics four weeks to six weeks of lockdown lockdown would cause the pandemic to wither and fade away with the grace of Allah"
