  "transcript": "Oh calcium from India is asking about a misconception that is widely spread among her people when there are two people fighting and the one who's being oppressed is asking Allah for justice and they say no you should not ask Allah for justice you should ask Allah for mercy because Allah's mercy also includes a Las justice and this concept is baseless both in Quran and in the Sunna so we do not pay attention to what laymen say rather we only refer to the Quran and the Sunna for example in surat al ahmar the moon allah social tells us that after relentlessly calling his people to islam when they rejected and ridiculed him prophet nor peace be upon him said in Nima hooloovoo born phantosaur o Allah I am overwhelmed I'm overpowered so grant me victory and avenge me so here he did not ask Allah for Rama he sought a las vengeance and we know what happened when the flood covered the whole of earth and the whole of humanity cease to exist except for those on the ark who believed and accompanied knew peace be upon him also in the hadith of the prophet alayhi salatu salam the night of the great battle of badr abu bakr may allah be pleased with him was with the prophet a little artisan in a small tent and the prophet sallallaahu Salam was supplicating to Allah at night while everyone else was sleep and insisting on allah that grant us victory o allah if we were to be defeated defeated you would not be worshipped on earth o allah grant me the victory that you have promised me and he did not ask for forgiveness or for mercy he asked for victory so justice is not something to be ashamed of on the contrary we seek justice in our daily lives when we have a dispute with someone else and we go to the court why do we go to court why did allah azzawajal in the first place appointed judges like that would peace be upon him as mentioned in the quran so that he would solve arguments and disputes and this is why we need courts there might be a problem between me and my father over issues of inheritance if my mom dies and my father decides not to give me anything of my share in my mother's in wealth he's unfair but does this mean that I should remain silent and accept no Allah so Jill gave me the right to go to court and complain so that the judge would give me my god-given share no no and and this would not be considered being undutiful to my father or disrespectful rather this is my right that I am entitled and permitted to seek and ask for therefore this misconception is totally baseless you can ask for Allah Idol the only person who would not want this to happen is the oppressor the one who transgresses does laudanum towards others he's the one who does not want a las Justice he wants Allah merci to conceal his oppression and Allah knows best"
