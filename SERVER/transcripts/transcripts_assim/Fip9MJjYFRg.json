role in huda tv the programs he has hosted what programs he will host inshallah last ramadan i don't want to give away who the guest is because last ramadan he hosted one of the live shows which was

well as our special guests from the ksa we're always pleased and honored to host them and we look forward to uh to having them here for some time uh in sha allah while we're waiting for our awesome guest i want to talk to you a little bit about ramadan's pulse you guys know that's like my favorite show ever season one was a blast with my good friend the behind the scenes tour guide muhammad tayo well this year we made it like a we're making it rather because we're doing it right now a semi-drama kind of documentary in the harry potter fashion that's right it's going to be like a harry potter film inshallah of course without all the bad stuff just good stuff the theme rather i should say i had a lot of fun i got to film with my good friend abdul khadim who was actually originally from cameroon he invited us into his home he treated us like kings he had made a huge amount of food we had a wonderful dinner he had his family with him there he talked to us about the customs or as they say in arabic uh you know i better not practice my arabic on the live let's take it to english uh he talked to us about the customs the foods the language uh and the people of cameroon his native country it was really a marvelous time we were honored to be his guest i certainly look forward to airing that every day in the month of ramadan in sha allah and it's going to be similar to memories of hadamay because of course the the mind behind it the brain behind this project is of course mohammed tail who brought you memories of halloween i believe you guys benefited greatly from that program my friend abdul kareem was also in memories of haramain as were many of the regular hooded tv personalities members of hadamay was probably the best in my humble opinion probably one of the best programs on huda tv thus far i mean it was really i think the level of professionalism and and craftsmanship from the artistic perspective was amazing and that's why we're pleased to have brother muhammad working with us here at hoda tv and we hope to make ramadan's paul season two uh the same caliber uh in sha allah now like i said we're waiting for an awesome guest so if you're just flipping

promised we have a very awesome guest and he has arrived in the studio of course i'm talking about you know who the sheikh that is is broadcasting once a week live from jeddah the host of ask us thank you for having me by the way sometimes they call me awesome so it's okay whether you call me awesome or awesome thank you sheikha i uh my book is very bad i apologize thank you so much for joining us i certainly appreciate it uh sheik you know you broadcasting from jeddah yeah and now you're in cairo so what does bring you to cairo well i'm attending tomorrow with the grace of allah a conference on what they translate as targeted media okay but i i i don't i i'm not comfortable with the word targeted because even the evil media is targeted that's right so it should be the beneficial media the educational media idiot tournament attainment as they call it okay so they have a two-day conference tomorrow in charlotte okay so what will be your role in this conference why was it so important that you traveled here from 10 well this is the official version is that i'm a man of media and i have to attend the unofficial version is that i i miss the brothers here in huda tv and and it they have a very um big chunk of my life devoted and dedicated to huda with the grace of allah and it's it's fun always to be in egypt this loving and caring country where the weather is fine the food is excellent the people are kind thank you so much awesome we certainly appreciate your kind words the egyptian brothers especially behind the cameras uh sheikha you know last year you know rather we i receive a lot of emails right here on this program and people are asking when is shake awesome going to do another program for us especially a youth program we want to see him wearing jeans and sneakers like there's an old program that you did i believe do you have anything like that in mind because i do think you're very popular with the youth well nowadays i used to be popular with the youth because i was young nowadays everybody looks at me and says uncle i have a question and this you know puts me off completely i'd love to do a dedicated program but the problem is that the cake is too small and there are so many people eating from it and time does not allow me to do so many things that i wish i could do besides the responsibilities i have but inshallah with the grace of allah i would love to do it of course skip the jeans and the sneakers apart because i'm too old for this so let's keep it as helpful but uh sheikah ask her it goes very well mushroom i like to watch it myself you you handle the calls in a very friendly way in a charismatic way how many years have you been broadcasting a hosting ask this is my i think 12th year subhanallah this is your 12th year so is there was there a certain episode or a certain question that you always remember like a funny a memorable moment or a certain question or a certain caller that you remember to this day well i'm unfortunately i'm not good at this but every single day you receive things that are so funny so sometimes you could say that they're so ridiculous but at the same time you could never look down at any person asking questions because at least he's better than half of the population he came forward to ask even if it's silly but it might be that this is the one who's going to benefit most from you yeah certainly that's that's an excellent point we do hear dr selassie that say that say that as well signs of the hour was a wonderful program and i do receive a lot of feedback on this email about that program uh who came up with the concept for that program did you take a lot of preparation on your part why did you choose that topic why in ramadan perhaps you can speak about that well first of all i'm when it comes to uh preparation uh preparing a a topic or a subject i'm very lazy so if you want to kill me justin michel give us a title or give us a topic this completely destroys me but if you come and say listen i'd like to just to talk about xyz no problem i i if i'm unable to do it i'll fake it but when you come and tell me you come up with a subject i find this horrendous for me the signs of the hours the hour was suggested by sheikh jamal and zharan himself okay he told me how about this topic and i love the topic because i've done it so many times in friday sermons and in lectures etc and it did uh take a lot and i mean a lot of my time because when you do it for tv you try your level best to research it and you do not depend only on sheikh even ashkar's book may allah have mercy on his soul but also you uh depend on other books uh such as useful wabil and uh i think it's inaudible i always mix up these two brothers and it's a very beautiful book it's a master's degree uh thesis okay and you look on on the web when you find people who are deviant or having uh wrong information coming on the youtube and talking about the jail and saying that the jedi is the uk it is not something and it's found in in the north sea etc all of this nonsense you have to defend it okay excellent point shaking on this program we do try to give the viewers a little bit of background information about the the particular guest perhaps you can tell us a little bit about yourself because you know actually when i hear you speak i i thought you were born and raised in america because you speak perfect american english so perhaps you can give the viewers a little bit about yourself and a little behind the scenes information whatever you feel comfortable sharing yeah if i do this i have to kill you but i can't do that with the viewers no i see um well um what you need to know is that i've been to the states on in my life only for five weeks okay so i went for a month and then a couple of years later i went for a week okay so this is my experience with the us i don't know even how to get there because the last time i was there was like in 1984. okay right um my english uh with the grace of allah i never thought that i'm going to use it for dawah so i come from a westernized family so my father my brothers my siblings my cousins we since god knows when we've been westernized we were muslims but not practicing muslims like the the masses right and with the grace of allah with time allah guided me to pursue knowledge more and then i found that people are benefiting from it in english in arabic that is right and only 12 years ago i was introduced to the arena to make lectures in english which i didn't hesitate a lot because heck nobody knows what i'm going to say in arabic you get people come hey this is wrong but in english whatever you say the people that's nice so alhamdulillah it went on and unfortunately now people are discovering these shortcomings and they're pointing it out no i think we've we've benefited greatly from your efforts we certainly appreciate it let's talk a little bit about physical fitness if you don't mind i i see that you're physically fit i believe you lift weights perhaps you can is is that right um i'm my family is also a a family of athletes so we they are deep in tennis they play tennis professionally and uh i used to do squash and and compete in squash and i've got tournaments and squash before i busted both knees and got both knees operated on oh my goodness that was like last century so so you could tell how old i am and i do table tennis professionally also and i do weight lifting just so that when i travel abroad and i put on the jeans and the t-shirt at least i could look okay i've been doing uh bodybuilding for the past uh 30 years okay and i reached to bench press 100 kgs which is how many pounds shake i was going to ask there's about 225 okay okay i was going to ask okay so but but that was when i seriously when i was young okay but now i'm just trying to keep things uh in perspective i think it's a lost art among many muslims you know staying fit because it does improve even your psychological mental state you know being healthy this needs a lecture but the problem and i don't think you have time the problem with the muslims is balance right see you don't stay in the gym for 10 hours right and then you goof when it comes to your family when it comes to your business money wise and when it comes to your religion you have to balance and that is why the prophet has some said to buddha and also he said that to abdullah allah has rights over you your body has rights over you your wife has rights of you and your guest has rights over you so give each one it's due right so the issue is not going to the gym or not the issue is are you managing to balance your life if you do you're the the happiest muslim around you so paul thank you excellent points sheikh what about any new programs here at hoda tv uh and your ascot is rolling you know uh do you have any new programs in mind or do you have anything any new topics you'd like to address i'm open to all suggestions okay right as as i've said before i'm easy like sunday morning so if the guys come and say listen we need to you to do something in al-qaeda or we need you to do something in jerusalem with the grace of allah allah blessed me with finishing um for uh peace tv okay and i i don't know any one had done this before the whole in english on tv okay so i was blessed by allah azzawajal and i give my gratitude to dr zakir for entrusting me with this mission i can do the same with any other textbook with the grace of allah if allah helps me helps me and wills that for me for huda but the problem is lack of time yeah and lack of resources right and this is what why i always tell people that come and say listen i'm the only one muslim in my family and i'd like to write a will for most islamic organizations so that the money would go to uh the cause of allah i always tell them buy endowments buy buildings and make the revenue go straight to this beneficial media especially al huda huda tv this is the greatest form of deed that you can benefit and reap from while you're in your grave because how many people are watching us five hundred thousand a million what happens if we go to the states in the to europe and broadcast live there imagine about the benefit people would get unfortunately this is not materializing yet but it will with the grace of allah and i have great confidence in allah that he would secure financial resources for huda so that it would allow me to come and dedicate my time to doing something that may benefit the muslims thank you shake and of course the viewers can always get online and contribute to keeping the channel up and running uh inshallah sheikh uh your dawah has taken you all around the world i'm sure you've now traveled to countries that you would never expect you have traveled to can you talk to us about some of the countries you have traveled to and well actually i haven't traveled a lot i've been uh going to the uk a lot okay and it's like 15 20 times very nice country very nice people and they're very uh welcoming and eager to learn i've been to india a gazillion times for the grace of allah and these people just want you to talk non-stop and they benefit and they learn and they question and they send you feedback so it's challenging alhamdulillah i've been to the gulf the emirates too qatar egypt is it has been always there for me um australia hopefully soon if they grant me a visa sheikh assam what about the viewers out there that want to contact you they want to book you do you operate a facebook page they can send you a message for tower questions i mean this sort of thing my facebook page is operated only by me and that is why i seldomly answer back okay so it is awesome hakeem one word okay great that's that's my page and that's my personal page and i think it's also on the fans page i have both okay great okay and um my twitter account is also awesome hakeem one word okay and i also operate this what i do to answer questions is that people have to post their question on my website which is www dot awesome hakeem one word which is aws i am a-l-h-a-k-e-m dot net slash contact okay so they'll find a form put your your question and make sure that you put your email and within 48 hours inshaallah you will get the answer and this is the blessing of allah azza because there is a team that works for the sake of allah voluntarily i am unable to afford them but allah azza will grant them from his mercy and his reward they screened the questions and if it was answered before because i got like 100 questions a day on what's ruling on growing the beard and the the typical answer if you're a female it's not permissible if your mail is okay so instead of reinventing the wheel right they just post the link yeah okay that's a very very uh excellent point uh sheikh we want to also record ramadan's pulse with you i certainly hope you're available in the next couple days while you're in cairo how long are you going to be with us inshallah i'm traveling back sunday morning okay i'll always hope to we're going to really squeeze and get you on all the shows and and record with you as much as we can shake awesome i certainly appreciate your time unfortunately we do have to end the episode but you're always welcome of course here and i want to i look forward to hosting you again in the future and you guys i certainly hope you appreciate this special the special interview with a very special guest sheikh asamit hakeem the host of azkaba a little broadcasting live once a week from jeddah uh so until next time you guys i leave you in the care of allah assalamu alaikum come join us and have your say let's talk about our way remember you are let's talk about our way do"
