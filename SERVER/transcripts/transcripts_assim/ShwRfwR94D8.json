  "transcript": "oh [Music] my name is Hadith number 226 um foreign reported that a man asked the prophet Allah which Islam is the best and a number of hadiths started with the same question yet the outcome is different so the prophet in this Hadith said feed the poor and greet Those whom you know as well as Those whom you do not know but in other hadiths there were different answers why is that Scholars say that the prophet sallallahu answers each individual according to what he needs so one asks for advice the prophet says do not become angry another one asks for advice the prophet says Islam to pray at the beginning of the time and so on depending on the person posing uh this question and in this Hadith it highlights that Islam is a religion of humbleness feed the poor and spread the greetings of Islam to Those whom you know and Those whom you don't know because this is what a true real Muslim is and this is how he behaves chapter 109 deals with Salaam but when the one giving the salaam is not a Muslim so returning a greeting to a disbeliever how do we return the greetings to someone who is not a Muslim [Music] the prophet Allah when the people of the book the Jews and the Christians greeted him he used to say come which means or translates to and upon you okay what's the difference when a Muslim says assalamu alaikum I have to reply by saying so I say and upon you is and emphasize peace and mercy and the blessings of Allah with the disbelievers I must not say this I must only refrain and say and why is that because as I've mentioned earlier it's not permissible for Muslims to pray and ask Allah for Mercy or for Jannah for the disbelievers this cannot be given to the disbelievers we can say to them as we've mentioned in the chapter that deals with sneezing when a disbeliever sneezes we don't say Allah have mercy on you no we go to the other statement or phrase by saying may Allah guide you and rectify your conditions this is the Sunnah and likewise when a non-muslim greets us with the Islamic greeting assalamu alaikum we just reply by alaikum upon the following chapter 110 upon hearing a rooster crow or the braying of a donkey or an ass so what should we say come on even when a rooster crows when a donkey brays I have to say something yes I told you Islam is a holistic religion you deal with everything that's around you that relates you to Allah the prophet says if you hear the craw of a rooster ask Allah for his Bounty for it has seen an angel and if you hear the praying of a donkey seek refuge in Allah for it has seen a devil subhanallah these animals see what the Jinn and the humans do not see so the rooster has an alarm clock that Allah has given it it knows exactly when to set off and roosters are a beloved animals to Allah or Birds because they wake us up for Fajr not only that the awakens wake us up for the hajjud so usually they set off like an hour or so before the break of dawn so when you hear it you go and make wudu and you start to offer prayer it is recommended that you ask Allah from his favors and bounties because it has seen an angel and this means that whenever the angels are around and they are present this is a time for Dura and it's most likely to be answered while donkeys when they Bray although their sounds and voices is the most ugliest of all as mentioned in suratman in the Quran however it has seen in a devil so you seek refuge in Allah whenever you hear that sound what about dogs well Hadith 229 tells us what to do is the prophet said that is awesome if you hear The Barking of dogs or the brain of donkeys at night seek refuge in Allah for they see what you do not meaning the Devils so even the dogs when they bark at night and probably even in the daytime they see the devils and this is why they bark sometimes without any reason this is when you should seek refuge in Allah from all types of evil Ness [Music]"
