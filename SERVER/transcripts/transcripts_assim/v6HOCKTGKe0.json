  "transcript": "alhamdulillah we are still studying the chapter that deals with and we have I believe two hadiths remaining with us in this chapter so Hadith 209 yes brother narrated asked the prophet alaih wasallam I woved in the pre-islamic period of ignorance to stay in for one night in Alam and in another narration a day in the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said to him fulfill your W now in this Hadith we learned that the prophet Alat wasam instructed Omar to fulfill his vow but what is the ruling on making a vow the scholars say making a vow is Mak to pledge something that Allah Asel did not oblige it upon you this is and the prophet saidat that this is only means of extracting from someone who's misery or stingy why usually a person who misery or stingy would not pay sodak but when he has something he needs he says oh Allah if you cure my son I will slaughter a sheep for your sake so he will only do this if Allah answers his supplication or fulfills his need otherwise he will not do it so the prophet is telling us that this is B this is stingy person who only offers charity in exchange for something and we know that once a person pledges himself and vows something then he has to fulfill it as long as it's in Allah's obedience and Allah recommended and complimented those who do this Allah said in that these righteous people they fulfill their vows and they fear a day that the danger of that day is so great now Omar made his vow when he was not Muslim yet the prophet Alat ordered him to fulfill his vow and in one narration he said a night I vowed to stay for a night and in other narrations the scholars said that he did not mention neither a day nor night so what is the ruling on fulfilling such an such a vow it is is a must as long as you committed yourself to it Scholars say that is it required for a Muslim to be fasting if it's not Ramadan some Scholars said it is requirement because there is no without fasting they said however the prophet as mentioned before if you recall offered for 20 days in sha and he he did not or it was not reported to us that he fasted them and therefore as IM says there are no evidences proving that you must be fasting when you do so how long should I make an a day and a night or only a night or only the daytime it depends on what you intended if you said I have a vow to Allah that I will make for one night this meaning from till but if you say I have an one day for Allah this means the whole 24 hours because a day includes the night as well is it permissible to make in any Masid the answer is as long as you pledged or vowed to make that in a Masjid a night or so it is permissible however if you make a pledge for example or a vow to make in the Masjid of Medina can I make it in the Masjid of mecah for example the answer is yes you can how Scholars say what is more rewardable to make in Medina or in meca in meca then you are actually having more of reward but if it's the opposite no if I say I have one night as a vow in Makkah in Haram which the prayer is equivalent to 100,000 can I change my mind and make it in Medina which the prayer is equivalent to 1,000 and the answer is no because it's a lower degree so Scholars say that if you change from low to high it is okay if someone vowed to slaughter a sheep and then he found a cow said well I would like to slaughter a cow instead is this permissible yes it's a higher thing and it is beneficial more and rewardable more so one should always look at things from this perspective and we move on to the second Hadith the Hadith of safia may Allah be pleased with her and this Hadith will be read by mammad safia said the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was doing e in the Masjid and I came to visit him at night and I spoke to him for a while when I wanted to return to my house he escorted me and her house was in ama Z's house two men of the ansar passed by and when they saw the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam they hastened in Walking The Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said take it easy she is safia B the two men wondered saying Subhan Allah oh prophet of Allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said Satan circulates in the body of Adam's Offspring as his blood circulates in it I feared that he may throw evil in your hearts or something the short lessons to be learned is that it is permissible to leave your for a legitimate reason and this legitimate reason was to take safia from the Masjid to her house who is safia saf may Allah be pleased with her her husband her father her uncle were Jews and they betrayed the prophet Alat wasam and they broke all treaties with him and they were executed when there was a war a battle between them and safia may Allah be pleased with her came to the prophet wasam to ask for her freedom and the prophet Alam gave her her Freedom she accepted Islam and the prophet married herat wasam so sopia may Allah be pleased with her came to the prophet to talk to him in the Masjid which means that once you make in the Masid don't be a smart alec and turn off your mobile whenever your wife wants to talk to you you hang up in her face and say no you're allowed to talk to your wife you are allowed to answer her queries if she has any you even are allowed to meet her like safia did so this is a Sunnah we can meet we can talk but no intimacy and after a while she went back to her home and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam walked her to her home on the way two men of Al Anar were walking in their Direction they saw the prophet with a woman so immediately they changed their Direction why this is part of being respectful because you don't want to embarrass the prophet Alam by seeing she's his wife but usually when I see someone with his wife I don't stop and say Salam while his wife is with him out of respect because people are jealous you know maybe if I do this the brother would think that I'm trying to impress his wife or to show off this is normal jealousy that men have so the men Chang their Direction once they changed their Direction and The Prophet saw them he called them take it easy come come and the men stopped and the prophet said this is saf my wife of course she's covered from head to toe and the men were shocked and said Subhan Allah what is this why are you telling this oh prophet of Allah we have no doubt yeah do you think that we think that this is not your wife someone no at all and the prophet said no no no no you misunderstood the devil Satan circulates your body like blood circulates your body and I was afraid that he would throw something just an idea just a hint in your heart that would nullify your Islam because if you doubt the prophet that he's doing this or that what is this an act of blasphemy we have a short break asalam alaykum and welcome back so the prophet Alat wasam was afraid that Shan is there and no one of us can say that is not there we all suffer we all complain of the whispering of Shan from small things to major major major big things some of us may be lucky because the whispering of Shan is only that when a beautiful girl passes by take a glimpse look it's okay looking is free and they what am I doing this is from Shan others problems is in things that may consider to be Blasphemous when he thinks about Allah who created Allah who created the Quran is the Quran created no it is not and they start to have ideas that if they go on with these ideas they go out of the fold of Islam and that is why the prophet saidan comes to you and he says who created The Rock who created the mountain who created the Earth who created the trees and you say Allah Allah Allah and then he says who created Allah he comes to you and then the prophet says if he does say another narration if he comes and says this say I believe in Allah and stop thinking stop thinking about these things because it will destroy your life believe in Allah I don't have to listen whoan is so fearful and he's so caring for me he's advising me now I'm taking El my adviser since when so the prophet is telling us beware of his Whispers and that is why he called these men and told them she is my wife don't get any thoughts now what are the lessons to be learned the lessons are very important your reputation is extremely important not only that if you believe that people would think of you in a wrong way you have to clarify yourself if someone goes to a country and his niece lives in that country and she's not practicing she is completely European and he would like to give her dawa she is his niece huh yeah he is her uncle and he wants to give her da so they go out for dinner in this non-muslim country and they're having dinner there comes one or two of the people who know this brother and they know this brother to be practicing and now they see him in this restaurant with this beautiful blonde young woman now what would the brother do if he does yes yes this is me I am the one look how mat I am I'm strong no you have to go to them and clarify it to them why because the prophet did thisam you have to purify your reputation and save it from anything that tarnishes it this is an Islamic concept so it is essential that when you do something you look at what people think of you and if you feel that they will misjudge you you have to clarify you have to tell them that this is not what it seems because this is what the prophet didat wasam and this shows us that he's merciful he knows himself he knows he's not doing anything wrong but he's merciful so that his brothers his umah would not fall into sin because of him and this is very crucial do we have any questions my question is regarding the and the place where it should be done as you said the last time we met that some Scholars they give the opinion that it can be done only in the three masss as I have possess some of the knowledge of linguistic Arabic for example if I want to say that one pen I say if I want to say two pens two pens we can call it as and for three pens we can call it as similarly for the Masid it can be M M and M so according to the words of the Glorious Quran this mid can refer to the only three mid means Allah subhana T does not say that it's other than the Haram and the M AA so can you please clarify on this this is not as you have understood it because there is a probability and this probability is it might be that only the Quran referred to the three masses but it did not the prophet when he said meaning that the perfect and we have pointed out long ago if you recall that the negation in Islam can be for the origin not to exist or can be for the perfection not to exist and the scholars say that Allah does not mention as a general state for all the Muslims in the world only to refer to three Mass because this is so Allah is mentioning with fasting of Ramadan and he's telling us that you eat and drink until you see the thread of the day you can distinguish it from the dark of the night and do not approach women while you are in seclusion in the mass this is not logical that Allah talks about a general term of fasting and then only limit the in these three mids so that's why the scholars and this is the opinion of our Scholars like and other great Scholars that is probable and is possible and accepted in any m because once you limited to the three M then you have limited a great form of worship only in these places and Allah knows best should the women do can the women do who has the answer with the evidence in the last episode I guess you said the Hadith that was given the permission to to in the mosque yes this is correct but not this Hadith the first Hadith we mentioned is that the prophet used to offer in the last 10 nights of Ramadan and his wives after him meaning after he died their wives continued to make in the Masjid and Scholars say yes it is permissible till today for women to make in Masjid providing that it is safe for her to be there so the Masjid has to be not heavily guarded but it has to be a Masjid where she can be protected if she goes to a Masjid that has no one in it and she's the only one and there are people that do not fear Allah May attack her or harass her then this is not permissible if she is in a Masjid that is occupied by people and there are other women praying with her there is no problem inshallah in that sh as we all know that means total seclusion so is it permissible that we perform in a company or Vis it with a brother or or son in total remembrance of Allah of course no chitchatting or any sort of loose talk is that possible to do in in company with suppose a good friend who is very righteous very Pious in yeah in yeah yeah yeah yeah this is completely permissible a lot of the Muslims go in groups usually most of the Muslims go in groups and I go with a friend or two maybe five but we don't sit in the same place chitchatting no we try our best to stay away or if we stay close together then we do not talk and engage in worldly matters and especially this would be helpful when you go to have lunch if you go and eat alone this is not suitable for some so when you go two or three together you talk on the way and you talk on the coming back this is permissible you're not in anymore and this is okay inshallah she can people sitting in conduct a sermon or have religious talks or D as we are having now in the Masjid itself yes I've stated and noted that it is permissible for a student of knowledge to give a lecture of course he's going to give a lecture to other people in so it's okay for them to attend the lecture and to take notes and not only that it's permissible for them even to discuss afterwards together some of the points mentioned and clarify things to each each other this is all considered part of and part of remembering Allah what is not permissible is to engage all of your day in debating what did Abu hanifah say what did Ahmed say no this is wrong this is right and you go on the whole day discussing these things we have not benefited we wanted to come for for this seclusion to be alone with Allah Asel worshiping him making Vick this is good every now and then an hour or two a day okay but when you have it more than that it takes from its main purpose sh can you comment on people who complete their taravi in six days the Imam reads very fast and we cannot catch what he's reading I believe you're referring to finishing the Quran in 6 days well finishing the Quran is not a Target in Ramadan a lot of the Muslims think that means that you have to finish the Quran in and this is baseless and it's completely wrong what is mostly needed in Ramadan and especially inwi is the understanding so people must pray with understanding with ease with means for others to understand but if the Imam just recites in like 150 M hour and no one understands what he's doing all what they care about is W Mah we finished the Quran this is not rewardable Allah revealed the Quran to be understood and for the people to contemplate on it not to be recited like what people do nowadays with poetry just reading it quickly this is not the way of doing it I'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time oh"
