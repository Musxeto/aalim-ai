  "title": "Can we pray voluntary Salah for our parents after they have passed away?",
  "transcript": "No, this is not from the Sunnah. What you do for your deceased is, one, make dua, as the hadith that Sheikh Salim mentioned yesterday. Number two, give sadaqah, as per the hadith of Sa'd Ibn Ubadah, may Allah be pleased with him. Number three and four, do umrah and hajj, either personally or pay someone to do it for umrah or hajj al-badal. So sadaqah has underneath so many things, building an orphanage, a masjid, printing a Qur'an, buying Qur'ans, printing beneficial knowledge, digging a well, feeding the poor, the sky is the limit. But praying two rak'ahs, no. Fasting, it's an issue of dispute. The most authentic opinion, you can fast only if the deceased had left overs. He did not make up for a vow or a missed Ramadan, etc. Then his heirs can do that for him, but not voluntary prayer or voluntary fasting and the likes, and Allah knows best."
