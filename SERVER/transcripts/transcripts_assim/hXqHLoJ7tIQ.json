  "transcript": "oh [Music] Lord you may be driving and may Allah forbid may Allah protect all of us a car comes inevitably it's going to crash and it's horrible what do people usually say unfortunately a lot of the Muslims May curse what or say bad words well the prophet Allah whenever he was startled he would say Allah it shows you how connected his heart is with Allah azzawajal even when he wakes up in the middle of the night startled because of a prophecy he had seen he says so many hadiths this is what must be on our tongues all the time remembering Allah azzawajal none has the right to be worshiped except Allah we move on to a different chapter that deals with what to say when offering a sacrifice Hadith number 246 the prophet Allah used to say whenever he wanted to sacrifice that is to slaughter an animal he says Bismillah in the name of Allah and Allah is the greatest so you must say Bismillah this is the Sunnah if you say just Bismillah this suffices Akbar oh Allah it is from you and belongs to you so this sacrifice I'm offering who gave it to me it's you so I'm offering it back to you o Allah accept this from me this is the Sunnah now the following chapter deals with a different situation altogether and that is what to say to ward off the deception of the shaytans the devils when they are trying to do things to confuse you or to harm you so the prophet Islam taught us this long Dua Allah foreign foreign [Music] I take refuge within Allah's perfect words we've always explain perfect words to be the Quran to be the words that Allah commands the universe by all the words written in the preserved tablets I seek or I take refuge within Allah's perfect words which no righteous or unrighteous person can transgress from all the evil that he has created made and originated I take refuge from the evil that descends from the sky and the evil that rises up to it I take refuge from the evil that is spread on earth and the evil that Springs from it and I take refuge from the evil of the tribulations of night and they and the evil of one who visits at night except the one who brings good oh merciful one total connection I'm intimidated I'm afraid but I would not let this deter me from seeking Allah's protection by this beautiful Dua then seeking forgiveness and repentance and we've been through this and we've said this before that the prophet Allah used to say and this is Hadith number 248. by Allah I seek forgiveness and I and repent to Allah more than 70 times a day so the prophet is swearing and he doesn't need to we believe him but he's telling us o people seek Allah's forgiveness and repent to him for I myself would by Allah I do this myself this is an encouragement for us to go and repeatedly ask Allah for forgiveness not only that the prophet said in Hadith number 249. foreign to Allah verily I Repent to him a hundred times a day and by the way 70 or 100 some Scholars say that when 70 and more is mentioned it's not a specific number rather it is used by the Arab to indicate so much like we say a gazillion there's not such a a number as a gazillion but 70 or 70 000 mirrors that means that it's it's an infinite number it's so huge that we are not able to count it and some say no 70s 70. so this is one of the ways of combining between the two uh hadiths the following Hadith the prophet Allah also said Hadith 250. foreign whoever says I seek Allah's forgiveness beside whom none has the right to be worshiped except he the ever living the self subsisting and supporter of all and I turn to him in Repentance so this is very concise whoever says this what would happen Allah would forgive him even if he was one who fled during the advance of an enemy and this is an issue of dispute among Scholars whether these ascar expiate and erase and forgive major sins or minor sins the majority that they erase minor sins because major sins require repentance so how would we combine we would combine by saying that whoever says this Dua while having the intention to repent that Allah would forgive all of his sins even the major one and Allah azzawajal Knows Best with this we come to the conclusion or of our episode I leave you here Manila was [Music]"
