  "transcript": "uh Jeff my question is some people in my family that are older than me they do some form of things and our owners I want to tell them that they didn't harm things to any respect for money how do I do it well there is an art for dawa and Allah azzawajal praised Prophet Muhammad alaihissalam in the Quran in chapter three it is by the mercy of Allah that you are soft with them had you been rude and hard-hearted they would have dispersed away from you so Point number one be soft and lenient and this is also mentioned in the Quran by the terminology Fair preaching so it's not rude preaching it's not Simon says you have to do this I'm not speaking to the people from my Ivory Tower I'm going down to their level being diplomatic being a wise knowing when to choose how to give and when to give advice is very crucial this comes with great amount of knowledge and experience it comes by asking the elders asking the scholars the students of knowledge it's not just dump all the information you have on them and say I did my due diligence I told him this is Haram no you have to prioritize sometimes you have to turn a blind eye to some of their sins in order to focus on a particular sin that you think is most important and address it instead of listing 20 sins that they're doing and telling them don't do this don't do this don't do this and the end of the day they would not listen or adhere to any of them so it's an art it's a science it's a gift from Allah that you have to ask Allah every time in sujud and at the times of where on Allah says your Dua so that Allah would make it easy for you to open their hearts"
