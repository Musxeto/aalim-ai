  "transcript": "Adrian from Serbia. Assalamu Alaikum. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. So is it permissible to clean mobile phones sir and door handles and other things with alcohol or ethanol and is alcohol pure? It is permissible to use alcohol to sterilize and to clean objects regardless of what these objects are and whether alcohol is pure or not the answer is yes it is pure what is the difference of opinion in is wine or intoxicants so if we're talking about scotch whiskey brandy rum tequila vodka whatever this is what we have to look into whether the scholars say it is najis impure or not and it's an issue of dispute but alcohol as alcohol this is pure we sterilize our hands doctors use to sterilize their equipment and themselves before going into an operation and the likes and there's no problem in using that"
