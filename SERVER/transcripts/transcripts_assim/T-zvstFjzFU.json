  "title": "The worst of all calamities? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "but rather be poor but be able to walk, be able to see, be able to eat. If your calamity is in your health, praise Allah Azza Wa Jal that it is not in your religion. The worst of all calamities is in that in people's religion. Wallahi, thumma wallahi, thumma wallah. To lose every single penny in your pocket, to lose your wife and your children, to lose everything you possess but to maintain on Islam is better than to keep it and lose your Islam. Why? Because at the end of the day you're dead. We are all walking dead. When are we going to die? Huh, how old are you uncle? He says I'm 90. So how long you think you're going to live? I've heard of Nuh, he lived 950 years so I think I have another 860. Ya Shaykh, come on, you're dying. Everybody thinks that I still have some overtime, I have spare time, maybe another 10 years, over 20 years. At the end of the day what will happen? You're dead. So when you manage to understand that the best and most valuable asset is your religion, whatever you lose is okay. Alhamdulillah I pray five times a day, I pray Fajr on time, I pray Witr, I fast, I give charity and I'm content with whatever Allah Azza Wa Jal decrees. You are in Jannah inshallah."
