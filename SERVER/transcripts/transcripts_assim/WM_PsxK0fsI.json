  "transcript": "Schneider of Minerva he al hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa salamu of al qaeda I believe he was early I mean nabina muhammad in Vienna he or sahbihi ajma'in dear brothers and sisters in Islam assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh hadith number 24 in the series of elaborate and Noah we the 40 hadith compiled by Alan ma'am and Noah we this hadith was narrated by abu dharr el Rothery may allah be pleased with him he said that the Prophet said adding his salatu salam Allah the Almighty said now is this a hadith or is it or an because the Prophet said erase salif's am Allah the Almighty said this is known as al-hadith l could see meaning that this is hadith the Prophet reports sallallahu selim but Allah said yet it is not or an therefore we have these three categories the Quran which is the word of Allah given to gibreel revealed to the Prophet sallallahu alayhi assalam the Quran is the word of Allah not created this is the attribute of Allah Almighty and your prayer is invalid without it where the hadith Qudsi is the word of Allah however it is not similar to the Quran in the sense that you cannot recite it in the prayer and if you recite it in the prayer your prayer is invalid but is from Allah Almighty the Prophet says alehissallaam allah the almighty says all my servant I have forbidden vuln which is injustice I have forbidden volume upon myself and I have made it forbidden amongst you so do not oppress one another all my servants all of you are astray except those whom I have guided so seek guidance from me and I shall guide you all my servants all of you are hungry except those whom I have fed so seek food from me and I shall feed you all my servants all of you are naked except those whom I have closed so seek clothing from me and I shall close you all my servants you commit sins by day and by night and I forgive all sins so seek forgiveness from me and I shall forgive you all my servants you will not attain harming me so as to harm me and you will not attain benefiting me so as to benefit me all my servants if the first and the last of you the humans and the jinn love you if they were all as pious as the most pious heart of any individual amongst you then this would not increase my kingdom my Dominion a thing all my servants if the first and the last of you the humans and the jinns among you we're all as wicked as the most wicked heart of any individual amongst you then this would not decrease my kingdom a thing all my servants if the first and the last of you the human and the jinns of you we're all to stand together in one place and ask of me and I were to give every one and each one of them what he requested then that would not decrease what I possess except what is decrease of the ocean when a needle is dipped into it all my servants it is bought your deeds that I account for you and then recompense you for so who finds good let him praise Allah let him say alhamdulillah and he who finds other than that let him blame no one but himself and this hadith was reported by lemma Muslim in the sahih this beautiful hadith is long yet it revolves on acknowledging the towhead of Allah in aruba beer and a towhead of Allah in Alleluia and his beautiful names and attributes so it revolves around a toe heat a lot of Almighty is praising himself Allah the Almighty is showing us in detail what we are heedless of the Almighty begins with stating that he is capable of inflicting injustice he is capable of being unfair because all what you see belongs to Allah Azza WA JAL therefore whatever he does no one has the right to hold him accountable or to question his deeds and therefore if Allah wanted to annihilate all of this universe and what lives in it no one can say this is unfair no one can question allah azza wajal but allah almighty with his grace made injustice forbidden for himself so upon himself he made it forbidden meaning that he had said it he had acted upon it and no injustice will ever be shown from Allah sight and once you believe this and once you understand this this puts you at ease because so many times people get these whispers from Shaitaan telling them why is this happening when there is a disaster when there is a tsunami where an earthquake or a volcanic eruption children die innocent people we see die Shaytan casts his doubts why Allah is killing the children this is unfair what had they done and Subhan Allah no one has the right to judge Allah or to question allows actions if you believe that Allah is fair and just and in this hadith we take this because Allah is word stated that he made volum or injustice forbidden upon himself so if you believe in this and if you believe that Allah is the most wise analyse the most knowledgeable and if you believe that everything you see belongs to Allah then you become free of these doubts and you feel at ease your heart is at ease and you feel the tranquility why because you understand what you see is definitely not what you think so you would never have these doubts because you believe that Allah is always fair and always just and this is part of his justice the children if they die they'll go to paradise no problem non-stop but this is a calamity analyse testing the parents are less testing their relatives Allah is testing you who are watching and at the same time you're complaining so first of all injustice is not a question that you can ask about a larger Allah made that forbidden upon himself therefore he made it also forbidden upon the humans so that they would not oppress one another and oppressing one another would be either by shedding blood or taking their wealth or slandering them in their reputation and all of these three are haram as the prophets erase or some speech that Allah has made these three things Haram as the day of Hajj we are in is Haram in the month of Hajj which is a sacred month and in the sacred land so it is not permissible for you to have any form of oppression against your fellow Muslim in these three categories and scholars say that there are three big files big record books of zone among the people so there is a record book of injustice that Allah never forgives and this is sheer this belief associating others a lot a lot whoever commits an act of such and dies without repenting Allah would never forgive this and he would toss him in Hellfire for eternity the second record book is the sins that an individual does between him and Allah so if you sit in your home and you watch forbidden things you listen to forbidden things you drink intoxicants on your own things are between you and Allah Azza WA JAL these are up to Allah and Allah can forgive all of them and could care less soprano Atala this is up to the most forgiving the third record book is the Volm the injustice that is between you and the fellow men and this has to be clarified and reconciled on the day of judgment so if I made forms of aggression towards another Muslim if I beat him if I took his money if i BAC bit him if I did any of these bad things it will all haunt me and come back to me on the day of judgement and I have to give from my own good deeds to him and these are the three record books of volume as stated by the scholars now the Prophet are a solid stone tells us that Allah says all mankind are misguided are going astray they are all ignorant and without allah guidance no one can be guided and that is why we supplicate Yenisei autonomous talking guide us to the straight path every single prayer and that is why we say in there are absolute in which allah who medina FEMEN had a guide us among those who you have I did and the Prophet had in salatu salam the majority of his supplication was that o Allah Turner of the hearts turn my heart to be on your straight path and to be on your religion without asking Allah for guidance without the guidance of Allah we will be all astray we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah

hungry I was full stomach I have a lot of food in my fridge I'm not hungry well actually you are hungry and ignorant as well do you think that the food you have is something that you have produced yourself how many farmers cultivate their land throw the seed irrigate it put the fertilizers and in the end of the day nothing comes out or the crops come out but don't stay out for long because of the freezing weather cause of the drought or because of so many reasons so who is the one who gives you food when you look at a bottle of milk did you get the milk from the cow yourself did the cow produce the milk itself or it had to eat the grass that Allah brought for that cow so that Allah would make from that grass milk that would be put in the bottle and would be brought to you how many people worked on a piece of grain how many people worked on the ball of cereal that you eat every morning every one of us is hungry because we don't have anything unless allah azzawajal provides it for us and that is why allah the almighty says so ask me for food and I will feed you these things we take for granted we never look at it seriously when we have dry fruit and we eat the man who brought it to me I would say thank you but it is not him who brought it it is Allah who gave it to me it is allah azza wajal that made the whole universe work so that it can be produced and I can consume it but we take things for granted the food we eat the restaurants we go to the candies even the water Allah says in surah tilapia is it you who brought the water down from the clouds or is it us definitely it is Allah if Allah wished this water would not be sweet and drinkable it would be salty it would be undrinkable so we have to ask Allah Azza WA JAL to feed us because without him we have no food Allah says all of you are naked I'm not naked I'm fully dressed when I came from my mother's womb I was butt-naked not only that I did not know anything well ah whoo ah Raja coming Buitoni on my heart accumulated ammunition Allah got us from our mother's womb with new knowledge and look at me healthy strong brave smart I have a university degree I have a good job I have money I have this is it because of you yes no it is from a lot when you came out to this world you knew nothing you understood nothing Allah taught you Allah brought you up Allah gave you all of this and what do you do you say alhamdulillah or you send with the things that he provided to you instead of showing your gratitude you're showing your Cooper you're showing your arrogance and disbelief by not thanking the one who gave it to you so ask Allah to close you we ask Allah to clothe us and Allah would clothe us as well and then all of this the food the clothings without allah azza wajal we we are poor and we have nothing so all what you see is from Allah the Almighty the blessings that we are living in it is from Allah the all-mighty and this is part of Allah generosity that he shows us how deep in need we are to him so that we are never heedless from this fact and Allah tells us that mankind by default they are sinful they sin in the day there is the morning and they sin at night so what to do this is human nature Allah says to us no one can forgive your sins except Allah so seek my forgiveness and I'll forgive you seek my forgiveness so ask yourself how many times do you ask Allah for forgiveness seek forgiveness of what or from what from your sins but I have so many even though I have serious major sins no problem do not be despaired of Allah's mercy for Allah forgives all types of sin he's most forgiving and merciful subhanahu wata'ala never despair always keep on asking Allah for forgiveness and Allah the Almighty would forgive you the Prophet sallallaahu Salim tells us that prayer to prayer Ramadan to Ramadan Juma Friday to Friday what's between them is forgiving Allah is most forgiving if you know him but if you don't if you're ignorant if you're heedless then you have a problem of course we're not going to go into details whether the forgiveness is for major and minor sense or not but the most authentic opinion is that major sins require repentance so you don't go to the bar every single day and at night say oh Allah forgive me and then you go the following day and you don't have any remorse or you don't show any repentance Allah would not forgive you because this is a major sin it needs repentance and it needs showing remorse minor sins are forgiven as long as you pray as long as you do what Allah said that by avoiding major sins Allah forgives the minor sins Allah Azza WA JAL is mighty and he is strong and among his names you have the name of Allah zis the old powerful soprano Allah which means that no one can harm Allah and no one can benefit Allah Almighty so being mindful of this you know that if Allah is with you you have got everything and if Allah is not with you you have lost everything so no one can harm Allah no one can bring benefit to allah azza wajal it is Allah Almighty who does this to you and then Allah says all my servants if all of you rich and poor young and old if all of you jinn and humans were practicing we're pious and virtuous you are all in accordance to the heart of the best of you this would not add anything to my kingdom or to my Dominion nothing and do you think Allah so L benefits from our forms of worship do you think when we spotted these sacrifices to Allah that allows the Orajel would have them in his kingdom as trophies or booties of war no all of these are for you all our prayers or our sacrifices or what we do is for us it would not increase in 'unless kingdom and likewise if the whole of humanity and the jinn the first and the last were all wicked we're all disbelievers were all bad and evil people this would not reduce a single iota from Allah's kingdom and Allah wealth and we understand from these sentences that if you do well or if you do sin this would not affect Allah the Almighty how you should try your level best to do good deeds and to stay away from sin and when it comes to wealth Allah tells us that if every single person if every single living teacher jinn humans etc we're to stand in one place and ask Allah what I would ask from Allah I would ask for the whole earth I would like cars I'd like women I'd like children I'd like palaces I'd like gold and gold and gold I like a lot of money that would never end and Allah gives it to me and he gives that to all the trillions of his creation who asked him similarly if Allah gave all of us what we wanted Allah tells us that this would not reduce or deduct anything from my kingdom why because it's still your kingdom we're still in your Dominion not only that he said except that a needle would be dipped in an ocean and then taken out how much water has been reduced from that ocean nothing no one can even count it or look at it and it's the same thing with Allah Almighty if he were to give all of us creation what they want so Allah is so rich that it's beyond our imagination yet we still feel that we're deprived Allah is not giving us enough and this is part of our great ignorant not knowing Allah not knowing these beautiful attributes and that is why if you know that Allah is fair and just and that Allah would never oppress people or have injustice done to them because he made that forbidden upon himself then you should know that if you do well you will be rewarded well and if you do evil and if you don't obey and if you go against Allah's will then you have only yourself to blame and that is why Allah so gently concluded the hadith Qudsi by saying if you find good things then praise Allah because it is not you who these things or it is not you who did it alone it is the guidance of Allah when I pray and finish my prayer I wouldn't say wow I feel good I managed to pray no it is Allah Almighty who guided me and allowed me to pray so I would say alhamdulillah but if you find something that is evil and bad in your record book on the day of judgement you have only yourself to blame because Allah facilitated things for you Allah showed you the path and the way Allah gave you the freewill and you chose that path then blame no one except yourself this is all the time we have until we meet next time via mandala assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh you"
