  "transcript": "Sheila rahmanir rahim alhamdu lillahi rabbil aalameen sallallahu wasallam mubarak-era abbe de la raza de nabina muhammad ali he was a beech mein I'm back assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh hadith number 160 is still regarding the issue of washing the deceased so how to wash people who had died last time we met we've explained it briefly but I hope in sha Allah thoroughly in a fashion that would give you enough knowledge on how to do it if this was going to happen to any of your friends or loved ones and you were invited to participate and I do advise you to participate whenever you can because this softens the heart unfortunately we do not see well I don't know if it's fortunate you are unfortunately but this is a fact we do not see a lot of deaths we're not exposed to a lot of deaths and death is inevitable one would say may Allah make it far and away from us how far all those you know are going to die and you yourself you're going to die as well so it adds a lot of value for you to learn how rotten how cheap this life is and this is manifested mostly when you wash a dead person once you see that this man who was full of life and power and energy all of a sudden the power is turned off and he's dead so while you're washing him this gives you a big experience it softens your heart when you go out and return to your home you start to realize that this life is only a transit you're not here to stay you have to remember this you are not in this life to stay and therefore we should focus and we should try to wash dead people whenever it is possible for the experience and for softening our hearts hadith number 160 narrated by if near bus brazil on why the main was standing in alpha he fell off his camel and was killed so the prophet sallallahu wasallam said wash him with water and syd and shout him in two pieces of cloth and neither perfume him nor cover his head for Allah will resurrect him on the Day of Resurrection and he will be saying lebesgue in another narration don't cover his head or his face now this hadith is referring to an incident that had taken place at the time of the prophet alayhi salatu salam where a man in hajj or umrah wearing the clothes of a rom it so happened that he fell off his camel and broke his neck and died and it's it's very funny what are the odds of you horse riding or driving your bike like a lot of the people do and having fun and go maybe dirt biking and do a wheelie on one wheel and jump to three meters in the air or riding a camel or riding an elephant when you do this do you think that it's a possibility that you're going to fall and die never never me die doing this this is silly yet this man in hatch simple this is like riding a car he does this every day riding the camel he simply felt down broke his neck he's dead do you think that he was hoping to go back to medina to his family and to his children yes do you think that he has money to give to people and money to take from people as loans yes he has lots of obligations but it was over the Prophet said that a kiss a lot was salaam wash him with water and load tree or leutis so we wash him like all the dead as we mentioned last time yet the Prophet said do not perfume him so a man who dies in the state of ROM cannot be perfumed why because he's still in the state of a hub not only that he should not be shrouded in three pieces as we've stated he should be shrouded in only two which are the clothes that he's wearing the Muharram how many pieces is he wearing so these are the two that he must be shrouded in yet the Prophet said Alice salatu salam and beware do not cover his head another narration do not cover his face why because a muslim is not allowed to cover his head is that true it is not permissible for a mushroom to cover his head but he may carry an umbrella and the funny thing is that in hatch we have deviant sex that when they perform how they do it in buses without any roofs on top it is so funny to see them going and hatch in their masses and buses without any roof and the Sun is so hot why are you doing this suggest because the Muharram is not entitled to cover his head this is not covering your head the Prophet Alice of Salaam in the authentic hadith spent the day of arafah in a tent at the very beginning so do you sleep in a tent do you sleep in the house or you sleep in the open so now we sleeping in the house and in a tent ok what about travelling in a bus it's only just showing off it shows you how smart people some people are when they are not following this one anyhow so the Prophet told them do not cover his head and another narration nor his face why look at the justification because on the day of resurrection on the day of judgment he will be resurrected as a mullah be what is meaning of Willoughby he's the person who says labbayk allahumma labbayk libecki la sharika laka labbayk so a pilgrim or a man in the state of ROM he is the one who's always repeating these words meaning that I am coming to Allah I am answering your call or Allah every grace and every praise is due to you Allah so the day of judgment people would see him and know that he died while performing a mirage in the state of a romp and this is how people will be resurrected on the day of judgment the Prophet tells us that the martyr ali salabhasana the marcher will be resurrected on the day of judgment with his blood with his wound bleeding yet the color is red the color of blood but the smell is the smell of musk and the prophet alayhi salatu salam told us that those who break their promises and those who cheat and deceive others will be resurrected on the day of judgment with a flag coming next to their backside and this flag shows that this is a person who deceives and cheats and lies so everyone would be resurrected on the day of judgment with the good deeds or the bad deeds showing on him remember the more advan those who call for the salat they'll be resurrected with the longest necks so people would identify them that these are the people who used to call for prayer what a beautiful and noble profession and likewise this person who died in the state of Iran now having said that one would may ask and say is this the only person to be shrouded in his two clothes set of clothes and the answer is no we know that there are certain people when they die we cannot wash them and we cannot shroud them with different types of clothes and they are to be buried in their own clothes and those are the martyrs but who are the martyrs because we have a hadith where the Prophet tells us at a solid wassalam those who died protecting their lives their families their religion or their wealth they are martyrs those who died when a building falls on them forward who died in a fire or those who died drowning they are martyrs those who die with an illness in their stomachs so like a liver cancer may Allah protect us all or any cancer in your intestines those who die with an illness that causes internal bleeding or a tumor those who died while in labor women who died in labor the Prophet also told us that they are what martyrs so are we to treat them as we treat those who died in the cause of Allah and in the battlefield this is what we will find after the break so stick assalaamu alaikum and welcome back so who are to be treated as a martyr when it comes to funeral rites scholars agree that it's only the person who dies while fighting the enemies who dies in the battlefield but others are rewarded like a martyr but are treated as normal people in a sense that they're washed their shrouded they preyed upon funeral prayer and they're buried while the martyrs who died in battlefield they are not washed their shrouded in their own clothes and funeral prayer is not performed on them because they do not need people to intercede for them they intercede for others so they are buried like this however who is considered to be a martyr that is treated in such a way scholars say it is those who died on the battlefield or because of the suffering of this wound so if a person dies on the battlefield he's a martyr but if a person is injured and he is taken to hospital and he spends in hospice a couple of weeks where he eats and drinks and being treated and then dies of this wound is he a martyr he is not a martyr the martyr is who dies directly due to this injury and they say if a person is capable of eating not drinking thinking is permissible if a person drinks and then dies of his wound he's a martyr but if he eats this means that his death was not directly caused by the injury it is a cause but he had the time to eat and maybe spend the day or to an hour or two yet he did not die in the battlefield due to direct cause of the injury he's not considered to be a martyr in the sense that we wash him we shroud him we pray on him and we bury him but the reward the sha Allah is is there one does not say that no he will not get the reward no he will get the reward but we do not treat him as a martyr as such and from this hadith we know that it is a great deal to die while offering good deeds to die while you are in the state of Iran is extremely rewarding because this means that this was the last thing you have done and you remember that the Prophet said that deeds are judged by their conclusion which as in the hadith of the line wrote a man could do well as it appears to the people for 60 years and just before he dies he does something bad that makes him enter hell and he's among the people of help and another man may do bad things and bad since for 60 years and just before he dies Allah guides him to do something well and he dies doing that and he goes to paradise so it is extremely important to know that these are by their conclusions they are judged by what is the last and final of them this man died while he is a mahram likewise if a person travels long distances to acquire knowledge to learn the Dean and he dies then also he will be among those who will be resurrected and his reward would be continuous until the day of judgment one thing that we supposed to mention those who we would like to bury but it is not enough for them to be covered in their clothes what to do the prophet alayhi salatu salam on the battle of a hood when was habanero made and hamza even abdomen polyp died they tried to shroud them and cover their bodies with their clothes but it was not sufficient so what did the prophet order them to do they put leaves of trees to cover the areas because whenever they cover the head the feet would be exposed and whenever they have a defeat the head would be exposed so they covered the feet with leaves of trees and this is when we cannot cover the body properly do we have any questions before going on yes the brother on top / Islam as we know through history amara know he was assassinated in the photo prayer so after a few days he died because of the wound so will he be considered as a person who died on battlefield and will his reward or is what you be as the one we Shaheed what do you think runners basin once the Prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam with umar a day alone abubakar see tigre de Lana news mundo del on they were on a mountain and the Prophet sallallahu wasallam said that on this there is an ax be acidic and to shaheed so from this we come to know that prophet had given him the glad tidings of being a martyr so what his death was a death of a martyr okay then this hadith shows that they were Omar was a Shaheed however my question to you was he washed and shrouded and preyed upon or was he buried in his clothes anyone yes he was shouted and preyed upon which means that he was not treated as a Shaheed why because I clearly pointed out that the Shaheed who is not washed and shrouded and preyed upon is the one who dies on the battlefield now being Shaheed means that he was assassinated and he will get the reward of a Shaheed like the one who dies in fire or the one who dies if the house collapse upon him but he will not be treated as a Shahid in the sense that he would not be washed no we wore shame without him and we offer funeral prayer any more questions yes brother Salam aleikum Salam is goosal recommended for the person who perform go solo on the deceased that's a good question at the beginning it was mandatory the Prophet said a disruption whoever washes a deceased person must perform whistle and whoever carries a funeral must perform voodoo but then this was abrogated later on and it is not mandatory it is recommended but not mandatory if you don't do it you don't have to do it and if you carry a funeral you don't have to perform model again yes rolla a strong liquid salam if an infant or a child who has not attained puberty dies what is the procedure to worry the funeral procedure for a child and infant or a child who did not reach age of puberty is exactly the same he is to be washed he is to be shrouded is to be preyed upon and he is to be buried however scholars say that if the child girl or boy were below the age of seven years of age then it is permissible for men to wash a girl and it is permissible for women to wash a boy because they say that below seven years of age they do not have our so it is okay for men to wash a girl who is five years old six years old and it's okay for women to wash a boy who is five or six years of age though it's recommended that we keep on the segregation but they say that below seven there is no aura that is respected such children in normal cases do not stir any desire or lost unfortunately nowadays this might be different because people's souls are corrupt and we know about child molesters and and these sick perverts who may have these ideas therefore it's best to segregate but scholars say that if a man wanted to wash his daughter who is five years or six years of age this is permissible and there's nothing wrong in that yes brother I have seen cases that some people do not cook non-vegetarian when the person dies in their houses they don't cook non vegetarian for 40 days please clarify that this is all not part of the Sunnah whenever we see any practice and we do not know whether it's permissible or not we ask is this backed by the Quran or sooner if they say no then we know that it is part of the innovation why don't you cook meat in your house for 40 days likewise if someone says after 40 days of the death of our loved ones we would like to commemorate his death by throwing a lunch or a dinner and inviting our relatives we say this is vida this is why simple the Prophet did not do it and this is coming from the Pharaohs they commemorate their dead on the 40th day because they think that when the Pharaoh dies and they bury him in his pyramids they usually put treasures and food and horses because they believe that on the 40th day he will be resurrected so they commemorate their deceased on the 40th day unfortunately Muslims nowadays do the same and not only that they also commemorate their dead after one year and maybe they will have a five feet or a ten year what is this I'm going to spend my life remembering those who died this is not part of the sooner it is an innovation a clear innovation that we should be far away from do we have any special day or special light where we are advised to go to the graveyard because we have one day which is celebrated as savvy bharath where it is said that is a night of the death and we should go to the and usually people go and visit the graveyard how far it's true this is not true this is an innovation there is no special day to visit or special time to visit the graves it's an open topic or an open date but if you relate it to something this becomes an innovation so if you relate visiting the debt on Fridays and you say that this is good or related to eat and say that every day I have to go and visit my grandfather or my uncle or you related to later to Israel Minaj or to the middle of Shaban all of this is considered to be innovations and it is not permissible for you to do this is all the time we have until we meet next time fee amanillah assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
