  "transcript": "Abu Rayyan from Senegal Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaykum Sheikh my question is I would like an advice on how to deal with parents and relatives who are Sufis and are part of the Tijaniyya sects Like really deep into it, doing almost everything, even some of them go to his grave and ask him things And when I try to explain them some certain things, they tell me that they know better than me, that I shouldn't say anything So I would like to know how to deal with that Abu Rayyan, unfortunately, this is the dividing line between true Islam and hypocrisy A true Muslim is someone who submits his will to Allah Unfortunately, when brought up in such an environment where you're brainwashed and you're influenced by peers And everyone around you does this as we spoke in previous episodes of this series That all the scholars they know use this tariqah and do these innovations And probably go to these graves and do shirk But this is all what they see in front of them This is why it is quite challenging to call them back to Islam Unless you are equipped with sincerity, with proper knowledge and with diplomacy and wisdom Sincerity because Allah Azza wa Jal opens closed hearts with it Because you're addressing them from heart to heart And Allah makes that works Knowledge because if you speak to them by saying, Oh Sheikh, Islam said so and so Ibn al Qayyim said so and so They shrug their shoulders and say we have half a dozen of other scholars who say differently And they come cheaper by the dozen So your scholars against or versus our scholars Let's see who wins This wouldn't work Rather go back to the Quran To Allah's word This is something no one can argue Though there are some hypocrites who would argue When you show them a verse from the Quran or an authentic hadith or hadiths Overwhelming proofs and evidences They would have the audacity to say Yes, but is it possible that our scholars did not know about this? Or do not know about this? So they blind follow their scholars and reject the Quran and the Sunnah This is true hypocrisy Total hypocrisy Deep down inside they're not Muslims When you show them what Allah said and the Prophet Muhammad said And they acknowledge but they reject On the basis that their scholars know better Where is Islam? It's nowhere to be found with them However, this is how you should be equipped with knowledge from the Quran and the Sunnah Don't use scholars names that they don't approve of Because that would be a point against you Wisdom and diplomacy is also needed because you need to know when to address them If you address a group of people They'll be like wild hyenas They'll be like jackals attacking olive at the same time But if you try to give one to one da'wah That would open that individual's heart Much, much more than addressing a group of people Where they will collaborate against you And among other things So you do your level best Make a lot of dua in sujood and the times of acceptance And Allah will open their hearts, no doubt"
