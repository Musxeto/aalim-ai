  "transcript": "this is the arabic word for prostration of recitation there are a number of places in the quran 14 or 15 and in these verses once we read it it is highly recommended for us to perform sujud prostration so how many and how to perform it well the most authentic opinion without going into details that it is one prostration and you say allahu akbar and you go down whether you're sitting standing whatever you don't have to stand up if you're sitting or sit up if you're lying down no from what position you are well actually if you're lying down you have to sit so that you can prostrate so you say allahu akbar and you prostrate and you say subhana rabbil allah three times or whatever dua afterwards you would like to make without any problem after you finish you raise your head without takbir and you do not offer salam so it's only one tech beer when you go to prostrate now as i said to brother tawfiq i'll be generous today so i will tell you that you don't have to be in the state of wudhu you don't have to face the qibla but if you do that's good you don't have to be covering your aura even whoa whoa what is this sheikh what are you getting this covering the facing the qibla being in the state of purity tahara these are conditions for what for salat for prayer define prayer for me please it is inaugurated by takabiratul iran concluded by salam with specific actions and words to be said in a particular way with the intention of worshiping allah azzawajal good mashallah 100 correct is it like any of this no so this is not part of the prayer you can do it after fajr you can do it after assad at the time of prohibition without any problem because it is not prayer this is why yes it's highly recommended to be in the state of udo to face the qibla to be covering your aura but if you don't none of this is mandatory and your sujda is totally valid"
