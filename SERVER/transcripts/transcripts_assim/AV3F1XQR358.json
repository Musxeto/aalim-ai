  "title": "How does the time in Al Barzakh pass? Grave - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "hamdan says how does the time in barzar past is it similar to ours is it 100 years going to feel like 100 years or is it going to feel like few moments I have no idea I haven't tried it yet but what Allah mentioned in the Quran that when they're asked about their life on Earth they would say it was merely a moment or half of that half a day maybe so this is regarding their life in on Earth but in the barzar we don't know whether they feel the passing of time or not and this is something that would not benefit us a lot"
