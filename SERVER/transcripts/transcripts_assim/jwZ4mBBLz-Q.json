  "title": "Sharing memes that have edited pictures of real people or drawn images, permissible? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "is it prohibited to share memes that have edited pictures of real people or drone images i'm not making them or anything but just sharing first of all this is inappropriate because memes usually are made to make fun and mocking people and making fun of them is un-islamic secondly editing pictures and we've said this before like using photoshop to make me look younger to make my beard blacker to remove some wrinkles in my face etc this is prohibited because it is altering and changing the creation of allah although you did not make it using it would be endorsing such a thing and this is not permissible and allah azzawajal knows best"
