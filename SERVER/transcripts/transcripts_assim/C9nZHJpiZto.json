  "title": "Is it Sunnah to say Alhamdulillah after Burping? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "so hyb says i see many people especially belonging to the subcontinent saying alhamdulillah as soon as they burp just like the case in sneezing is this from the Sunnah to burp and say alhamdulillah these are things that people pick up from one another and this is unfortunate you see when you don't have knowledge you tend to imitate anything new that you see thinking that is good not knowing that this is an innovation and I'll give you an example in the message where I pray Feder after concluding Fajr prayer people said to make their ask our there was a particular individual that after doing his f car all of a sudden he falls frustrating for about a minute or two prolonging this frustration and then he stands up and leaves few days later two or three people started adopting this practice and all of this is because they saw that person and they thought Shaitaan comes to them and he makes them think that whoa what a nice form of showing your humbleness to allah azza wajal not knowing that this is an innovation so if you don't stop if you don't refer back to the people of knowledge and ask them is this practice okay for you or is it an innovation then you will be in trouble likewise when people burp so this burping is the result of a full stomach and when you have a full stomach this calls you to praise Allah so whenever you burp you say alhamdulillah what about if you yawn so if you yawn this is the result of being tired and in the hadith that yawning is from Shaitaan so what is appropriate to do a double I'm in a on the regime so people when they are the same in a shaitaan/the regime and all of this is not from the sooner the Companions used to do it may Allah be pleased with them in the presence of the Prophet that is awesome never ever told them to say alhamdulillah or to seek refuge in Allah from Shaitan regime on the contrary in fact he'll bury Imam I'll have a live in Hodja authenticated the hadith where a man once said or burped in the presence of the prophet alayhi salatu salam so the Prophet said to him keep your burping down because the most or the longest of the people with full stomachs in this dunya are the longest of people who would starve on the day of judgement and he made this is not Hassan so he did not tell him to say it hamdulillah which indicates to us that we do not know more than the profit that is salatu salam and hence it is a wrong practice to burp and say alhamdulillah to yawn and say how do we let him in a  on the regime to forget something and say hmm allahumma salli wa sallim ala muhammad while we're supposed to seek refuge in allah from a Shaitaan and to remember Allah when we forget something not to offer the salutation upon the prophet Isaiah miss is backed up by a weak hadith so even if someone does it it can be tolerated but to say al hamdulillah or mm standard regime this is not from the Sun and Allah as usual knows best"
