  "title": "Reminding a person of the favours you have done for him, what if he is a conman? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "amina's first question reminding others of the favors you have done to them is one of the major sins it's called in Islam and the prophet said Allah and among the three sins that Allah does not look at the individual does not speak to them does not have mercy upon them and would not purify them is who goes to people whom he had helped and said didn't I do this for you didn't I give you a loan yesterday in the sense of reminding them of their favor upon them so this is a major sin but if you know that there is someone who is a con man and he's going around taking people's money unlawfully and he forgot and he came to you and asking you for money or you're scolding him for what he's doing because now it's apparent that he's a blatant liar not that he's needy no you know that he is scamming people for their money when he pretends that he wants to open a shop or start a business and to stand up on his own two feet and he's a blatant liar he's a manipulator and a cheater so you tell him as form of scalding him I gave you money last year and he did not do anything with it there is nothing wrong in that insha Allah"
