  "transcript": "contorted to others each one had a recitation that he attributes to the companion to the Prophet of Islam so they were afraid because of the expansion of the Muslim of all the Islamic empire that someone would go to Kufa and learn the coffee Tarara and then goes to Basra and then goes to Mecca and then says I am a master now in this garage let me do my own garage so he combines this language with this language with this dialect and become comes and gives a certain cara of his own now this would be tampering with the quran and that is why compilers of this science brought the car and brought the difference between their cara add to the preaching to the top which is the prophetess shrum so if everybody has his chain of narrations until the companion until the prophet Isaiah salatu salam and these again party differ among them not in the meaning but in the pronunciation on the rules of the jury of recitation and they are different from the arrow again we every time we elaborate on this don't get confused by the number they tell you seven I hope is seven class know it can be one or two Quran d and there are 0 and in sorry there can be one or two I hope in the car are not necessarily the same number most famous scholars who compile in this science what do we mean by who compiled in the science as we know in here 200 300 400 a jury there were a lot of padding they were not limit it to seven to 10 to 15 there were a lot of them reciting the Quran and they were famous they had schools they had students so we had a boo are they the passive if it's a lab he's among the prominent scholar to write not own in garage or on Omicron he compiled a bureau had written a lot of books he lied in 224 degree he compiled 25 party 25 different cloth scattered ground the Muslim countries he compiled them and he said this man him am so and so his students are so and so his shoe are showing so up to obeying the cop the other one up to what my rap man so he wrote everything and he combined these 25 got a hot or bodies with the chain of directions with the difference in pronunciation and so on after him came I met even jubail algoo fee and he only focused on on 55 of the garage and everyone is looking from his own perspective but the Quran is in fact all of these people have a sound chain of their agents and it is accepted came after them i'll call this mail even as her and he compiled a book but on 22 hot and he described them then comes up with a Evangelion robbery the famous in festive and the famous historian and the famous compiler of hadith melody pleased with him and he made his work on garage and finally came i met him in which I Abu Bakr the famous scholar who himself was a sheath party himself but supernova he included only seven party not his own and when they told him ya know you're an imam urish a you are like these people who you are mentioning why don't you include yours he said it is not time to include our own and mention ourselves it is time to preserve the science as a science and to limit the number two what all the people agree upon and he made his book which he entitled a 727 and he mentioned these seven parties now there are authentic garage and there are other fantic garage how do we know the difference there are conditions will do what do you mean by an authentic garage we mean my own authentic that is not acceptable to read in the end in the Salah dirac there are art and they are authentic and narration to the companion but they are not motivated so we cannot accept it in the Quran but it can add value when we want to interpret the meaning of a verse for example famous Road me I will appeal to them in his garage it says that possiamo philosophy I am passing off three days this is in the Muslim in the Quran have MS old ads Wichita Fiat now can we read this in the quad and then prayer wichita bi meaning in sequence so what is the capital T I mean people are sleeping I'm beginning to find people falling asleep i will ask i would have to ask in shower then get ready what is a couple of aaliyah mean what is the explanation when you swear when you say wallah hair will do this or I will not do this what is the expansion if you do not fulfill it be a slave feed 10 people from the middle of what you eat cloth 10 people you choose if you cannot you past three days but are you rock operative Oh actually my second member to Ramona idea okies were two home family lineage it possiamo celebrity I am this is the Quran Tim ms rude added pathological a mean motor tabby art now this word multi vit continuous we cannot recite it in the car in the prayer if we do you pray is invalid but we use it to understand the Quran so we say yes the ruling stays but it is not part of the Quran we decide so what is authentic and what is not authentic how will we know this the Curragh must have an authentic side chain of narrators back preposterous auto setup so this is the job of the scholars of honey when the car he comes and says yes I have agora this is my tree it goes back to the Prophet Alice lobster on the scholar of hadith comes and says can I see it please you are a trustworthy your share is known it goes back to Al Bukhari for example from bihari onwards or this man is not his life he's used to forget he got all his books burnt and all of these are part of mosca alhaji and part of algeria what their deal and this is a science and islam is called the german meaning that i would discredit you and tidied meaning it i will authenticate you so this is a science we're all Emma come to a chain of narrations at banana puddin and poland and who and I be high on the geyser and then examine these people and they say that this person was known to the community good who says he's known to the community I am a different ambarella be pleased with them met a man and he says this man was a neighbor of his and he says his okay we came to him in headband if it had been Offices he's okay we came to it to a bahama Razi we come to as a hobby become so all of these scientists they have compiled a history of the biography of this particular individual and they come up with the ruling that he's okay some of them say he is ok until year 314 after read here 340 whatever he reports is not accepted why because he is pure lie on his books he used to write all the hadith on his book in here 340 Subhan Allah his house burnt so all these books were burned so after he 340 whenever he said yes my shares also said Sean saw a nebari receptor so he's making headed from what from his memory but his memory is not sound so they intercepted his honey after the year 340 before that it was ok so it's a science it's not you know something that you come up with it is a science it's documented and you have the books now if you leave read Arabic you come to the book of the creamer Teddy for teddy bear teddy oral canal is busy or a la limonada or so and so you have a big collection of books explaining the status of every single man in the books ready so I can it's a difficult job but it is easy no one can come and say no this man is ok when did you say he is OK from I know him how do you know years between you and him there is okay trust me I cannot accept this and I cannot accept someone coming and saying to a man in Bihari that he is fabricating Heidi where did you bring this from I know no I have the complete biography by not one scholar not by 45 by a number of scholars who were at his time for who reported from the hottest I'm so the killer must have an authentic side chain of narrators back to the prophet alayhi salatu salam the drama's confirmed with one of those half of us man so if i were there are that is different but the timber to but the bay you know confirms you the most half of us man but if i have a new word that is different in writing that does not confirm with it this is not accepted and the galaga must confirm to the arabic grammar so if i have and a word or octorara that it's completely enough arabic it's definitely known to be someone who's are not say saying this and it does not comply with the arabic word as when i talk to a masculine i change it into feminine if someone should yeah can I Buddha ye Einstein I say this is gras whole Quran you're changing a man to a woman masculine to feminine dishes not accepted at all because it does not comply with the arabic grammar the seven party now we come to their names do I know their names by heart no no I do not why check your chef's you have to know them no I don't have to know them I have one party that I know they might have sun awesome this is what we need Oh all ninety-six percent of all Muslims only decide this there are housed an awesome okay what about the others I have great respect to them I don't know them and I don't know how they decide I know you know their class so why should I keep the name so should a student of knowledge know it yes if you are going to study the different card yes you have to know it because it's a difficult job not very difficult but it is a science that you cannot heat you have to learn my daughters are in the school of tapi the Quran and Saudi Arabia and hamdillah fight for them come finish the Quran by heart in the last two years in high school year 11 year 12 they give them courage and they come and recite it to me in the house and a sufficient well don't do this don't I don't understand anything what you say so I cannot correct them it's or on it's exactly what we have but it's different dialects and it's a science so you have to be very careful I cannot help them at all because I have zero knowledge and it's not a book that I can breathe in mashallah hallows now I don't I can I can pronounce it it has to be learned from share to share and it has to confirm with the three conditions that were mentioned so if you want to keep the names and the dates and Allah if you don't nothing is wrong with that first one is not fair almaden e and we have to remind you that there is something called para and it is something called rewire but what did I say you don't candid camera ok try your best on your best bilaspur ah there is the wire so we have seven party and each party has to Ravi two people giving fire so we say that this is the power of Napa and rewire of par une so we say para another device Vadhu another so we have the curragh of Napa and rewire of wash so this is when you hear this maybe what is the CI a-- and claw always know we have seven party and we have for every seven party to rally or rewire so the first one is not bad nothing second one even Cathedral mckee and he has a busy and people two of his students and they are the raw beef ham al-basri and he has a duty and a suse but of course if you ask the people who are professional in crowd they give you the biography they give you the difference between each flower why is it the same party and different Lee wire very slight difference in his weed that is hell then you have even amber a shiny and he has a sham and amends the Quan also awesome a groupie and he has sure man helps and this is what we all recite a half son awesome so the rally is awesome and the aquatic is awesome and garages apps this is what we know comes a goofy color collect and alka sigh a lake and a duty there are of course you don't have to write this again you will get it in sha allah there are extra treat party and some scholars say no we only accept the seven and the majority say no the ten are valid providing they have the three conditions fulfilled and there is the other side duration it has to be in the same writing and it should not differ with the glamour the three carries our Abuja para Matheny and the approval bursaries and cutter with their to rouse each what is the benefit of collage is it beneficial now because we are at the bottom of the ladder we always say I don't know it I don't need it if I don't have it I don't need it so this shows you how ignorant we are because we say course i know ron the 1i have scholars say no there are a number of benefits among them that there are by known the killer art you cannot make a mistake why because when you learn the pill are you learn it in accordance to a party who took it all the way to the Prophet arresting officer so if someone this is a channel to the cameraman follow the this is anyone memo if someone's someone says this is how it's written meme lamb cap and a small Aleph so it can't be recited mary Kiyomi Dean and it can be recited Maddie key AA meeting it can be accepted both this is different god it's active if someone comes and says malachi Oh woody mallika means he has possessed now animalic tool column I've owned the the pen and he's saying Malachi routine we say we have three conditions do you have a straight narration correct narration to the prophet as exam there's no does it come side by side by the writing of manic massage yes yes if you can come because it's the same thing the same hole now the to scale the vows tip so we say yes it does does it contradict with the Arabic language the grammar no no it doesn't it goes side by side because in arabic and arabic malathion routine Allah has gained and possessed the day of judgment so it's Arabic it's acceptable but it does not go with the first condition which is it has to have a chain of narration that is authentic to the Prophet al-assad son therefore this is not accepted and why would say okay how do I ensure that there is no confusion among the people who read when you say Malik Malik so this means that i can choose whatever I wish no there's a verse can you see that then okay allah says allah huma magical wolke can we say Allah hamad medical work it has to be recited Maddock you cannot say medical mall why they we said it hit why can't we say it here no it's not this because this is one crawl the hoof said malik al-mulk so we cannot change it from comparing this to this where that are this is not something from the re or from the companions this is how it was revealed likewise melaquin us can we say Malik in US why if we put one eyelid it becomes Mary keenness scholars say yes this is true but this is only the only way to decide it is medic enough you can"
