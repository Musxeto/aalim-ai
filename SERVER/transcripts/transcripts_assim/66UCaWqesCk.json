  "title": "So called 'Scholars' in the West vs Tawheed {The Basics 5}",
  "transcript": "and a lot of those quote unquote so called scholars especially in the west who were brought up learning to hate teaching and studying the books of tawhid and now turn back on their heels only do this for recognition they have nothing to show for they have nothing that makes them shine and this is why they decided to do something that would bring them recognition among the disbelievers the orientalists and the hypocrites and also they would be recognized among the believers among those who believe in the akhida of the salaf but only by cursing him and this is a shame all what they hate is the concept that imam muhammad abdullah is a reformer and a great imam of islam after so many years studying now they turned back on their heels and started slaughtering the imam talking ill about the imam even talking wrongly and deviantly about the concept of shirk they've diluted the concept of the hate due to political reasons due to their hidden agenda or due to their ill intent to gain support from their race"
