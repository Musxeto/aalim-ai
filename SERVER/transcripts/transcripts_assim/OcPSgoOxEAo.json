  "transcript": "alhamdulillah the issues related to rights and obligations are interlined because whenever you have rights over people this means that you are obliged to do things for them as well an employee a worker has obligations do your work what are his rights to be paid likewise a student he has to study and what are his rights if he does he passes the exam and gets a degree however your obligations come first and not your rights and this is a given in Shar do what you're told and ask Allah for what you're rights this is how it goes otherwise we will have chaos if a wife says I'm not going to serve my husband until he gives me my rights and if a husband says I'm not going to take care financially of my wife until she gives me my rights then we have a clash we have a problem and this is what the Quran says and this is what the Shar says that you have to do your obligations in order to win and gain your rights when did this all start I don't know to our limited knowledge this started when Allah created Humanity to our limited knowledge it might have started before how is that this is when Allah Asel made Adam and Eve live in Jenna he gave them an instruction this is your obligations and if you do your obligations you'll be honored and get your rights what are our rights indeed it is Promised for you not to be hungry therein or to be unclothed and indeed you will not be thirsty therein or be hot from the Sun these are your rights you will live for it eternity without any problem what's the obligation do not eat from The Forbidden tree this is rights and obligations again and this is our life story as humans almost all of us are unaware of this fact the fact of obligations and responsibilities and rights Allah mentioned this clearly by giving us the am from All Creatures we are given the am indeed we offered the trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains and they declined to Bear it and feared it but man undertook it and and undertook to Bear it indeed he was unjust and ignorant so what is am am has two meanings this obl these obligations and rights they have two meanings one the general one and this refers to whatever Allah ordained upon us and commanded us to do sh in general all what Allah commanded us to do and prohibited us to get close to this is fall all of this falls under am and it goes without saying Muslims have neglected this miserably how many of the Muslims pray faer on time in the Masjid you tell me 1% maybe less but look at them on Friday the Masjid is full it's packed sometimes they pray in the sun where were they in the fer of a jum asleep what's their justification usually nothing and you could Cascade this to zakat to fasting to Hajj they have not fulfilled this am and then they ask Allah where are our rights there is a specific not a general a specific meaning for am which usually it deals with what's between me and you as individuals I give you money iust you with a a secret I uh put an Amana or a deposit with with you and this is what Allah mentions in the Quran indeed Allah commands you to render trusts to whom they are you you have to do this this is an obligation this also we have a big problem with so we have misinterpretation misunderstanding why do people cheat why do people consume tribes why do people embezzle others or take their money unlawfully they think or they make themelves think that I have a right to cheat you I have the right to take from your wealth I have a right to lie to my company because they did this they did that and all the rights and obligations are gone down the drain the prophet says Alam give the back to whomever entrusts you and do not betray who betrays you this is our religion a beautiful religion just because my company betrayed me that does not allow me to betray them back no I have to do and prove to them and this is what our Prophet didat you remember before he migrated to Medina the people of meccah would deposit it their wealth their expensive their valuable things with him when he migrated if I wear in his shoes I was now it's time to make it now we're never take all their wealth and go to Medina and become a multi-millionaire he kept his own cousin Ali behind to give back everyone what they entrusted him with sallallahu alai wasallam this am by the way is not limited to Muslims you can find it with the non-muslims and Allah praises the non-muslims look at the beauty of Islam it doesn't say he's a cafir throw him down the drain there's nothing good in him no matter what he does he's evil he's this no no no no no Islam tells you to be fair Allah says and among the people of the script scures is he who if you entrust him with a great amount of wealth he will return it to you so Allah is telling this telling us that among the Jews and the Christians there are people that can be trusted when it comes to monetary transactions unlike what we usually say there is nothing good in them sometimes we paint them with the same brush even the Muslims if he does something wrong to me I cross out every good thing in him and I demonize him and I make him the worst person on Earth no so coming back to the issue of obligations and rights these are interl Allah says obligations and rights oh believers if you stand up for Allah these are your obligations he will help you and make you step uh uh uh make your steps firm and this is the right that Allah will grant for you Allah does not change what people are encountering until they change what is in themselves and the obligations are so so so many and seriously if we sit with ourselves to reflect on them we will find out that we are [Music] doomed and most likely destined to hell but we pray we fast we give charity yes but we do a lot in the field of not fulfilling our obligations we have deprived so many people of their rights I don't have people that have rights over me what are you talking about you have rights towards your own self towards your own body towards your little Community your family your bigger Community your um your country to humanity you have obligation towards Allah towards your religion all of these are so detailed in Shar if we were to talk about each and everyone it will take us till F and we don't have more than 20 minutes to go for my session so these rights that you're obliged to give you will be held accountable by Allah by Islam by your conscience by the Angels by the soldiers of Allah by the society by the community by the laws stemmed from Shar all of these are going to hold you accountable for not giving these rights and these rights that you're obliged to give they control our lives without them we will be living in a jungle imagine if I see something I like and I say I'm going to take this it will be chaos if I have something I want to do and it goes against Islam but I still plot to do it we would be living in a jungle so it preserves our Integrity our property it makes our souls calm fills it with Tranquility it organizes priorities workers know what to anticipate from reward for doing what they're told to do and from the punishment and torment because of their actions one of the ayas in the Quran one that gathers these rights and it would take us hours to explain but I'll just go through them briefly Allah says worship Allah and Associate nothing with him and to parents do good and to relatives orphans the needy the near neighbor the neighbor farther away the companion at your side The Traveler and Those whom your right hands possess 10 Allah's giving us telling us to give them their rights now these rights can be mandatory upon individuals some of the rights are a communial obligation if I do it you're not sinful if I don't do it and you don't do it we're all sinful like for example washing a deceased someone is dead Muslims yeah Allah okay what are we going to do not my job not my business we leave him to rot what will happen we will be punished in Hell one of us says no no no this is not Islamic I will wash him shroud him pray for funeral prayer and bury him we Exempted from the punishment communial obligation sometimes these rights are recommended Sunnah yeah something that's good alhamdulillah so we have to segregate and know and this is what seeking knowledge gives you when you know hm is this sinful if I don't do it or not I have to know how to know to go and check it from the Quran from the Sunnah from what the scholar say so the greatest right of all is huh worship the right of Allah you guys sleep Friday after big bani with some and have to wake up a little bit because this is rapid fire four hours Salam and I we don't have time we have so much information we cannot share it with you we have to make it short and concise so you guys have to be on the edge of your seats so the most important important right is the right of Allah imagine the prophet saysat do you know what is Allah's right among upon his servants and his servants right upon Allah there are mutual rights obligations and rights so I said I don't know Allah and his Messengers know s Ali wasallam he said Allah's right upon his servants to worship him and not to asso associate others with him this is the most important right what is the reward if we do this the servants right upon Allah if they do this that he will get them admitted to J this is what we're doing here what are you doing in this world I'm working she I'm doing business she I'm getting married and having children she this is not your job this is temporar soon you will be terminated from this job what will you do either heaven or hell so this is your priority your objective your target is I want to go to Jenna how to do that don't get married this is difficult she no you get married and go to Jenna with your wife oh that's nice so many things in life are like this you enjoy and have fun and it takes takes you to Jenna the smartest those who have knowledge because they can utilize their Investments and use little and gain a lot so worship Allah among the rights upon us the right of the Prophet Muhammad wasam to obey him whenever he orders us to refrain from whatever he tells us not to to believe whatever he tells us to not worship Allah except by what he has commanded us this is a huge right among others of course we could speak for ours the right of the companions of the Prophet Alam they have rights over us to honor them to love them to defend them the right of the mothers of the Believers his wives they are our mothers what have you done then we come according to the Ayah to the right of the parents and the right of the parents sh Salim will inshallah speak about if we give him 6 hours it's not enough seriously this is only from the Quran and the Sunnah we're not talking about storytelling because there is so much and verses of the Quran highlighting the importance of your parents Allah ordained that you worship no one with him and to be dutiful and kind to your parents look what Allah is doing comparing or associating the instruction not to worship others with him alongside with being beautiful to your parents this is one of the most important things in life when was the last time you were beautiful to your mom when was the last time you time you were obedient to your father and respectful and then ask yourself do I have a chance I've been ru good with them I've been bad with them but I'll leave this to she Sal then you have the right of the relatives what do you mean Sheik who are my relatives anyone connected to you from your father and your mother you mean uncles and aunts yes cousins yes second cousins third cousins all of these are your relatives how do you call them how do you contact them when do you see them when do you kind to them then we have the rights of the orphans and the orphans can be in your family and they have a priority and they can be in other people's families do you support them do you sponsor them do you are are you kind to them then we have the rights of the needy and the poor and we know the Hadith whether they are orphans whether they are uh um widows whether they are stranded people all of these are needy and poor people around you are in the hundreds of thousands who don't have money to pay rent electricity I get calls on daily basis she there's no electricity for a week we don't have money to pay imagine how you can live without electricity in Saudi is like Kuwait when do you have electricity breakdown sometimes for 15 minutes what happens it's a microwave we live in a microwave you strip from your clothes and and and your spouse is no it's too late it's too late this is what what are we doing it's hot imagine if you have this for a whole week no air conditioning no uh electricity for the food the food rots so they need to pay bills they need to go to the hospital diabetic people can't buy insulin what are you doing it's not my job she these are rights on you you have rights of the near neighbor who's the near neighbor he's someone who is a relative of yours so he's your cousin and your neighbor at the same time then you have the neighbor farther he's not your relative but he's a a neighbor still then you have the companion at your side and this is anyone that may accompany you they say it is your travel companion they say it is your wife they say it's any friend of yours so they all have rights over me I'm trying to note this down the notebook is finished what am I going to do these people's rights this is the tip of an iceberg we haven't started yet and this is what you're going to be held accountable on the day of judgment this is what you're going to be questioned about why didn't you do what you were told to do and then is the right of sail the traveler or the wayf farer someone who's traveled then lost means of financing himself to go back maybe he's rich in his country but at the moment he needs a ticket he needs a Comm he needs food give it to him as a lone she no as zakat this is his right in Islam so you have also what your hand right hand possesses which it's called they are prisoners of War they are the concubines they are the slaves we don't have them now but they we will have them later because this is an Islamic concept that cannot be abrogated Whenever there is war between the Muslims and the non-muslims there have to be prisoners of Wars what do we do take them to Gano no we don't have Gan V we distribute them to Muslim families to serve them and to work for them as slaves but Islam comes and says if you swear by Allah and you break your uh uh oath free a slave if you fight with your wife and say you're har like my mom's back free a slave if you have Intimacy in the daytime of Ramadan free a slave free a slave free everything in Islam experation says free a slave if you kill someone by mistake free a slave why because Islam has one source of enslavement and This Is War but it has tens of sources of freeing slaves which indicates that this is the only religion that has kindness and mercy in it there is the right of other individuals as well so for example Allah the prophet said every one of you is a shepherd and everyone is responsible for his flock so the ruler is responsible for his citizens the father is responsible for his family the wife is responsible for her children the servant is responsible for those who he serve all of these are rights you're obliged to give among the rights the right of the husband so the wife must acknowledge that her husband has rights over her but is as they say it takes two to tango of course Islamic Tango with Nashid no music Haram you cannot tangle with nah it has to be your wife huh so also the husband has rights towards his wife so he doesn't sit and say no Simon Says do this and that without being expected also to give his rights to his wife each one of us those who are blessed with children they are a test for you because your children have rights over you why they should serve me they should pay money to me no no no no look at what your job and duty is but at the same time your parents have rights over you as a child so you have to do this and give it to them our rulers Muslim rulers have rights over us to obey them to respect them to give them advice but they also have rights towards us and to take care of us employ employees they have rights as a an employer or as the head of the business and you have subordinates you have to give them their rights you have to take care of them not try to milk them out of every penny you can but even the employees have rights to their superiors in obedience and taking care of the company and Etc and there is the right of the children towards or from the elders the elders should take care of the children of the youngsters by having mercy and compassion but also the youngsters have to respect the elders this this is the rights of the elders over the youngsters respect obedience Etc and the rights of one of us towards the other I would not become a Believer until I love for you what I love from my for myself of goodness and this is a very important addition in the Hadith that you love for your brother what you love for yourself of goodness because I might be a smoker and I love smoking so I said H okay would you like to have a cigarette yeah the Hadith says no goodness the things that are good the things that are Halal the things that are permissible in Islam also the prophet saysat and this Hadith by itself requires a workshop because if we implement it in our lives we won't have any disputes the prophet says the Muslim is the brother of his fellow Muslim he does not wrong him or let him down the one who meets the needs of his brother Allah will meet his needs whoever relieves a Muslim of distress Allah will relieve his him from distress on the day of Resurrection whoever conceals a Muslim Allah will conceal him on the day of Resurrection imagine if we implement this how many of us relieve brothers from distress uh she I give distress to everyone I know this is happening at work in in in in my home my neighbors yeah some husbands are professional distress givers to their wives they just want to put them on the edge of course it takes two to tango the wives are specialists in making you have high blood pressure diabetes uh uh high cholesterol and stance in your heart why do you think I have all of these four and I do have all these four by the way but my wife is a sweetheart W for 40 years mashallah this is life without parole alhamdulillah she is an excellent woman but it's it happens so it goes both ways also the prophet says and this needs another course the prophet says the Muslim is the brother of another Muslim he does not wrong him let him down look down upon Him tawa piety is here he points to his heart and he pointed to his chest three times it is sufficient evil for man to look down upon his Muslim oh he's Kashmir oh he's from this he's yeny he's Egyptian he's Saudi he's this he's that you this is h a Muslim quality unfortunately not a Muslim but hypothetic atically we are Professionals in looking down at people uh where is this brother from he's from this country oh this country they are very lazy they are very cheap they are very dirty they smell they and who's perfect of course me I'm I'm the only one perfect around this is Haram in Islam but these are the rights we're depriving our Muslims from and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam says among the Hadith the right of a Muslim upon his brother Muslim are six it's not limiting it part of them if you see him you give him Salam is this mandatory no this is highly recommended so now we can segregate between obligation communial uh obligation or Sunnah highly recommended Sunnah if you meet him you give him Salam if he invites you you answer him if he asks you for advice you advise him if he sneezes and says alhamdulillah you say this is mandatary upon all not a communal according to the most authentic opinion if he gets sick you visit him if he dies you follow his funeral we have many rights the rights of your body do does my body have rights yes I have to take care of my health I have to look good I have to be fit it's not that M I don't like this door bam I break the door I break my hand I wound myself your body has rights over you your guest I have guests coming to the home I look turn off the lights I don't want them to see don't answer the guests honor them look what ibraim did to his guests may Allah have peace and blessing be upon him so your guests have rights over you you as a guest have rights to your host what is this food what is don't you have some you know sh some hot sauce the salt is little air conditioning is bad no you have to respect your host you have to honor your host the right of a deceased someone who died to wash to shroud to pray to give Dua even animals have rights over us imagine when you Slaughter an animal you don't just and I know I'm going to get questions about slaughtering animals and Sheik McDonald's and KFC and people are saying this and Z I'm ready I have my Arsenal and and and grenades and bombs with me don't worry I'm always ready alhamdulillah so even the animals we have to sayah we have to have a very sharp blade and we have have to cover it from other animals not in front of the other animals and Slaughter it how beautiful Islam is you have to cover the animal that being slaughtered from other animals fearing for their feelings and I'm not going to go into feelings of humans that we always abuse and misuse the right of non-muslims and this is a very white topic and the right of the environment with this uh uh climate uh warming we having and the floods and the earthquakes and the tornadoes and the melting of the glaciers and even Islam looks into this so mashallah I am always on time I came on time they started late but I finish on time so that sh would not beat the heck of me because this is his right upon me how much time for the break 15 minutes those who want to go go if you want I'm free for 15 minutes for questions I'm going to abuse this H yes s that is Ava in the if you can go and see that you can it on your own but of course we can do that we don't have that ability weo to it on our if there is so the question of the brother is why is the we mentioned yesterday is Haram because I as a buyer did not possess I did not see and I did not sell so actually it's like saying I'll sell you this for a dinar you say okay and then I'll buy it from you for 1.1 says okay and this item is still there so it's like one for 1.1 cash by cash but if I actually possess it when I buy it this is mine if I sell it to X to Y to Z no problem because I'm doing the selling what is Haram is what's been done in the banks which is only on paper you go to them Salam alaykum I'd like to borrow 100,000 he said okay we have this amount of iron or Steel in this ex location you didn't see it I said okay I'm willing to buy it the terms I'm I'm happy with said okay if you want to sell it by the way we'll do this for you because you don't have trucks to so we will sell it for you you have to authorizes okay I authorize you in 10 minutes you got the money in the bank who bought it I did who sold it I did to whom they know did they took it take it no so this is all arranged all on paper it's like Forex a lot of people love Forex it's all on the screen you don't see anything anything sell Buy sell buy and you get some money sometimes sometimes you lose a lot of money so I hope this answers your question H yes sir stock trading is different because if you buy stocks on the stock market this is a legitimate Market governed by the government itself they have uh um uh processes to prevent fraud they also in Saudi I don't know about here if the stocks drop 10% it's halted not like NASDAQ it's free if it drops 100% you lose all your money no it's regulated in Saudi so it's governed by the governments to protect you and to protect your money and these companies you know Al Mar company I know this rash Bank I know this I know they on Forex it's digits and you don't know what you're doing so I have this answers your questions the sisters if you have questions you can go and drink and coffee drink drink and come back we have 9 minutes inshallah uh rights of animals I answer questions not a lecture but among the rights of the animals is that you do not torture the animal so you must and this is part of the rights of the animal feed them and give them drink even if they were a kitten the prophet says Alam a woman was admitted to Hell Fire because of a kitten of a cat she kept it locked neither it gave it she gave it food and drink nor she let it loose in the streets to go to the garbage and collect whatever is found there this means that if you don't take care of your livestock of your animals and you don't feed them and give them water the same in slaughtering I told you you have to say Bismillah you have to have a sharp knife and do it swiftly it is prohibited this is part of the right of the animals to take them for fun shooting so I have a number of pigeons or birds or rabbits and I let them loose and I just go for target shooting the prophet said Allah curses the one who does this um to be used in what is what it was not created for so someone rides a cow and hits the cow or in Australia They Ride ostriches I've seen this in some documentaries and in the Hadith a man was riding a cow and hitting it to move and the cow looked at him and this is an authentic Hadith and he said she it said I was not created for this and the man and the people were shocked said a cow speaks and the prophet said I believe in this and Abu Bakr and Omar this is a miracle of Allah so it shows you that to use the cat in what it was not created for this is not of the C of of uh did I say the cat Cow okay I'm getting old I'm tripping alhamdulillah Alzheimer maybe so to use the animal in other for than what it was created for this is not from giving it stri so many things I this is from the top of my head if I want to go and research I'd find more and more and more Islam is a beautiful perfect religion no other religion can come with half of what we have from our history and and Heritage and tradition with the grace of Allah and Allah knows best okay so he's the brother is asking that one of the rights of the Quran is that whenever it is recited that we listen to it so can we dock while listening to it Allah gave you only one heart as mentioned in the beginning of Surah chapter 33 Allah did not give a man two hearts meaning you cannot concentrate if your Vick is related to the Quran yes how Allah speaks in the Ayah about Jenna and you say this is related to what I've just heard or Hellfire and you say this is okay but if you keep on saying Subhan alh and the Quran is being recited and I I I immediately stop you say which Ayah what did he say then why are you playing it Baraka no this is form a form of disrespecting the Quran the Quran was made to be listened to and to uh um be contemplated upon and Allah knows best you feel you can't you've heard you were inba today I see this is why you have to follow the Sheikh wherever he goes this is his right so that he does not have to reinvent the wheel and repeat what he says the prophet said do not enter upon women folk a man said even my in-laws my brother my uncle I trust them with my wife said your in-laws are death if you want death to come to your wife husband said yes yes yes yes no this not good uh if you want death to come to your wife then allow this because this is more dangerous than death so Allah is protecting us if I sit with my cousin she's closer to me than a stranger woman so I would Fe I would put my guard down she would put her guard down andan is waiting for the right moment mam for"
