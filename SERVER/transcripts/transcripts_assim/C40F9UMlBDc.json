and welcome to lessons in folk we're still studying the chapter that deals with times of salat times of prayer and we went through hadith number 130 and we had few points left over so I'd ask brother Fatih to read it again as a reminder narrated by abu Barthelemy may allah be pleased with him a las messenger sallallahu alayhi wa sallam used to offer the austere prayer and after the prayer one of us would return to his house at the farthest end of al-madinah and arrive while the Sun was still hot and bright and he is all alone you seldom loved to delay the prayer and he disliked sleeping before it and conversation after it after the Friday prayer used to leave when a man could recognize the one sitting beside him and he used to recite between 60 to 100 verses of the Quran in the federal prayer narrated jabbering the virgin of Al Bukhari and Muslim the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam used to advance their prayers sometimes and delayed at other times whenever he saw the people assembled for a prayer he would pray early and if the people delayed he would delay the prayer and the prophet sallallaahu Salim used to offer the Fredric prayer when it was still dark narrated abu musa may allah be pleased with him in another version of muslim he is so la la la o sanam offered the friday prayer at daybreak when the people could hardly recognize one another again the thing that we've mentioned last time we met was it sounds confusing in one part it says that the Prophet would pray when they do not know each other they could not recognize one another and in here it says that the prayer would be over and they could recognize each other so what do we do scholars say it's very simple to begin such a prayer it has to be really dark people cannot recognize each other but as the prayer goes on and the soul Allah and the Prophet Alice Aslam prolongs it he recites between sixty to a hundred verses of the Quran then the Sun is coming up so when the finished prayer is already daylight the Sun has not risen completely yet it's daylight they could recognize each other and this tells us that at the time of the Prophet Elisha they did not have any lamps or any forms of lighting in the mosques which indicates that the mosques themselves were not beautified and built on the the way that is built the mosques are built nowadays nowadays if you go to lots of mosques in the Muslim world you would find that they're spending so much money on things that they're not supposed to do in Islam you're not supposed to put so much money in mosques you're not supposed to beautify it and put marbles and put under layers and put a expensive stuff into it because it's better that you feed poor people than putting your money in mosques Muslims can pray anywhere any open area any place of worship would do for them it does not have to be so expensive and extravagant for them to pray in and the Prophet Dallas our son told us clearly that if you beautify your copies of the holy quran and start to write it by with gold and put a expensive binding to it and so on and if you put ornaments on your mosques and put marbles and and and put expensive things into your mosques the Prophet warned us that if we do this then destruction will fall upon us for DeMar DeMar alaikum if you do this Elijah will destroy you why because this is not religion and this is the case nowadays P with money build mosques and they don't build mosques to pray in it they build mosques to show off so they say that this is the mosque of this gentleman so-and-so it's called mosque of so-and-so and why because they want to show off so my mosque is really is bigger than yours my my air conditioning is better than yours and they start to show off with the houses of Allah the mosques and this is unacceptable in Islam that is why if you compare those that pray in these mosques with those that prayed at the time of the Prophet aerosol artists and the prophet's mosque did not have any ceiling they just put some leaves of palm trees they did not have proper walls it did not have carpets they prayed on sand and pebbles and that's it yet look at the generation that came out of this mosque and look at the generations that are coming from these expensive mosques there is no comparison none whatsoever so it gives you an indication that it is not what you pay it's not the money that you invest in mosques and building them and having them you know with nice and beautiful carpets it's what's being taught inside the and the proper Sunnah that should be followed brother nor you have a question yes a written one how does that directed by was my name dolphin who built an immortan in in his hindus life all over you built for him the the house in the heavens so if if we built the the better most of curse a lot we built for us a better house in the hadith narrated was is correct it says that whoever builds a mosque even if as small as the nest of a bird Allah will build him a house in Heaven's but that does not mean the more you put into this mosque the better your house in heaven is because we know that the standard is is one in heavens and a lot standards is one you do not have something that is more an extra everything is perfect in Heaven's yet if you do this if you build a mosque it should be as instructed by the Prophet area salat-u-salam and his companions for example umar said build a build the mosque but do not use red or yellow don't paint it because the more decoration you put in the mosque the more distracted people and I've seen this a lot in lots of you know expensive mosques people go in and they pray and instead of looking at the the place of the position where they should put their forehead on when prostration they you know gaze around and look at the chandeliers and look at the decoration and some of them while prayer while praying tried to read what's written in the Qibla and the verse says if somebody does this and why what is this this is this is not praying sorry was stuff for lawyer I seek the forgiveness of Allah so gel but I was distracted our prophet sallallaahu any other Selim was given a thought a dress with lots of marks on them and he awarded and as soon as he started praying he finished prayer quickly and took it off and said that these marks you know distracted me from in Salah so take it take it away and bring me another table from abu jahil one of the companions so that I can focus and contemplate in my prayer this is a soap and this is the Prophet Allah so some the highest and oh sure and submissiveness to Allah is urgent so what is our case it's even worse when you have things on the floor when you have things on the walls when you are in a place that is so expensive when you start thinking about the decoration they put about the marble about the writing about this and that it distracts you completely from your prayer this is not the way our prophet instructed us our assessor and that is why we're losing why are we being distracted and drifting from Islam because we're not following the teachings of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam I think that this is all connected to hadith 130 we move on to hadith 131 narrated by raffia been hadith audio low on we used to over the Maghrib prayer with almost senior sort of the homonymous Erlin and and then one of us what good would go out of the moss and be able to see the spot his reward perot would follow his arrow would fall that his arrow full would for a lot okay now Ravi urban hadith is telling us that he used to pray with the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and as soon as they go out one would be able to see the point where his arrows would fall at now is this a Sunnah that as soon as you go out of the mosque you take an arrow put in the boring Bank to see where it falls is this a Sunnah so what what is this compelling saying he's telling us that it is so light it is that the whole yeah it's there is still light outside of the mosque that enables us to see where an hour would fall at if we throw one this indicates what what does this indicate Fadi that's good half of the knowledge is I don't know Mustafa used to pray directly after the excellent this means that the prophets allah salam would pray Maghrib immediately after add on just after sunset and they would finish prayer and they would go out and there is still light it's not complete darkness and it's still like to the extent that one could see the point where his arrow fell act do you get do you get the message so this means that and this is a consensus of all scholars the consensus of all scholars as shekel Islam in Tamiya states that Margaret is to be prayed immediately after a van some of them say well you should leave an interval of two raka what what is what are these two rakahs is considered to be soon let Asuna al-kibriya and every single prayer you have or you're able to pray between the event and a comma because the prophets Allah Salim said that between every two events there is a Salah every to advance there is a Salah he repeated that three times and then he said to whomever wishes to do so so this is with all form of prayer of prayers with the exception of fetcher Roger you may only pray the Sunnah which is - raka and that is it you may not pray anything in addition to that we have less than 30 seconds Rushdie if you have a very short question with a very short question so the performing of the Maghrib prayer is the contrary of performing a prayer it's at right I mean after Adam we immediately performing the salaah and about Issa we delay for a while no it's not a must delaying of Asia is a Sunnah but if you pray Asia immediately after the Iran this counts I think we're going to take a short pause and if it's not understood we'll go back to it after the break you inshallah we are covering the manners in Islam that a Muslim is supposed to have in Islam there is a strong link between having good manners and piety and then he said I guarantee a dwelling in the highest rank of Jenna for the one who perfect his manner that indeed truthfulness leads to piety to hodges's and righteousness and piety leads to gender preference Elam used to always maintain family ties gentleness in Islam means to treat people with kindness and with tenderness Salam alaikum wa rahamtullah and welcome back I think we should move on to the following hadith knowed by Cheryl yellow on how the prophet sallallaahu sudden and delayed - a prayer one night till a great part of the night passed then he went out and offered the prayer and said this is the proper time for it wear it not that I would impose a burden on my pardon a burden on my followers okay in this hadith it tells us that the prophet alayhi salatu salam preferred to pray raesha prayer late until a great portion of the night has passed and gone it also tells us that the companions of the Prophet that I saw Sarah had this as a priority so they stayed in the mosque waiting for prayer and the prophet salallahu alaihe salam preferred that ratio prayer is prayed after the first third of the night has gone or until it's midnight so this is the preferred time between the third and before the first third and before at the end of the first half of the night this is the preferred time for Asia prayer it also tells us that the prophet alayhi salatu salam does not want to burden his ummah does not want to burden his followers otherwise he would have left it at it as it is now in our times it's more convenient to be prayed at this time as we all sleep after twelve o'clock or at 1 a.m. at some stages so it would be okay for us yet the Sunnah is to delay it depending on the status of those who are praying with you which means that I do not want an imam to come a newly appointed in mom to come to his mosque here the call for prayer for Asia and then waits for three hours before he makes a comma while the people are waiting and they're used to 20 minutes or to 15 minutes interval and this guy comes in and extends it to three hours this is not another acceptable even if he claims that this is the Sunnah why because the Prophet alehsalaam told us that we should not make people run away from Islam this came in the hadith of narada manageable you know madam in Japan he's one of the scholars of the companions he's young he was very young he died young he died with the plague of Hamas and this companion used to pray Asia with the prophet alayhi salaatu son and then go to his village which is at the outskirts of Medina and pray as an imam leading prayer for Asia to those who did not pray with the Prophet Allah so sir so for him it's for raka and his voluntary but for them it is obligatory raesha prayer and he would sometimes begin to recite the second chapter of quran surat al-baqara which is the longest chapter in the holy quran so at one stage one of the Companions praying thought that god this guy is taking too long I have work to do I'm tired send of the night so he had to pray on his own and he left the congregation after the prayer ended they told maja damageable didn't you see what so-and-so did so he asked what what did he do they they said he abandoned the prayer and left the congregation prayed on his own and left home so why I said that this guy is a hypocrite so the same people that talk to my heart went to this man had said didn't you hear what my eyes said about you he said that you are a hypocrite and this also shows you that there there are people that are willing to go out of their way to have disputes among the Muslims to cause disturbances among the Muslims they don't go to advise and to with a goodwill they go to destruct and destroy all kind of relationships so they went to the man and told them that mod says you're a hypocrite so the man says I will show up Marth who's hypocrite I'm going to the Prophet Allah so salaam to report this so he went to the prophet and he told him that Oh prophet of Allah I have a farm to to water and irrigate and Mahad comes in and he prays like an hour an hour and a half and and this jeopardized my work I can't do this so the Prophet SAW Selim turned to Murad and was very very angry with him and he started talking harshly to him saying Mahad are you trying to throw people away from Islam are you trying to make people reject Islam what is this if anyone of you prays for himself then you may prolong it as long as you want if you're praying home on your own pray for two hours three hours it's up to you it's no problem but if you're leading prayer then you should take care of those praying behind you you should choose the small and short surahs to pray this indicates that if you're an imam of a mosque and you come to the neighborhood you should take care of those praying behind you and you should pay attention to their needs if they're there are elderlies if there are people with special needs if they there are people that are ill and cannot stand for for a long time then you should do something about it so in this hadith it tells us zakir that if someone goes to a new mosque what which he should do he should pray as there used to pray now if they are all young and strong if they are all knowledgeable and they agree among themselves that okay guys we want to follow the Sunnah so instead of calling for Aisha prayer at nine o'clock the farmer instead of praying at nine o'clock we we'll postpone it until 11 o'clock is that okay with all of you if they all agree Angela this is excellent this is the best but if they don't then you have to be with the congregation with the majority now if we go into our homes now females are women wives and sisters and daughters may delay the prayer Asia because they don't have any congregation so each one of them preys on her own so it's okay it's recommendable for them to delay the prayer until it's the first third of the night is gone or between that and the first half of the night and this shows us how kind our prophet Isaiah salat-u-salam because so many instances reported to us that he would leave something that he would abandon something though he loves it because he's afraid that it may become a burden on his nation or it would become obligatory upon his followers do we have any examples taboo Malik should I say the question again or you guys should I said again oh you know it okay sure I should say it again there are many instances in the Sunnah where the Prophet SAW solemn abandons things does not do things that he loves and wants to do because he's afraid that if he continues doing them it will become obligatory on their on his followers so if you know raise your hand let's see is a key taraweeh prayer which is a night prayer in Ramadan the Prophet loves it and the Companions love it but because they prayed for nights in a row with the Prophet salah salem he could not go on again so when they said come on prophet let's pray we want this he says that i've seen what you've done and i know that you love to pray with me but I'm afraid that if I continue to do this Allah will make it obligatory on Muslims and this would be a burden and thank God it's not obligatory because then most of the Muslims would not have done it or would not have been able to do it do we have any other examples Abu Malik the SWAC which is an excellent example the Prophet says is awesome had I not fear that it will be become obligatory I would have ordered everyone to perform SWAT to brush his teeth before Moodle or before salat but because he was afraid it would become obligatory the Prophet SAW Salim did not do it and he did not ask his followers to keep on do it because it would have been impossible or difficult for them to do so this shows us how kind and merciful our prophet is and was sallallahu alayhi wa he was in them I think we should move on to the following hadith hadith number 133 narrated abu huraira radiyaallahu and unlost messenger sallallahu alayhi wa sallam said when it is hot delay the zuhr prayer till it cools down till it cools down for the intensity of hate is from the exhalation of hell okay the intensity of heat is of the exhalation of hell and the intensity of cold is also from the freezing of hell so in hell we have freezing and we have heat and one would say well god please put me at the freezing end I like cold weather no it's not that cold but actually it's not that nice now freezing can be part and form of punishment right if those who work with liquid nitrogen know this if you drop one drop of liquid nitrogen on the flesh it eats it out it burns it like hell though it's frozen but it it burns and lots of times when you see that the people are climbing the Mount Everest and the Himalayans you get frost bites and they chop their fingers because it's almost similar to burns so extreme heat and extreme cold is the same it's a form of punishment and it's all in hell invoker prayer as Brotherhood she has read to us the Prophet lssm instructed us to delay the whore prayer when it's really hot and why is that because you should contemplate you should concentrate you should know what you're doing and saying while praying and if you're doing that in the midst of heat you're unable to do this so the colder it is the better for you to do and by Kohler we say that it could be two hours or more and we believe in this hadith though we have not seen hell and we sure pray to Allah that we do not see it or be close to it we believe in this hadith that also we should choose the place we pray in so scholars say if you pray in a dark place you'll be afraid then don't pray in the dark print like and if you pray next to an air conditioning that is blowing into your face and ear and after one raka you will be distracted then choose the place you pray in and if you play pray next to a person that smells really bad you know eating garlic or onion onions then it's okay for you to leave the prayer because you have to contemplate and concentrate in prayer and that is why it's forbidden for us to pray while one has to answer the call of nature and you see this in some mosque you know people praying and the guys jumping what are you doing is something vibrating you have a mobile in your pocket or what say no no no but I just want to finish and go to the toilet then this is Haram you are not concentrating in your and what you're doing in your prayer likewise if you're starving and food is being served and the call for prayer is is there the Prophet tells us eat first even if you miss the prayer because if you go and pray and the guy is talking about Jenna and about the food and the chicken and and and and and and the things they're there you're not gonna concentrate and prayer and I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program so until we meet next time fear man Allah WA Salam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
