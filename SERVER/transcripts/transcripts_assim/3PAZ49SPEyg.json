  "transcript": "foreign if it's permissible uh to do this job because you know as you probably know most of the engineering Engineers job is to do all the technical work like for example as an electrical engineer to do like analyzer circuits uh do the schematics Etc but part of his job uh generally this is generally speaking um in the project would be for example to do a cost estimation like um basically estimating you know the the amount of money the company needs to finance the project by you know listing all the different materials Etc but also you know doing a bit of risk assessment to see from a technical and economic standpoint to see if um you know these project is feasible and the company can do it basically um and then all these studies and cost estimation will then be used by the finance Department to possibly you know get a loan to finance the project uh am I is will the engineer be assisting them in sin no no no no no no no again overthinking the essence of the company's work is in a fire fighting systems so your job the company's job is to install firefighting systems which is mandated by the government in most countries your job is to give it a quotation so you estimate how much lines do we need how much pumps how much pressure sprinkles and Sprinklers and and the likes and then you give a risk assessment that in case of failure what will happen and how much we are obliged to pay because our system failed and smoke detectors and the likes and you give a quotation and you give your estimates all of this is halal now if the company will finance it through riba because you don't have the cash money to do it this is the accounting Department's fault and the CEO's fault not yours your job is to install to inspect to operate and all of this is halal work so there is nothing wrong in your assessment in your quotation in your reporting because you're not dealing hand in hand you're not applying for such loans from a bank or a financial institution and you're not helping them in in such activities rather you're giving Halal um estimates and Allah Knows Best"
