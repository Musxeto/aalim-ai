  "transcript": "man over him from the relative autonomy sallallahu wasallam Obara md he wore a suit enemy nabina muhammad in water and he was happy he were many tether be happy he was 10 the vision that he he either you media and I assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh allah the almighty addresses us in the quran in a very beautiful verse which requires a lot of time to go through which unfortunately we do not have a lot of the almighty says white LC move be happily like me Jamie and one at the fabric ooh and hold fast all of you together to the Rope of Allah and B naught divided among yourselves this is an instruction of Allah zildjian to hold tight to abide by his rope and one would argue what type of rope is a large origin telling us to abide by well the sooner explains interprets and elaborates on the Quran which without the sooner we will not be able to fully comprehend the Quran the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam explains the meaning of the Rope of Allah he says the Book of Allah the Quran is the extended rope of allah the almighty it is the strong rope of allah almighty from the heavens to the earth so the Quran is the Rope of Allah that we should abide by the Sunnah is also part of the Rope of Allah that we must abide by and as even my soul may allah be pleased with him said it is also the German the majority the unity of the OMA this is the rock Obama as erosion and as Muslims or as humans on this earth we are facing a great danger in the morning we wake up happy to be Muslims unfortunately there will come a time where in the evening those Muslims among us would turn on their backs and they would become cafard or non-muslim as the Prophet re sabado salam worn this from if we look around us we find a lot of those who used to be prominent Muslims have unfortunately went back on their heels and they rejected what they had believed for so many years so many Muslims who used to call others to things that were elementary from the Quran shin now they're having second thoughts unfortunately and some of them may have turned into hypocrites or non-muslims altogether that is why we must avoid falling into the traps of shape on by abiding by the Rope of Allah as sahaja and if you look at this beautiful description it gives you the idea that you are walking a thin line you are walking over something that is very sharp and narrow and you're about to fall down however there is a rope next to you that you are holding two and you're walking this thin line with the grace of allah azzawajal and to abide by Allah's rope is found in the Quran and indocin as well Allah Almighty says in the Quran and verily this is my straight path so follow it and follow not other paths for they will separate you away from a las path so had a lot the prophet alayhi salatu salam was sent and he remained in mecca for 13 years he did not teach the Muslims how to place a cap he did not tell them about the rules and regulations governing inheritance for example he did not talk to them about health issues for 13 years he had been implanting in them the love of Allah intelligent he was teaching them how to know allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala how to worship Allah with his beautiful names and attributes when he after these 13 years migrated to medina he came to a city that was devastated by wars and internal disputes he found that the unsub who came to support him we divided into an else and a hostage and they had a hundred years old feud among them the minute he set foot in Medina salala hierusalem he started to gain confidence of the people of Medina and he worked relentlessly on making them feel the bond of brotherhood among the Muslims so all the fusion wars between the house and the hostage were removed Subhan Allah by the grace of Allah and they were only known as the ants are no sub tribal names the uncertain that is it also he did the same with the Mujahideen the migrants who came from Mecca with nothing he made the Brotherhood bond between them and answer so from each one from a muhajireen he assigned one from an unsub not to take care of but to be his brother in the case that one of them would die the other would inherit him so it was full Brotherhood subhanAllah and that is why Islam prevailed with the grace of allah azzawajal and that is that what and that is why they were able to conquer the world and to have all these surrounding nations and empires coming to islam and we are seeing the fruits of that nowadays all due to the grace of Allah and after that due to their unity and like a lot of Mossad said may allah be pleased with him unity is beneficial it is high it is good while disputing is evil he said this when he rejected the idea that of man when I found may allah be pleased with him would pray in minna during the Hajj season the assa and Asia four rak'ahs inch instead of shortening them and he said that this was not the doing of the Prophet that I sought asylum and he was adamant to show the people that this was wrong but whenever the armor was called for the Salah and earth man would pray for a cast he would create behind him for records nobody should have prayed to and when his companions talked to him how would you say that this is not the sender and yet you are following him unblock my throat said this word that history records until today he said that Angela was shocked which means that dispute is evil and allah azzawajal forbade us from disputing and he says and obey Allah and His Messenger and do not dispute with one another lest you lose courage and your strength depart and be patient so Allah is telling us that the cause of disputing would be the loss of courage and the strength would be gone and it would depart us and the Prophet told us that I thought of some that his OMA would divide into 73 sects all are in hell except one those who are following his footsteps and the footsteps of his companions sallallahu alayhi wassalam and if you look around us we would find that there are a lot of small nations and countries Muslims but they're not United and if you look at the muslims and non Muslim countries you'd find them groups and sex again they don't have one to represent them and that is why people look down at them that is why then the Muslims invented what is known as divide and conquer or divide and rule and this is what they had done with the Muslims they are in every Valley spreading not allowing themselves to join and to come or to become United and this is what Islam tells us not to do and one would maybe argue and say but we have different schools of thought the Companions differed may Allah be pleased with them even at the time of the prophet Isaiah saw a loser well this is not what is meant by do not dispute and do not differ you cannot help but differ with another person but this difference in opinion does not cause into enmity hatred and fighting the companions may allah be pleased with them differed with one another but they never fought over what they had differed on you go your way I go my way the hearts are still pure and clean this is what your intellect led you to and you have all the right to think differently because you are human being and you have the knowledge necessary to give you this ability to choose and to tell right from wrong unisys Salafi may Allah have mercy on his soul said that I debated with Imam Shafi wants and we different and the following morning he came he greeted me he took my hand and he said you're honest isn't it possible that we differ and debate and yet still be brothers in Islam how wise Imam Shafi was this is the kind of difference that Islam promotes in the sense that we differ but we all remain brothers because the fundamentals are there we all refer to the Orang and the sooner we all respect the righteous predecessors of the Ummah of the scholars we all respect the Companions so even if we differ whether to put our right hand over the left on the chest or under the belly this is not a major thing this is something that can be tolerated in Islam what it cannot be tolerated is that we differ and we start to throw labels and names at each other though we are following the Quran and the Sunnah of course if someone comes with a theory or an idea that contradicts the Quran and the Sunnah we have to point out that to him and if he still insists on following it then we put him aside and ignored him I'm talking about us those who follow the Quran and Sunnah those who share the same a feed those who take their knowledge from the same sources we should unite and that is why I give my brothers and sisters my sincere advice that we should put aside our differences and abide by the Quran and bind by the sunnah and whenever we have something that we dispute over we go and refer to the scholars that we trust and first and most of all and last of all that we should have mercy upon each other and abide by the Rope of Allah until I meet you inshallah assalamualaikum warahmatullahi / cat"
