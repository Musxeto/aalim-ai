  "title": "Does the reward of a deed suffice for expiation of an oath",
  "transcript": "um a questioner says we are normally supposed to free a slave to expiate for breaking an oath if i recite la ilaha i get a reward of freeing ten slaves so this is sufficient to expiate my oath the answer is no as we have discussed this earlier in a previous question and we said that there is a difference between al jazeera the reward and to suffice so if you recite three times the reward is equivalent to reciting the whole quran that's the reward no one says that if i recite it in my prayer three times in every rakah this suffices for reciting the fatih because the fatih is part of the quran so as if i recited the whole quran including the fatiha your prayer is invalid and likewise with every single thing such as offering two raka's after sunrise after praying fajr in the masjid and remaining in your position remembering allah the prophet said that you're rewarded by umrah and hajj complete complete complete does this mean that i don't have to go for hajj khalas i've done my due diligence the answer is no this is rewarded as if but it does not suffice for the single hajj you have to perform once in a lifetime"
