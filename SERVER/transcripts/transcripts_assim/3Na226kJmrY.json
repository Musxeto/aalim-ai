  "title": "A woman doubts whether she got her purity at Zuhr or Asr, but checked at Asr? Should she pray Zuhr?",
  "transcript": "whatsoever I hope we have Mooney on the line um so if a woman checks for her Purity during the beginning of and she's still on her menes then she checks again after and she found out that she was actually like pure towards the end of D but she didn't know cuz she didn't check so does she now have to pray d as well or just the prayer of is not to be prayed unless you were certain that you were pure at the time of due to the fact that you checked or that woman checked after and saw her Purity she has no right to assume that oh had I checked half an hour ago probably I would have seen my Purity because certainty is not affected by doubt the certainity is she's still on her Menses this certainty is not taken away unless we are certain that she is pure and this would not be uh confirmed except after and therefore she does not do her"
