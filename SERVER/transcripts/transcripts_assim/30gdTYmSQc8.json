  "title": "Father recorded borrowed money as a debt, but the borrower thought it was a favor, can we ask for it",
  "transcript": "Muhammad from China Sheikh I have a question that previously there was the person who borrowed money from my father and he thought it as it was like a favor for him but my father wrote this in his record book and now fast forward around five years or six years my father has passed away may Allah have mercy on him but when we approached this person and asked him for the money I understand your question because we have 10 seconds left the answer is if you don't have a tangible evidence that can be held in a court of law then you have no right in asking for this money because it's your father's writing against this man's word you go to the court and say this man borrowed a thousand euros from my father the evidence is my father wrote that this man borrowed a thousand euros from him the judge goes to him said did you borrow said no I didn't borrow anything he gave me as a gift so who will be the decisive word his or your father's your father did not take a paper from this man saying that I borrowed this much from x y z and therefore you cannot claim such a money unless he confesses that yes I borrowed it or you bring two witnesses or a written confession from him stating that I took this as a loan and Allah azawajal knows best"
