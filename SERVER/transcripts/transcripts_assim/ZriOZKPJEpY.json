  "transcript": "Ro from Bangladesh we know that the for prayer ends when the Deep of the Sun comes out but if I cannot see that visually can I rely on theable the answer is yes Allah holds us accountable to what we can see so if we cannot see the rising of the sun we can rely on the Calenders or uh the Tim taes that tell us when Sunrise is however you have to make certain whether they mean that the tip of the sun has just risen at this particular time or the whole sun has risen at that time and there's a huge difference is a difference of maybe seven minutes or so so you have to make certain of that and Allah knows best but also you have to be really careful because Salat is the most important deed in our lives the problem with Muslims nowadays is that they have it the other way around basically the norm is that our lives our work our Hobbies our desires all revolve around prayer times so according to the prayer times we plan our lives nowadays it's the other way around people prioritize their lives over prayer time so if I have a hobby or if I have a meeting or business or a family gathering on the account of praying on time no problem I'll skip the prayer I'll delay it I'll pray it later on maybe I won't pray it at all because it's not a priority and this is a very grave uh uh problem and Allah Knows Best"
