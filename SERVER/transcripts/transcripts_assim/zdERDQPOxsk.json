  "transcript": "now one would argue and say okay if you claim that these two raka's are mandatory then answer this sheikh if i come after assad prayer to the masjid should i sit or should i pray and then sit answers you should pray to raka's [Applause] what's wrong said you said i have to pray said yeah but the prophet allah said it is not permissible to pray after assad prayer until the sun sets so i got you know you didn't said now you're telling me to defy the instruction of the prophet saws didn't the prophet say do not pray after asir until the sun sets yeah he did so how are you ordering me to pray to raka's of the hate and masjid he said listen you don't learn knowledge through picking things here and there you have to go to the root of the problem now when the prophet salallahu salaam prohibited us from praying after asar if i didn't pray fajr out of forgetfulness and i remembered after offering asar can i pray my fajr make it up yes sir you can okay if i were in the message after asur and they brought a deceased person to pray funeral prayer can i pray funeral prayer yes you can we have to bury the man so this is after assa thirdly if i was in the masjid hypothetically and the sun eclipsed so can we pray eclipse prayer i guess so yeah this is mandatory as well what about if i have to do something immediately and i need to pray to raka's can i do that i said yeah you can do that so the prohibition of the prophet alison to pray after asir is not an open one rather it is specific to things that have no legitimate cause to voluntary prayers someone after assad is sitting there and says listen i have like uh 20 minutes before maghrib let me pray ten raka's so nope sit down haram you can't do that but things that have a legitimate reason behind them you can offer them after us or so i hope this clarifies a lot of the ambiguity that many muslims may suffer from when it comes to these two rakaas"
