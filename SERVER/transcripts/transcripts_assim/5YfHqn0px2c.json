  "title": "Masjid has 2 khutbah on Friday Arabic by imam & other person gives in local language assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign I said the following there are two men okay one delivers in Arabic okay then he sits then the listener stands up and delivers the translation in German okay then the sitting one so the first one stands up again it's the the second hotba and then he and then he's the Imam for two rakas so the Arab does everything normal just the difference is in his sitting where normally everyone is Silent One someone stands up and then speaks German aloud and this is just part of their rumor I already spoke to them they should change it but they refused with basically no reason I hope this is scary no so by your correction the khatib of the jummah is actually giving two of the Juma however the Innovation they've introduced is that in between the two hotbas a translator stands up to give a translation again that is good and this is totally against the Sunnah and wrong however does that invalidate the or the Friday prayer I would personally believe that it would not invalidate it because in so many incidents while the prophet was giving his Friday speech there was an interaction between him and one of the worshipers by either clarification or a request or any of that sort and the prophet would interrupt his to listen and reply to that individual so the prayer inshallah is valid but what they are doing is a clear Innovation and it's prohibited and Allah Knows Best"
