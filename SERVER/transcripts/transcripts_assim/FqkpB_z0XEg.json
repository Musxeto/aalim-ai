  "transcript": "says if a man tells people he is divorced over and over again over the years is this marriage does his marriage stand um with his wife even though he tells people that he's divorced the answer is yes the marriage is valid because he is a blatant liar and this is not a divorce when a man says about himself I'm divorced this is not a divorce this is a blatant lie he may have intentions behind that unless he meant it and he see divorce is divided into two types explicit explicit and implicit so the ambiguous divorce is when I say to my wife we're done we're through we're over it's fanito go to your family go to your father never come back again and I have the intention of divorcing her this is the divorce but if I when asked do you have the intention to divorce I said no I just I'm just fed up with her then this is not a divorce a direct clear divorce is to say I divorce you in the present tense or you are divorced in the past tense and this is not related to your intention whether you intended it or not it's done so when he says that we are divorced or I'm divorced this is not a uh divorce on Allah Knows Best"
