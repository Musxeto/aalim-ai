  "transcript": "Abdul Aziz from Sri Lanka. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Barakatuh. How are you Sheikh? Alhamdulillah. Sheikh my question is I have come across a verse which says those who come to Allah with a pure heart will be saved. Could you please elaborate this ayah for me that what it means with a pure heart in this one. This is in reference to Ibrahim peace be upon him when he's warning the people by saying that no one wealth or children would benefit him on the day of judgment except those who come to Allah with a pure heart, with a healthy heart. And the scholars say that a pure or healthy heart is a heart that has no shirk in it. So a Muslim or a non-Muslim who comes with shirk being committed, he will go to hellfire for eternity. And those who come with a pure heart, Muslims who come with a heart that does not have any shirk in it, rather it's filled with tawheed. If they have some innovation, they will be purified in hellfire for some time until they are clean and then they will be admitted to Jannah unless Allah wills otherwise. And those who come with a heart that is healthy and pure from shirk and innovation but they have major or minor sins in it, most likely Allah would forgive that if he wills and if not they will be purified for some time in hellfire and then they will be admitted to paradise for eternity. And I hope this answers your question."
