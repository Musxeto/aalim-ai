  "title": "Endorsing or Collabing with YouTubers who have halal products but have music or pics of women",
  "transcript": "Ibn Nur Nuruddin from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So my question is what's the ruling on promoting a halal service or product with a Muslim influencer if the video itself where they promote you it's fully halal but they might have some stuff like music on other videos not on the one that they promote you on Jazak Allah Khair First of all when you go to an influencer you do so to promote your product or a service knowing that this influencer has followers so you go to him you pay him money and he does this service for you the service itself is halal however by you announcing it to the public that I am advertising with xyz who's an influencer knowing that this influencer has haram followers and followings and other products that those who follow your ad would most likely follow him and checking him out and looking at his materials it's not permissible the means itself is not permissible because you're endorsing this influencer it's like going to a an influencer who's a female and she has all the videos with botox on her face and lips that are as big as camel's lips and she's not wearing the hijab but on your ad she would only use her channel to advertise for you again you're giving her money in the wrong place because you're seeking her followers and that endorses her and Allah knows best you"
