  "title": "Hindus give sweets to Muslims on Diwali; some say it's halal to eat, but HOW CAN it be?",
  "transcript": "jate from India assalamu alaykum uh Shake in India there's a Hindu festival called Diwali so in this Festival the Hindus they distribute sweets even to the Muslims and the sweets are of two types like the first type is the one on which the name of other than Allah has been taken which we know is completely forbidden in Islam while the second type is that they purchase the sweets from the market and directly gifted gifted to us so I personally avoid it but there are some Muslims who say that it is halal if the name of anyone other than Allah has not been taken on it but the reason for it is to celebrate a non-muslim festival wherein they are doing shik so what should we do about this either way my friend as long as the ingredients of these sweets do not contain meat that was slaughtered in the name of other than Allah so normal sweets whether they say the names of their gods on these sweets and then give it to you or they do not this does not transform the sweets into Halal Oram the sweets are sweets they're Halal so either way if they give it to you as a gift if you're not in their Gatherings if you're not celebrating this div with them you can accept these sweets without any problem"
