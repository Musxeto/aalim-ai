  "title": "PayPal doesnâ€™t have a late payment fee, can we borrow from them? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Ibraheem from the UK, Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh, I have a question about PayPal pay in three installments, I checked the terms and conditions and they don't have any late payments or interest applied but they say that if you don't make a payment within the three months of borrowing that it affects your credit and future potential to get to use their service, is this Haram? It is not permissible to borrow from any entity if there is late payment or a threat of paying a little bit more but if you're borrowing from someone and you're obliged to pay them back on time exactly as much you have borrowed from, I personally do not believe that PayPal or any other entity would do this free of charge, at least if they give you a thousand dollars they will take off you five percent commission or their fee and this is Riba immediately but hypothetically if they give you a thousand and you pay them a thousand back this is permissible and if they say if you're late in paying the thousand this would impact your name and the ability to take another loan in the future but still you have to pay the one thousand this is again permissible and Allah knows best."
