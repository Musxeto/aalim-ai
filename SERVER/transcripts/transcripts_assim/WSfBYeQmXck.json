  "title": "Will Poor be admitted into Paradise 500 years before the Rich? & Hadith of 70,000 - Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "okay Sarah from bahin she had three questions well actually there two so she says that in the Hadith where the Prophet Alat wasam says that I saw the poor from my umah entering Paradise 500 years before the rich and the rich are at the gates of paradise being held accountable for where they earned and where they had spent their money not that they are sinful or going to hell so she's saying is this individual poor or as a whole the answer is as a whole because not every poor person qualifies to enter Paradise they might have sins that are beyond our imagination Allah throws them in hell and not every rich person would be held for 500 years until his accounts are settled because some of them as in your second question might be admitted to Paradise from the first uh uh second so this is in general as for her second Hadith the prophet said there will be 70,000 of my um who will be admitted to Paradise without accountability nor prior punishment or torment and he explained that they are those who do not ask people to do for them who do not believe in bad Omens and who do not ceriz themselves by using a a hot burning Rod of metal and putting it in special places and they have trust and total dependence on Allah so this is their description and the prophet told us Sall Ali wasallam in another Hadith that with every one of these 70,000 there is an additional 70,000 and you do the math so Allah's favor upon us is great may Allah make us uh uh all among them from"
