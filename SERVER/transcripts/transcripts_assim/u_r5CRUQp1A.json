  "title": "If I don't catch the 2nd ruku of Friday prayer with the imam, must I pray dhuhr? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "have a question about the Juma prayer yes sir I heard that in in the gym if I if I go after this Ruku in the second raka then after the Imam does the Salam I have to offer four cause of Zohar instead of the tour cause of Juma bread so what do I have to do in this case the prophet Allah indicated to us that whoever attains minimum of one raka with the Imam so the Imam is in record position and you come and offer a core and both of you are simultaneously in the record position and then you continue the prayer this was the last raka the prophet said that you have attained the prayer so if you come in Maghrib and you attain the last rukur with the Imam and he sits in the third raka over salaam you offer two rakas only because that rukor is considered to be a full raka a full unit if the Imam says while you were trying to go for record which means that you were not with him in the Roku position simultaneously this means that you did not attain the Salat which means if you did not attain Friday yet you joined the congregation when the Imam has already raised his head from rukur the second or was in the shahud before concluding the prayer and you joined him this late this means that the Friday prayer in you in your case is not valid what to do whenever you miss a Friday prayer what is the alternative that you have to pray Lord and this is why when the Imam offers salaam you stand up and you continue for raqqa of the and you're not rewarded for the jummah and Allah Knows Best"
