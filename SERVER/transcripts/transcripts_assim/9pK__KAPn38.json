  "title": "Asking others to do Ruqya for us - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "the hadith says that you do not go and ask people to give rupiah I feel a bit sick oh brother Ali come and give me a rakia I have pain in my stomach so I'm asking him to do repair for me which is something between a person and Allah is doing supplications reciting the Quran giving hadith etc this would prevent me from being among the 70,000 of this nation who would enter Jannah without any accountability or punishment this is a privilege this is a plus it's the first class it's the elite where Allah shall treat these people with his generosity and mercy this is different from me being sick and then I say hmmm why don't you I did rock you to myself this is totally permissible and has nothing to do with the hadith so I do rock it on myself and I drink the water or I'm sick and my friend or my wife or my son comes in and sees me and he puts his hand on my head or he just says the rakia without asking me and he gives me rakia again this is nope there's no problem you're still among the 70 thousand people those who do not believe in bad omen they do not ask people to do rope here those people who do not cure eyes and on a larger they have their full trust so I hope this answers your question"
