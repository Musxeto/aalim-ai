  "transcript": "I lies my heart's age your mercy is what I beseech keeping my heart you'll remember and singing singing to evidence help me in my quest permit me to pass the ultimate test help me in my quest [Music] is [Music] dear brothers and sisters in Islam assalamu alaikum and welcome to this live episode of ask Huda coming to you every Sunday and Tuesday at five o'clock local time here in Cairo Egypt as usual we will take your live questions in uh sister Eve from the UK I've got the two questions if that's all right yep go ahead um I'm trying to commit to the Sunnah fast and uh right now the free white days is going to be on Friday Saturday Sunday so if I do Thursday which is also the soon of us so it's gonna be Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday and Monday and it's the days are very long right now in UK um is it is it mandatory to pass on 13 14 15 maybe I can do 14 15 16 and combine it with Monday but it would be a bit shorter is that okay okay second question and the second question um about the Family Planning care Living in UK um kind of scared to have more children I have three already and because of the fit now that they get in the school and everything and as a revert I don't really have much choices um I don't know is it timely planning okay if you are scared of for the fitness children okay um like it's reception all that stuff yeah thank you you're welcome first of all is it mandatory to fast these voluntary days if they're voluntary how can they be mandatory so if the white days coincide with Friday Saturday and Sunday but you're used to fasting Mondays and Thursdays every week which one would I prefer I'd prefer that you skip the white days observe the Mondays and Thursdays because at the end of the month you would have fasted eight days rather than fasting the white days which is only three days per month if you can combine both that's a win-win so combining Thursday with the following three days the white days and a Monday that's pretty fine but if it is difficult for you you can choose whatever you want however choosing to do the 14th and 15th because it's a Saturday and a Sunday and combining Monday with it would not give you the virtue of fasting the three days that are the white days it's a package deal is either you fast 13 14 and the 15th together or no need to fast any of them and just randomly fast any three days of the month so I hope this answers your first question as for family planning having three children is a gift from Allah and to worry whether to have more would be problematic you're scared for the fate of the coming children this is from shaytan when you have three children the risk is there when you have one child a child the risk is there when you have more than three children the risk is less how's that because they'll be together the more children you have the more the more care they would give one another the more experienced they would share with one another and the Lesser threat would be upon them as a group as a Unity as a number of siblings together so the prophet encouraged us Allah to have as many children as possible not that we focus on quantity over quality rather they go in parallel so have a lot of children but at the same time invest in upbringing them in a fashion that would be fitting of Islam and the Muslims and that would comfort you when you're older when you have so many children who would take care of you at an an older age with Nilla Aquila from India yes my question is that if a person makes an oath before the age of fluidity okay does it open does it require Expedition uh I have another question for you as well yes my second question is that in soil stick part we say that uh oh Allah you are my Lord my God except you you created me I am your student and I advisement and promise you can oh I mean kind of breaks it okay I will answer inshallah thank you first of all the prophet said that the pen of accountability has been uplifted over three categories of people meaning that they are not held accountable on the day of judgment for what they had done a person who's asleep until he wakes up so someone who's asleep and while sleeping he would shout oh my wife I divorce you I divorce you I divorce you is this a valid divorce answer is no if he says words of kufur or shirk while asleep he is not accountable because he's not in the state of Sanity that Allah holds him accountable for the second category is someone who's insane until he regains his sanity someone who is classified as a wacko he's insane mentally unstable and he goes and breaks things is he accountable no yes his Guardian has to pay for what he'd had damaged but is he sinful the answer is no and the third is a child until he reaches the age of puberty so if a child swears or says words of kufur he's not accountable because he is not sane yet or he has not reached the age of puberty where Allah would hold him accountable and likewise if he swears not to do something are we obliged to tell him to go and expiate the answer is no because he's not accountable for his actions and hence expiation is not due for him and Allah knows best as for akayla's second question which is about said far I am upon your pledge and promise that I promise not to send and to fulfill my dues and obligations to the best of my ability this is not an oath this is saying that I am doing my level best to the best of my ability it's like saying wallahi I will not do this insha Allah so saying insha Allah means that you're not obliged to fulfill such an oath because you made a condition and saying to the best of my ability is also stating a similar condition Knows Best Yusuf from the UAE all right is it mandatory for me to say uh if I'm praising someone for me to say uh Allah if one feels shy of saying this is okay first of all is it mandatory the answer is no but it is highly recommended because this would prevent you from saying something without knowledge and that's why you're relating this knowledge to Allah azzawajal Allah is more knowledgeable of him when I praise someone I say brother so and so he's an excellent brother he's a trustworthy brother I wouldn't give such a testimony without saying Allah is his witness and I don't praise him over Allah's in the sense that without relating this to Allah's knowledge but if I did not say that I wouldn't be sinful in sha Allah but I would be doing something macro now if I'm shy of saying it would that take me out of the fault of Islam of course not over and over again we say that Islam is not an easy thing that you can come in and come out of as simple as that so many people are intimidated are frightened by the concept that they might leave the fold of Islam so whatever happens they think oh did I say something that I became a kaffir is this shirk is this kuffer and shaytan works them really bad such overthinking is one of the ways of shaytan of derailing us and diverting us from the straight path which we have to avoid and Allah Knows Best we have um Amina From the UAE salaam alaikum so I have two questions the first one is um my father passed away like 10 years ago and he has almost 40 children so when he passed away uh they said that it was very difficult to define the properties so they kept it and I told them that that is not islamically correct and they say well you know we we're not following the Islamic way of dividing the heritance so I told them because I didn't want to get it it's too much people I don't want to get into a lot of problems with people so I wrote a letter that I'm not interested in the hearings anymore then I listen to one of your lectures that you cannot do that so did I do the right thing and it is not the writing what do I need to do now and that was almost 10 years ago that I said I don't want to have anything to do with it they shouldn't give me anything and the second question is uh do you have any recommendations for like a psychologist a Muslim women psychologist that you can recommend because I have a sister that I've tried so many psychologists and therapists but the advice they're giving to her is not really the best islamically advice as to what to do because she's having like a mentor issue so if you can recommend someone will really appreciate it just have to like her or just welcome okay for as for your first question on Amina whatever Allah has given you as part of the inheritance from your father this is your god-given right once you possess it it's up to you whether to keep it and utilize it or to give it away as Charity or to let go of it by Distributing it on whomever you wish from your siblings and from the other heirs the paper that you had written stating to them that you have no interest in it at the moment is not binding because the inheritance is not divided so you did not possess it yet you cannot give something you did not possess therefore you have the right to claim it whenever they are Distributing any of your father's wealth whenever they do so you can claim it because it's your god-given and you can possess it and then give it a means of charity you can also take them to court your siblings have no right in preventing and stopping the distribution of such wealth this is your god-given right and this is the right of all other heirs Allah gave him this money who are you to prevent them so if they say that we're not going to divide it islamically and they don't give a heat or pay heat to doing the right thing you should not respect them as well and you should take them to court and demand your right if they want a peaceful settlement they will come and say okay our father's property is equivalent to so and so your share is so and so will buy your share here you go and then you can do that and document it and it is permissible in halal Allah knows best as for your second question in regards to a female psychiatrist unfortunately I do not know of any personally you have to look around and look for someone who is a practicing Muslim see there are so many psychiatrists and so many people dealing in psychology and they have Muslim names but when you come to their treatment you find that it has nothing to do with Islam on the contrary they may ask you to do things that are prohibited according to what they have learned in school which is not necessarily Islamic therefore one has to be really careful when it comes to such uh professionals that you don't fall in the wrong hands Seiko DD from the Netherlands um I'm from Gambia originally West Africa what can I do for you okay I I have a quick question for you I want to know the ruling of them okay the fourth one is that a lot of places in our place when they finish the prayer and the max deep they will gather together and say they want to send Salam to the prophet Allah and everyone have to do this together at once and the second question is that during the burial if someone die then people during the burial people will try to research maybe seven times they're trying to read the Quran during the burial I have witnessed this someone said no this is not the Sunnah of the Prophet we have to um ask Allah to give him okay it was a big fight the Imam said we have to pray for him we have to read the Quran for the the disease during the burial and the third question is that um I think um once in a year it's not a maolo Nabi well it's not about yeah we call this Gamo once in a year the village all the people in that Village will gather together to read the Quran and they spend the day and the night to pray or the you know people from different places to gather together and they kill a lot of cows and stuffs they say this is another way to you know people gather together and and they say it's a form of worship and I think this is not about the the dead bird of the Prophet but this is something once in a year all the people in the village will go there and read Quran research Quran and maybe at night they do this some of the dawah is it the uh this is permissible in Islam these three questions I want to know the rule the ruling of them in Islam and I am the I am a very big fans of yourself I follow you a lot and I want you to remember me in your prayers as well I love you for the sake of Allah make you steadfast upon the Sunnah of the prophet and combine and join you and me with the prophet Islam in Jannah to name and all our viewers ask for your questions before I answer them Allah be pleased with her as in Muslim and elsewhere said that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam clearly said whoever innovates in our religion what's not part of it it is rejected it is void it is unaccepted and this is one of the pillars of our religion that Islam revolves around number one Deeds are judged by intention number two these Deeds have to be comply in compliance to the Sunnah of the Prophet Allah so these are pillars of Islam which means that when I judge something it has to be in accordance with the parameters of the Quran the Sunnah with the understanding of the three favorite Generations the of the sahaba Companions tabirin and tabir tabin otherwise it's an innovation it's something that is fabricated our Lord Allah in the Quran said today [Music] I have completed your religion and completed my favor upon you and accepted Islam to be your religion Palace it's over whatever was completed you can't add anything to it you cannot take anything out of it if this is crystal clear to you and to all Muslims because this is Basics logical things you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure it out if this is clear to you and to the Muslims let's go to your questions where it says these guys after the Salam after the prayer of the congregational prayer they offer salutation upon the prophet Allah very good very nice salutation upon the prophet salallahu is highly recommended and desirable anytime nope what do you mean nope if I'm coming out of the toilet or if I'm entering the toilet I want to answer the call of nature I say Bismillah this is the Dua we all know this can I say Allah or when I come out I say rofranak Allah no this is inappropriate he said why said this is not something that the prophet taught us to say excellent did the prophet teach you to offer salutation upon the prophet after concluding the Salat no but it's a good thing a good thing in your head not in the religion of Islam and this is an innovation because you've come up with something that the prophet did not come up with so question number one did the prophet ever offer salutation upon himself after Salat no did it did the companions the four rightly guided khalifas was it ever reported that they performed congregational salutation upon the prophet after the Salah no so with all due respect do you know more than them no but it's a good thing subhanallah a good thing and the prophet did not do it you're coming to me and saying that oh now I'm doing something the prophet didn't do he didn't know that it was a good thing that's why he didn't do it but I'm doing it this is kufur in the Netherlands or in Germany or in the UK or the US they're doing this actually most of these imams are ignorant people they don't know or they are following deviant sex and cults these are immigrants who came running and fleeing their country for a good Social Security they're coming for money if you check a lot of them not all of course there are righteous and practicing Muslims among them but so many people that I get similar questions from are gold diggers they are buying homes in riba and mortgage they're free mixing I get sisters from Denmark and from Norway and from uh uh Sweden talking to me about imams telling them to come with them in the car travel to different cities alone what is this and she says I don't know the Imam says it's okay these are not imams they're just there for the money yeah maybe they're Arabs maybe they're Turks maybe they're from here or there they know few verses of the Quran and masha'allah they grew up here then they became mawlana and they became these are deviant people stay away from them second question when we are doing the burial they say you have to recite Surah a number of times and read the Quran and this and the Imam says this is what we should do do you have any report that the prophet did this no but this is good thing we're reading Quran it's nothing bad about it do you know more than the prophet Allah again this is an innovation the prophet when he sallallahu finished burying his companion he said to his companions who were round the grave ask Allah for forgiveness for your brother and ask Allah to make him steadfast because now he's being questioned no Quran no a Hadith no nothing so if the prophet did not tell them to recite such surahs do you know more this is weird man so this is the beauty of Islam you don't need someone to come and give you syllable approval all what you need is to open the Quran open the books of Sunnah find the way whether it is the way of the Prophet or not and then you have your answer and finally the the last question there is a night Where We Gather in the village and we spend the night reading the Quran making Dua offering sacrifice feasting Etc I don't know what that night is but definitely the whole thing is not from Islam maybe you're gonna say this is the miraculous night Journey which is on the 27th of rajab maybe you're gonna say this is on the 15th of Shaban which is mubaraka ETC maybe you're going to say this is here or there either way in our religion we do not have such a day where people Gather in congregation and do what they are doing as you have claimed because this is an innovation Allah Knows Best we have money from the U.S yes sir Like a Prayer due to laziness or traveling are we supposed to pray sunnah's prayers with us prayers after that prayer because we do not complete a set of 12. and uh what are some non-em emphasized Sunnah uh prayers with other prayers thank you so if I were to miss an emphatic Sunnah Sunda we know that there are 12 rakas during the day and night if you manage to offer them regularly Allah will build you a house in Jannah what are these rakas two before third prayer of Fajr four before the two after the after Maghrib and after Asia these are 12 emphatic the prophet never left them when he was in Medina he used to skip all of them with the exception of the turakas before Fajr whenever he traveled So when you say to me that whenever I travel shall I make them up the answer is no because the Sunnah is not to be made up what about if I miss them whether I was lazy whether I had a a meeting I forgot them there's no problem in making them up inshaallah if you had a legitimate reason and if you did not have a legitimate reason the reward would won't be the same but again still you can make them up insha Allah and finally what are some of the unemphatic sunnan to be prayed first of all whatever is between Adan and nakama so between every Adan and a comma there are turakas also the four raka before as a prayer may Allah have mercy upon anyone who prays foreign also an extra turakas after Lord so we know that there are four before two after the emphatic and you add another two this is of some of the non-emphatic Sunda that you can offer among others and Allah azzawajal knows best we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back summer [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] he is foreign [Music] and it is he who sends down rain from the sky and we produce thereby the growth of all things we produce from it Greenery from which we produce grains arranged in layers and from the palm trees of its emerging fruit are clusters hanging low and we produce Gardens of grapevines and olives and pomegranates similar yet varied look at each of its fruit when it yields and at its ripening indeed in that are signs for a people who believe [Music] supplication when stricken with a mishap or overtaken by an affair the strong believer is better and more beloved to Allah than the weak believer and there is goodness in both strive for that which will benefit you seek help from Allah and do not despair if a mishap should happen to befall you and then do not say if only I had acted such and such would have happened rather say Allah has decreed and what he Wills he does for verily if let's in the work for the devil [Music] and welcome back we have brother Amal from Tunisia foreign okay so my first question is unfortunately I was born out of wedlock I have a younger sister she's also born out of wedlock uh unfortunately I'm the only brother my sister has my mom is now married so my question is who is the world of my people who's your father and who's who's your sister's father wait wait who's your father and who is your sister's father is he is the same man you don't have the same father okay second question okay okay my second question is that I was born in the U.S is from two different countries in Africa for example uh neither instead of Africa but if I were to Define America or another Africa or Senegal we don't be simple for that your line is breaking your line is breaking but if your question is whether you attribute yourself to any of these four or five countries is it sinful or not the answer is no you can attribute yourself to any country as long as you have the proper documentation okay so my third question is we know that in Islam whenever someone thinks of ignorance there's no sin on them does this apply to Major things like for example of knowing others out of the foreign okay first of all your sister who was born out of wedlock and you don't share the same father with her you cannot be herwali herwali if she doesn't have a paternal family that she can be attributed to her while he becomes the Muslim judge in the country she's living in so the Muslim ruler the Muslim judge or the authorized Islamic Center the Imam authorized there would become her guardian but not you the Imam or the ruler can appoint you but not you um as for the second question which country you're in this depends on the documents you're carrying so if you're carrying the documents of nature or of Senegal of the US then you can say that I am from this country or that country as for your third question this is an issue of dispute whether the excuse of ignorance can include issues of or not some Scholars say that if a person commits kuffor or shirk out of ignorance this is not justifiable and they will be thrown in hell for eternity other Scholars like they mean say that no this is not true otherwise what was the reason for sending the Messengers so that they would uplift this ignorance and put the proof against the people because if they could not receive the proper knowledge they can't be held accountable elsewhere the famous Hadith where a person on his dying bed called his wives and children and said what kind of a man was I and they said you were the best of husbands and the best of fathers and he said that I was a bad person so if I were to die cremate me and spread my ashes on the top of mountains and the bottom of valleys and over the oceans scattered me all over the place for if Allah was able to gather me back he would torment me severely after they did what he had asked them to do Allah ordered the top of the mountains and the bottom of the valleys and the oceans to gather his remains and he was standing in front of Allah and Allah asked him my servant why did you do what you had done and the man says because I was afraid of you o Allah now the concept and the doubt that this man had that if Allah were to gather me he would have tormented me severely this notion this idea by itself is yet due to his ignorance due to his extreme fear that made him do such a thing Allah forgave his sins and admitted him to Jannah therefore whether it's a major sin or a minor Center if a person does it out of ignorance and Allah Only Knows whether he's ignorant or not then he's not accountable and Allah Knows Best Amina from Saudi yes I have two questions uh inshallah this year I'm planning to perform Hajj and I will opt for Hajj Kiran um I am very clear that um I have the option to go directly to mina on seven zul hija and of kuduru is actually Sunnah but there is a confusion among my colleagues that no you have to go first to uh Haram to performed by Sai umrah and then start going to Mina and do the rituals and then do tawaf ifada and say ifada the second question I have is uh is it permissible to use the electrical scooter for tawaf and Sai that's all okay first of all what your friends had said to you is totally not correct a person when doing hatch has three rituals to perform either ifrah or Tehran or tomato as you're opting for Kiran this means that you have the option of doing one of two either you follow the Sunnah which is to go to Mecca on the seventh and you perform which is a Sunnah what do you mean by Sunnah this is no it's not an umbra what your friends are telling you is totally bogus and wrong this is Sunnah you offered seven rounds which is followed by seven rounds of Sai which is not part of the omra rather this is called sayul Hajj and then you go to Mina and you do the rituals and everything on the day of Eid you go to Makkah to do tawaful which is a pillar but you don't follow that with sari of a Hajj because you've already done that on the seventh after tawafakudum oh so I have the option to offer Hajj earlier than eight the answer is yes this is how the prophet offered this offered it okay then what's the second option the second option is you don't go to Makkah at all on the seventh of the hija or the eighth of the Hijra you go straight to me now no the prophet did that and went to Mena he did not clip his hair huh you never clip your hair if you're a mufrid or a Karen until after the day of eight so your second option is to go straight to Mina okay then what do all the rituals of going to Arafat and then on the day of radio to mina now you have two pillars left and by the way powerful a father is a pillar of Hajj without it your Hajj is invalid it has three names so that you don't become confused when you read some of the books available or on the Internet name number one powerful if Alba name number two name number three all three are for the same ritual afterwards you offer serial Hajj because you did not do them on the seventh and after you do the father and say it Hajj normal clothes you don't have to be in the set of and you don't shave or clip your hair afterwards these are pillars of Hajj these are not a umrah so I hope this makes some sense to you as for your second question it is permissible to use the electric scooter for tawaf and Sai for those who are in need such as the elderly or those who are tired those who are sick and even those who are healthy it's permissible but their reward would be less and Allah Knows Best brother dawood from the U.S all right I'm fine how can I help you I have two questions so the first one is uh that's it I do like card detailing and I accept that and let's say I go clean someone's card that I know he he makes his money from Halal money and he pays me as a ham is it going to be a hat on for me or no so you you have a question listen you have a garage or a shop where you detail cars and someone comes to you with his Ferrari Roma and says I'd like you to detail it and put spoilers and and mufflers and and the likes but his income is Haram is this your question okay second question second question is when I used to go to Driving School uh we had to pay for like segment one and segment two and segment two I didn't pay it on purpose do I have to pay them back or no so how did they how did they award you the driving license if you did not pay for it I I we were supposed to pay them twice and I only paid them once okay I'll answer you inshallah first of all generally speaking if I am providing a Halal service the income of the person who's buying or getting the service from me is none of my business otherwise if I have a a supermarket and someone comes to me to buy a bottle of water would it be logical asking him okay what's your income what is your IRS statement where are you doing this what are you doing in your life of course not so whether their income is totally Haram meaning they work in insurance they work for a conventional bank they deal in entertainment they sell tobacco intoxicants they have a bar or a nightclub this is on them the service I'm providing is not related to their sin I'm selling them water I'm detailing cars I am a tailored making suits and and the likes there's nothing wrong in that insha Allah because it's not related to their sin as for the second question is a well-known fact in Islam that the prophet said those who cheat us are not from Among Us Muslims don't lie Muslims don't cheat Muslims don't steal so if you availed or utilized or use their service and did not pay them you're sinful and you're accountable and Allah will take the blessing from you one way or the other in addition to what awaits you on the day of Judgment of his torment and Wrath so yes they these people trusted you it's not justifiable to say that oh they're disbelievers they're kafir they're this and that I can cheat them I can deceive them no you have to pay them what they provided you with and Allah Knows Best this is our last caller brother hulam from the US I have couple of yes I have a doctor like you are free whatever like in my language not that your line is breaking I can't answer you unless you're talking from a secure line that I can understand your question so if you can park and speak to me directly not on your speakerphone give me a minute give me a second give me a second just a second okay yeah I'm parked right now yeah just a second I can hear you now speak hello okay okay sorry for that yes okay so I I have been argue with my wife I tell her that okay you can you are free something like this but I don't know this word have a double meaning I know that because this kind of word we use lot of time lot of other relation like Mom said that Sam you free you can go whatever you want like even we used to be like this I I don't know that this kind of whatever doubles meaning like the final one but hi did you have did you did you have intention to divorce her yes or no but I don't use any final award and my intention was never give her the anything maybe uh my intention was not given anything like something final what I just threat her so in between I talk I tell her say in same argument I tell her that you are free something like that so my person that if someone says that point is talking with the like separation or something else then if you say anything like this then it's gonna be does not matter the intention but I don't know that and I saw her I don't know which one I say first that you are free or I cannot be used if I I'm gonna be talk with you some bad words do you want me to tell you she's divorced no I don't want to tell this no no no no no no no no no okay listen to me listen to me take it easy and hold your horses you want the ruling she's not divorced and this is not a divorce nothing happened you're still married any more questions I I say you are free it's not anymore why are we going in circles you want a divorce I can give you a divorce you don't if you don't want a divorce she's still your wife end the call and go back and have a good dinner and hanky-panky enjoy your life but don't keep on opening a can of worms and then say Oh what can I do keep on knocking on Scholars houses and doors asking them did this divorce happen or not I gave you the final verdict move on with your life and put a full stop to these Whispers of shaytan this is all the time we have and with this I would be concluding my presence here in ascuda it was a memorable event and and days spending it here with the brothers in Huda TV it was fun alhamdulillah next week we will be back with ask zad and ask zad and ask Koda they're the same thing with the grace of Allah I pray to Allah that we benefit from what we learn and that it gets us closer to Allah the almighty what is foreign [Music]"
