  "transcript": "from nigeria he said there is this lady let's assume his wife his sister who does not pray on time and sometimes she prays after the time is over so how can we advise her first of all if a person prays on time this means that the allocated time of a prayer this is called praying on time so luhr prayer the prayer starts at 12 30 for example and usual prayer starts at 3 30. within these three hours this is called praying on time so if a person prays it at 12 30 at 12 50 at one o'clock at two o'clock at three o'clock at just at 3 24 and he manages to finish the prayer before the adam of assa this is called praying on time so you and i have no right to go and complain to people you're not praying on time you're doing those yes it's best to pray at the beginning of the time mainly speaking if a person is having a habit of maybe skipping prayer because of such delays nevertheless we have to try our level best to be diplomatic to know how to pull people to islam gently and softly without intimidating them and without repelling them away from islam sometimes it's our own way of dawa that repels people away from islam our harshness our rudeness our prophet islam was described to be gentle it is by the mercy of allah that you're soft to them had you been rude hard-hearted they would have gone away from you and not uh um come to listen and learn from you so you try your level best to give dawah nicely now if a person is reminded to pray and he says yes inshallah procrastinates and says and then adam is called in this case we try to tell that person that you have done a major sin in islam and because you have delayed it until it was over this is considered as skipping it which means that don't pray the anymore even if he wants to go and pray no no you there's no need allah will not accept it from you and this is the most authentic opinion if a person deliberately skips a prayer until the following prayer is due he cannot make it up and the prophet said allah clearly that whoever oversleeps and whoever forgets a prayer must pray it as soon as he remembers there's no expiation for it other than that sheikh bennett and other honorable scholars said that the prophet gave two reasons for making it up and consider that as expiation over sleeping and forgetfulness but if someone deliberately consciously and intentionally skips it then he cannot make it up so tell them that this is a serious offense and tell them that some scholars even went to the extent that it would be an act of kufr to do that deliberately and may allah azza protect us all"
