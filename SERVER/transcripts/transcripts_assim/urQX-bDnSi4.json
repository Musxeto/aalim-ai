  "transcript": "Rajeev says do I have to be married reach the age of 42 recite the Dora mentioned in Surat al-kahf ayah number 15 the answer is no the ayah that goes to saying when he reaches maturity and reaches the age of 40 years he says my Lord enabled me to be grateful for your favour which you have bestowed upon me and upon my parents and to work righteousness of which you will approve and make righteous for me my offspring indeed I have repented to you and indeed I am of the Muslims this too is a general dua and it's part of the doors of the Quran so you don't have to reach 40 to say this because this is when that person in the ayah said it when he reached maturity at the developer should the hua bala arba'een asana and he reached 40 years of age this is when he started to praise Allah and thank him for that gift but if you are like 20 years of age there is no problem and saying that do I at all bearing in mind that saying this draw is not part of the Sunnah what do you mean she cuts in the Quran I know it's in the Quran I've just read it for you but it is not from the Sunnah in the sense that the Prophet is all Salam did not say that door it was not reported to us that he used to say that du'a so if the Prophet did not do it a little so does this mean it's Haram I didn't say it's Haram I said it is not from the Sunnah which means that it can be permissible to say it but it is not from the Sunnah we're confused no there's no reason to be confused inside he'll go hide and elsewhere there was a man who used to lead his companions in salat and every surah he reads he combines to it all who Allahu Ahad so he reads to sewers so his companion said to him listen either recite one surah or recite put who Allahu Ahad there's no reason to combine both of them he said listen you asked me to lead you in prayer you don't like me to lead your prayer go and choose someone else so they went to the Prophet and complained a little ofsome and he said to them ask him why does he read it so they did and he said because I love it due to the fact that it includes the description of allah azza wajal so the Prophet said to him a less awesome your love to it or for it made you enter Jannah and Allah loves you for that so now the Prophet approved Ali Saleh - Salam this man reading it and we know that approval of the Prophet Isis lamb is a Sunnah there is a Sunnah of him saying things asuno of him doing things a Sunnah of him approving things now when we say it's a Sunnah does it mean that if we do it we are rewarded for it like other Souness scholar said no approving him here means that it is permissible to do like this companions had done you can recite for example surah Tauba ha and after you conclude it you say call who Allahu Ahad Allah summit no problem with that but this is not the best thing for you to do because the prophet alayhi salatu salam had never done such a thing so if there were extra reward in it or if it was a better thing to do the Prophet would have done it Abu Bakr Umar Uthman and Ali would have done it the great companions of the Prophet would have done it but none of them did so it was only this ice incident with with this particular companion who had done it so we have the choice between following the Prophet Ali salatu salam anticipating the highest and the best reward ever or following that companion and definitely following that companion would reduce your reward but it's not something haram or dislike it's simply permissible and the best is to follow the sunnah of the prophet alayhi s-salatu wa sallam on Allah Azza WA JAL knows best"
