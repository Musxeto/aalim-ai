  "transcript": "um I was wondering that if a deceased has left some debts behind and he hasn't left any inheritance at all to pay off the debts from and he has their wife and two daughters Who Remain after his death are his HS the ones who are most responsible to pay off the debts on his behalf and would it be his wife or his children or do any of them have any responsibility at all so the question is clear a deceased dies leaving nothing behind who's obliged to pay off his debts the wife or the two daughters or if he had Sons the answer is the answer is none of them this is an obligation upon the individual the heirs are not obliged to pay off for his debts or for his mistakes if he did not leave any property or wealth behind then this is not their responsibility if they are well off and they would like to save their loved one save their father for example by paying off his debts then alhamdulillah they're rewarded for that but it is not mandatory upon them and Allah Knows Best"
