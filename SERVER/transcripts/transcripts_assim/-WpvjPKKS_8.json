  "title": "In Islam, some Martyrs are washed before burial & some are not, Why is this? | Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "and my third question is I know for some Shahid's you when they when they die you don't wash their body and for someone they die you wash their body can't you please address the difference please okay I will do that to Sharla so abdullah x' third question I think from Canada he said that why when it comes to marchers some of them we do not wash before burial and others we wash before burials okay the only martyr the only Shaheed who is not washed before burial is the one who dies in the battlefield so if someone for example was wounded on the battlefield and was taken to a hospital and he stayed there for a month and then died he's not a Shaheed in the sense that we should bury him as he is those who died on the battlefield are considered to be Shaheed they will not be washed and they will be buried as they are the rest of the Shahid's are the ones that die not on the battlefield such as those who die in fire or under a collapsed house or while drowning or due to the plague or due to an illness which attacks their intestines and cause causes internal illness that maybe cancer can be one of the interpretations a woman who dies while in labor all of these are considered to be Shaheed they're considered to be martyrs they will get the reward of martyrs but this reward is not similar to the reward of those who died on the battlefield fighting for the cause of Allah under the flagship of a Muslim Imam and ruler there's a big difference in the reward and also in the way they're treated after the death so I hope this answers your question"
