  "transcript": "foreign a question from one of the brothers I just wanted to ask um in some cases you know if our brother is doing dawa I'm sorry sorry if our if our relative or our brothers if he's doing better and you and then you and if you and you know that if you say something to him right and he's he's weak on his Iman but if I tell him that he's doing something wrong I fear that he might leave this religion and like that's the only good thing that he gets out of religion so I feel like if he leaves that then what if he just leaves Islam and that point should I just let him keep doing his beta or stop him okay this is something that you have to weigh the pros and cons of Allah mentioned in the Quran this concept of weighing the pros and cons when he said and do not now Allah is telling us do not curse the idols that they worship unlawfully what if I curse the idols that's a good thing why is Allah telling us not to do this because Allah says because if you do this they will curse Allah they will insult Allah without knowledge so due to the fact that something more evil would happen from doing your good refrain from doing this good if you see someone who's evil and Bad to the Bone and he's drunk he's got like a half a bottle of Scotch entity his eyes are red and he has a 38 revolver and he's playing with it and he's triggered happy and you go to him say he fear Allah drinking his Haram and you will be deprived from your prayer for 40 days and you will go to hell and you know that the guy is going to shoot you right straight between the eyes Point Blank would anyone in on Earth with little logic would say oh keep up the good Court you know Martin no you're stupid with all due respect so you have to weigh the pros and cons when giving downward to this relative who is committing an innovation now if his dawah is something trivial that wouldn't be a cause for leaving Islam I can't imagine someone at the spring hanging by a thread if you say to him he says the heck with them let them believe Islam Islam doesn't want him I don't know if this even exists or it's only in your mind where shaytan is messing up with you so uh the brother is doing something Haram I'm afraid if I say something to him he would leave Islam the brother is drinking with this left hand I'm afraid if I say to him the prophet prohibited this use your right hand he'll leave us no this is too much this is only in your head but if it's really something that would escalate and usually this doesn't happen in 99.99 percent that you tell someone about something about he argues with you he debates with you he escalates things and he wants to raise his voice and can you can easily stop and say okay don't harm that just thought of you know um talking with you thanks a lot and he would not leave Islam so be realistic and know how to weigh things in Allah foreign"
