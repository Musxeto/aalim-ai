  "transcript": "like what happens quite often is that um I I wake up from fragile from my alarm and then I like have a attention to just wake up like like light up five more minutes then I'm going to fall asleep and then I wake up after five years is this painful and is it and if it is simple is it like the sin of like missing us a lot purposely like that majors in okay this is something I cannot answer you because only Allah can hold you accountable for why I don't know if you were in a state of uh unconsciousness so someone who goes to bed hears the alarm clock puts it off not knowing that he's asleep and he doses until after sunrise is he sinful no of course not because it is not by choice someone who wakes up looks at the alarm clock puts it off looks at the time maybe checks his messages and says to himself let me dose for another 10 minutes there will be another 10 or 15 minutes for me to wake up and go to prayer he doesn't set his alarm clock again he doesn't take any precautions this person is sinful he knows out of experience and his previous track record that is going to fall asleep again so he is predetermined not to wake up for Fajr and hence it is a major sin how"
