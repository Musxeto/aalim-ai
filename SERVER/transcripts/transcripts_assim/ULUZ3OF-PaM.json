  "title": "Can a person offer umrah first and then hajj? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "says someone who did not perform Hajj or omah before is it mandatory for him to perform Hajj first or can he perform uh omra well if we look at the Sunnah of the Prophet wasam we would see that he performed before as he did in the uh and his Hajj was on the 10th year of hij however there is no difference of opinion that a person can go for om before Haj sometimes all what a person can do is perform omah because he doesn't have the financing for Hajj even if he saves for many years so there's no problem in going for om first however if you know that if you wait a year or two you'll be able to collect money that enables you to go for Haj then definitely that would be a wiser decision but it is not mandatory if you go for omah first and then you uh go for Hajj later on this is totally legit"
