  "transcript": "consider subscribing and jihan or jahen says saying is saying this permissible when a kafir dies or a person who used not to pray salat at all when he dies what is there are verses in the quran where allah azzawajal uh says um and we will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and lives and fruits but give good tidings to the patient who when disaster strikes them they say indeed we belong to allah and indeed to him we will return this is what they say when a disaster strikes so this is what they say then what is the conclusion allah says those are the ones upon whom are blessing from their lord and mercy and it is those who are the rightly guided so the ayah clearly states whom when disaster strikes them say therefore saying is permissible whenever a crisis strikes whether the death of a loved one or the fall of a muslim city or the defeat of a muslim army or the illness of a friend or the death of a colleague whom i was hoping that he was would become a muslim but he was a disbeliever and he died there's nothing wrong in saying in such an incident and allah azza knows best you"
