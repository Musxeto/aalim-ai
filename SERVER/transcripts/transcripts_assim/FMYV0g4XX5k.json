  "transcript": "uh sh my question is as psychologically speaking we love certain things in this Dunya such as a car because we know the cfat of those things when when it comes to longing for Jenna admiring Jenna we we are given in Islam we are shown the theat of Jenna we will have the the rivers Etc but now when I when I think when I sit down and think that okay I have to I have to stop sinning because of imagining Jenna uh I recollect that there is an attribution to I Abbas in which he said that you cannot imagine Jenna so I'm confused how to imagine Jenna can I imagine Jenna by using the world what I know of this world whatever you do your imagination would fall short because in the Hadith Allah says I've prepared for my servants in Jenna what no no eye had seen what no ear had heard of and what no heart had ever imagined so no matter what you imagine in Jenna it is a fraction of the true reality of it having said that of course one aspires to go to Jenna to be among those who dwell in the favors and blessings of Allah while acknowledging and realizing that no matter how you imagine you're falling short so no matter how much you think the beauty of your spouse in Jenna this is not even 0.00001% of the true reality of what awaits you so there's no problem in imagining it but don't go overboard with these philosophical ideas which Shan is inserting in your head because his objective is to get you out of the fold of Islam either by rejecting the whole concept of such unimaginable beauty or by doubting here or there be careful have the conviction and the Iman of the shepherds in the deserts of the farmers in their Farms of the laymen who may have never read the Quran in their lives but but they have concrete and solid conviction and Iman that they would fight the whole world if they try to prove something against it they don't have the knowledge you have but they have the fear of Allah the Hope in what Allah has and the unquestionable conviction of what Allah has told us and Allah Knows Best"
