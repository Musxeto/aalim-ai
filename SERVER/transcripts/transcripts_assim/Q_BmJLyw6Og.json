  "title": "Praying for non-Muslims to accept Islam",
  "transcript": "well if you specifically pray these two raas for this reason this is not permissible this is an innovation because the prophet did not do itat and he supplicated that Allah guides the non-muslims to Islam without doing these two ra after every prayer or after any prayer so these two raas would become because of this particular reason would become an innovation and you ask Allah to guide ma Mankind and if Allah wished it he would have guided them all to Islam so the prophet did not ask Allah to guide all of humanity and all of non-muslims he supplicated and he asked Allah to guide certain people like in the case when DOI came to him and he tried to call his people to Islam they would not comply and listen to him so he came to the prophet and he asked the prophet to uh ask Allah to bestow his wrath on them and the prophet asked Allah to guide them to Islam and they all came Muslims so the prophet did not guide the whole Humanity did not ask the whole Humanity to uh did not ask Allah to guide the whole of humanity to Islam though he wanted this and he he tried his best to do so so I believe that asking Allah to guide all non-muslims to become Muslim it it would be uh um exaggeration and it would be extravagance in Dua and Allah forbade us from this and the prophet forbade us from asking Allah something like that it is like a person asking Allah that he grants him the beauty of Yousef the wisdom of of uh uh of David the power of suon the long life of of Noah and the Perfection of the prophet and he said Allah is capable of doing this yes but you are exaggerating and you are extravagant in your Dua it is like abdah pleas with him the companion when he heard his son supplicating and he said oh Allah I ask you to grant me the White Palace in Paradise to the right hand side of the people entering Paradise so he's assuming that the minute you enter Paradise on your right there would be a a white Palace and he wants this first White Palace so he the refuses and told him my son ask Allah for paradise and seek refuging Him from Hellfire because I've heard the prophet Alam that there would come people from his followers who would be extravagant in their Dua and in performing W and what you're doing is one of this and Allah knows best no this is not true this is is a known way in Arabic of glorifying a person so an individual could refer to himself as we and it is like a king or the Queen of England when she writes a decree says that we the Queen of England have uh ruled that so and so be so and so or that this person becomes a sir or to be uned or whatever so she refers to herself as we in the sense that she is glorifying herself and Allah of course without no doubt is the one who is to be glorified and this is why Allah glorifies himself by saying we uh to himself and Allah Knows Best"
