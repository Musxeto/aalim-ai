  "transcript": "he says what are the rights of the wife and children over the man allah azza wajal has ordered us to treat our families and our spouses especially with care and conviction Vilma roof and made us guardian over the females whether spouses or sisters or daughters due to what we spend over them plus due to the status that Allah has given us over them therefore as the prophet alayhi salat wa salam when asked about the rights of a woman over one of us the Prophet said to feed her from what you eat and to clothe her and to give her shelter and not to beat her nor beat her face no say ugly things about her face so these are parts of the rights of women on men and these rights also cascade down to your children whether you married or not meaning you divorced or still married it is your obligation to support your your children to feed them to clothe them to shelter them to provide proper education medical care all of these things are the responsibilities of men financially other than that it is the men who are supposed to up bring their children in the right and correct Islamic fashion it is your responsibility as a husband to take care of your wife and to prevent her from falling into the traps of Shaytan ooh and foucha come o aleikum Nora prevent yourself and your families including your spouse's Hellfire the prophet Elijah orders us twice in the Quran and there are many many other things and Allah knows"
