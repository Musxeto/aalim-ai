  "title": "Ruling on Muslim women being treated by a male doctor | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "thirdly what's the ruling on a Muslim woman being treated by a male doctor first of all Islam is a dynamic religion it is not stagnant so there isn't anything as such no die that would be better for you if you're starving and you're about to die and there's nothing else to eat except pork or you will die Aslam tells you it's mandatory upon you to eat it so when someone is sick and needs consultation from a physician this is a necessity it's not something that is luxurious or one is doing it for the fun of it so this is a necessity and whenever there is a necessity things that were prohibited can become permissible in that incident therefore scholars say first of all choice number one a Muslim woman must only be treated by a Muslim doctor if there is no way we can get to a Muslim doctor then a non-muslim let me rephrase that first of all a woman must be treated by a female Muslim doctor if there is not a single Muslim female doctor then a non-muslim female doctor if there are no females at all in this type of specialty of Medicine then she can go to a Muslim male doctor and if there is no Muslim male doctor then the last choice would be to go to a non-muslim doctor but in the case of the doctor being male there has to be with this Muslim patient her muharram attending with her for safe keeping and protection and a large visual knows best"
