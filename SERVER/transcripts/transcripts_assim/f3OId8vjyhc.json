  "title": "Blaming everything on black magic, evil eye or Jinn possession - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "first of all let it be known through my programs lectures and answers I always say that is part of the RP the Vidal journal JAMA which we all abide by we believe in the existence of black magic we believe in the existence of jinn possession we believe in the existence of envy and on evil eye all of this was mentioned in the Quran and in the authentication of the Prophet as a son we have to put the ground rules before we answer this question so we all agree that this is true and a reality however I have problems with people who try to justify their failures in life with such things and I've repeated this so many times someone who has a nagging wife he says that she is possessed with jinn his son fails in exams he said this is evil I his boss does not promote him or deprives him from the race he says this is black magic his car does this or its envy people are envious of me and this is not that the case and hence people should not blame everything that happens in their lives to these things"
