  "transcript": "so we have allah from canada i have a question about a hadith the hadith is narrated islam began as something strange and will go back to being strange so give glad tidings to the strangers sheik i don't understand this hadith could you please briefly explain the meaning of this place allah from canada he says the hadith of the prophet islam that islam started strange and it will return to be strange so tulda for the strangers and they said who are the strangers or prophet of allah he said those who abide by what i and my companions are on today strangers this is a description if i go to a different country i'm a stranger if i dress like my countrymen do in these countries i'm a stranger when i go to a kafir country and i don't indulge in their celebrations i'm a stranger so it is a description that fits an individual according to his conviction according to his ethnicity according to his race and nationality etc what the prophet alaihistalatus is telling us about he's telling us about a state where a person is estranged due to his beliefs not due to his skin tone or the colors of his eyes not because of his language not because of his passport rather because of his conviction of his religion so when islam started in the beginning it was strange everybody indulges in everything haram you can think of the whole nine yards they worship idols they make idols and worship them of dates and once they're hungry they eat them they commit incest they commit fornication and adultery they consume intoxicants they rob people from their wealth they invade other tribes killing is like drinking soda to them so when the prophet was sent to them he came to transform the whole community not only that he came to transform the whole world not only that he came to transform the jinn as long as as well as the humans and everything he brought to that world to our world is perfect regardless of what the enemies of islam say regardless of the haters of islam or the haters of niqab or the haters of muslim modesty a woman in a thong and a bikini is okay to roam whatever she wants to to be on billboards but a woman to wear a niqab that's a taboo so the prophet brought this beautiful religion alaihisalam the community did not accept it he was a man on his own when it first came started with the belief of his wife khadija and his cousin ali and his best friend abu bakr and then it spread until it became what we see today almost 2 billion muslims on earth believing and embracing the same religion so it started strange and it will return to be strange so when we see that we have 2 billion muslims whoa great news no it's not that great we have quantity islam focuses on quality and this is what we want so tulba and this is the name of a big tree that a traveler requires like 70 or 100 years or more to travel under its shade to cross it in jannah so this tree is for you who is a member of the strangers and who are they who abide by what the prophet of islam and his companions are on those days so the prophet is telling us that the quality is important and for us to be strangers we have to abide by the quran a muslim is a stranger among the different cults and religions in the world thousands of different religions i'm a stranger and the muslim is a stranger among his own people among the muslims because they are divided into 72 sects you have the super sufis you have a murtazila you have a germany you have al-murjiya you have the liberals you have the hypocrites you have the whole charade so i feel stranger with them and even i'm a stranger with them because i abide by the sunnah they abide by their schools of thought they will go to jannah inshallah they are all right but they're not upon the way of the prophet isalam exactly and the people different than the people differ in their acceptance and submission to the sunnah of the prophet so you feel how strange you are among the people a practicing muslim is a stranger in his own house when his spouse is not practicing when a sister is practicing her husband is not practicing the children are calling him to do sins to take them out to places that are haram to do things and compromises religion all of these are part of being a stranger and i hope this conveys some of the message i do have a lecture on my youtube channel about this hadith so inshallah maybe you get more information from"
