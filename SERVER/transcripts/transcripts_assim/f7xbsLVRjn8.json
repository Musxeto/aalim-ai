  "title": "If my uncle & mother are free mixing in a room alone, do I have to sit there too?",
  "transcript": "Mariam from Canada Assalamu Alaikum Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi If my uncle comes over to my house and my mother and him they like remix I just and they're in the living room and I sit upstairs in my room but they're like all alone but I can still like hear them like their conversations so like what should I do in that situation? Now I'm assuming that this is your mother's house is it correct? Mariam Okay maybe you've lost Mariam So it's your mom's house you have no control on who comes in and who does not and therefore you have one of two choices either to go to your room and let them be to their seclusion to say and do whatever they want or to be with them to break the seclusion and to minimize the sin and the haram and I would highly recommend the latter because this would prevent your mom from falling into sin without knowing or with knowing and Allah knows best"
