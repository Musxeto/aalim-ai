  "transcript": "Yunus from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So Sheikh, when I started learning more and more about Islam I got So I cared more about Sharia and the like, yet at the beginning I did like some people call it fatwa shopping. I just said okay music is okay and I was feeling really bad for a long time so I didn't I felt really bad until one time I made the decision okay I quit and then afterwards I found much sakinah, much kursuha, I was a very happy person okay and this went on for a while until one incident what happened was dad told me to go with him to the bank okay at that time I didn't have that much knowledge okay and he had a bag and then he told me to carry it I was thinking this is a major sin there may be contracts of riba and the like in there okay so yet so I didn't want to carry it yet I still did because the day before so he beat me with a stick and I feared him yet still I was thinking I think I was thinking this was a major sin okay I carried it and we were there when we were there he told me to carry it again I refused okay and then he beat me up with a stick pretty hard okay and since that incident I so so he beat me up okay and then he cut off my internet connection he made it very hard for me to learn about Islam okay so and then I got many confusions is this okay Yunus, Yunus, Yunus come on Akhi what is your question? five seconds more no what is the relation between music and going to the bank and beating you with a stick what's the question Akhi? five seconds more please okay I'm timing you so I cut off my internet connection and then when I doubted things to be haram most of the time I didn't do it and I did many strange things and since the time he beat me up I around the time I didn't find khushuwa and I can't concentrate in prayer so what's your question? can you give me advice? over contracts of riba or music or being beaten up by your father I don't know what happened what do you want me to advise you about? which topic? the time he beat me up and he cut off the internet connection since that time it was like 1.5 years ago I didn't know most of the time I didn't have khushuwa or concentration in prayer okay first of all Akhi when you ask a question I would highly appreciate that you go straight to the point if I need any details I'm going to ask you about it as you have seen we've wasted so much time you could have easily said that in 5 seconds Sheikh I fail to find khushuwa in prayer what can I do? and I would answer you without any reason to mention what you have mentioned secondly the khushuwa comes from your knowledge of Allah azza wa jal it comes from the amount of time you spend reading the Quran and understanding the tafseer it comes from studying books of aqeedah beautiful names of Allah Allah's lordship and worship tawheed and in studying the biography of the Prophet Sira a.s and you don't need internet connection for all of this you can do it through hard copy you can do it through reading the Quran and the tafseer books available in your home thirdly you have to communicate with your father you live in Germany if the German authorities know about your father they're going to put him in jail I'm not telling you to threaten him by this but tell him that be a little bit more communicative let's talk if you see that I'm doing something wrong advise me not by beating me up fourthly you have to learn your religion jumping to conclusion and thinking that I can't carry the bag if my father says charge my phone I said no I can't charge his phone because he watches inappropriate images so I will be collaborating so I will not do this if he says bring me a glass of water if I bring him a glass of water this means that he will remain alive and he will go tonight to my cousin's house or my in-law's house and he will free mix with my cousins who are non-mahram to him what kind of ideology and thinking is this? when you come to take a decision and make a choice based on total ignorance and not weighing the pros and the cons so this is a fault from your side you deserve what you are getting because this is what you brought to yourself instead of asking whether this is permissible or not whether learning your religion or not and Allah knows best"
