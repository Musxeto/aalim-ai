  "transcript": "Salaam alaikum assalaam alaikum our exam tomorrow yeah yeah my question is is it ideal to follow the mentality of the sahabas and they elevate or the actions can you elaborate a little bit what I mean is like is it a more ideal to look at the intentions or what this hub as well when they were around at the Prophet peace be upon him how they reacted to the attacks on the Prophet peace be upon him and I lost 100 dolla or is it more appropriate to follow the actions and then what they done physically around the Prophet peace be upon him okay anything else no this was something in my heart for a for a while I just want to know your view on it no thank you unanswered s inshallah up to me the ideal thing would be is to follow not their mental way of thinking and not their actions but to follow what they were instructed to follow that is the Sunnah of the Prophet area salatu salam what is the point in me following the companions may allah be pleased with them when they themselves might have differed in few minor things so we know that even omar may allah be pleased with him had the school of his own anybody Bass had the school of his own and if I decide to follow any one of them this would be a bit premature because I have the source which is the Quran and the Sunnah so why would I follow the opinions of the Companions oh I respect them all and I appreciate all of them and I think that they are the best and the elite of Allah's creation why would I follow them and not follow the prophets teachings salala haryana salam this would be the ideal thing now if there's any if there's not a clear cut instruction from the Prophet era so Scylla in this case I would go down a level and look into the Companions ideas their companions actions so that I could choose what coincides with the whore edition and follow that but other than that no we have the source which is the Quran and the Sunnah and this is what Alonzo Gee instructed us to follow and allah knows best"
