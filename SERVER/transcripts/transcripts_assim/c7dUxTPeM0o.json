  "transcript": "Samira from Sudan. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Walaikumussalam. Sheikh, yesterday when I woke up I found myself in an embarrassing position where I could have masturbated while I'm asleep and on that day I kept a homemade cursive on my private part before I slept. So I went to check if there is anything on the cursive that could indicate that I secreted money and I found nothing. But Sheikh, some descriptions of the money of women said that it could be white and thin and the cursive is white. So I thought it could have dried up now and I just can't see it. Should I take ghusl and repeat my prayers? First of all, there is nothing as masturbation while being asleep. Because when a person is asleep, the pen of accountability is uplifted. So whatever he does in his sleep, he's not sinful for that. Secondly, the Prophet ﷺ said, إنما الماء من الماء, which means that obligation of taking a ghusl only materialises when an individual sees semen being gushed or ejaculated. So if there is no nocturnal emission when you wake up, there is nothing. There is no discharge. Then there is no ghusl mandated upon you. Thirdly, women's semen is not white, it is yellow and thin as described by the Prophet ﷺ. And this means that there is no obligation of ghusl upon you. Finally, whenever there is doubt, we go and refer to the default. I'm doubtful, is this mug pure or najis? The default, it is pure until proven otherwise. You are pure because when you went to bed, you were pure. You did not have any ritual, major ritual impurity. When you woke up, you still are in the default state of purity. Until proven otherwise, until we have a proof that shows us that you are in the state of major ritual impurity, and this does not exist, and Allah knows best."
