  "transcript": "today's topic is about something that usually turns eyes and heads whenever it is discussed in the islamic sharia so whenever we mention the topic that deals with prescribed punishment known as usually this causes controversy to the non-muslims the muslims have no problem at all with it and this is part of their religion this is part of their conviction it is not a choice that they may adopt or leave they have to take it adopt it embrace it and believe in it unfortunately the westerners the disbelievers the non-muslims the hypocrites always find a room to attack islam from this view and unfortunately a lot of us muslims are negligent of our religion a lot of the so-called muslims living in the west mixing with the christians and the jews and maybe even loving them and having close relationship with due to the proximity due to living among them being part of them carrying their nationality giving preference to the country that takes them in over islam unfortunately some of such muslims may consider it to be controversial may it to be barbaric and this is a clear sign of hypocrisy now when we come to the reason of these prescribed punishments we find that the westerners the disbelievers fear sharia and they intimidate people from it when they say that if shariah is implemented in your country you will lose your limbs and you will be flawed day and night and may be executed and of course this is so ridiculous but when people are not in their full ability to comprehend they're not saying and they listen to such rubbish you i don't know how to you can find a cure to every disease and to every illness but when someone is thick in his mind and can be fooled in such an easy way there's no cure for that stupidity has no cure so when someone intimidates them by saying that you will lose your limbs and you will be executed and you'll be flogged and you'll be stoned to death and they believe it then they're either blind or stupid look at the muslim world how many do we have 1.8 maybe 2 billion humans living on earth today who are muslims whom among them do you see walking with no limbs or decapitated or flogged or stoned no one so where did this come from the westerners believe because that they have crimes round the clock and maybe this is an understatement they have rape consumption of intoxicants theft round the second they used to count it how many crimes per hour how many crimes per minute now how many crimes per second and they are afraid that this would be implemented and everyone by default who is a criminal will be treated in the islamic prescribed punishment and this is not true islam is a system and it's a divine system it's not man-made and it's been here for for the past 15 centuries and that it's its track record has proven that it is a divine system when islam comes it does not implement sharia on the spot it first of all eliminates the cause for sins and crimes so if there is poverty it eliminates poverty so there will be no theft even when there is theft and there is famine so the people have a choice between either dying or stealing if they were to steal the prescribed punishment is halted due to the necessity to eat or die when islam comes it eliminates the causes and the reasons for adultery and fornication so it simply tells women to abide by the hijab tells women tells men to cover their aura prohibits free mixing implements segregation orders women not to flirt with men not to wear perfumes that would lure men and so many things that if islam introduces so that the community itself would be safe from such sins and crimes and secondly these prescribed punishments are in accordance to the crime itself so islam does not kill a mesquito with a cannon that's an overkill you're going to destroy the whole house just because of a mosquito no it punishes according to the crime itself and it is most likely more to intimidate criminals from falling into crime than to actually implement it meaning that islam is not bloodthirsty what do you mean it's not bloodthirsty it chops the hands of a thief it flogs a person who consumes intoxicants it stones a person who commits adultery what more bloodfest do you want if islam is as you have described look at the 2 billion muslims around you and tell me do you see anyone flogged stoned or decapitated or without any limbs no why is that because islam makes it extremely difficult to be indicted for such a crime so when you come to the conditions of adultery stoning to death and we will come to talk about this inshallah later on maybe today maybe not depending on the introduction to this important topic when you come to adultery do you think any random person can come and say ah sheikh asam committed zina he committed adultery and i have the photographs to prove it i saw him with a bombshell actress or an entertainer and they were having a good time islam says wait wait wait wait you're accusing someone said yes okay let's go back to the policy and procedure policy and procedure of the prescribed punishment in order for the crime of adultery or fornication to be proven we need one either one of the following one a confession do you confess how would i fall in such a sin okay there's no confession two we need four witnesses you the accuser can you provide us with four witnesses um no i i was the only one who saw this take him and flog him 80 lashes he's a slanderer what but the sheikh did this and that bring four witnesses okay i can bring four witnesses there are conditions in the witnesses my friend who are you witnesses well two of them are my my my a sister and a wife and another friend who's a christian teacher that works with us in the college doesn't work they have to be for male adult sane muslims trustworthy come on then you don't want me to prove this crime on him probably because islam encourages people to conceal their sins and you want to slander him you want to expose sins all over the community so again you see it's not for any tom dicker harry just to walk in and says and say that i saw someone commit fornication let's go and flog him or stone him or do whatever we want it is something that is fixed likewise if someone steals there is a threshold for what he steals it has to be concealed and hidden he has to do this in secrecy if he does it in public this is not stealing that we can amputate his hand if it is not in a safe or in a box that's locked in if it's in the middle of the road and i pickpocket somewhere or if i go to a store and pick an apple in broad daylight this is not stealing so don't think that islam is man-made islam is something that is a divine system it's from allah and you guys that is the non-muslims the disbelievers or the hypocrites who feel ashamed of their religion and try to justify these things you guys think in a twisted fashion and manner islam does not promote punishment for the love of punishment islam is not a blood loving religion and to tell you that it is a system if you listen to the preaching of preachers students of knowledge scholars 27 24 hours seven days a week what is it about it is about preaching advising warning people to stay away from sin because sin takes you hell sin destroys your dunya sins would reduce your provision sins would cause you to fall into some of the prescribed punishments in this life so we always give them preaching we always give them a reminders and it's not a religion of a sword and a whip it's not the way they think it is the beauty of this divine system that it does not differentiate between a ruler and a commoner so all under the flag of islam are equal so if a person steals whether he is rich or poor whether he is from the dignitary of the people or from their peasants the punishment is the same and this is rarely found in other countries if not other religions and finally among the best benefit of these prescribed punishment excuse me benefits amputating people's hands flogging them stoning them and you say that there are benefits from this indeed there are great benefits in addition to what i have mentioned the benefit number one is that the whole community is safe from such deterrence because prescribed punishments are deterrents when i know that if i go and i force myself to a woman who doesn't want to have any relations with me such crime is punishable either by flogging or by stoning to death when i know that this is what will await me i will be deterred and i will stop now you westerners and disbelievers go to the fbi official website the federal bureau of investigation in the united states of america and check the rate of rape in america alone you will find that there is an incident every few seconds and you accuse islam and the muslims of being barbaric excuse me this is ridiculous look at the rate of murder mass murder a gunman in las vegas takes a group of machine guns and shoots tens of people randomly in a concert why is he doing this why not then what are you going to do about it put him in jail for 20 years or maybe life doing what eating drinking having a couple of hours work out in the sun the weather is nice in california maybe i don't know about las vegas what about those tens and hundreds of people who died and their families tough luck this is the system this is the man-made system islam benefits us that my woman can walk in the street wearing her hijab and not a single person can come and speak to her or abuse her because we have a system i could go and leave my shop unattended and pray and come back and the shop as it is nobody dared to go in though there are poor people because there is a divine system islam looks and caters for the rights of the majority by depriving the individual from what he sees as his privacy and freedom to do whatever he wants we don't have what is known as freedom of speech which gives you the right to slander people and we've seen in the past few years how many women came forward accusing innocent men of rape they toppled them from their positions high positions discredited them disgraced them and after three four years in court they were announced innocent okay then what kissing makeup you've ruined my life without any proof and then that's it islam doesn't allow this at all and in addition to all of these mentioned benefits islam gives you something no other religion can we have consequences for what we do in this life and in the hereafter so ed love hitler they say killed a lot and we will not go into them exaggerated numbers but let's assume he killed a hundred did anybody punish him for these hundred in this life nope then what will happen he'll go unpunished of course not on the day of judgment he will have to pay for all the crimes he had committed against humanity he has to pay for all the rights he deprived people from and he will pay this is what a muslim believe we believe that if you escape this life's punishment you won't escape the hereafters and therefore it is always in the back of my head the punishment that awaits me on the day of judgment for the crimes i've committed allah is so merciful if i were caught red-handed or four witnesses or two witnesses and some crimes came and testified that i committed a crime or if i were to confess the prescribed punishment that is implemented upon me in this life erases my sins so that on the day of judgment i'm absolved i don't have to pay for the crime that i had committed in this life because allah is more generous subhanahu ta'ala to the extent that he would not punish a person twice for the same crime so this prescribed punishment has a number of benefits but those who do not have knowledge those who are ashamed of their religion may describe it most likely unintentionally without paying attention to what they say and they call it controversial yet if you were to fall into such wrong description as a muslim you have to have the guts have the balls to stand up and say i seek allah's forgiveness i did a mistake and it's not controversial and it's not an issue of dispute among muslim scholars it's an issue of dispute among those who are not scholars like marta like they see that stoning is not part of islam but who said that they themselves are representative or considered to be part of it they are part of the 72 sects and no one disputes about that so don't be among them and learn your religion refer in whatever you learn to great scholars of islam have the courage to announce your scholars of islam so that we know where you're coming from and who your references are at the end of the day you're not rambo so the arabic term had and the plural is [Music] a partition so if you have two things and there's a line between them this is had if we have two countries and we have borders between them we call it in arabic so allah's commands is a you cannot transgress you cannot go beyond and this is why ahead is a punishment stated in islamic law for encroaching on the limits said by allah and these are as stated earlier set as a deterrent in arab in the arab world and this is islamic culture as well we're ordered to hang the whip or the stick that we use to reprimand children with we're told to hang it in the living room why is that so that when the children see it they remember always that if you do something wrong you'll be whipped for it you'll be beaten up with it because of your crime because of your mistake so this is a reminder many people if not all of them rarely use it but it is a deterrent and this is what the prescribed punishments are um this they help to spread security and reassurance in the community they serve to absolve the guilty of the guilt because the prophet said that in an authentic hadith whoever commits any of these offenses and is punished for them meaning in this life such punishment absolves him meaning that allah would not hold him accountable on the day of judgment so let's get on to it not get it on but get on to it to the first of the sins that require prescribed punishment the sin of zina and in english i think linguistically they differentiate between fornication and adultery so if my understanding is correct and i don't know i haven't looked it up in the dictionary yet but is fornication a person commits the sin of zina when he was not married and adultery is when a married person commits this offense and it refers to sexual intercourse between men and women when there is no legitimate marital relationship real or imagined between them what are the proofs that this is haram allah says in the quran do not come near adultery it is indeed an abomination and an evil way and look at the beautiful description of the quran do not come near adultery and allah did not say [Music] allah did not say do not fornicate because then everything else would be okay he said do not come near fornication or adultery what do you mean by do not come near it means that any means that would take you there it is prohibited so sheikh do you mean that chit chatting with my friend with my colleague of the opposite gender whether in school college or work is haram i said yep it's haram why shaykh it's just chit-chatting messaging and what's happening what's wrong in that is there a possibility that this may lead to fornication if i'm lucky then it's hard sending your gaze and looking left right and center at the beauty of the opposite gender which you know that turns you on and makes you lust after it would it maybe not now later on lead to zina fornication and adultery sure watching pornography listening to music love songs watching movies going to nightclubs strip clubs going to bars consuming intoxicants having dinner with the opposite gender on a date casual talking at the park all of this falls under do not come near fornication islam did not say do not fornicate this is the end product and this is why islam protects the community it protects the individuals for their own sake you have a natural urge and desire get married i can't get married fast i don't want to fast well what do you want me to do you want to go to hell be my guest but islam protects the whole community so uh where are we okay and the prophet says allah in answer to abdullah when he said to him o prophet of allah tell me about the most major sin so he told him that to associate someone else with allah and he's the one who provides for you then to kill a an innocent soul and thirdly he said to commit adultery with your neighbor's wife this is one of the major sins not just because she is your neighbor's wife but because also it's adultery so it is a combination of two major sins now the nature of this sin is that it impacts the whole community one would say if if i were a teenager or in my early teens i would say whoa it's time to get lucky wow it's fun you do this you do that you have free sex you do whatever you want what's wrong in that we young we're half blooded this is what you think as an individual but if you look at the community around you you think differently if you look at your own system what's wrong in people banging your sister as they say what's wrong in going out with your sister dating your sister maybe dating your mom your father is busy at work she's a human being she needs attention and care so if someone comes and takes her to a movie you're okay with that or are you crazy she's my mom of course not i wouldn't allow my sister to do this subhanallah so is this the alpha male speaking for you haram for your sister you're not thinking with your head you're thinking with something else and this is why you're unable to see this is what happens when we do counseling people come with fixed ideas and beliefs and they're determined to divorce they're determined to run away they're determined to do this or that to cut someone out of their life in five minutes time you show them the other options it's like fog was removed from their eyes and now they can see this teenager this youngster who thinks that life is all about sex partying booze having a good time when you speak to him in such a logical rational way he says whoa i didn't see that coming so islam protects the community it protects people's lineages so we know whose child this is but let us look at the people living abroad the disbelievers you have a famous celebrity living with his girlfriend for the past 10 years having eight children we can't verify whose children these are because they're not married so they're either born out of wedlock or the mother simply had another affair because her boyfriend always has different affairs and then we have children and we don't know whether they belong or not you have people refusing to get married i 20 years ago used to go and work out in the gym and there was this american engineer or he's a simulator instructor who used to work with me in the gym it's a big gym and i used to try to give him dawah indirectly i only knew his first name rick but i don't know his last name i don't know where he lives we're not buddies but i always try to give him tawa indirectly so once he opened this topic and he said that islam is a little bit barbaric for me and this and that the prescribed punishment and so on so i told him listen rick do you have a sister he says yes so do you love your sister he said of course i do so i said what happens if somebody brutally raped your sister scarred her face beaten up her really bad and the police caught this man tried him your sister pointed him out to you that he's the one there's no ambiguity in his identity and the court acquitted him because there were no sufficient evidences and as the man was walking out of the court he saw you and winked meaning i did it and you cannot do anything about it and you were in your jeep cherokee with your shotgun next to you on the rack what would you do he said i'll blow his mind his head off and i said subhanallah isn't this barbaric we will do that for you islam does this for you islam saves you from such a crime the guy started thinking said yeah i'm yeah baby i guess this is fair islam does this for you if someone kills my father traditionally killing 100 individuals of the murderer's tribe would be sufficient 100 for my father i would never settle down except if i killed the most valuable and influential person in their tribe though that person did not order or had anything to do with my father's murder but just to revenge to avenge islam saves you all the trouble tells you no we can't be living in a jungle everyone takes his shotgun and starts shooting people and justifies this by saying that they did it or one of their tribe or their cousin killed my father or their relative or all of this is nonsense it's the same thing that some super countries superpowers does a group of terrorists make a terrorist attack on their soil killing three thousand or four thousand what do you do i destroy a whole country who had nothing to do with it killing more than a million people destroying the infrastructure destroying the livelihood of the people for the next 20 years and then saying oops i did it again i'm sorry there are no masked weapons of mass destruct destruction wrong info wrong intel islam doesn't allow this an eye for an eye but not a whole country for a handful of people over an impulsive decision which is based on circumstantial evidences what is this so islam protects the community what we see in the west people not having marriages especially among the youngsters the same individual this american rick he was in his late 30s maybe early 40s and i asked him listen are you married i said no no no no no i said why are you saying no like that he said i'm not married said why he said i'm still looking for the right woman and i said subhanallah if i take a peek at your black book where you have all your dates registered in would it be fair to say that you have more than 100 he smiled he said maybe subhanallah you are spoiling more than a hundred women for your sick desires claiming that you're looking for the right one you will never ever find the right one ever because you're not looking you're just searching for a good time that's it no strings attached no commitment and islam definitely fights this and does not approve of it and no way you can convince me that a solid society would flourish all what you see in the disbelieving countries is a clear sign that they will collapse and fall soon because they went against their religion false are good they went against it and they are going against their human nature so islam is focusing on safekeeping the community securing the lineages we know who's the father of who and who's the son of who so that there would be no ambiguity not what so ever i think we will stop here and i apologize for taking so much time on such an introduction but i believe that as muslims as students of knowledge as dies we have to have this altera artillery artillery we have to have the weaponry we have to have the strategy in order to stand in the face of any attack and as muslims as practicing muslims we're bound to be attacked with such doubts and criticism and people pointing their fingers saying you this religion of yours is this is that i will not accept it i will not uh ever consider this barbaric religion and and we are touched by that by saying that our religion is a little bit uh stiff uh maybe it's this maybe it's that if we ourselves are unable to defend our religion not to keep on defending you have to turn the tables why would i always be on the defensive side the best way to defend is to attack so people say you guys marry for women and your women can't matter except one you guys don't give women their rights you take a full share and your sister takes half a share what is this what and they start accusing your religion and you're taking this in and trying to say no no no you misunderstood see our religion is this our religion yeah i and then you fall short of explanations and you say uh i see where you're coming yeah i this is a little bit barbaric yeah it might be a little bit harsh but what are you doing you are going so down to their level because you don't have enough pride in your religion if you're proud of your religion of your conviction it doesn't matter whether oxford or cambridge tells you this or that the hell with them all this is my quran this is my sunnah i have full conviction you don't want to believe who cares but to concave to cave in to go deep inside of yourself and shrink because of what they say this is not the right way of doing it anyhow muhammad wasaf says my question is that if there is no difference between the prayer of men and women then why at the time of mistake during prayer men should have to say subhanallah and women should have to clap their hands i'm confused regarding this now this type of question illustrates the amount of knowledge people may confuse themselves of having so now our brother muhammad says you always say that there is no difference between the prayer of a man and a woman i did say i said this ah now you're trying to retract your comments no no i'm not i'm just asking did i say this yeah you said that okay then what i said was true when i study the quran and the sunnah and i hear the prophet saying [Music] pray as if you see me pray i ask women sister how do you pray she says as described in the prophet's prayer and i say why do you do this she says because the prophet said so done those who say a woman should conceal herself in prayer and not part their their arms were in prostration i say where did you get this from is it from the prophet isam they said no said okay who should i follow you or the prophet he said no of course the prophet but why do you but if there was a difference between the prayer of a woman and a man the prophet would have showed this to us not only this when brother muhammad says i'm confused why is it when the imam makes a mistake the men say subhanallah and the women clap there is a difference in their prayer go a little bit above women must wear the hijab if they don't wear the hijab their prayer is invalid so there is a difference in prayer but it is like someone coming to me and say and saying why don't you allow others to prostrate to others or to prostrate to buddha statute or to prostrate to their elders like in some countries of africa why is it wrong ordered the angels to prostrate to adam i'm confused you in your mind can't you hear what you're saying what's wrong with your intellect what's wrong with your brain give the matter some thought before you open your mouth who prohibited us from prostrating to other than allah allah who ordered the angels to prostrate to adam allah so excuse me it's allah azza who told us to do this it's as if you're saying no with all due respect allah has only the power to order us to do something he cannot go against this thing who are you to say such a thing who orders us to remove the underarm hair and the pubic hair allah who prohibited us from moving the beard and the eyebrows allah so now you're telling me that i'm confused no you're not confused you're not thinking properly you follow what allah tells you to do you follow the sunnah of the prophet so when the prophet tells you to pray like he has prayed you do so and when he during the salah a man makes mistakes and speaks and the companions wants him to shut up so they start to clap and the prophet says at the end of the salat what you have done is wrong if there is anything you want to bring the attention of others too in the salah you say subhanallah as for women they clap they don't say subhanallah where is the confusion just because the prophet differentiates between women not speaking and clapping during salat makes us ignore his instruction pray as you have seen me pray this is not logical so there is no confusion in this women must pray as men but in the things that we are told not for them to do they have to refrain because the one who told them not to do it was the prophet alaihis and i hope this makes some sense to you afiya says if someone wears hijab for everyone but they won't wear it for certain people can we select dresses or jewelry for them to wear so what taffy is saying is that i have a sister that abides by the hijab totally when she goes out when she's at college etc shopping but when my cousins come home she doesn't abide by the hijab because she thinks of them as their brothers as her brothers so she does not abide by the hijab which is totally haram and sinful so if this happens can i help her select dresses and jewelry if you know that she is going to wear these dresses and jewelry in front of none definitely the answer is no allah says in the beginning on virtue and righteousness and do not collaborate on sin and transgression so you should not help her and allah's best ramissa says there is a trend in facebook named 10 days hadith challenge where one person posts 10 hadiths in 10 days and nominates 10 other people to do the same it goes on in this way is it permissible i asked you before and you said it's an innovation i wrote about it on facebook but people are really confused about it and the challenge has been spread widely in our country can we can you please explain should one follow the trend or not again this is an innovation it's called a challenge so it is not something that helps spread islam it is not a competition that promotes memorizing the hadith it's just a person randomly over the period of 10 days publishes or posts a hadith and then he nominates 10 other people to do the same challenge so now on the 10th day another 10 people would post 100 hadith and then another 10 000 people because this is trending on facebook so first of all is facebook a source of knowledge nowadays every time dick and harry post whatever they want on facebook on twitter on instagram on snapchat on twitter or on whatsapp as well and you get people coming to you with nonsense pure utter nonsense saying that this is sunnah and this is buddha and you don't know who they are referring to where did they get it from who are their scholars anonymous who is this person putting this post i have no idea he could be a kadyani he could be a baha'i anyone who wants to cast doubts in islam or fabricates things in islam so it's not a source of knowledge first of all second of all what is your intention in posting these 10 hadiths uh to win a challenge then this is not sincerity thirdly has it ever been done by the salaf then it's an innovation fourthly do you think that people are reading your hadith when you post them do you yourself if i ask you now what are the hadiths you posted and explained and explained them to me would you be able to do that um i'm not a scholar then what are you doing it's a challenge this is what we're doing nominating people and they're them complying with the challenge is it for the sake of allah or just for the sake of people would not point a finger at them and say oh look look at them they could not even post 10 hadith over the duration of 10 days so this is not how things work and a muslim does not go with the flow it's not the trend that mandates me to do something or to refrain from something it is the quran and sunnah and following the way of the three favorite generations and allah azza knows best afiya says if a government of certain state prohibits from slaughtering on idol upheld due to pandemic as they think it will cause people to gather in a large number probably are we obliged to follow the government rules i'm not going to talk about politics because politics is so filthy and dirty and politicians are almost the same because you could defy the order of the government though the order of the government is nonsense it's illogical people are gathering in large numbers in different places why when it comes to islam you try to limit that we could justify this but governments being corrupt filthy usually have a hidden agenda so they lure you they provoke you to do something which is already scripted with a scenario so that once you fall into the slot they want you to fall into they bring the building down in india the moment the coronavirus the covered 19 spread they accused the tabliri jamaa because they had a meeting of 8 000 people and they caused the outbreak of this pandemic blah blah blah and three four weeks after lynching and killing of muslims innocent people it was discovered that all was all these reports were lies so you understand where these people are coming from if you defy the government's orders and you go and offer your qurbani or they would find a way to strike islam and the muslims because of your impulsive decision you don't have to do that if it's illegal follow the law send your money to neighboring pakistans and then money to yemen to syria to any trustworthy organization islamic organization where they will slaughter and give the meat to the needy refugees alhamdulillah two birds hit with one stone can i call name of someone inside the toilet if his name is one of allah's names of course not if you're answering the call of nature and you are in the toilet you can't say abdullah bring the book with you when you come back because you've mentioned the name of allah and allah's name must be respected and not used in such places also haslin says is it permissible to keep an aquarium or pets in a room where husband and wife have intimacy there's nothing wrong in that providing these pets and animals won't talk but if they are able to talk and convey what they had seen this is not permissible um [Music] magazine whatever can you please explain why do our ruler say if you die of covet 19 you are a martyr but it was i was under the understanding that a martyr does not get to be bathed washed that is and uh but only to be buried is this correct sheikh well you have a confusion between the types of martyrdom the highest type of martyrdom is the one who dies in the battlefield fighting against the disbelievers with the intention to make allah's word the highest and the greatest so he's doing this for the cause of allah this type of martyr is not washed and is not shrouded except in his own clothes and we do not offer funeral prayer upon him we just bury him however there are other types who are highly rewarded and the prophets of allah describe them as martyrs but they do not or did not die on the battlefield and these are the people a person who dies in a fire or under a collapsed building or who drowned or a woman who died while giving birth someone who dies with tripoli tribulations this is why i did not go to medicine school someone who dies with an internal illness that causes certain symptoms and he dies out of it and so on so these people get a high status of reward due to their patience over the calamity and the suffering they have gone through but they are washed they are shrouded and they are preyed upon the funeral prayer as any other muslim who dies and allah azza knows best so i hope this answers your question and with this we come to the end of today's program or today's episode insha allah next thursday we will continue with talking about the prescribed punishment and until then i leave you for a minute"
