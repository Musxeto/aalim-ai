  "transcript": "uh charmin from bangladesh if i have semen on my hands after okay and i touch a garment will that garment be impure and if the garment touches another garment will another garment or thing be even wood or clothes become impure to this is too much this is how shaytan messes up with people what she's asking about is the purity of semen and whether it transfers to other objects and the objects transfer it to other objects and then the whole studio is tarnished with semen etc what is this we've neglected the biggest problem which is masturbation which is a sin which is transgression to allah azzawajal which is prohibited and engaged in whether this is najis or not it is exactly like the people of iraq when they came to mecca for hajj and they asked ibn umar may allah be pleased with the manner with his father about a person in who has a mosquito on his hand and he squashes it so is the blood of the mosquito pure or impure it sounds like a legitimate question what did even omar say he said look how dumb these people are they had just killed the grandson of the prophet hussain ibn ali may allah be pleased with them and his family they've killed him in iraq in karbala when he came to help them and assist them and now they're asking me about the blood of a mosquito so this is illogical for shaytan to mess up with your mind like this and play with you guys like children play with football semen is pure whether it is resulting from nocturnal emission intercourse from masturbation which is sinful but it still remains to be pure and one should fear allah azzawajal from such sin and allah knows"
