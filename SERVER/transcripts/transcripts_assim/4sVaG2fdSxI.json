  "transcript": "and we have from the us when can kuffer be made in jokes yanni i see people from the subcontinent saying things speaking on behalf of allah or using the verses of the quran to say uh like make a joke about it uh saying like everything belongs to a mother uh like suramas said uh the second ayah it says which translates to everything belongs to the mother so they say allah said this that everything belongs to the mother is this type of joking considered to be kopher says sometimes we get people making jokes and these jokes may mock the religion of allah and sometimes they mock the quran and she gave an example i did not fully comprehended it i did not fully comprehend it it says that in surat al-masid fiji so she says that in urdu one of the words here means to his mother or belonging to his mother so they use this quranic verse to joke and mock that everything is for the mother as stated but of course it's not what was meant by the ayah so they manipulate the meaning of the ayah sometimes people make jokes and unfortunately i heard this in a lecture and may allah forgive the one who said it where a missionary debated with a muslim in front of the people's village to make a point so he said couldn't allah save al-hussein from being killed and he's the grandson of uh the prophet islam salaam and the conversation goes to say something may allah forgive us that allah azzawajal said i could not save my own son let alone save your grandson o muhammad which the sheikh who said it wanted to prove to the missionary that you accused your lord of being unable to protect his own son as you believe o christians from being crucified so how would you object on him not saving the grandson of muhammad ali et cetera now these stories are problematic they show a great deal of negligence of allah's beautiful names and attributes those people who mock the quran the hadith who say that allah did this allah did that jokingly are falling into kuffur allah stated in surat if i'm not mistaking verse 65 66 chapter 9 this is one of the nullifiers of islam when you mock and this is a story as in mustafa hakim three were traveling with the prophet assam in in the expedition of tebuk and while they were camping three of them started chit chatting and gossiping so one of them said i or we have not seen anyone like the companions the reciters of the quran these companions of the prophet they're big in tummies they're fat and they are liars they say what they don't do and they're so cowardly when it comes to fighting immediately allah revealed these ayahs and if you were to ask them of muhammad they would say they would say that we were just mocking around we were playing fooling around say to them is it by allah his verses and the messenger allah you were mocking do not apologize you have abandoned islam and went into kufur you have committed an act of blasphemy after being a believer so this is not a game people who do this have zero weight of the love and respect of submissiveness submissiveness and worship and humility to allah azza they have arrogance and most of them if you bring that to their attention they become furious and start shouting and cursing and and and and abusing you which indicates that these are real true hypocrites real believers would immediately back off and say allah forgive him and then our caller will call where did you get from sumi anyhow so this is a very serious topic and you cannot make jokes about the quran about the prophet about the sunnah about the companions about anything in the religion of islam because this is a dividing line between iman and kufur"
