  "title": "Is showing off (riya) shirk? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Shabazz says I've heard from India saying that showing off salat fasting as charity or shirk and showing off clothes etc or Sheikh as well I want to know is showing off clothes gadgets watches beaut etcetera it considered to be sure glasses know if I show off with my car wearing branded labels if I show off with my new phone or with my watch or with my LCD screen or computers this is not shirk this might be pride this might be arrogance this might be showing off but it is not definitely shirk ship has to be involved with a form of worship so if I pray and pretend to be praying in a short fashion so that people would admire my prayer this is minor check if n is called Rhea showing off this is Haram this is a major sin if I don't want to give money to the poor but then I notice that there is a CEO of a company who is dining on this other table so I flash a note bill and show everyone that I'm giving this poor person this is showing off this is charity so it's a form of worship unlike when I come to showing off with my car with my gadgets etc these are normal things but they're not recommended nor something that people should do"
