  "transcript": "you are from the emirates uh i finished my class 12th my result didn't come so there are no segregated medical coaches colleges in india so is it permissible for me to study there i also i'm also applying in other countries like saudi but if i didn't get in other countries is it permissible for me to study in india men are the bread winners and they are obliged by islam by the society by the culture to be the people who work and earn and hence you live in a kafir country and you are pursuing the degree that would grant you with the grace of allah a good job that would enable you to live a an honorable life instead of begging or doing a job that is inappropriate for your status so studying in a medical college though it's not segregated you are permitted to do this for a necessity now having said that you're obliged in islam to abide by sharia law which means that you have to lower your gaze you have to avoid free mixing socializing with the opposite gender you have to maintain your dignity and honor at all times and if you do this there is nothing wrong in what you're doing in sha allah you"
