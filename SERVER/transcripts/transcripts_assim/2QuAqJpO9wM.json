  "title": "Should I continue Tahajjud or pray Fajr if the athaan was called? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "it's like very last moment and the father prayer is a saying so does that mean that should i continue my sahaja yogis or should i just stop immediately and stand up for the prayer okay at home i will answer inshallah anna from the us she says i always pray to hajjud late sometimes the adhan is called well it's your mistake jannah the prophet said islam night prayer is two by two but if you fear fajr then offer one rakauter which means that you have to be careful you know the time you know when fajr is called so give a buffer zone of two three minutes and if you're hesitant or unsure just pray one rakah don't pray the full tahajjud so that you would be on the safe side so once given complete your the prayer you're in quickly conclude it and don't pray with her if it's twitter then pray it but if it's two raka's then prayed as to raka's allah knows"
