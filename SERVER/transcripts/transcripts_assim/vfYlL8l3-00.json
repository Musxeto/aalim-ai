  "transcript": "Ubadah from Syria Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Just a quick heads up I'm not an air conditioner I'm a nuclear reactor cooling tower Mashallah Mashallah may Allah increase you without any explosions or radiations No no I don't understand ah what's your question the question is so I used to be an idiot who watches cartoons and anime before now I stopped the problem is it's like a drug to me right now I used to imagine stories of what I used to watch in my head as fan fiction you could say I want to stop it it's like OCD it comes yet it's like drugs the person enjoys it I don't want it yet my mind wants it and it's sometimes it contains magic no just magic and stuff are you are you watching it or you stopped no no I stopped as long as you have stopped because I'm sorry at the time of the episode as long as you've stopped you will need maybe a few years maybe more for your brain and your body to detox and these images will come and jump on you even in your salat even when you're going to bed fantasizing thinking this is your test from Allah you have to remain steadfast and not go back to watching them and ask Allah for forgiveness whenever you recall or remember them and Allah azawajal knows best"
