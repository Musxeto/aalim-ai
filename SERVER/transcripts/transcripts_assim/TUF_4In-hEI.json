  "title": "Is saying the Kalimah la ilaha illah Allah every night before sleeping an innovation Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "sh I know a I know a person who recites every night when he goes to sleep and he says that the reason for reciting at that time is if he dies in his sleep it will be as his last sentence because the prophet Sall say if a person's l words Allah Paradise will be granted for him as a result he always does that so my question is is what he does will be an innovation to my understanding yes this would be an innovation simply because the prophet did not do it so do you find any Hadith that clearly states that the prophet s alam's last words were before going to bed the answer is no so why didn't the prophet do itat why didn't the prophet say itat for any reason either you think that you know more than the prophet Alam or that he concealed it from us and either way is Blasphemous accusing the prophet wasallam of not knowing or of betraying us and not telling us so definitely ly thinking that you know better or yeah I'm doing something that nobody figured it out is a serious offense it's sufficient to say thear before you go to bed and all of it consists ofed and we know that if you die just saying these AAR that inshallah you'll go to paradise no need to say isolated so yes in my uh opinion this is an innovation"
