  "transcript": "leaves no stone un perfect with no fls at all are the laws of Allah a way of life a way of life a way of life a way of life Islam is a way of life all praises to to Allah we ask Allah to exalt the menion and Grant peace and send his blessings upon the prophet Muhammad s. wasam brothers and sisters in Islam welcome to a new episode on the topic of marriage uh we discussed many many many different issues and we were dealing with how sometimes the boys or the young men are unable to get married because of some obstacles either cultural or parents actually create these obstacles do we have the same problem with the ladies unfortunately we do and with the sisters or with the females it's even more than the problems or the obstacles facing the boys because they don't have their full freedom of maring whomever they want so if in marriage a girl cannot get married unless her father approves her guardian approves of the marriage and he cannot give her to anyone un unless she approves of that person so it needs two concessions two approvals to get the marriage contract on the way the father unfortunately constitutes one of the greatest obstacles in girls getting married early and this might be attributed to either the father looking for a high doubt some parents when someone proposes to them and they check out this person and they find that he's not rich or he's going to give a diary of so and so so they refuse they reject the second the third the fifth until someone is filthy wealthy who would come and marry his daughter but not knowing that a filthy wealthy person is not necessarily practicing righteous God-fearing person so he in a sense he's selling his daughter these are one of the reasons he wants someone to be rich so that he would offer a big dowy and we know that Islam the lower the dowy is the more blessed the marriage the marriage is blessed and even even either way is the father entitled to any of I mean isn't the doy for the lady yes the doy is 100% for the girl the girl nowadays in some parts of Arabia the father has the audacity to ask the boy the man coming though he knows that he doesn't have a good job a big job so he says listen I need 50,000 r as do for my daughter two 20,000 R uh jewelry I need a GMC suburb for myself and you buy her mother so and so and the apartment has to be so and so and you have to throw a wedding party an extravagant wedding party that cost so and so and the end result is half a million R ouch and unfortunately most of these weddings and marriages end up in divorce after a couple of weeks and not divorce the boy would not divorce her until they pay him back because this this is not what he expected expected to find in his wife so this is one of the reasons a father can also prevent his daughter from marrying because she's a working woman so she graduated from University now she's working as a teacher as a doctor as so and so and she's getting and receiving a salary and the father has four or five of them working and he takes all of their salaries he's a rich man and he gives him like pocket money and I had this problem with one of the sisters who called me and she said that we're three sisters and we're all over 30 years of age the eldest being 40 and the youngest is being 30 and our father even takes our ATM card so the minute the salary goes into my bank account he T I don't have any right to do it and I was telling them that this is not your father's right and you have to Rebel in an Islamic form being respectful being obedient but he has no right to do this for you and he has no right in rejecting those who are suitable for you on and on he may reject one that you may like but this would come inshah uh later on the Lord Giver has given the the father or the brother this uh responsibility or as a guardian okay and if you look at Guardian is the wi is actually there to to protect the girl and to facilitate and to help her not to become a stumbling block that's why in the sh if there is a father who always turning anyone who proposes okay the Islamic judge the steps in okay and talks to him and if he finds there are no legal things or justification then that right of being the guardian will be taken away and giv to if there is a uncle or a brother or the judge himself will play the role of the W the guardian and get her married so it is not just open like that the father can can do whatever he want and at the same time it's not from the first rejection I get like tons of emails sisters saying that I met this boy in the uni and he proposed to me and my father rejected him but I loved him no no relationship but I love the boy so I'd like to go to the Islamic Center and talk to the judge or to the Imam so that I would marry him is this permissible the answer is no this is the first rejection or the second or the third based on reasons and justifications that the father is convinced with it's but sometimes in these cases I'm familiar with they're not giving any reason the reason is literally he's not from your cast he's from the wrong color so he's admitting openly he's not giving a Sharia reason he's saying clearly you need to marry someone from your cast unit so often this is the case from my experience that they the father openly shamelessly doesn't care if the reason is based on the Sharia or not it's just like no that's not the sort of person I'm going to let you marry but we can't open the door even if this is the only reason this doesn't mean that from her cast or sect there isn't anyone who's suitable there will come someone who's suitable see a lot of the sisters who object to this they object from the first this incident the first or second but what the is referring to yeah I think she you're I mean I think you're right about not opening the doors and this is something we have to be very careful about but I think like all of these things there's a lot of cultural issues a lot of things in the west that will be different so this is very important to really understand fully the situation where whether it's in Saudi or whether it's India or in England it's not the time for the discussion I just want I I wanted to um something you mentioned which I thought I should mention the other side in India the Mah is demanded yeah the girl has to pay the Mahar at least in your country the the father is the mother the M for the girl in India they have to pay the man yeah this is not permissible at all islamically but this and they will find a way no no they will give a Mah of 30 rupees that's the Mah and the rest of it is gifts they'll call it something else even I know practicing families but I'm giving it to him as a gift he's my son-in-law it's a gift but in fact without these gifts they will never be able to get their daughters married if it's a gift it's Hal what is forbidden is when the man demands I'm proposing how much you give your family is what they do this is what happens this is what this is exactly what happens this is he and he needs to have a salary a regular income he has to be given a flat the same list of yeah yeah yeah this is all un Islamic basically he just has to be a man that's the only role he plays then he gets the money and he gets the offer then he gets the wife this is the Hindu culture this is the way and the women suffer see because the if you recall all your the Hadith of the sallam when the woman came to the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam and she said oh prophet of Allah three of your companions proposed to marry me and Confused confus for me he said who are they and she mentioned he said he said mu he said muya is very poor guy he doesn't have anything so don't marry him then she mentioned Abu jaham said don't marry Abu jaham he beats the woman this is one ofation huh he does not he doesn't put down his a stick so here the Scholars they explained it in two ways either it is in allegoric metaphoric form that he's a traveler because normally the Arabs in those days when you are traveling always carrying a stick on your shoulder or that he beats the women but there is explicit narration that he beats the woman okay which explains it so which means if a person is hot tempered very temperamental and you know about it and they ask you you have to mention this bad quality and it's not it's not it's not at all you have to be because this is permissible okay and this will disqualify him and this is a companion okay so he said don't marry him marry Usama perhaps inshallah we can hear some more of them after the break we'll be back shortly Salam alaykum a way of life way of welcome back in India they have to pay pay the man yeah this is not permissible at all islamically but this and they will find a way no no they will give a Mah of 30 rupees that's the Mah and the rest of it is gifts they'll call it something else even I know practicing families but I'm giving it to him as a gift he's my son-in-law it's a gift but in fact without these gifts they will never be able to get their daughters married if it's a gift is Hal what is forbidden is when the man demands posing how much you give your family is this what they do this is what happens this is what this is exactly what happens this is and he need and he needs to have a salary regular income he has to be given a flat the same list of yeah yeah yeah this is all un Islamic that's amazing so basically he just has to be a man that's the only role he plays then he gets the money and he gets the offer then he gets the wife this is the Hindu culture this is the way and the woman suffer yes see because the if you recall all your the Hadith of the Prophet Sall wasallam when the woman came to the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and she said oh prophet of Allah three of your companions proposed to marry me and Confused choose for me he said who are they and she mentioned he said he said mua he said muya is very poor guy he doesn't have any thing so don't marry him then she mentioned Abu jaham said don't marry Abu jaham he beats the woman this is one ofation H he does not he doesn't put down his stick so here the scholars they explained it in two ways either it is in allegoric metaphoric form that he is a traveler because normally the Arabs in those days when you are traveling always carrying a stick on your shoulder or that he beats the woman but there is explicit narration that he beats the woman okay which explains it so which means if a person is hot tber very temperamental and you know about it and they ask you you have to mention this bad quality and it's not it's not it's not at all you have to be because this is permissible okay and this will disqualify him and this is a companion okay so he said don't marry him marry Usama so muya because he was very poor the prophet said don't marry him because the man in Islam is the one who this is the meaning of manhood in Islam is the one who looks after the family he's the one who's responsible not the one who's on doll the doll you call it the doll no he's not in India what will happen is this is how it will happen if he's an engineer for example he will be able to command a higher payment because he does look after his wife eventually but just to get to the stage where she can get married she will have to pay her way it's not that he sits there enjoying everything and he you know he doesn't contribute at all he will still but the higher his job I'm just telling you she the higher his job the more he can command and this is the I'll I'll be in trouble there if I that's true but here it is the this is why they look at it as a dishonor to have daughters and then that's when you get female infanticide and they start killing daughters and scanning them before they're they're born and aborting the fetuses of the girls this is what you get okay um we've covered this issue may I add something else go ahead yeah also here we want to to strike the balance actually regarding this issue not the girls in particular not always you have to think that your father is racist because he from his country from the his tribe the same Clan Etc because as a father and there are certain things only you will understand and appreciate when you grow up and you have children the girl in the life of the father actually she is there always when she is young you take care of her and you try to bring her up in the best way but in the sense it is something enjoyable but it is it is something responsibility you have to think of it that that way so now she reached the age of puberty you have to think of getting her married now she is married you are still thinking about her yeah you're still thinking about her how's she doing now is she happy is he treating her nicely is this and you prefer if your daughter is around you in the same area in the same country so whenever she needs help you are there because if someone coming from overseas another country is going to take your daughter you don't know and the other community is going to so the are other factors should be taken into consideration and also the the compatibility really and the cultural difference is very important but the this is exactly the same logic that they use to marry your cousin for all of these same reasons it's from our family you know our their parents we know that's what not that my argument is that not everything they are saying is wrong so we have have to see and look into it and put yourself in the shoe as a father why he is thinking along that way but we should not go also to overboard or go to the to this extreme to to this but how about the for all the parents out there there is a very clear Hadith which is a guideline for every parent that if someone comes to you asking for your daughter and you are happy with his Dean and his character you should not refuse or there will be great uh facad and on the face of the Earth that's true but the Hadith also added another Factor not only the dean added the and the character I okay the character and the dean okay and it's of course it will be a sin on my part if this is the only justification I have that's why if these two qualities are fulfilled this will give me assurity that my daughter is in safe hands you understand so I will not hesitate if this is pious and righteous to accept him but I have to do my homework there are other qualities need it for example if someone comes to me from a different country and he's a student of knowledge and says give me your daughter in marriage most likely I would not approve of that not because of his religion or because of his moral conduct which is acceptable because we know that mixed marriages usually fail different Customs different Traditions going to a new country that is why I always encourage the brothers and sisters to marry from their own country from their own culture someone who knows how to treat your mother because if you bring someone from a different country but that's just one point of view sh I would say the opposite I mean I would say actually the benefit of marrying someone from a different culture I would go back to the reason you stated for that one of the benefits of marriage itself is bringing families together so how much more better we could bring families together from across the um we have already a divided um divided div into Nations divided into things a lot of these artificial Customs that really they shouldn't divide I mean it's a totally valid point and I have an experience from my own marriage uh of culture clash between my wife's Asian background and my English background but I have to say alhamdulillah the beautiful thing is when you have really and this is the always your basis you can overcome exactly really you can overcome the most because we always say okay we have disagreement we bring it back to Allah and his messenger we will ask a she whatever the she says that's it it's end of argument for us so I think that I agree but if really you have the dean and this is your common Foundation 90% of the issues you will resolve it these cultural issues when you really have the dean alhamdulillah they become I agree with you they are issues and they can put straight on a marriage but they're not something that you can't you know uh in my experience I might be wrong but the there something you can overcome if you have that Foundation we go back to the book and the Sunnah that's why father will do the homework so if I find out that this is the right part and unsuitable and he fears Allah and this alhamdulillah that's it this what I need but uh most of the times people they don't know because they fear what will happen to my daughter now she's in love or infatuation whatever okay he's blind as Love is Blind he doesn't see but you are thinking ahead you are seeing what after 3 months 6 months he comes back to me Daddy help me now yes that's your that's the job as a father to do that but I think the thing here is that it's all solved if the father and the mother and the parent are judging by ISL Islam which is which is unfortunately not this is the problem and the problem is what we're talking about the biggest challenges we've got from my experience and I think you will find from most of our experiences is that a lot of the time it's not and this is where the Clash takes place that it's not an Islamic point of view it's a tribal point of view it's a cultural point of view it's it's really and sometimes the parents are open I don't care what Islam says this is what our culture teaches you know and then the daughter does care about what Islam says You see I've been watching peace TV all of these years learned something about Islam so I think this is where the problems and the challenges and I think we all of all of us encountering these things and the letters and the people that come to us and the emails we receive and may allaha I think if everyone just goes back to the book and the Sunnah you know most of the things alhamdulillah you will find it will be sorted by that do we conclude that so we will be fair and square that not every time the marriage you know the success of the marriage is conditional to them being from the same background same culture and then doing that does not guarantee success either which means every situation requires its own evaluation and to see whether it is feasible or not feasible I think the only fair thing to do and from my personal experience I've seen that alhamdulillah in recent times the Muslims are becoming more aware of this element but it is neglected by many at the end of the day at the end of the day no matter what we do in ter terms of a human physical means that we can apply and utilize the matter is from The Unseen success and failure is not in our hands we can assume that this this marriage will never work out and it will be the most successful marriage and vice versa so if people were to take it step one step at a time this is the prospect or there's a better word for it which I cannot think of right now now anyways when he would come around evaluate this individual he may be a different different background different skin color different whatever other limitations they've they've added do after you've made up your mind that this is something you want to pursue do if Allah facilitates it no matter what the people say this is from Allah and if Allah doesn't facilitate it no matter what do people say this is from Allah soar is part and parcel of every decision we make specifically in matters of marriage because it's a long-term contract and here regarding the you receive we receive manyy mes prayed and I married him and my life is in Hell his miserable life because here what happens because if you analy really because if you analyze the Hadith answer for that okay if theith says it's not that you made up your mind okay it's not that you made up your mind already and now I pray oh I feel good about it no it is the whole issues of thear I leave the matter to Allah subhah wa tala putting my trust in Allah subhana tala he knows I don't know that's what you say in your then whatever comes after that this what Allah subhah wa ta'ala decreed and what Allah decreed is going to pass our time is up for this episode but we will continue inshallah in the next episode with more about marriage for tuning in and we'll catch you in the future inshallah a way of life a way of life dri away"
