  "transcript": "Suleiha from India. Hello, Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. How are you Sheikh? I'm fine, Alhamdulillah. How can I help you today? My question is, my mother is not a good person. She slanders about each other and everyone in our family. She lies and tries to create enmity among family members. She has tried to separate her children from their spouses many times. Even after multiple, multiplied Islamic lessons from us, she never ever listens, does not pray and does shirk. Due to those, no one wants to stay with her in my family. I am married, my husband takes care of her and even though I fulfill my duties to her, but how far should I maintain relation with her? Everyone has a test in life. Some are tested with cancer, others are tested with insecurity, having bombs falling on their heads day and night. Others are prosecuted because of their religion, like our brothers and sisters, the Rohingya and the Uyghur in China. Others are tested with famine or drought or starvation, etc. So, everyone has his own tailored made test from Allah Azza wa Jal. Your test is in your mother, someone who's evil, someone who does bad things despite the fact that you've tried your level best among others to advise her and bring her back to the straight path, but to no avail. What to do? You have nothing other than to be dutiful and respectful without harming yourself, your spouse or your children. So, keep on trying your level best to help her from a distance if this may cause trouble for you and your family, but still you have to be dutiful to her and sooner or later this has to come to an end, either by her death, by your death or by her guidance, you never know. Keep on making dua to Allah to guide her to the straight path and to rectify her affairs and Allah Azza wa Jal is most forgiving, most merciful."
