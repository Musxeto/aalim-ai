  "title": "My friend & neighbour insulted me & my family Can I boycott him for more than 3 days Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question is that I have a neighbor who is my friend here so today we had just had a coral just a little a bit not that much and he said to me you are son of a dog which in our language technically it's like the top of the abusive words one can say and plus my father is also dead and he said much more things about me and my family so now my question is how can I still talk to him what about my self-respect and plus he won't talk to me I can't stop talking to him more than three days how to manage the situation I am really really stressed and plus I'm also shocked man um please make it easy for me first of all Anwar when someone insults you and curses you or swears bad things about you this would reflect upon them so whatever he said about your dead father this would go back to his own father may Allah protect us whether his father is alive or dead whatever he said bad things about your family it will go against his own family as if he's cursing his own mother and his own family what to do such people are toxic and their venom keeps spreading as long as you socialize with them you said that I cannot boycott him for three days this is true in the sense that when you see them when you see him within these three days period you may look the other way and not return his salaam and not give him Salah after these three days if you happen to see him on the streets or he calls you and you pick up and he says salaam alaikum you have to say alaikum Salaam but nowhere in Islam it says that you have to hang out with him and be best friends as before and go out and mix and chit chat no such a person as long as he did not come back to you and apologized and sought your forgiveness and explained that he wasn't in his healthy State of Mind you have all the right to ignore him not speak to him but if you see him on the streets if you meet him because he's your neighbor you just give assalamu alaikum and move on don't hang out or don't communicate and mix with him this is the minimal required and Allah Knows Best"
