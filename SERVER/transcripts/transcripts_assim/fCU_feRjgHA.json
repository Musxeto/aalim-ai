  "transcript": "[Music] would the night of other take place all across the globe at the same time or would it be different for different Regent regions the night of decree lailatul other changes and moves every year it is not on a fixed date like some people say it is always on the 27th of Ramadan this is not true and it's not always on the odd numbers of nights in the last 10 nights meaning it's either 21st 23rd 25th 27th or the 29th no this is most likely but it can be on the 22nd 24th 26th and on the 28th maybe and this is a possibility so to claim that it's only on the 27th and this is by the way the way that the majority of Muslims worship allah azzawajal they neglect the whole of Ramadan they neglect the whole of the last 10 nights only on the 27th they rush to the Masjid to offer taraweeh and to offer kamila where I come from they all rush to Mecca on that particular day and they say that this is the night and then they go back to their sins and go back to their negligence being unaware of what awaits them and this is wrong the prophets way of doing it alayhi salat wa sallam was to sit in seclusion in here take half the full ten nights now had he known it was on the 27th he would have only stayed on the 27th at the beginning it was known to all when the night of decree was in sahih al-bukhari and elsewhere the Prophet came to the companions and he said to them Allah showed me the night of decree and I knew it and I wanted to tell you about it but because two of the companions in the Masjid had a fight an allowed argument I was made to forget it subhanAllah look at the consequence of sin two companions arguing and raising their voices in the masjid led to the whole Ummah to forget and lose when lailatul cut it is it shows you the severity of sin upon not only the individuals but rather the whole Ummah the same thing happened when a group of archers disobeyed the Prophet and I saw some on the battle over hurt and descended down leading to overturning the results of the battle 70 of the prophet's companions may allah be pleased with them who were martyred and we know the events of a hood there for the night of decree is not fixed it keeps on hopping from one year to the other and what the people are always asking share in Saudi Arabia Ramadan was Monday in India and Bangladesh it was on a Sunday and in the USA it was on a Tuesday now when is laylatul addre I don't know does it or is it on the same night for all these countries or the is each country has or does each country has its own have its own night of destiny well to answer your first question it's only one night so if it is a Sunday night is the Sunday night if it's a Wednesday night it's a Wednesday night for the whole of globe it's one night now we don't know because the month started to us on a Sunday which means that the odd night would be even night to those who started on a Saturday or a Monday so now we are in a dilemma okay don't put yourself in such a confusion it is not your business Oh what do you mean I'd like to know where a leather cutter is no one can know when they a little cutter is by the way so these reports we get on the 29th oh by the way lailatul cutter is most likely on the 21st was most likely on the 23rd I saw the Sun come with little light and it was a night of peace it these are all speculations only Allah knows when exactly was they little cutter why so that you would be forced to spend the whole ten nights worshiping Allah to the maximum hoping that each and every night would be lailatul cutter as if it's your last night alive how would you perform but when you think and most likely it's on the 27th the rest of 9 night would be taken easily unlikely and this is not what allah azza wajal wanted for us by concealing and hiding lailatul qatar therefore yes it is one night every year so this Ramadan assuming it is a Thursday it's a Thursday for America for Bangladesh India Pakistan and for Saudi Arabia Morocco Egypt etc next year it might be on Saturday who knows but it would be for the whole globe whether you saw the moon sighting like we did or earlier or later it doesn't make any difference towards when is laylatul qatar it's fixed on a particular night each year it differs on the last 10 nights of ramadan as for the different narrations from the companion site obey Him niqab Mahadevan in Java other companions used to swear that it was on the 23rd or the 25th or the 27 well this confirmation from their side was in regard to one Ramadan that they were certain it was on that particular night and there were some signs and for example the year that the Prophet was informed that is the lob solemn of Leila - coded being on a specific night and then he was made to forget it he said to the people that I saw myself prostrating on water and mud that was the night of other the Companions say that we know which night rained when the Prophet prayed Fajr a salatu salam and we prostrated in muddin and water and rain besides the hadith which is authentic that the Prophet says alayhi salat WA Salam look for nay little other for nine nights left seven nights left five nights left three nights left one night left this hadith even Tamiya says it turns the belief that they litter cutter is always on the odd nights how is that he says people think that 21st third fifth seventh and ninth are the odd nights depending on the beginning of the month while this hadith the Prophet is asking us to detect it depending on the end of the month which we cannot know until the month is over again I could not understand I'll explain it to you if the month begins today the 21st third fifth seventh ninth are the odd nights correct yeah this is logical this is depending on the fact that the month is thirty days but what happens if the month is 29 days the same thing sure no it's not the Haditha just coated detect name lay little other the night of decree nine nights left meaning that if the month is thirty days nine nights left means the twenty first seven nights left means the 23rd and so on but if the month was twenty nine days so nine nights left would be the twenty-second seven nights left with 24 26 28 and this shows that yes it can be on odd or even nights depending on whether we see the crescent and Ramadan is 29 nights or we don't see it and we complete Ramadan to be 30th so again don't confuse yourself do your level best and work hard on these beautiful ten nights [Music] [Applause]"
