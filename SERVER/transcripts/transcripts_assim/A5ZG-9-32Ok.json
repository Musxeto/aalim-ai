  "transcript": "Yes, sir. Do they have to show their passport and the stamp? Not yet. I'll be waiting at the door afterwards. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu. Alhamdulillah, I got the chance to ask because in your lecture in Jogja, I listened to it. I didn't get the chance to ask. So you followed here? No, I studied here in UUM. Alright, alright. Continue please. Shaykh, ever since I made tawbah, I got closer to Allah. And as time passed by, I started disliking the prohibited things like music, smoking, and all other things. But I see my family and close friends, they still do some listening to music, some still smoke, and other things. How should I deal with this? Should I let them be or should I be telling them this and that? Because I fear that they might hold me accountable in the Day of Judgment. Thank you. JazakAllah Khair. First of all, you have to be diplomatic and you have to be smart. Because Sharia came to obtain benefits and complement them and complete them and prevent haram and reduce as much as possible if can't be prevented at all. So when you do something, and this is the beauty of Islam, you judge the thing you're doing or saying by the consequence. So before you do it, measure what is the consequence. There are idols, Buddha, there is a lot, Al Uzza. Let's blow them up. Okay, blowing them up is good. But what is the consequence? Oh, they're going to close Islamic centers, prevent people from praying in the masjid, and put us in jail, incriminate all people with beard. Oh, no, no, no, wait, wait. This is not for you. This is for the authority. So you judge by the consequences. Allah says in the Quran, Do not curse the idols that they worship. Why? So that they do not curse Allah in return. So if I curse the idols, is it a good deed? Yes. But because the consequence is cursing Allah, I will stop. Now you go to your family. And I spoke to my brother and my sister. This is haram. You should do this. You should do that. The following day, they're doing the same haram. You should not do that. You should not do this. This is haram. Okay. The third day, I say the same. What will they do? They'll fight you. They'll insult you. You interfere and put your nose in something that's not of your business. Leave us be. If I'm going to hell, I'm going to hell. Not you. Don't do this. You cause the gap that cannot be closed except after six months or one year. This is wrong. First time. Oh, mashallah. Okay, who is this? Justin Bieber? He's sick. Yeah, I know he's sick. Subhanallah. Yeah, you know that music is haram. The prophet said, and the four imams of the fiqh, he said, yes, I know. Okay, so let's go play football. Let's do this. I cleared my conscience with Allah. Now, next time I come, he listens to music. I don't sit with him. I go and sit somewhere else. Without saying anything. He knows. And they all know. But you're not the religious police. It's not your job that, okay, grow your beard. Don't do this. Your trousers are below the ankles. You wear the hijab. You wear the niqab. You do this. You do that. It's not your job. You have to give fair preaching. With wisdom. Knowing where to put things. What is al-hikmah? To know where to put the things in the right places. So, as long as you did your due diligence, and you did your duty the first time, pull back. What to do? Lead by example. Now, when they see the transformation you have gone through, oh, he doesn't smoke. He doesn't listen to music. He doesn't watch movies. All of these things are negative to them. To me, as a sinner, this guy is crazy. Are you with ISIS or not yet? No, I'm not asking you. No, you're not. You're from Indonesia. So, no. My question is, this is what goes into their mind. So, what to do? Lead by example. Be honest. Be generous. Be courageous. Be caring. Be humorous. Why is it when we commit to Islam, we become grumpy and people say, salam alaikum. Why? They're not begging you. No, no. They want something. No. Be easy going. So, your role model is who? Muhammad, Allahumma salli wa sallim alaikum. Our prophet. Do exactly what he did. Now, if you manage to grab their attention and hearts and make them love you, wallahi, they will follow you in everything. But first, you have to reach that level. In their subconscious, in their mind. Oh, this punk. He just came out of the shell. Like an egg. He just came out of the egg. Now, he's giving us dawah? What does he know about Islam? He's, mashallah, a big mawlana. He's Wahhabi. This is what they will label you with. But, no. When their hearts, try to grab them and draw them closer. By your actions, not by your preaching. I am good in preaching. I can sit here and, oh, you do this, you do that, you do this. I am a sheikh. I do this. But, this is not the best way. Because, you guys came in. I don't know who's paid among you. Alhamdulillah, nobody's paid. Luckily, no one. Inshallah. I hope so. 23 years ago, in Huda TV. When it first started, we used to make programs of dawah. I used to give classes in Balugh Al Maram. So, there were students in the masjid. About 50 or 70. None of them speaks English. They just come and give them money and a lunch. And, they come, all what you have to do is do this. I didn't know that. I thought they were speaking English. So, I was giving my lectures. And, they put four students from international schools who speak English to ask questions. After three, four programs, only these four are asking questions. What about the others? They did not know anything. Anyhow, this is beside the point. So, coming back to the point. I'm not grumpy anymore. I try. Akhi, wallahi, if they love you, if they trust you, they will come and ask you. I was in your shoes 41 years ago. When I started practicing, everybody in my family hated me. Literally, everybody. My own mother, when I got married, I told her, Mom, on Friday, I cannot sit in a mixed gathering. My wife wears a niqab. We cannot sit together. So, we have to segregate. She said, no. I want to sit with my sons and their wives. You come on another day. I said, okay. Immediately, a couple of days later, she said, Khalas, we'll segregate. Yalla, come. I came. Everyone, my cousins, my family, my own uncles hated my guts. And, I wasn't this wise. I was haram, haram, haram, haram. With an AK-47, just going there and wanting to shoot someone. But, it took me a couple of years, some knowledge, some thinking. I'm not getting feedback. Come down, come down, come down. And, after that, it took me maybe eight years until they trusted me. Nowadays, they all call me, with the grace of Allah, with love, with compassion, with mercy. Asking me questions. Oh, Sheikh Asim, what's your ruling on this? What's your ruling on that? It feels good. But, it's not me. It's Allah. Making a lot of dua. And, let them love you. And, Allah knows best. Sorry for the long answer. Not a problem at all.
