  "title": "Taking Islamic classes from someone when we do not know if they are reliable",
  "transcript": "uh nasra from the u.s um okay so there's a zoom call that'll happen soon and apparently it's by ashen who learned under one of the scholars of islam um the topic would be on importance of righteous um friends i don't know the shaykh and i haven't asked others if she was a reliable person so i was just wondering if it would be permissible for me to join this zoom call even though i don't know whether she's reliable or not give the glad tidings to my servants who listen and follow the best of speech so we unfortunately don't have the luxury of picking and choosing most of the time if a person gives us an advice or a reminder it is not possible to just put it on pause and say wait a second and google it and go to facebook and linkedin and see the background of the person and see who criticized him and who praised him this is not applicable most of the time so if a person is giving a reminder or an aseah or an advice and we don't know anything bad about him the default is he's a good person go listen to what this shaykh has to say take notes and cross examine whatever she says with the quran and sunnah and the scholars of islam to see whether it checks the boxes or not and if it does alhamdulillah you've benefited and if it doesn't now you know next time i have to erase some red flags and allah knows best you"
