  "transcript": "Imad from Sweden Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh What books would you recommend for someone who can read Arabic fluently but has no grammatical knowledge? I don't have knowledge in that field because I'm an Arab so I did not study it extensively but Qatr Al Nada is what we've studied in university and it's a good book but you need a Sheikh and likewise the other books around that are more advanced that would teach you Nahu you have to have a Sheikh to teach it to you and Alhamdulillah there are many books that are explained if you know Arabic for example Al-Ajr Rumiyah by Sheikh Ibn Uthaymeen may Allah have mercy on his soul explained the whole book so you will find it beneficial if you know Arabic and you have the guts and the spying to sit and learn Inshallah"
