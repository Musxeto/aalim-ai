  "transcript": "namira from georgia uh i wanted to know that uh if you buy mystically uh put a henna which is like chemical and like it puts like adds like a layer on your skin so if you remove the layer and you feel like only the dye is left then in that case can we do only vudu and not young okay i will answer inshallah namira from georgia she says uh sometimes we apply hin but we notice that there's a layer so if we scratch the layer off and only the dye and the color remains would that impact my wooden answers no as long as there is no layer and it's gone it's only the color especially for natural henna there's no problem in that"
