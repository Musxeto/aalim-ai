  "transcript": "my question is is it permissible for a woman to ask any kind of question in an online forum where men can answer her question well this needs to be looked into if there is no fitna and it's not a private chatting with an mahram so it's seen by everyone and the question is appropriate and decent and the answer is appropriate and decent and there is no possibility of future communication or relationship i believe that this is totally permissible insha allah and that there is no problem in that and allah knows best so we have you"
