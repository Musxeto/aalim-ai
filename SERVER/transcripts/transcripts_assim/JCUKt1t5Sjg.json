  "transcript": "Kurdi from Iraq. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam. Is it permissible to in order to attain martyrdom that you purposefully endanger yourself such as going to for example Gaza and becoming an aid worker and then dying in the process. Will this count as martyrdom or will it count as suicide because you knew that you will most likely die? This is not suicide when you go for relief purposes and working to help Muslims there and the injured. This is not suicide. If you die in the process In Sha Allah you'll be a martyr and In Sha Allah you'll be rewarded for that Bi'ithni Allahi Azza Wa Jal."
