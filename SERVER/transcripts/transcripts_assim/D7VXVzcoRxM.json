  "title": "Can we watch lectures of deceased scholars Must their thumbnails videos be destroyed Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "a brother says what is the ruling on watching islamic lectures of the deceased what about all the thumbnails must they be destroyed upon their death you recall that we say usually that in terms of photography it is not permissible to keep photographs of women and of deceased so thumbnails of sheikh bimbas of ibn ethamine after their death when we have a video and there are thumbnails and there are a still photograph would that be permissible or not i called one of the major scholars and asked him who he himself adopts this opinion and he said i believe that such pictures meaning thumbnails of deceased for such videos are permissible and that they're not kept to be worshipped or to be called upon and they're just random pictures that come and go so insha allah there is no problem in that as for the videos there's no difference of opinion that it is legitimate and permissible for us to watch videos lectures clips of deceased scholars and other than scholars as well"
