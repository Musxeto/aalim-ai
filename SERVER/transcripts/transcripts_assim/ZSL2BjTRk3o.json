  "title": "Husband sent me back to my parents for arguing with my in laws, not spending on me or visiting Assim",
  "transcript": "see if i want to ask question that i am having so serious marital issues okay i am at my mother's home and my husband forced me to live at my mother's home because my in-laws are not willing to give me back home and they used to say that even i apologize whatever i did in anger i did arguments and but even i cried and i said sorry to everyone either i was fault or not but in spite of this my husband forced me that you have to leave your at mother's home as my uh home conditions are not well or suitable for you so he is also not coming here to see me or give me any expenses or you can say he's not giving me anything is it right and he said being a muslim i have to obey him because he has my husband and it's not his will so i even i can't get separate home do you have children no i don't have children okay i'll answer you inshallah this issue of shireen being forced to leave her husband and go back to her parents house simply because her in-laws don't like her or would not accept her apology or for any god for any reason this issue is reoccurring and it's one of the saddest issues that i always face especially in counseling sessions and i have this like on daily basis sometimes yeah i mean a lot on weekly basis sometimes twice a day the same complaint the origin of this is that in the subcontinent they have this with all due respect stinking habit of forcing the wife to live with her in-laws so they all live in a joint family now in some cases this is a good thing if the woman is accepting and if the parents of the husband are logical diplomatic wise and rational people the vast majority of cases i get are from tyrants the in-laws are usually the most evil people on earth and their son admits this i get counseling sessions like this and this the husband says my father is evil my mother is a witch and she doesn't fear allah she seems to be praying and reading quran and she looks like hijabi but she is the worst of all people and they speak about their moms like this sometimes it's the other way around sometimes it's the wife who's lazy disobedient disrespectful doesn't want to do anything he wants to be treated like a queen i'm not going to say who's right who's wrong but generally speaking the concept of joint family is totally unacceptable islamically it's a woman's right in islam to live in a separate house not to take in her in-laws or not to move into her in-laws home and be expected to work as a servant and this is what's happening in the subcontinent a man marries a woman she serves his sisters his in-laws his own in-laws and their children and his parents she has has to do the shores she has to wake up early she has to cook she has to clean and iron and do the whole nine yards where is it in islam is this yeah it's cheaper and more decent to get a maid from abroad you know pay like 1500 reals or so and and get it over with so this is the vast majority of the problems i'm getting in counseling sessions and not only that we have a problem with mummy's boy so the man who's supposed to be a real man a husband a woman marries a man so that he becomes her rock he becomes someone who protects her who defends and stands for her but unfortunately the vast majority of such quote unquote men they get married and their mom says oh she's doing this she's doing that and he puts all his rage and anger on her she's a victim did you look into it cross examine the evidences no no no my mom said my mother my mother never lies while his mother is the most blatant liar on earth and he will be held accountable in the day of judgment not only that let him divorce this poor woman do you think allah will leave him do you think this will not come back to haunt him with his second or third or fourth wife with his children with his daughters payback is you know what and and allah azza doesn't leave things un accounted for unpunished you have to pay back so he sends her to her parents okay did you divorce her no i'm compelled to do that okay are you providing for her giving her uh allowance to live in her parents house for food for whatever she is no so what is this what are you doing i'm pressuring her to file for and return the gold and return the maha you're not a man with all due respect you're a wimp you're a mummy's boy you have no dignity you have no honor when you want the wealth and money of your wife not because of something wrong she did but because you're not a real man have a spine fear allah azzawajal and don't claim and pretend that oh i'm a good muslim i pray taraweeh i read the quran you are full of hot air you have nothing to relate you to real manhood and real chivalry and real islam so what he's doing is wrong and may allah make things easy why did i ask you do you have children because staying in such a marriage is a very bad investment let's assume after six seven months he forgives you and gets you back do you think things are going to go well a dog's tail is always crooked it's never straight it's not never going to be straight and his family is like this and he's mommy's boy so maybe you should negotiate well actually you have to think it over with your parents and your wise people in the family is it is it worthwhile still having all the eggs in one basket is it worthwhile staying this marriage or it's best to run and call it a day because when the stocks are falling down in the stock market the best thing to do is to sell because the damages are going to increase so run with whatever you can and allah knows best you"
