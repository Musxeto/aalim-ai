  "transcript": "Abdullah says during the process of meeting a potential spouse does the mahram have to be right next to her during the meetings or does she just have to be heard and seen what is a proper method to conduct the meeting the reason for the mahram to be there is to ensure that there is no seclusion so if he's there physically and he's able to hear what goes on so that would ensure there won't be any flirting or inappropriate things to be discussed but being there physically without listening and hearing what they have to say to one another that would not be appropriate so yes the mahram has to be there and he has to sort of be engaged in whatever conversation is going on not just to be there symbolically rather to control whatever inappropriate things may happen which is very rare but also to steer the conversation sometimes there they have cold feet and they don't know what to say so they just sit there watching the chandeliers and looking at the carpets Etc not engaged in asking one another questions to break the ice so his presence is beneficial when he adds some value when he asks question to the shooter or to the daughter or his um sister or whoever is there so that one could get a chance to look at the potential shooter take a good look at him or her while they're talking and maybe initiate a conversation after that"
