  "title": "ğŸ†• Can we use Nicotine Patches to help us quit smoking in Islam?",
  "transcript": "Hassan says, is it allowed to useÂ \ncigarette replacement products to help stop smoking, like nicotine patches? If you recall, when intoxicants, when wineÂ \nwas permitted in the beginning of Islam, it came over three stages. Until on theÂ \nlast stage it was totally prohibited. this gradual process of prohibitionÂ \ncan be applied in other cases. So, smoking is Haram, and we knowÂ \nthat. Why? Because it's harmful. Even the non-muslim doctors andÂ \nphysicians all agree that this is a main cause of fatalities,Â \nheart problems, strokes, etc. Therefore, if someone is trying to kick out orÂ \noff the habit and he resorts to nicotine patches, chewing gums, pills and whateverÂ \nthat may help him stop smoking, scholars say that this is permissibleÂ \nbecause it's a lesser evil and at the same time it helps him with the grace ofÂ \nAllah stop such a sin providing that it doesn't cause more harm than smokingÂ \nitself which normally it doesn't Therefore, In sha Allah, it isÂ \npermissible that Allah knows best."
