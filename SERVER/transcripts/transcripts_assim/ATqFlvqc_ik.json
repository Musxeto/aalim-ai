  "title": "Traits of Khawarij is they declare takfeer, how to avoid falling into the other extreme (Irja)?",
  "transcript": "yeah first question is uh we know that the traits of khawarij is that they declare thick fear on muslims and sometimes on muslim ruler as well so my question is how do we not go to the other extreme uh and fall into the when it comes to muslim rulers and other muslims how do we make it uh like keep it balanced and stay on the correct path first of all takfir is not a treat of al-hawaris alone meaning that fear is one of their characteristics and in a sunnah jamaa we are supposed to give tak fear to someone who is a kafir providing that the conditions are fulfilled and that there are no obstacles present that may prevent us from giving tech fear so ignorance is an obstacle being forced is an obstacle i can't give that fear to someone who's under gunpoint to say the words of kufur and he does he's not a kafir so we have to be aware that in order to call someone that is hawarish not only that he gives the fear he gives the fear without any legitimate justification and he endorses rebellions against the muslim ruler and a number of things that are cascaded in their akida about seeing allah azzawajal about the grave torment atonement of the grave so many things only then they can be labeled as hawari now how to strike the balance so that we don't fall into irja and irja is the quite the opposite of where they say that major sense makes you a kafir and for eternity in hellfire if you lie if you steal if you commit zina this is totally taking you out of the hold of islam says that you can do the whole nine yards and you're still a muslim and your iman is as strong as the iman of abu bakr and umar and jibril and mikhail of course both on the far end where nev they do not meet are wrong but you can't simulate or give similarity of what they're doing to allah because al sunnah will have guidelines and their guidelines are from the quran and the sunnah with the understanding of their favorite three generations so they are covered they're protected and they would not be able to go astray because the guidelines of adolescent protects them from falling into that in order for you to strike that balance you have to learn your religion you have to study the books of akida with trusted scholars so that you can understand how a sunnah will act"
