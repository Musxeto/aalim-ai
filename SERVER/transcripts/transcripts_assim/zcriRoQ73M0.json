  "title": "How should a woman cut her hair after Umrah if she has layers? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Nayla says how should women cut their hair after ombres is it an ish from the hole of the bottom however if someone has long fingers or layers in their hair long fringes if they have fingers that would be problematic if someone has long fringes or layers in their hair must they cut an inch from those different layers also the scholars say that in order to take off your rom after completing your ritual of Rama or Hajj is that a woman collects all of her hair and cuts about this much from the end of it now this is understood if the length is one but if it is in layers then this would be difficult so the most authentic opinion is that you do your level best yes you may fail in catching each and every hair in cutting that much off but you have to try and level as much as possible this much from all or your hair and Allah knows and knows best"
