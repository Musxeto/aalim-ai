  "transcript": "oh [Music] this is alhamdulillah foreign [Music] welcome dear brothers and sisters to this beautiful night of worship where Allah has chosen us to be amongst the people that the angels surround and praise as we get together to seek beneficial knowledge striving to get better for the sake of Allah foreign Scholars our beloved our beloved Sheikh will be discussing the topic of preserving one's identity so without further Ado please welcome to the mic Sheikh Allison so alhamdulillah and welcome to this blessed night where we shall inshallah discuss the Topic at hand which is a very important topic not to our religion only but rather to the existence to our existence in this world in this Cosmopolitan world that we live in if you remember we recite two surahs in the Sunnah Fajr in the Sunnah of after tawaf in the Sunnah of Maghrib and in with your prayers in the last of the three rakas Witcher one of these surahs is the famous Surah suratul kafirun and it everybody knows it by heart and if you look at this Surah you find it emphasizing a very important fact in Islam this fact is that we as Muslims have our own identity have our own religion have our own way and that cannot be mixed with other ways Allah says say o disbelievers I do not worship what you worship nor are you worshipers of what I worship nor you will will I be a worshiper of what you worship nor you will be or uh uh worshipers of what I worship for you is your religion and for me is my religion you imagine that we repeat this Surah throughout the day a number of times and it's part of the bedtime ascar so that we recited before going to bed because it signifies our identity our religion the way we deal with ourselves and the community around us a muslim's identity is unique because we pride ourselves to be on the straight path which Allah has chosen for us we recite in Al Fatiha not less than 17 times a day not less stating our identity when we say guide us to the straight path we ask Allah to guide us to the straight path the path of those upon whom you have bestowed favor not those who you have who have earned your anger or those who are astray so our identity on the straight path is different than those who had earned Allah's anger and these are the Jews nor those who have went astray and these are the Christians we identify this and recite it and acknowledge it so the issue of having our own identity that is unique that's make us stand out in a crowd this is an essential part of our religion and that is why it is a well-known fact that Muslims are ordered to go against other denominations all other religions in our conviction in our beliefs inner traditions in whatever they are known of such as their Customs their Traditions their attire and the general Hadith of the Prophet Allah highlights this when he said and whoever imitates a people he is part of them this is a very strong warning for those who have lost their identity whoever imitates a people if you look at the Muslims nowadays the vast majority of them are confused they have mixed opinions of things to an extent that their identity has been diluted with the identity of the disbelievers because the system the existing system worldwide is working hard to do this forget this nonsense they claim to be democratic democracy democracy freedom of speech freedom of opinion freedom of individuality this is a lot of excuse my French BS total nonsense the greatest democracy they claim last month abandoned uh prohibited little girls from wearing their Abaya from their wearing their Islamic attire not the head cover no no just even the outer garment is prohibited you have to wear skirts or jeans trousers where is a democracy this is other communism don't claim your Democratic you want the people to be molded and what you choose for them and there's no democracy in this there are a bunch of liars hypocrites so they essentially want to mold the Muslims to dilute their identity so that they don't have an identity of Their Own they monitor messages lectures preachers when they preach and they say anything that goes against the Republic foundations and beliefs they're extradited or put in jail what's the difference between them and The Wager who are being prosecuted for their Islam what's the difference between them and the Chinese who are prosecuting and persecuting the uyghurs for their Islam that is the same don't claim that they are Democratic there are a bunch of liars and hypocrites and this is why most Muslims now are losing their identity if you go back to the foundations of Islam which all kafir countries resist and undermine and try their level best to bring you down on your knees and humiliate you through their educational system through their social system through prohibiting you from using freedom of speech which they brag about you will find that they don't want you to learn your religion because if you learn your religion if you go back to the Quran to the Sunnah they lose and you win and Islam will prevail whether they like it or not in Islam it's a crystal clear fact that we're ordered to have our own identity not to imitate the disbelievers even in the slightest of things that people would consider to be trivial and not of great importance you see this this is the mustache in Islam with order to trim it so it does not go beyond the upper lip and to trim it to the best of your ability not to shave it but to trim it really good the prophet said he who does not trim his mustache is not from Among Us whoa it is similar to cheating who he cheats us is not from Among Us a mustache is something trivial to the vast majority of Muslims not in Islam it's part of your identity the prophet I thought of some said honor the beard prolong the beard let go of the beard leave it as it is go against the ways of the Christians and the Jews and the fire worshipers and the vast majority of them the Jews and the Christians and the five worshipers don't grow their beads the prophet salallahu so a man once walking with a garment that went below his ankles and we know that this is a sin so he said to him uplift your garment so the man looked at the prophet said and said to him Allah o prophet of Allah it's a very torn old garment it's not a means of Pride for showing off so the prophet said to him don't you have an example in me as a role model to you the man said so I looked at the prophet's garments and it was to the middle of his legs and this shows you that your identity is important even if you don't find any logic behind it Allah now let me please with the man with his father once came as he narrates in Muslim I came to the prophet Allah with a two pieces of garment or suit that were died with zaffron so this is a Dye that has a smell and a color but this is not from what the Muslims wear and this is something that the disbelievers are known to wear Abdullah said the prophet was angered by this when he saw me and he said to me Abdullah did your mother or do you to wear this and this is a bit offensive shocking for a man to be addressed like this Abdullah said immediately acknowledge his mistake he said o prophet of Allah should I wash them off and remove the saffron from it the prophet said no burn them why waste money so that you would learn your lesson not to ever imitate the disbelievers this is a glimpse of how important the identity is in Islam and this is what the enemies of Islam don't want us to do unfortunately the vast majority of the youngsters and they're the majority of the Muslims alongside with the elders some of the elders they've got dual personality Dr Jekyll Mr Hyde so on one hand they have Muslim names sometimes they pray but on the other hand if you look at them you don't know whether they're Muslims or not fading hair styles no beards wearing lots of amulets and rubber bands and colored wrist bands and necklaces bling blings some of them even Pierce their ears and they don't have anything that would indicate that they're Muslims some of the Muslims even play music participate in AGT bgt whatever and they have Muslim names so they don't know what Islam really is and this is dangerous when you lose your identity and you're torn between different identities this may make you fall into hypocrisy listen to what Allah said about hypocrites in the Quran Allah says verbally the hypocrites seek to deceive Allah but it is he the almighty who deceives them and when they stand up for prayers they stand with laziness and to be seen by men and they do not remember Allah but little they the Hypocrites are swaying between this and that belonging neither to those no to these nor to those they're not really belonging to the Muslims the Believers nor their belonging to the disbelievers they're Hypocrites and they are in between and then Allah azzawajal says and he whom Allah sends astray you will not find for him away to the truth and to Islam so this is really scary now come to think of it what is the source of our identity what is the source of our pride is it our Beauty our wealth or authority our power whenever you see a real practicing Muslim abroad the first thing that comes up to your mind and to the disbeliever's Minds when you tell them I'm a Muslim what's the first thing that comes up to their mind oh you're a person that does not eat pork you do not drink intoxicants that you pray you fast Ramadan and women wear hijab this is the first thing that comes to mind why because this is their identity so the source of our pride and our identity is Allah's religion is the Sunnah of a prophet alaihissalam the more you follow the Sharia the more your pride goes up and increases because this is the only source of your pride the religion Allah says in the Quran but honor power and Glory belong to Allah his messenger and to the Believers but the Hypocrites know not these things belong to us believers because Allah granted it to us and our pride and identity is manifested when we fall when we are committed to forms of worship the prophet said Allah remember that the Believers honor is his praying at night my honor is when I pray to hajjud at night and his pride is in him being independent of people my pride Lies when I don't look to people giving me something my pride is to be independent and not to look whether they're going to give me something or not and this concept of honor and pride and dignity was well established with the companions may Allah be pleased with them and there are so many stories that we can spend the whole night saying but time is quite Limited once bought the Garment of the king of Yemen the yeezen so imagine the king of Yemen had a very fancy garment so he bought it and gave it to the prophet Allah the prophet accepted his gift Allah and gave it to usaid of course we know Zaid was the adopted son of the Prophet Assam before it was abolished and abrogated so there was no adoption after the afterwards and the prophet loved Zaid tremendously as he was known to be the son of Muhammad but when adoption was abolished so he was called by his father's name but the prophet loved him as a son and his son Osama the prophet loved him as a grandson so he was the love of the of the Prophet Allah the prophet gave this beautiful suit an expensive suit to Usama so Osama put it on Osama by the way was black as night while his father was white Caucasian so when Hakeem saw this young boy who was in his teens maybe like 13 or 14 years of age wearing the Garment in suit of the king of Yemen he was astonished and shocked and he says you are wearing the suit of the king of Yemen look at the identity and pride of Osama this youngster he said yes why shouldn't I I'm better than him because I'm a Muslim and he was a kaffir and my father Zaid is better than his father Hakeem was Amazed by this answer and he went to Mecca back to Mecca repeating it to the people of McCain showing them the pride of this youngster Willis Islam may Allah be pleased with him one of the companions enters the courts of the leader of the Persian army that was just about to fight with the Muslims and he said to him probably this rustom the the Persian leader said to robe what brings you here you Arabs used to eat dead flesh out of poverty and you eat you used to eat a beetles of the desert you used to fight one another and assault one another tribes tribes men assaulting other tribes and he started cursing and saying bad things about the Arabs so is it who are you people what brings you here probably did not come to this Persian leader with gifts golden swords or Hawks and Falcons expensive jewelry no we're here to fight so he said to him Allah the Almighty had sent us so that we can take and free the people from worshiping other humans to worshiping Allah alone and to take them out from the tightness of this life to the wide Prospect of the hereafter and to take them out from the oppression of different religions to the fairness and Justice of Islam so Allah sent us with his religion to his people to call them whoever accepts are religion we leave him alone and whoever refuses we will fight him until we reach what Allah has destined for us this is the attitude an identity of the Muslims unlike us you and I look at the Muslims today they're scattered all over the world tourists partying all night long womanizing drinking booze spreading mishab and and chaos and corruption in the world and they are acknowledged as Muslims while back then they spread all over the world with their graves everywhere in the globe calling to Allah azzawajal so they graduated from this message of the prophet which was paved with pebbles and had only Palm leaves on top of it that would not preserve it and protect it from rain water when it fell it had nothing but look what it produced and look at our messages with the marbles and the chandeliers and what it had produced now what is the cause of this identity crisis a number of factors and reasons and we're running out of time unfortunately but as I said this is a very important topic so what are the reasons behind this identity crisis there are a number of reasons among the first of these reasons is the technological advancement and being shocked how they've reached the Moon traveled in space so much technology they have and possess and their upper hand in their military advancement so this made a lot of the Muslims feel inferior and want to be like them also secularism and the Relentless attempts to destroy religion whether Islam or other religions and to amplify and inflate the role of logic over Islam and what Allah commands so nowadays you end up by people saying that no this is not logical yeah but Allah ordered it exactly like when Allah ordered Satan to prostrate to Adam he said this is not logical I was created from fire and he was created from clay I'm better than him why would I prostrate so he defied a direct order from Allah and the vast majority of Muslims today are doing the same they're going against the Quran the Sunnah openly saying that it's not logical this is uncivilized and they have left the fall of Islam once they have done this also as humans we're weak we love lusts and desires and things that makes us enjoy life even if it's Haram so when we imitate the disbelievers it makes getting and attaining these lust and desires much easier it's much easier to hook a girl or to involve and get involved in uh drugs and intoxicants and boozing and maybe gambling and pursuing whatever you want from Haram if you look and act like them while it's much difficult if you look like me and among the things that caused this identity crisis the media especially social media so when they portray someone like me wearing the Islamic attire or the Arab attire not necessarily Islamic having a long beard what does the media say about the likes of me terrorists um uncivilized and Muslims they listen to this and some of them say that's true and this is very unfortunate when such ignorant imbeciles fall to such traps of the media and the social media and the likes where they tarnish the reputation of Islam so they feel inferior and they start to lose their identity and rather be like the disbelievers even if they have to wear a cross or have tattoos on their bodies like so many Muslims are doing now not knowing that they're being cursed for this or knowing but they brush it off it's trivial thing we will go to agenda before all of these people they say they think and they believe so how to cure this identity crisis again the time is very limited but number one you have to sense and feel the blessing of in favor of Allah upon you for being a Muslim don't be a Muslim by identity only card ID card this doesn't does do you any good written in your passport Muslim or in your ID card Muslim doesn't have any significant significance it's walking the talk that does and when you feel that you're blessed for being a Muslim you will preserve your identity and if you feel that no it's not a a huge blessing then you'll start to compromise your identity and if someone comes to you says hey you look Hispanic hola que pasa you feel happy oh alhamdulillah he thought I was Hispanic and not a Muslim I was afraid that he would recognize me to be from the Middle East or from the Muslim Community but alhamdul he thought that I'm Spanish or this or that this is pathetic and it brings sadness to our heart if you want to cure this illness and to preserve your identity you have to learn your religion no one with knowledge of his religion from Quran or Sunnah or the biography or the Seer of the Prophet salaam no one has this knowledge and would lose his identity you need to learn what your Islam is not valid without the essential not to be a scholar but to the basic minimum the bare minimum and this is what makes you steadfast at times of tribulations and calamities you have to call others to Allah because if you're proud of your identity you're proud to call others to Allah so many people are ashamed of their identity they don't even have the guts to pray in an airport or in college or at a school or in a mall when the time of prayer is due and it's about to go out they're afraid nobody's going to harm you yeah but uh what will the people say so you have to call others to Islam you have to be proud of your Islam the Allah says in the Quran and who is better in speech than one who invites to Allah and does righteousness and says indeed I am of the Muslims thirdly you have to fear that you might be a hypocrite a full-fledged hypocrite this fear of being a hypocrite means that you're not a hypocrite because whoever is secure and safe from feeling a hypocrite He's a hypocrite and whoever fears hypocrisy then he is a True Believer from the table Allah says I have met 30 of the prophet's companions may Allah be pleased with them all of them is afraid that he might be a hypocrite and none of them says my Iman is as strong as the Iman of jibril and Mikhail finally a lot of us may complain that there are so many pressures against us the whole world is against us and we don't know what to do it's it's overwhelming us my friend a Muslim has no other choice either to remain steadfast on Islam and show his identity and be proud of it or to blend in and to agree to be diluted in this Melting Pot until he comes out of his religion totally like Allah described the Hypocrites by saying they are swaying between this and that belonging neither to these nor to those and at the end the choice is yours either to be a Muslim culturally a Muslim by inheritance by lineage or to be a Muslim through conviction and practice and this would preserve your identity and the identity of your children there is so much to say especially about those living abroad and how to preserve their children's identity to the best of their knowledge and ability but as I said the time is very limited and we've already exceeded the half an hour margin so I pray to Allah that he grants me and you and oral viewers and all those who listen to this to grant us the ability to remain steadfast in Islam and to gain the knowledge that would enable us to call others And to clarify their doubts about Islam and to be proud of our identity and of Who We Are and no matter what they say about you dogs that bark don't bite when people accuse you or abuse you or try to put you down do what you do when you meet a dog in the street that barks at you don't fall on your hands and knees and bark back rather stand tall and walk away ignoring it and Allah knows best Muhammad we will be taking questions and uh I've got a few good questions over here uh Chef the first one says for your input what is your recommendation for the situation in India and other places where it's becoming tough for us Muslims should we migrate to other safe places in the world even though they're non-muslim countries the people of India are a minority compared to the rest of the population but there are almost 200 million which makes them one of the largest communities for Muslims worldwide other than the Muslims in Indonesia for example who are over 250 million so if we were to ask them to migrate that would cause a vacuum and to tell you the truth non-muslim countries are not better than India so with all the what is happening the lynching and the killing and the torturing and the humiliation compared to what happens abroad this is not a lot and this is why the vast majority of Muslims are safer in India than outside yes there are certain areas that it is too hostile and dangerous and then these particular areas the Muslims should evacuate and relocate to other Muslim areas and this is what I always tell the Muslims to reunite and to try and live together next to one another to watch each other's backs when you live scattered in different neighborhoods and you're the only Muslim family among thousands of non-muslims you will be eating alive you will be eaten alive but when you are a thousand Muslim families watching for one another living next to one another they would think twice before even attempting to do something against the Muslims so the Muslims should cluster and gather in their own Villages their own neighborhoods and build a strong Community around domesticate this is the right way of doing it and inshallah Allah will protect them by that uh the next question is how to preserve your identity when your own household is non-practicing and pressuring you the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam was sent in a similar environment he was on his own and he started building alliances and followers so mother Khadijah his wife accepted Islam the first one Abu Bakr his best companion his adopted son his cousin so when you're alone you try your level best to focus on getting people who will sympathize with you and accept if not practice with you if you fail to do this then there is no other alternative by preserving your identity for the sake of Allah always remind yourself why am I doing this because I love Allah why am I doing this because Allah ordered me to do so why am I doing this because this is the way of the Prophet Allah which I'm following so I could care less what people say as long as Allah is hap as as long as Allah is pleased with me and with what I do this is all what counts next uh people living in the west try to maintain their Muslim identity at the same time they feel the need to wear normal culture clothes to blend in with Society how do we balance these two a tire Sheikh do we stick to ourselves or Abaya or wear Islamic dresses the Islamic dresses while blending with culture there is nothing wrong none whatsoever in wearing Halal permissible clothes so this thought I'm wearing is not in Islamic attire this is an Arab attire the prophet used to wear the hamis which is a much shorter shirt like the Pakistani wear this is more closer to the Islamic attire than anything else the Saudis or what I'm wearing the Arab attire is a cultural thing this is the prophet never wear this he used to wear the turban so it is not advisable for people living in the U.S or in Europe to wear the Arab code dress code because this would make them look weird and if you approach someone to give dawa to he would have an immediate resentment to whatever you want to say even if you're gonna say to him here's a hundred euros because it's coming from you when I traveled and people know this I wear normal jeans and a t-shirt there's nothing wrong in that it's more convenient for me I tend to blend in with my beard I don't think I'm gonna ever blend in but again it looks okay and if you are a student of knowledge and you want to give a hotba in a Masjid or you want to lecture your friends at school but you look different than them though you are from the same country so you're born and raised in that country and you always wore trousers and suits and t-shirts and shirts what made you change well because I become a Muslim Islam doesn't tell you to change your attire like this Islam tells you not to wear Haram clothes so you don't expose your aura you don't wear tights you don't imitate the disbelievers nowadays wearing trousers and a t-shirt or a shirt or a suit is not imitating the disbelievers because the vast majority of Muslims wear this as their day-to-day clothes so there's no imitating the disbelievers when we wear this and Alana's best feel free to ask whatever you want if you have doubts or something you did not like go ahead you can comment I don't hear you I've lost your your voice you're muted Maybe um sorry um there is uh one more question that says what should be the approach for children who are being confused with difference with differences within the household and the Masjid Community with respect to the beliefs and rulings which are obligated in Islam depends who's teaching them if you're talking about a parent in the house who's telling them about Islam and what's right and what's wrong they should be aligned with the Masjid there's no difference in that but if the Masjid is teaching them Islam and the household and the parents and the siblings are all teaching them against that the children are definitely going to be confused and if Allah does not guide them to listen to the right sources of information in the Masjid or by Scholars and the likes they're they're going to be lost like their parents and their siblings um [Music] um even though I identify as a Muslim I struggle with being religious with being as religious as I want to be what are small but effective steps I can take towards being a more identifiable and more reliable okay this is something that needs to change a whole lifestyle rather than a few tips because if you want to be identified as a Muslim and to increase your Iman and to be proud of your religion first of all you have to transform your life into what pleases Allah beginning with your house so again we don't want Dr Jekyll Mr Hyde in our community we don't want you to go to the Masjid and pretend to be a practicing Muslim and when you go home you're engaged with Netflix and Game of Thrones and listening to music and wasting your time over Haram things you would never ever have your identity because you keep on seeing this filth and you can keep on hoping when will I be like this when I will fall into such things and and be famous or the likes secondly look at your contact list on your phone you'll find that only one or two practicing Muslims are there and the rest are all Dunya uh um and people that are not something to be proud of associating yourself to so you have to go to the Masjid you have to stick to the community and hang out with righteous practicing Muslims 24 hours seven days a week otherwise your heart is a vessel if you don't fool it fill it with goodness it's definitely going to be filled with corruption and sins so once you put this in your system and you hang out with righteous practicing Muslims 24 hours seven days a week only then you will see transformation on yourself on your body on your Abida on your thinking and you will have this identity to be proud of on allano's best um are you up for more questions sure you got eight minutes okay um we have one question that says what is the bare minimum length bare minimum length of beer to have yeah I think the brothers said shoot I don't want to have a beard like as long as the chefs it's an issue of dispute the vast majority of Scholars say that the Hadith of the Prophet saws stated that leave it so he said all of this is just leaving it not put weights on it every night so that it becomes longer by itself no no the prophet did not tell you to prolong it he said leave it you don't have to put fertilizers or special uh chemicals to prolong it as it is now the prophet himself had a very big beard huge and it's wet to the extent that the companions could tell when he was reciting in silent prakas by the trembling of his beard from seeing him from behind which meant that he had a huge beard which he did not touch or trim the other opinion says that due to the action pleased with him that whatever exceeded the fist length he used to trim it and this was in the Hajj season because in Surah al-fat Allah says you shall enter the message in safety shaving and shortening this refers to shaving the head if you wish after omrah or Hajj or shortening and trimming your hair if you wish so he understood it to be shaving the head and trimming your beard so used to do this in Hachi so this is the other opinion is that if it is more than a fist length you can cut it short Unfortunately today people don't do this they do it from the top of the Fist not from the bottom of the Fist that's why it never ends if they keep on trimming it and cutting it short so the opinion that I'm inclined to which is the opinion of my issue that they mean and the likes they say that you leave it as it is now in extreme cases and this is rare when you have your beard reaching your belly button this becomes hazardous to your health so when you eat you start eating your own beard because it's everywhere when you drive it comes to your eyes and impairs your vision or it if you're working in a factory imagine it falling into the machine and you have a big problem in this case yes when it's Hazard this this hazardous to your life you may shorten it to the fist length and Allah Knows Best um uh there's one teacher of mine who'd like to ask you a question sure getting old alhamdulillah how are you doing today I was about to come to an end and I know very well the question that I've been getting as well but it's been a little bit challenging for many people uh in the west speaking about identity Sheikh uh we know very well that the syllabus in school in the west is being structured to put doubt in our children's identity not us like how you mentioned with the context we're having the kids the social media and all you know when they go to school the syllabus have been structured letting them understand that it's okay for you lose your identity you know Shayla with Chantel and Paul Lewis Smith it's okay to do that to them matter of fact sometimes they have parents meeting Mom and Dad supposed to come and then they see two male coming in my mom and my dad so our children being exposed to this and they're confused so the parents in the West they tend to remove their children from the school but now with a new low if you don't bring your children to school they bring Social Services to you it's very challenging for their parents to actually save that identity and save God and preserve that Muslim identity what's your advice to those parents or keep their kids in the house or bring them and make property to them we would like to hear that from you this requires another lecture I think first of all you know it is a priority for Muslims to preserve their religion and their identity and Scholars say that if a person is capable of practicing his religion without any interference without any oppression without any hindrance they may stay and live in the disbelieving countries but if there is oppression or they cannot perform their normal rituals such as hijab then it becomes mandatory for them to migrate if they're able to do this now unfortunately migration is not possible to the vast majority of Muslims either due to economic reasons or political reasons but alhamdulillah there are countries that are more lenient than others so such as these countries that prevent you from wearing the hijab or the Abaya such as France we anyway beat around the bush who claim to be Democratic and they're a bunch of liar Hypocrites they're not Democratic they are socialist communists enforcing whatever they want upon the people and the people who are like stray sheep they just do what they're told and they can't say anything else and rather some of them even ride the wave and support their government in such evil Behavior and I was talking to a brother a few days ago and he was telling me that the social services are going to intervene intervene in what no one knows what's best for my children more than me I wouldn't believe legislators I wouldn't believe the president himself when he says that no this is best for your children yeah I can't use profanity otherwise I would have done that but this is a lot of nonsense nobody cares for my children more than me and when you come and enforce your beliefs that are corrupt and that are spreading uh um all kind of of nonsense in the society look at your children look at your girls look at your boys boys are turning girls girls are turning boys and you're teaching them sexual education sex education at an early age of eight or nine years of age how to use condoms how to use vibrators how to use dildos and and the LA and then you say that oh this is for the betterment of the the Children's Health and and knowledge this is a lot of BS and this is why Allah is little by little showing them his Wrath they're being kicked out of uh Africa after they've taken all of their natural resources uranium gold and this and that every African country is kicking them out and they are going to be facing a lot of trouble because of their Injustice not from us Allah would show them his wrath when the government itself in the country itself is going to collapse with from within so what to do I told the brother you as Muslims should have collaborated and formed many many private schools that are are private for the Muslims segregated through their legal system through their educational system but then they cannot enforce such rulings because it's not Public Schools if this is not possible they should migrate to other countries European countries that are more tolerant to this if they cannot find any Muslim countries to take them in but whatever there's a will there's a way they also as a community have to challenge this where are the Muslim lawyers they are getting richer and richer but they're compromising their religion no devote some Community time for the sake of Allah and file lawsuits in the European Community Council in in your own country against such Injustice and do it for the sake of Allah if the Muslim lawyers collaborated on this wallahi they will turn it over so there are many ways but who am I to speak about it I'm here in in Arabia knowing nothing in alhamdulillah not suffering like they are suffering but I pray to Allah that he makes an a way out for them well like it's it makes my heart bleed to see the Muslims weak uh ununited and to see these disbelieving government and Authority not only control the Muslims but they control the masjids and telling them what to say and what not to say and not to to cross their lines and then say that's a democracy no no it's not democracy this is a lot of BS hello and I believe that we've come to the end of our journey tonight I pray to Allah that he makes all of us steadfast on Islam that Allah makes us increase in knowledge of his Quran and the Sunnah and to abide by them and I pray to Allah that he gives us the true Islamic identity that he's pleased with and that would makes us would make us among the chosen one with the grace of Allah"
