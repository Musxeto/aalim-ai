  "transcript": "Abrar from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh in my locality during the time of Maghrib they give siren instead of Adhan in many mosques so I wait to listen for the Adhan in distant places even though it is time for Iftar and ignore the sirens they give for Iftar time this siren if it is to indicate that the sun has set it's a bid'ah it's not part of Islam it's an innovation like in some countries they have a cannon and the cannon when it sets off it indicates to the people that it's time to have Iftar and this is an innovation we don't have this in Islam what is what's next maybe the bells will be ringing and tolling this is not part of our religion but if you're certain that the sun has set you can break your fast through any means whether it's a bell or a cannon or a siren or anyone shouting the sun has set this is time for Iftar you're not ordered to wait until the Adhan is called but this is the norm in Muslim in Islamic in our Islamic religion and Allah knows best"
