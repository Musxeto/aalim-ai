  "transcript": "is it permissible to put mascara on the eyebrows or on the eyelashes the answer is if people will not be watching you as a nun muharram if none muharram I'm not gonna see you or see your eyes the answer is yes it is permissible to wear mascara in the presence of muharram or in the presence of females now the question is does the mascara form a layer on the eyelashes so that the water can not reach the eyelashes or not so does it affect my Woodill I believe that it should not affect your widow because even if it consists a layer on your eyelashes it has the same effect on hair gel and in what we are allowed to wipe over the head hair of the head and the layer itself is so negligible so I believe insha'Allah it is no problem on a large nose"
