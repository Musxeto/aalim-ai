  "title": "Wedding cakes vs Birthday cakes & Ruling on selling Cakes - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "a Shias question regarding wedding cake now a wedding cake is something totally different why is a birthday cake Haram we've explained this before the break because this is imitating the West a cake for your weddings a cake for your child passing the exams a cake for your husband coming out of hospital after passing and having an operation that was successful all of these are permissible there is nothing wrong in that unless your husband is diabetic then stay away from cakes but to do these things this is not something that is being a celebration we are told not to have any for example if one wants to make a cake for an anniversary we say that this is not legit because anniversaries are not part of Islam birthdays are not part of Islam Mother's Day Labor's they Valentine or Halloween Thanksgiving Christmas though they do not have religious background but it is part of imitating the Kafar so contributing to facilitate such a sin would be sinful now for the cake maker for the bakery for the woman doing this if she doesn't know the occasion they have no problem someone calls and places an order for purush a chocolate cake she's okay prepare it deliver it charge for it hamdulillah but if someone says I have a birthday today and I want you to make me a cake you cannot do that but if you don't know the reason and no one tells you whether it is halal or Haram occasion the default is that it is a halal occasion there's nothing wrong in doing it"
