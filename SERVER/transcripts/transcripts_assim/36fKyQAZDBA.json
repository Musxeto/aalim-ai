  "transcript": "a sister says is it permissible for a woman to get her underarms and pubic hair removed by a woman at the saloon as for the armpit or the underarms hair this is acceptable because the area is not a definite aura for a woman to look at so for necessity for a need yeah this is applicable as in the case when a woman breastfeeds her child in front of another woman definitely something would show and this is not considered to be a heavy aura it is negligible and accepted between women themselves for anit as for the pubic hair it's an issue of dispute some schools of thought say that this is okay and others say no this is not okay at all unless there's a necessity there is a real need for it as in the case of a woman who's so fat cannot see her pubic area cannot remove herself or she is handicapped she cannot reach it she is unable to do it on her own or because the area needs treatment due to the the heavy growth of hair and that it cannot be removed in normal ways whatever if there's a real need a real need and a necessity then this becomes permissible as when a woman goes to a doctor a gynecologist to examine her and look at places no one is permitted to look at except her spouse but this is for necessity permissible same thing generally speaking going to do your brazilian bikini or or whatever this is not permissible at all it's haram it's forbidden it's a major sin and not only that the people usually go for laser treatment this laser treatment is permissible providing it is safe medically safe and allah azzawajal knows best you"
