  "transcript": "my teacher said when you don't remember allah allah will send you a kareem and one can have a thousand or more kareens piled up when one is away from allah what is as mentioned in the quran what your teacher said is totally bogus and you have to select teachers that teach you the right thing in islam not someone who is related to ghostbusters is a jinn and this jinn accompanies individuals till the day they die and the prophet sallam said each one of you has a kareem so the companion said to him even you prophet of allah and the prophet saw said even me however my kareem there are two translations for it either my paren has become a muslim so he does not order me except with good things or allah has sufficed me the evil of my query so he cannot order me to do anything haram or to say any bad things and whisper in my ears allah has granted me power over him for islam meaning that he embrace islam or for islam that i'm in safety from his evil deeds etc so the issue of having a thousand kareem due to lack of remembrance of allah is totally baseless you"
