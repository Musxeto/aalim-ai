  "transcript": "so I have a question about uh an ID that I read about the processor model so now uh throughout being like a water when people Allah was doing ablution on his mama so can a woman when we use the job and go out or going around a while can we just wipe over our headscars he said he was having to take it off and wipe over the hands or something okay so the question of Amina if I understood it correctly the prophet Allah sometimes used to wipe over his turban Romana or inama and whatever exposed from his head so he would wipe over his forelock and the rest of the turban and continue his Evolution his wudu so she's asking can women do the same in wiping over their hijab it's an issue issue of dispute some say that due to necessity this is permissible especially if we're talking about a public place where women are performing voodoo and they don't want to jeopardize exposing their hair in front of others say that this is not permissible because I when I want to perform mudum I cannot come and wipe over my headdress like this because this is not a turban okay you're wearing it on your head yes but it's not a turban see a turban is a head gear that is turned around the head and then it goes underneath the chin and tied to the back removing such a turban is burdensome to put it back again this is why the concession of sharia came to make it easy in the case of women who want to wipe over their hijab headscarf just because they're in public how would they wash their arms to the Elbow would they expose it in front of everybody else would they expose their faces in front of everybody else if they're able to cover that then they can from underneath their hijab do the same with their wiping their head without jeopardizing or exposing their hijab and Allah Knows Best"
