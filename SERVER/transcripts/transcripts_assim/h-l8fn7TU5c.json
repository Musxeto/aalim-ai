  "title": "The importance of dawah",
  "transcript": "he says that i heard a speaker say that giving dawah to non-muslims in europe is better than praying at the kaaba every single day is there evidence for this well hypothetically generally speaking this is correct but putting it in such a fashion maybe is not befitting praying in haram or in kaaba as if degrading it but generally speaking it is correct because dawa work when you call people to islam when you teach them about islam this is far better than voluntary fasting voluntary prayer umrah voluntary umrah even if it's in the haram because the benefit is widely spread and it benefits everyone else while praying and fasting voluntary prayers and fasting this only benefits me as an individual and that is why may allah have mercy on his soul used to say that i'd rather people spend their time teaching and learning knowledge rather than praying night prayer because when they pray night prayer they're benefiting themselves but when they learn and teach the knowledge of the quran and the sunnah they are benefiting others and that is why allah says that there is no one better in speech and rhetoric more there is no one better than that person who calls others to allah and by calling others to allah this this is a vast topic that can include um dawah can include learning and teaching and circles of knowledge and all types of calling to allah azzawajal"
