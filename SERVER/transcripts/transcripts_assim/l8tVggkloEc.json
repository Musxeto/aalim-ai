  "transcript": "uh asna from India so most of my classmates are part of the sect called Sunni they go to dargah by saying that those places are blessed as Makkah and the dead people in the Tomb are really close to Allah they say that they are not worshiping the dead person in the Tomb they're saying that they bring to Allah by the highness Baraka blessing of the dead person in the Tomb check my question is is it permissible to pray to Allah for something to get something by the Baraka of the dead person at home would that be shirk first of all going to dargas and dargas are a a cemetery or a shrine where the people have buried whom they think is a saint whom they think is a righteous person and this by itself is permissible to bury someone in a cemetery when this goes overboard and people start performing pilgrimage and visitations to that Shrine and they wipe the walls and they offer sacrifices and their light candles and they supplicate and maybe they offer fruits and food to the shrine and they think that they're doing a good deed this is a form of shirk and if they claim that they don't believe in shirk rather they're just simply asking Allah through the status and the importance of this saint to Allah azzawajal this is called tawasul and this is an innovation it's an innovation to ask Allah azzawajal through the importance of Saint so and so oh Allah I ask you that you cure my son oh Allah I ask you through the prophet Muhammad to do this and that this is not shirk rather it's in an innovation because no one has rights over Allah that we ask Allah through such rights as Imam evantemia has clearly stated and Allah Knows Best [Music] and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and the evening I will uh try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah"
