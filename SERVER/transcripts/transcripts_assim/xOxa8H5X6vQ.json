  "transcript": "Maru from Bangladesh he says how long should a person making dua or praying for a deceased remain next to his grave now there isn't anything prescribed for the time limit in the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam the only thing that we have is the request of amram nellis may allah be pleased with him when he was on his dying bed he said to his son after I die and you bury me stay close to my grave making duaa and asking Allah for forgiveness the amount of slaughtering a camel so how long will slaughtering and Campbell take a minute five minutes ten minutes this is the period that I'd like you to remain close to my grave there isn't any prescription that from this there isn't any recommendation from the Companions the general tendency the general instruction from the Prophet Allah so salam whenever he buried one of his companions he told those standing around the grave seek Allah's forgiveness for your brother and ask Allah to make him steadfast because now he's being questioned so simply it's an issue of minutes there isn't a time span for it that we can say Noah it's like ten minutes you have to leave or why it's less than half an hour you cannot leave there is no limited time for that and the sky is the limit for it inshallah"
