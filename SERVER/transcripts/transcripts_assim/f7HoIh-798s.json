  "transcript": "and again and again and again a lot of the people keep on asking about the competition of drawing the Prophet Salla Salah Salam picture in some a kafir country and we say that do not mention this do not circulate it do not highlight it do not give these imbecile kafir any weight because this is advocating it you're advertising it when you send some of the pictures when you send that they're doing this and that this is Haram so these people whoever they are with all what they want is attention they want publicity if you give them the platform by spreading it among the Muslims and the Muslim says can we kill them can we attack them can we do this is what they want they want to pull your leg so you would tarnish the reputation of Allah Islam and the Muslims and emphasize this negative idea that Islam calls for violence if you leave them ignore them it will die it will not get anyone sponsoring them it will die in its place and these people who initiated it and are working hard to make it something they will end up in the sewer of history they will go to the junkyard of history few years later no one would ever know their names and recognize them while the honour of the Prophet item is preserved whether you do it or not every single moment round the globe his name is mentioned in the even the event and in the Akama 24/7 round-the-clock saying ashhadu anna muhammadan rasul allah allahumma salli wa sallim ala Abdullah Saleh can I be in a Muhammad"
