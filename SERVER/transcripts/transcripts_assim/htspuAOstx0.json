  "title": "Are Shia who believe in 12 Imams Muslims? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "ask that if Shia who believe in 12 imams are they Muslims first of all we do not judge people by their affiliation so those who believe in the 12 imams among the or the IM and they're usually known as some call them and this is when referring to the f we don't paint them with the same brush until we listen to what takes them out of the fold of Islam someone just saying that I am from this cult or sect not necessarily he is a cfir most likely he is if he knows their beliefs so if they who believe in the 12 imams believe that they are better than the prophets and lower than the messengers as one of their Ayah said in his book he said that our imams are on a higher level than the prophets and below the messengers if they slunder mother AA whom Allah has exonerated her and purified her and stated clearly in the Quran that she's not sinful or she did not commit any sin or adulterous acts and they say no she is if they curse Abu Bakr Omar and the vast majority of of of companions we have no doubt that these are disbelievers we don't even sayam allum to them we don't eat the meat they slaughter we cannot marry from their women folk because they're not Muslims at all if they lay men they say nothing abouta or Bak uh uh and the likes they don't insult the Quran and say no there is a missing Surah stating that Ali is the khif as these ra do if they don't say this then we don't say that they're cfir and I hope this makes sense"
