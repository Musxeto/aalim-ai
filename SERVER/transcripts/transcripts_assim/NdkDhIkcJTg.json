  "transcript": "um if I tell someone something is halal or something Isam without asking like a sheh or doing research but I use my prior knowledge and then later on I found out that my fatwa was wrong I did not mean to like purposefully lie on Islam do I need to retake my shahada no of course not see the issue of retaking your shahada is done only only when you commit deliberately an act of kufur or shik and giving the wrong fatwa out of good willll and thinking that you're giving the right fatwa according to your knowledge to the best of your knowledge and finding out that you were wrong there is no kufur or sh in that none whatsoever"
