  "transcript": "foreign [Music] it's always nice to be here in Kuwait and to see beautiful faces over and over again some new some old and if you say that it's late I apologize but unfortunately the admins are acquainted with the people in Kuwait so they say if we tell them come and pray Alisha and you should start immediately after Asia there will only be 15 or 20 people so that's why we told you to pray in them in your hotel then we will bring you so that they would come on time this is very shameful I am a person that pride myself to be on time so whenever there's a workshop or a lecture if we say 10 o'clock tell him shall I begin even if there's only one person because he came on time he has to be rewarded not those late comers by rewarding them for 50 minutes waiting for them so I apologize it's not from me I'm ready since 10 o'clock in the morning today the moment they gave me a call I will come but this is a board of advice for all of us to honor our timings when people say after Madrid it doesn't mean before midnight like most us Arabs do okay it's 11 o'clock I told you aftermarket yes [Music] no we have to honor our times and words because this is what identifies us as Muslims not a long beard or a short soul so without delaying you furthermore what is the title perhaps of shaytan the topic of shaytan is very very very long it has so many branches and I can spend literally with you until future talking about shaytan how is one of my best buddies he's been with me since I was born and he's still with me until I die so you have to know him inside out otherwise you will lose Allah says in the Quran surely shaytan isn't any need to you so take him as an enemy treat him as an enemy he only invites his husband his followers his party that they may become the Dwellers of the Blazing fire what is his ability nothing physical he has no control over him he only what invites and it's only your fault when you answer and respond you don't blame anyone oh I couldn't do anything these thoughts inclusive thoughts I am weak I have the other you and how do I know I've been doing counseling for these people for the past few years now it's like yummy kids play for me two minutes I know your problem I tell you before you continue and the guy says how do you know I said I have seen 50 people like you in the past week but I'm not a magician I'm not a sorcerer I'm doing that and I'm not a psychiatrist and simply an eye-opener and this is what we need to identify and this is what Allah is telling us he is telling us and warning us about shaytan what is he doing calling you to be part of his followers why to dwell and help fire with him simple as something this is his mission and vision so if he is our enemy as Allah tells us in the Quran how can we protect ourselves from him knowledge is not sufficient and enough how many of us who are sick and we know our illnesses and we know the diet we should follow and the medication we should take in order to get healed if we don't follow this will we ever be healed never so most of us knows these traps are shaman some of us is even yeah professional he can write them down to you yeah number one number five number 20 and beware of this and if you take that right uh turn you may do this if you take the left turn this might happen but they themselves are the victims of shaytan so in order to expand our knowledge a little bit refresh it though everything I'm gonna say you know alhamdulillah what is straight line what is the definition of shaytan I was in India in 2003. on a business trip and they allocated a driver for me to take me in Delhi the driver's name was shaytan this is I just remembered this no he wasn't my driver but I was I was shocked why would anybody called all right anyway so what is shaytman first of all we have idlis everybody knows Japanese and we have Jin and we have shayapin plural singular is shaytan so what is ibiz as most Scholars say is the father of the Jinn foreign [Music] that you left the whole lecture now you want us to talk about technicalities Let It Go so in the Quran Surah Allah says do you follow him and his offspring do you follow Idris and his offspring who's telling us that he is the father of the Jinn Allah okay they were created from fire Angels were created from light you know that the humans were created from clay from month from soil whatever so he had offsprings the offsprings are called Jimmy those who were deviant or corrupt or sinful or disbelievers are called shaytan and there are believers there are righteous Jinn that they are not called shaytan and they eat they be mate they ride they live their own life like we do but in a way we cannot see Allah mentions in Surah a bliss and his tribe they see you from where you cannot see them so whenever someone especially your wife or your mother-in-law or your grandmother comes and says I showed the house something moving it must be a journey you can see so always tell them and comfort them Allah says you cannot see them in their true form yes if you see a cat if you see a dog yeah they can they can take phones but relieve yourself from these worries oh I saw a shadow I saw something that's black some it's not it's your imagination and the prophet told us that each and every one of us has a companion from the gym it's called means associate so the companion said even you o prophet of Allah he said even I however Allah gave me Support over him the word has two meanings one that I am safe from his Whispers he cannot Whisper In My Head the other meaning of Pakistan that he accepted Islam so now he's not a devil anymore he's a good righteous companion so this parine of us the prophet told us that he runs in our veins like the blood so he's always associated with us to the extent that he eats and drinks and even mates when we do all of this imagine lots of the brothers and brothers I don't see this is lots of the brothers when they attend my lectures Unfortunately they use their left hand and drink I see them I cannot say so I pretend that and the brothers say everybody's looking now who's thinking yeah hey leave this alone leave the wife of Satan alone don't focus on things that don't require focusing focus on what's required to be focused upon the prophet told us also if you eat or drink with your left huh shaytan is eating and speaking with you if you don't say Bismillah before consuming food or drinks the shaytan eats and drinks with you to making him healthy and happy and full if you made your spouse and you don't say Bismillah Allah every time yes every time you have to do this otherwise he will meet with you Miami protect us all he's so with us that when we go to the house open the door hello honey I'm home close the door and don't say Bismillah he will come with his tribe and he will say come come we have a place to spend the night in so he comes in of course if you have Netflix definitely he's gonna have a good time as well because he can watch with you and he's gonna listen to Haram and watch Haram and Masha Allah this will become his permanent residence zip code [Music] the prophet told us that when you go to bed and you're asleep the shaytan sleeps at your nostrils this is why the first thing you do when you wake up you blow your nose three times you wash your hands three times because you don't play with your hands where when you are asleep you are not mindful the prophet tells us um that Satan the devil even urinates in your ear lier what is this you know first time I did these things urinate the most impure thing in Satan who is already include himself will go into your inner ear why because you overslept and the scholars are have different opinion did he oversleep the hydrogen and wizard or did he oversleep Fajr until the sun was risen let's take the lenient opinion how many of us sleeps until it's six o'clock and the filter is already and the Sun is already Shining I have work at seven if I wake up at 4 and pray I can't go back to sleep okay so you want your payroll or you want gender I have to pay the rent pass this answers my question thank you I rest my case you have a problem the prophet tells us when he was told this was a man who did not create Fajr until it was morning he said this is a man urinated in his ear may Allah protect us and the prophet told us and this will happen after 10 minutes when you're bored from my nature do you feel I'm not hypnotizing you like people no no that's it so after 10 minutes you would fall asleep and your eyes would be heavy and what will happen lots of you start to yawn the prophet said that is some when you yawn shaytan is happy so lock it to the best of your ability if you can't block it put your hand because shaytan will enter from your mouth like you know Lions open their mouths like this in flies come in mosquitoes and come and the guy is just yawning what are you doing you have to put your hands after to educate and to save yourself from shaytan from entering and there is a designated not driver a designated shaytan who whose job is only to disturb you when you pray his name is I don't know if I should say the name because then I'm afraid someone will call his son to be oh this is my newborn his name is is the name of the devil his job is my heart correctly or not I saw a sign saying this is for the Imam but I embarked inside so is this my pocket or it's in the car who's doing this prison this is his job so your prayer is over and what did the Imam recite so many people are asking online people sometimes they're really sleepy prayer I finish and I go to one of my you know congregations I was just praying he says I said what did the Imam reside in the first attack [Music] told us that at least pledged comes the law that he will deviate the humans he will come from in front of them from their back from their right from their left from whatever side possible why to deviate them so that they would be with him in Hell Fire so whenever you want to do righteous things who's blocking you not the guy who part in the imam's place no that we will deal with them afterwards who's blocking you this is his job to block you from entering Jannah and to get you with him through invitation through calling you to Hellfire so Allah tells us in the Quran do not follow the steps of shaytan the shaytan have steps yes shaytan never comes to you all of a sudden he uses his ways and strategy little by little the main Gates or tools of shaytan are two heart and shahawat are doubtful things that confuse you things that cast hesitation and reluctancy in accepting the truth deals with desires and lust with sins so when you come to the category of support this is the most dangerous way of tempting humans and if you were to say that this is what Iblis did with our father Adam we wouldn't be far from the truth did he use or shahawat with Adam he used his doubts he told him Allah told you not to eat from The Forbidden tree why so that he would not become a more immortal so that you would not live forever so if you eat from it you will live forever so he casted this down in Adam's self peace be upon it so he sinned and ate from The Forbidden things and Allah forgave him and made him come to earth now what does shaytan Love More doubtful things or sins six [Music] six doubtful things it's an issue of the spirit among Scholars he discovered here regularly logically you know it's not sense what's more we love to shape on are the doubts because since every single one of us commits the sin while knowing [Music] pray for me Allah forgives me but go to the people of innovation go to the people of doubts when you tell them what are you doing sir getting closer to Allah but this is an innovation this is no this is something getting me closer to Allah they think that they're doing the right thing so give us a clue on what these doubts might be it's a as I said it's a very big chapter it will take us ages to speak about but among these doubts doubts about Allah doubts about the Quran and now nowadays this is what the people are working hard to do to confuse you is most people you speak to them he said how do I know that is maybe Israeli needs are there maybe some of the Lions put some Hadith maybe this may be that so what do you want he said oh the Sunnah is rejected I believe only in the Quran don't you hear this a lot now a lot of the people are saying this this mountain so half of the religion is gone and they say we only abide by the Quran actually do you know Arabic no do you memorize anything of the Quran and know that I've seen no what do you mean I Abigail you are an ignorant imbecile you have zero knowledge if I tell you I'll ask you anything about Hajj or zakat or transactions you say I don't know and now you're making yourself telling me that the Sunnah is corrupting this these These are part of he comes to you why are men allowed to marry for women and women are only allowed to marry one man one if his inheritance half for women the sister while the son gets a full shed why is this why is that all of this are what doubts and they aren't of two types some that are intrusive thoughts that touch as the captains in the pilots say touch and go they don't settle they just touched into you and you move on Cuts is gone but some of the doubts are settling down they marinate in your head and every day they become more and more dangerous the need to be clarified you go to the chef assalamualaikum I have this doubt one two three four five and the Sheikh with his knowledge with answering if he doesn't he will blow you up with a bomb of course not but this is what prevents people from coming come forward you're not going to confuse this because the Sheikh has met thousands like you and probably before even competing the question he already knows your question is gonna answer it for you with the grace of Allah it's not a surgeon savior he doesn't have a crystal ball yeah I've seen you coming no he will be with the grace of Allah and the experience bestowed upon him from Allah these are some of the doubts now Innovation are some of the doubtful things I believe that doing this and that is good it's getting me closer to Allah the religion he has doubts after finishing the Salata putting my hand over my head where are you flying I said no I have to do this I blow all my fingers and and wash my eyes I open my shirt and not your trousers and I blow inside what are you doing where is this coming from well I've seen my father my grandfather my uncle these are all from the doubts that you uh following because these are innovated you are changing the religion among the doubts the many doubts that a lot of people's lives are being destroyed because of doubts in exaggeration in overthinking and this happens when shaytan cannot hunt you down incense why people are divided into two types Muslims people who are the negligent ignorant don't care about Salah don't care about purity not just they don't care money coming from River I'll take it bring it on all what they care about is their sins their desires their lusts foreign [Music] what about going to the nightclub tonight I have a bottle of whiskey let's get wasted you want to try some pot we get high so this is all what they think about and the vast majority of Muslims are like this all what they care about is their desires their sins spending six hours a day sitting on the lazy chair watching TV watching movie some of them watch pornography some of them watch Haram stuff just waste it this is part one part two are those who are very keen on Islam they love Allah very ridiculous when it comes to prayer they uh fear is the strongest or not should I wash the whole mattress or the whole house because I'm afraid of najasa should I burn the house they get Whispers of shaytan how shaytan tried to take him to the nightclub they said I cannot I feel alone so okay you feel alone I'll show you he exaggerates this he makes them overthink so a small grain of sand very into this it goes he makes it in the head as big as old mountain what if this happened what if my father smiled when I was saying something that I thought it was covered and my father smiled this means that his marriage contract with my mother is invalid this means I was born out of Whitlock this means that he must not see me what are you doing well I have one I sit with people like this on counseling sessions and it leads my heart and sometimes I'm so rude with them my wife says what are you doing here why are you talking like this I talked to are you stupid and because of all lies yeah he cries so I have to Bang Bang smash his face right left and center and the guy says [Music] they are so sick to the bones because of what overthinking exaggeration people come here I wash the toilet seat and the sink and the Hamptons and the shower and the floor and the walls of the toilet every time I want to urinate it takes me 45 minutes to do it what are you doing this is how shaytan destroys your life don't laugh each and everyone may have this Allah saved us because it's intrusive it comes and goes we don't pay attention to it those who are not as lucky those who do not have the knowledge they fall into depression because of these things and some of them come to me and believe me I'm talking about 15 sessions of half an hour each 15 one five playing crying weeping why not I divorced okay what did you say I said this is not this is not a divorcement but I think I said thinking is not divorce but I may have this is not true this is not the divorce yeah I cannot get married yet but why well I'm not joking that I'm telling you this something is happening with me you're not married yet and you're coming and crying and reading says because I will get married and I love my wife I don't want to divorce it to me did not marry her yet and you're still happy this was worse please please I'll I'll do anything for you but with constant treatment they say who was happy all the time who is crafting all the time if you look at him he said I didn't do anything I just called him and he came that's it so whose mistake is it shows and if you go a little bit further it was fast you know what's his biggest two squash is I have hundreds of dollars I was eating the other day some Biryani and then my mother brought me some sweet corn and then I thought I was coming because one of Allah's names so while I was eating I started thinking and I lost it what is this so many intrusive thoughts so I was laying out again and in this game there is a God of War so I said to myself and since I stopped playing I see the shahada 50 times a day and make five times awesome to Angel is now and now I've lost my seat in the medical college and now I'm jobless I'm sitting home I've lost 50 kg from my weight I'm dying these are people that are alive and between us one second thumbs up he said you're doing a good job this is all because of shuku had and you don't mind you need to go to a psychiatrist what will that can say countries give you and to the present some uh Senators some electric shocks it will not help you what will help you open your eyes identify who your enemies so every time one of the brothers comes to say sure I have these inducing thoughts and says stop what should you do he said ignore them what should he do what should he do foreign [Music] for example I always give this example if I hear after you finish why not if I was in southern in my hometown after I finished my session will be cycle I will let them be sacrifices so after I finish why not take closer where they come drive one hour from my home to Market in one hour in 10 minutes shave your head drive one hour back to home three hours and 15 minutes you've completed the amount so I said hey excuse me hello who's talking to me what will the answer be sure telling me to go to my people I love this street but I was looking crazy who's talking to me nobody's answering am I that ambiguous oh and then you guys need counseling the prophet said [Music] two only Whispers in your ears angel or the devil the whispering of the Angel is to believe in the truth and promises you goodness and the whispering object is to falsify the truth and promises you with evil so this triangle bar so it's telling me to make an umbra and come back in three hours and a half he's an ancient he's telling me to do something good but if it's someone telling me to listen to a musical concert or to go and watch a movie or to sleep late and Skip five years every day you pray if I should come on give me a break every day call us tomorrow they can often who's this talking to me dangerous who is it if you identify who's whispering in your ears because you say it you don't need any treatment because you know your enemy and your enemy is not advising you to do something good he's telling you to divorce is telling you to make sure to go for Allah he wants to disturb me and confusion and this is why we are told not to sit with people of innovation of people of doubts sometimes people are fond of watching debates [Music] not knowing that watching debates hardens your heart and throws in your heart a doubt that you may not be able to take it out because the Sheikh the debater is not going to answer each and every single doubt he will answer maybe five out of 10. and the rest there's not enough time so do not listen to the people of elevation or to the people of uh doubtful things because this would only drive you further away from Allah what about uh over the time is trying to feel fine the second door so how about our sins lustful things so if you look at the CV of Satan how many pages these active since Adam is people so he knows all types of people and his CV is really thick and Rich and he knows exactly how to tackle you some of us he comes through money I'm very uh uh alhamdulillah unused when it comes to money I don't care about my own but I may care about faith now you're killing me some people don't care about things the demand money I want Mansions I want cars I want some people would want women don't quite care about finance and and Faith do they just want women others want off straight other want this and that so he comes and Tackle you when you are most vulnerable what is your weakness and this is why his main objective is one thing corrupt the heart how do I corrupt the heart why would I drop the heart because this is what Allah looks at Allah doesn't look how tall you are or how short Allah doesn't look at your bank account Allah looks at your deeds and at your heart how is your heart if your heart is corrupted with illnesses such as anger one of the biggest sins one could have is anger all of us have this anger my anger towards you is little why because you can beat me up I'm an old man but my anger towards my wife is at the most how dare can say such things I would have used her physically I will abuse it a verbally I will send her to my father I will do this I will insult her and I lash my anger at my wife at my children at my subordinates some of the nice bosses CEOs Financial officers martial law very high positions you see them in the society very good people look at them at work they insult the janitor the coffee boy their subordinates this and that they're very hardship they become very angry and anyone who worked in the corporate notes you write an email let it marinate for five hours and check it back again edit it and let it marinate for two hours and check it back next day and then you'll find that the two pages email are summarized in one very polite very nice because with anger shaytan takes control of you like children could take control of football they play in toss it left right and among his many ways of corruption is to substitute so whenever angels are present the Devils can come but if you kick out the Angels who will substitute so if your house is filled with TVs music musical instruments statues portraits of my parents small little ducks made of of crystals uh an elephant these pyramids the Pharaohs beautiful nice artifacts very nice people like yes very nice you don't have any angels in the home you have only devils and the Devils will corrupt you and your children and your wife maybe not now on the long run you will see the impact you will see that the pressure you will see the anxiety the panic attacks that people are competing what is happening here we pray we fast we're righteousness this is what's happening is all over the place this is why the prophet ordered us Islam to take out statues portraits and dogs I'm shocked in my country I'm shocked with the youth dragging dogs in front of them in the streets boasting about it as if it's something Halal and here I've seen this but not as much maybe because we have more people people are walking their dogs don't they know that having a dog in your house takes one carat of Good Deeds every single day how much do you have every day [Music] get a greyhound some of them have a chihuahua assistance and I have this dog that I'm so attached to I don't know what to do make hot dogs she she was shocked about this answer but this is at the end of the day get rid of them I can tell you oh you love the dog the poor thing no keep it no this is Islam neither you do it or you end up in Hellfire me a lot of detectors so um there's so many things and the times but if you were to look at what anger does to you what energy a lot of us are envious that he this guy came three years ago I've been here for 20 years and I'm not able to do this and look at him for years now he has money he has built two buildings back home and he's buying a new car every what is this and we have hatred we have anger we have a lot of grudges against one another this whole is the handicraft of shaytan destroying our hearts corrupting our hearts so I won't go into many of the material here I'll just stop briefly about the steps of shaytan now when we sing steps of shaytan shaytan takes steps with one objective to get you on board and hellfire simple as that how does he do that he has all the time in the world if I wanted to go into business transaction with you I'd like you to materialize the night and tomorrow we will start the day after we will make profit if you tell me okay let's have the meeting next month I'm going to look for sometimes we are Hasting to do things quickly shaytan take your time as long as you're gonna form to sin I'm not in a rush take a year take two years and this is why if shaytan comes to me says awesome there is this beautiful woman she's a bombshell her father was a terrorist that's why she's a mom she's so beautiful and she's gorgeous and so and so why don't you have an affair what would I say people think what would I say you're crazy after all these years you think I'm gonna fall to that simple uh seduction get the heck out of here what does he do okay I have all the time in the world your WhatsApp a notification someone sends me an inappropriate joke of a politician female joke she did a little bit inappropriate more a little bit more a clip of an axis and then a short video Tick Tock about someone doing this and I find that my seating of Haram and prohibition and being careful is being lower the body is lower the body is lower and then he said Johanna the movie XYZ and people Allah he come to me and says and people with peace I was in London once and the brother said didn't you see the movie so and so you crazy who do you think I am so I don't know but you know these things are here comment I thought that you may have seen so he says this movie watch your chair he said I don't watch movies there is no women in here this movie is good no women says okay no women I can watch it any music I can mute it so it's putting my legs little by little by little by little and I find that the body is way down until you get a chance to meet a woman which is a Christian and she is interested in Islam so maybe you sit with her for 15 minutes have coffee um okay why are you coughing Dylan that's waterproofing you it's longer I am all for a stand and a few meetings and after that my place are yours what's the chef I'm doing good job thank you how long did it take it's months eight months but you were marinate it well you can as we plant this is the meaning of steps of shaytan and every one of us has a certain strategy of shaytan working on him it might be very negligible this is what shaytan wants that you do the negligible things and they will become bigger and bigger and bigger until it destroys your life so how does shaytan work Scholars say that he has seven steps number one the most important on his priority is if he does this he has hit the jackpot what is that ship gopher atheism getting out of the holders now anyway he can do this then he has succeeded why because this is the ultimate sin as they call it in Christianity the cardinal sin alas if you do it you go to hell forever so this is what he wants he focuses on this and this is what he's calling all the people imagine chapter 14. Surat Ibrahim verse 22 Allah tells us that the inhabitants of Hellfire go to shaytan to Elise and they blame him all of them are complaining it is because of you that we are here in Hell For Eternity you do all our trouble what does shaytan say Allah says gives him a speech he says Allah has promised you the truth and fulfilled his thoughts I promised you and betrayed you I had no power over you except that I called you and you responded and answered so don't blame me rather blame yourselves I'm not gonna benefit you you're not gonna benefit me I will do that this is what Allah tells us in the Quran about the speech you'll find exactly this fitting as in love this is what he's doing to you but unfortunately in the midst of all our work problems our life our families our habits our Hobbies our desires we can't see it's a lot of fog in front of our eyes we need a dear friend a close relative to grab us from the neck and shaking us wake up you're doing this and this and this and rarely we will find someone to give us a proper advice unfortunately and if there is someone to give us a proper advice we would mind your own business look at yourself your fingernails are too long don't give me advice what do Michael Nails have to do is you're not following decision as well so Don't Preach you're this you're dead this is how shaytan works so firstly shaytan wants to catch you at his ship go for this relief anything that takes you out of the holdup Islam if he fails because you have a lot of talking and you have to hate Burns all these doubts away he goes a degree lower try to catch you in the innovation why because Vida changes the religion Allah says in the Quran today I have completed your religion perfected it and accepted Islam to be your religion especially an innovator comes and says I know there's something missing let's introduce the moment oh there's something missing let's introduce let's introduce things as a god of different things blah blah blah blah so he's saying that the religion is not complete the religion is not perfect when you see people coming to pray on a piece of wood or a piece of stone what is this this is part of the religion did the prophet of his companions ever do such a thing says no but you know what what will stop the religions complete this is nothing permission so he wants to get you in the level of beta where you change the religion when you add or subtract delete from it and this would help him a lot on the long run if you have Sunnah after hate no ship you have Sunnah meaning [Music] [Music] he goes to step number three that is major sins okay let's go and what is the definition of major sins are they seven even Abbas was asked are the majors said since seven said no they are closer to 70. so major scents are every sin that Allah cursed the one who doesn't or threatening him with Hellfire or to kick him out of his Mercy or with a prescribed punishment in this life chopping your hand vlogging um whatever so these are the major sins so how many of us are indulging in major sense a lot we are done in major sets but people think that they're isolated in cinnamon drinking wine killing stealing that's it what about backbiting I thought it was okay to just gossip and teach us what about slandering what about uh Envy what about cheating what about consuming River what about lying in uh in invoices or in contracts what about being bribed and the list goes on and on and on what about cheating your own wife by taking her savings building a new house in your name and then marrying someone else and I have stories like crazy about this alhamdulillah and all of these are sinful things and you are punished by a mind and fire for it so avoid this so if you have the heat no shame you have Sunnah no bigger you have fear of Allah righteousness piety then there are no major sins what will SRI Khan do minor sins so anything that's minor we think okay Salah to Salah Ramadan to Ramadan erases so anything that is let's do it smoking vaping and he says what are you doing this is wrong this is sinful don't look at the size of the sin look at who you are sinning against this is what we feel we have failed to upbring our children upon no no no [Music] we fail to instill in them to put in them that allow his watch so it's me nobody's watching they don't have any problem if we managed putting them the fear of Allah remembering that day of judgment and the things like that there will be a good time to shout so these minus things Allah says that the prophet says be careful of these negligible sins because there will be someone from Allah calling for they collected these minor sins upon a servant of Allah until they destroy him minor senses it's exactly the prophet says how you cook Bread on small chips and twigs of wood how would you build the fire if you bring the big log and you try to light it will it work you have to bring small twigs and small branches very little little these are the minor sins so if you have guidance from Allah you avoid you avoid better you're avoid a major you avoid minor he comes to you from disliked things you're doing well he comes to maku so you have no problem in entering the message with your left foot he went up with your left foot is it no it's not harmed us it's macro it's something that Allah does not like it's because it's okay you did not pray the Sunnah you should watch it why are you fighting with me I'm talking to you as a brother don't bring this up so he keeps on letting you let go a lot of the sun and a lot of them feel a lot of the voluntary things and falling into a lot of them dislike things does not like them this is that you're going inevitably soon to do something harder this is his steps and if a person is doing the hate abiding by the sun avoids major and minor sins and also avoids makuhat what will he do this guy is a big Power so but he doesn't do any of these things what is he going to do he comes to you from one of his very delicate steps it's called [Music] what's that it's in your selection between two good things rewarding and less rewarding both of them are Good Deeds he says you don't do the more reward you do the lesser one so on the 27th of Ramadan it's time for karawih it might be possibility the reward is unmatched he says no no don't pray with them I don't know I can make it any time of the day this is the only time I can gain this great reward or tell you better more leave the Haram and go and visit your uncle he lives in in 1080. go and visit him this is connecting your kitchen but one is way higher he's telling you don't do the higher do the lower because eventually I will drag your feet little by that this is number one number six the final one final step none of us alhamdulillah why because we can't reach that level imagine us mashallah securing all six and the only remaining one is the seventh don't for you don't worry we are not smart what is it yeah we didn't come all the way to get sick and forget about the seventh we came for the seventh we just want you know what it is it's called [Music] um the permissible things come on this is too much I think you're a mixed things are you happy maybe what is it if you are into heat foreign [Music] in selecting what is more rewarding from what's not if you're doing all these things his way of dragging your feet is by making you expand in things how your tummy your stomach is this much eat one Biryani garlic like this and it's like that like this and like that is it hard no but eight much you become full much you will not pray as much and little by little and I've seen this in my own family my children know restaurants I've never heard of [Music] and they give names and prices and many use what are you guys doing so now we you're listening 30 or 40 restaurants that have never ever heard of Miss along good way into but this is how he tackles the good people engage in halal things so what's the ruling on watching uh Pikachu Cricket that recently dressed there are no women don't use it and a bunch of guys running after one I think I know it's not my job to judge them but yeah there's no problem watching it one says I spent six hours watching me today what are you doing I watch it and I go to pray and I come back and watch it step one Next Step he's going to this is according to plan some people spend their time like our homies in gender they go on Thursday night they come back Friday and Saturday night two nights doing what fishing they go to the Sea the same nights 48 Hours what are you doing and the funny thing is most of them at the end of their trip they go to the fish market and fill their ice box they buy it from this Allah but they spent 48 Hours some people go hunting five days I'm being you know Halal yes hello but what will it lead they lost to man they lost Jamaica they've lost a lot of things and this is what shaytan is setting them and preparing them to do these are the seven steps that the scholars mentioned how he and shaytan manages to catch us now each and everyone needs to analyze himself if there isn't anyone would come to you say okay after this lecture let's check the boxes in your life nobody's gonna do this so if you were to benefit you will do this exercise with yourself where am I a lot of us would say that oops we have big problems I have big problems shaytan has managed to do what Russia has done in Ukraine conquered a lot of land and territory what to do then you have to fix it yourself with Allah assumption go back to the Quran soon try to get advice from your local demon try to get advice from your friends those who come to the ask them as a third person don't say I do this I do this I do this and you know me leave it not don't tell them expose yourself but try your Limitless to rectify Yourself clean your heart well why this is the most difficult part when you find your heart so bad so corrupt and people don't see this by the way they see the sheikhs long being and the short soul but they don't know what the ship is capable of doing when he hates someone how he plots how he fixes things how he goes in a backbite how he makes problems to others and then he goes to bed and sleep how can you sleep when you know that you will sleep in your grave and Allah will hold you accountable for everything this is when you have to come up with a solution and I apologize for taking too long but as I said the subject takes much much longer than this but I hope you shall love those who did not sleep would have benefited those who had slept and you shall they will have a good night tonight [Music]"
