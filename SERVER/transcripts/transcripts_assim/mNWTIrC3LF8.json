  "transcript": "my question is if an Imam does any mistake like stand mistakenly after fourth raaka but I did not do the mistake should I perform the sh is the please answer in two scenarios if I was from the beginning of the jam or I joined the jam late after some what if the IM makes a mistake and you are not aware of it or you did not do it and he offers and you're with him from the beginning you have to follow him so for example the Imam um let's say sits after the first suud thinking that it is tah time and he does not perform the second sujud so you guys say Subhan Allah Subhan Allah so he goes for the second sujud and you prostrate with him you did everything right you didn't make a mistake he made the mistake yet he's supposed to offer before the Salam and you have to comply with him if his Su is before the Salam and you've already missed one or more ra then definitely before offering Salam he's going to prostrate forah you have to follow him but if you missed one of or more ra and his Salam is after the Salam once he offers the Salam you stand up to complete okay now he's offering what should I do complete your prayer normally if you didn't do the mistake with him or you would not you were not witnessing the mistake the mistake happened in the first raak which you missed you didn't notice it so you don't offer but if you witnessed it with him then you offer it as well after you conclude your your prayer and Allah Knows Best"
