  "transcript": "there is a medicine that is prescribed to cure cancer or they say it's likely to cure cancer and this medication contains 50 milliliters of wine as ingredient in this medicine along with others are we allowed to take that medicine please advise first of all it is not permissible for a Muslim to consume wine in any sort or fashion now remember there is a difference between the presence of alcohol and between wine as an intoxicant the prophet alayhi salat wa salam was asked about using wine as medicine and he prohibited it and he said that this is an illness by itself rather than being a medication so this is not permissible it is not permissible to use not even one drop of wine as a medication even if it does not intoxicate you so maybe I would take a glass full of medicine with a dropper to of wine this is prohibited with alcohol is different because alcohol is a substance if consumed as it is it will kill you it will burn your guts so if added to medication then we have to look at the end result whether there is an alternative for taking it or not if there is an alternative for another type of medicine without alcohol then this is what we must take rather than that if there is no other alternative we have to look into is it intoxicant or not if they say it is intoxicating then it becomes the same as wine you must not take it or consume it if they say no it's not intoxicated the percentage is so little that even if you drink a lot of it it would not intoxicate you then this becomes Hallett so the wine itself the ingredient itself is totally prohibited to be used in medication if you put wine in chocolates even if you take ten or twenty pieces you will probably become diabetic but this doesn't intoxicate you it is still Haram to consume even one and Allah knows best"
