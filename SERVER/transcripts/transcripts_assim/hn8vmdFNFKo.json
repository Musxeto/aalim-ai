  "transcript": "Areeba from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu In Salah, I accidentally said Sami Allah, which is usually with Ayn. I said it as Sami Allah with Ya when rising up from the Ruku. I did realize it in prayer after I rose up from Ruku, but since it was a mistake in recitation, I did not perform Sajda-e-Sahoo and I did not know if I should repeat the Salah for it. So does it invalidate my Salah and do I have to repeat it? Saying Sami Allahu liman Hamidah is one of the obligatory acts of Salat. It's like saying Allahu Akbar to move from one pillar to the other. And Sami Allahu liman Hamidah is the movement said when we're rising from Ruku. If you mispronounced it and said Sami Allahu instead of Sami A, deliberately, while you're capable of saying it, you should have rectified it. The moment you stood up and you realize it's wrong, you should have said it again, Sami Allahu liman Hamidah. Because you did not do so and you continued, you should have compensated such a mistake by offering two Sujood-e-Sahoo before Salam. If you concluded the prayer altogether because you did not know the ruling, I pray that the prayer is valid, but next time do not do such a thing and Allah knows best."
