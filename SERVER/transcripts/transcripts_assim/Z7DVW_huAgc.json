  "title": "Will the 2 Angels STILL Question Us if we recite Surah Mulk before going to Bed? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "brother muhammad from the u.s i want you to know about the surah moon and as we know that when a person is placed in the grave then the two angels come to ask the question but as we read that uh whoever decides to remove every night he will not be questioned and the great but my question is so if there are questions at all so what happens after their they are putting their way uh what is brother muhammad to my recollection the hadith states that whoever recites surat al-mulk every night he would not be tormented in the grave not he would not be questioned the questioning is happening it's going to happen and this is not related to suratul mulk suratul milk only refers to not being tormented and not being tormented providing that there are no other obstacles that would block this surah from saving you from such torment so i think this clarifies the doubt the questioning by the two angels in the grave are uh is inevitable it's going to happen whether you recite suratul mulk or you do not you"
