  "transcript": "strengthening one's iman she's asking how do we drive away she says what's worse this is whispering i think she's especially speaking about the prayer how do you go about removing this unfortunately this is not a very easy topic to tackle in in this program because it's a very long process that includes abandoning sin and the more sin you have the easier for the devils and satan to penetrate your concentration and to control you it has to do with performing forms of worship on time and the more you delay prayers or you do not pray them in the masjid if you're a male or you have lots of short comings regarding uh forms of worship then the more the control they have on you it's quite helpful for a muslim to concentrate on what he's reciting so if you contemplate on the verses of the quran you're reciting when you bow when you say subhana rabbil and you think what you are talking about you start to imagine the great creatures of allah the almighty and allah created created them so you start to praise allah and to imagine his greatness when you prostrate likewise the almighty created all these universes and all of this for us to worship him so this tends to reduce the amount of whispering of the devil the swash in a person but again this is not a very easy thing to do you have to concentrate you have to contemplate you have to supplicate to the allah almighty to help you and to prevent these whispering from coming to you and with the grace of allah allah will answer your prayers"
