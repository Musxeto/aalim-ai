  "transcript": "from nigeria his friend got sick and he asked him not to tell his mom and his mom called asking why is my son not picking up the phone so he said that he's okay but he ate something and he doesn't feel well and i did not say the truth that he was sick or was hospitalized have i done a white lie there is no white or black lie eli is a lie but if you dodge the question by giving ambiguous answers that can have both ways there's no problem in that so if you said alhamdulillah he's fine in the sense that mentally he's fine physically he's not when you say that he wasn't feeling well and you meant that he was sick but you gave the impression that he wasn't that sick then this is permissible inshallah sinful for that muhammad"
