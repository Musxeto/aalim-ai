  "transcript": "is it true that the Saab was never used to look at men who shaved their face in fear that they would have desire for them who miss aha does the Sahaba okay is it true that the sahabas never looked at men who shaved their face in fear that they would have desire for them no I heard this from some other person on YouTube okay I said Olaf in Canada he says is there any narration that the companions may allah be pleased with them would not look at men who shave their faces for the fear of being tempted or they did desire them okay this is not with all due respect San Francisco this is Mecca and Medina we don't have any gays or homos or any of these weird things the companions were the best of men they were righteous true men and at their times no one would shave because this is this was totally out of the question the only people who used to say shave were the Byzantines the Romans the Persians the disbelievers Muslims and non Muslim Arabs used to have beards so this is part of the religion and to claim that they were tempted by boys or men who shaved their beard this is outrageous and preposterous no one had ever said such a thing yes you may find in centuries later that some of the scholars used to warn people from shaving by saying that maybe a pervert would be tempted and maybe desire you because of your shaving thinking that you look like a female this is out of the question this is not true a sick person is a sick person whether you have a beard or you're clean-shaven this is going to happen so what you've heard yes Allah is totally out of the question"
