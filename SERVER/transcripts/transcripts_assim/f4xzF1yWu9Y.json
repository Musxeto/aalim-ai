  "title": "If everything good or bad is from Allah Why did Ayyub attribute his illness to satan assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "yeah how are you doing I'm doing great alhamdulillah my question is um I was I came across a verse in it said that um about so my question was um we know that everything good or evil or any disease or any Affliction that comes is from Allah so in this verse it specifically Alam specifically said that I've been touched by adversity from Shan so I just wanted some clarity on this like how do I combine these things like every good and bad comes from Allah so Alam said I've been touched by adversity from Shan so can you help me with we acknowledge that Allah is the creator of everything whether good or evil subhah wa tala there's no other Creator than Allah but we do not attribute pure evil to Allah as in the meaning it's not attributed to you pure evil but things have evil and have good in them now having said that and acknowledging that Allah is the creator of all no one in his right mind would not attribute evil to the one who does it so if someone comes and kills your loved one kills your brother may Allah forbid would you say Allah killed my brother or the as salant this criminal killed my brother you tell me of course you would say this perpetrator did his crime and likewise if someone smacks your car you would say that this driver smacked my car so you attribute it to him but we acknowledge that the creator of everything in this universe is Allah the almighty by this I think there is no uh issue and Allah Knows Best"
