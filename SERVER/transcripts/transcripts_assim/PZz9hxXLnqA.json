  "transcript": "she's my neighbor he means well so Lola was a little while I got an idea I will come but didn't wanna touch me I'm Anderson my you can bottle lucky cat how long do we have for the second session one hour or one out exactly so we now have this very compelling question which is do the companions legislate do the companions legislate so it's in in red in front of you saying no but I have a problem if they do not legislate how can we accept that Friday has to event while at the time of the Prophet eraser Sam it had one other how can we explain that the Prophet Allah salatu salam flogged those who drank intoxicants forty lashes while Roma may Allah be pleased with them made them 80 lashes we have a number of cases that may not seem to be as we claim and that is the Companions do not legislate so do they legislate or not again the question compelling question the answer is in red no they don't so how do we understand some of the incidents where the Companions did something the Prophet did not do first of all a well-known fact that the companions do not innovate vida is not acceptable by the companions because they never ever innovated ground rule number one ground rule number two the Prophet stated alayhi salat wa sallam abide by my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the falafels Rashi dude the rightly guided companion so who instructed us to follow the Sunnah the Prophet Allah salat wa salam so they do not legislate but rather may improvise in things that islam needs and the Prophet indicated to only follow them who are they Abu Bakr Roma man and if you look you will find everything that they have come up with serves Islam and doesn't go against it the biggest thing and most prominent of all is the compiling of the Quran it was Abu Bakr may allah be pleased with him or was it enough man it was both the first compilation come violation was by Abu Bakr and this was when the for over rigde the words of apostasy took place a lot of those who memorize the Quran where Martin so they came to Abu Bakr and they told him listen those who memorize the Quran are dying and they are diminishing in number so we have to compile the Quran so that people would not make mistakes because as the nation group people came into his and they may find it difficult to relate to the Quran when we have only few people memorizing it so he liked the opinion compiled the Quran may Allah be pleased with him and it stayed until the time of rough man of course they ordered in the time of Abu Bakr they'd even Favot not how did the heart that was martyred in the eighth year they didn't a bit he is one of the greatest scholars of the Companions he is young he mastered if I'm not mistaken he mastered Hebrew in 15 days less than two weeks he mastered it by the order of the Prophet as Shoshana so that he can relate to the Torah and read it and know if they're lying or not to him and the Prophet said that I thought was Salaam that he would come on the day of judgement ahead of the scholars of Islam by a throw of a stone so we be there Imam way ahead of them on the day of judgement so they do miss habit compiled the Quran anyone who had written whether on a leaflet or whether on the palm trees leaves or on a stone or in a bone anything you have bring it not that they do not memorize it they all memorize it among her mistress man earth man recited the Quran in one raka from cover to cover and high season from Asia to future one record so he was a master of the Quran in memorization and all of them but when he compiled the Quran he said anyone who comes with the Quran he has to bring two witnesses with him and it's a long process now at the time of earth man no they had to come all right okay at the time of the man a lot of the nations entered into Islam so the Persians the Egyptians the Syrians the Coptics accepted Islam and people had different dialects so they came to earth mana said we have only one copy that is the master copy known as half son copy and so we would like to duplicate and write and send it so that people in different regions would have a road map to follow an original copy so they made four copies also by zeda meth habit associated and assisted by fear for other companions from perish because they had the pure tongue of the Arabs and they did this and it went so now is this legislating is it the same Quran yes nothing changed but this was not practiced at the time of the Prophet and some though the prophecy was there one would say how dare they do something that was not that at the time of the Prophet I serve Allah says Alif LAAM Meem that he can key tab that is the book which book the Quran but it wasn't compiled Allah telling us it is a book which means that it will be compiled and it was compiled so companions do not legislate rather the four caliphs Abu Bakr Umar Uthman and Ali may Allah be pleased with them they would improvise with little little rulings that pertain into the protection of Islam fight so after the death of the Prophet that I sought to sell you you read this some Iran heat reading English pipe now before going to the second stage which is the stage of pre doctrine stage which relates to the Companions era and the turbulent era if we look at the Companions era there were recorded that 130 of the Companions about give or take few were coated to be fat one how many companions were there there more they were more than a hundred thousand for those who went for hajj with the Prophet SM for approximately a hundred thousand define for me the meaning of companion Muhammad is not sufficient believe you can meet but you do not believe so you meet the prophet a sir you believe in the professor yes this is very important that he dies on Islam so this is the definition of a companion of the prophet alayhi salatu salam now can anyone of you say that i'm the companion of assam no I need to have like five six years to know you we have to eat together you have to invite me a lot outside so that we can relate the same yes we companions except when it comes to the Prophet Alice of Salaam the honor of companionship is sufficient by meeting him by believing in him and dying on Islam and you become a companion but of course they are what those that go way way up like the ten heavenly bound of the companions may allah be pleased with them and then it can be with someone who just met the prophet as salaam give slamming and left not even hurt anything of him there are companies that did not even heal one of the companions was five years old old and he's considered to be one of the youngest is it all what i remember he said five years old kid that when i saw the prophet he was performing Woodill and he was turning them water in his mouth he saw me he splitted my face you know will you play with the children is it this is the only thing i remember but he still is considered to be a companion what is the big role of companion men and women what's the difference no they're men yes we're men doubtful why the levels of the companions is so high to the extent that the prophet said is awesome do not abuse do not curse my companions for if one of you we're to give the amount of a hook in gold for the sake of allah this would not reach the mood of one of them of grain not even half of it what does this mean Jonnie the prophet is saying that to his companions and you know who he said this hadith to does anybody know you don't know you of some Sahabi not named holly the mini buddy his nickname is say fool ah the sword of allah great companion right he had a dispute verbally without the rahman even house one of the ten heaven bound both from Koresh both are great companions the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam was married to the aunt of holida muli and by the way harlot and our beloved bass we're cousins they had aunt to to their mothers were sisters and the third mother oh the third sister was married to the prophet who was my Munna bent and hadith now let me pitch with no more so the prophet s time when he saw the lyapunov clashing with harlot honey the same law the warrior the great leader he's addressing harlots it holid do not abuse or curse or fight with my companions he didn't say I'm your companion as well no no no no there is the difference between heaven and earth this is at the man even out one of the first three or four to accept Islam who are you you accepted Islam on the eighth fear of his rock meaning after 21 years of a black man accepting Islam and you're abusing my companion by Allah if you were to give the mountain of a hood in gold for charity this would not be even as close as a black man giving his full hand of grain not even his half hand and this is addressed to hope to holiday now a days we find imbeciles hypocrites talking about the Companions of the Prophet Elisha Ladouceur slandering them I'm not talking about Africa Shia these are fashion any I'm not even mentioning them I'm talking about people who call themselves sooner come on live TV talking ill about mahalia even ABI Sufyan he used to scribe the Quran with the way he was revealed the Prophet to tell him Holly come right his father is abu sufian health who was an enemy but then became a companion and then died in the cause of Allah his just finish the mother of the believers oh man what mini was her name hmm what's your mother's name my mother's name is Fatima yeah what is your the wife of the prophets name um Omaha Bieber what's your original name close hmm so holla so many gifts I have but I'm not presenting to anyone Ramallah Ramallah beat Ali Sofia these are your mother's you have to know them I once went to a hospital with one of my daughters and in the reception she said what's your daughter's name I said Julia and that is it what is it you wait yeah she was an addict from Egypt so do I see him in wider said why choose such a name said uranium and they had it the wife of the Prophet I saw someone hominid really I never heard of this name she's a Muslim she's a hijab' she has never ever heard of the names of our mother and said when I tell you what are the mother's name he was a Khadija I'm glass this is problematic this is the essential of your religion yeah you have to know your history without history you don't have any presence presence and you don't have any future you need to know these people because sha Allah when you enter Jannah you will be with them insha'Allah so what brought us so you do not come close to saying any negative thing about the Companions they're not because if you do you may face the issue of not entering gender with them you have to have a clean heart to them fight so they were 130 of the companion may Allah be pleased with them that were coated to give fatwa now their classification are as follows one some of the companions were known to be plentiful in giving fatwa so we have great volumes and books of them collective and for example romanovna hapa there is a two-volume big book this much of his fat was on everything ha murder was allergy one of the scholars of Syria is old I think he's still living but he is a researcher and he compiled these from different different books of Sunna 7 worth worth of them were plentiful and they were Roma even apart Ali didn't a Batali even miss rude what's his first name Abdullah Aishah bint ABI bakr they dip [Music] tabot make the distinction between JD bethabeth and sada belly added that he didn't had he's the father of osama they didn't had it it was the adopted son of the professor before adoption was abrogated and he loved osama his son who was black and he loved his father who was lady who was wait and people used to talk behind their backs saying that how can he be black in his father's white is any something fishy not knowing that his mother was amaz mother was my man an Abyssinian slave who used to care for the prophetess and she was too old but Subhan Allah they didn't had he was married to who yes huh ooh they have bent Josh she is the consent of the prophetess Osama she was from Koresh and the Prophet advised her to marry his freed slave adopted slave she married him but she did not like him he used to complain to him and she used to complain but he you say keep keep staying and he'd be patient until Allah ordered them to be separated and then order the Prophet to marry her so that the Arabs would know that there is no adoption how can he marry his daughter-in-law if he was my son but he's not so this is what happened anyhow oh yes so they demons a bit is the scholar of the companions and even a bus his father his name is Omar we often see and hear the dealer they saw a bad ela of the Companions they referring to Abdullah Mohammed Abdullah famous rude I'm the love nap bass and Abdullah in the US and also there is a Abdullah heaviness new baby so these five a bad dealer narrated hadith they were scholars who used to give fatwa depending on little or more anymore so we have even a moment may Allah be pleased with it so the free Abad Allah if it must wrote a melanoma and if it had passed well among those scholars who used to give a lot of fat one we have so many big volumes stage to the moderate not a lot but not what little and they were 13 among them was Abu Bakr earth man umm Salama whose umm Salama the mother of the believers the wife of the Prophet Elisha salat wa salam Ana's bin Malik abu sa'id Qadri abu huraira a the LA even amoureux in the NOS in the zubayr that says a beloved azume abu musa al-ashari jabbin a monocular imageable sardinia be Waqas Salman who salman al-farisi nothing happens and man these companions may allah be pleased with them if we would just like to give a preview it will take our day but living with the Companions is second to none you have to see when you study tough seed you refresh your heart but sometimes it becomes bored not because you're a Catholic but this is human nature sometimes you pray they are male you become bored so that does that mean I'm sinful no this is human nature you get bored so you have to change now if you study to see if you study if you study hadith and you become bored what to do PlayStation 4 no go to serie go to the companions this refreshes your heart because whenever you compare yourself to them and to the difficulties you find that you settle down once you read it and it gives you a lot of boost and power in Sharla to move on third category those who gave fat well but it was very very little and among them is Al Hassan and Hussein who are they the sons of rowdy and Fatima obey even a car though obey is one of the learnand companions in for an the Prophet told us learned the Quran from for obeying the cap Abdullah ibn Masud in Newham yard Salim mala ali food Asia and so on so obey was a well-known established scholar but not everyone used to give fatwa they used to feel saying hello column if I ask now what's the ruling on this I'll get everybody saying their verdict no problem if I ask what's a ruling on hedge fund good some say haha mortgages you find a lot of fat waste from people who are not even qualified the Companions used to what hold back even if they had knowledge that is 99% they were afraid that this 1% may take them to hell so this why should I bother take it to share share share so the fat were used to go around and come back to the individual once again each one is pushing it to the one next to him unlike what we do today we have this I wouldn't say it call it courage but it is carelessness when you have people saying yeah yeah or hell without proper knowledge so obeying the cab of Ayub al-ansari asma bint ABI bakr is a deafening outcome so ban the servant of the prophet alayhi salatu salam and so on faith we move on to the different categories if Malcolm says jurisprudence and knowledge have spread in the nation by the hands of the students of ibanez Ruth is a demon Tabak I'm the love guru MA and I'm the lot numbers which means that these four prominent companions were the cause of spreading knowledge systematically in the Islamic world how the Medina school had two prominent companions even Roma and they didn't affirm it they does this mean there were no other companions no there were so many we said that 130 but not everyone of them had their own students who would take the knowledge and pass it on and this is the difference between the different schools of thought we will come to that Hashanah by maka who was the sole companion that dominated the fatwah and the spreading of knowledge in Napa and in Iraq we had the great scholar the great companion Abdullah Abram s rule and when we say that they where the schools of jurisprudence the Companions who spread it bear in mind when we talk about scholars we do not compare them to nowadays scholars their Arabic is good is it they're fluent not only that I'm I'm an Arab man not originally but I'm born in Arabia I'm a native Arab I don't speak anything my mother tongue even my father sang this out of it but my Arabic compared to this is like one out of a thousand seriously one out of a thousand because they're Arabic is pure fossa backed by poetry by prose by so many things just to explain to you one single word so if I want to come to the word like rain hi the soul of M this is the basic we studied not as an example a new student of knowledge when they go to university in the subject of a solar cell they bring you the difference in meaning of one word to emphasize the importance of Arabic you cannot be as soon as of I remember first off and we always give the example of ie in Arabic it refers to the letter in the alphabet i in lane okay it also refers to the eye is called nain it refers to a spy who comes because he snoops along it refers to the spring I Nancy Hart Osama sell Sibylla okay so it's a spring coming from it refers to that entity of the thing I use shape I know a shade the thing itself the entity of the thing so many meaningful one word if you don't know Arabic you are gone and I always give this example I don't know if I was give it or not here somewhere else I was doing a course in Emirates about the funeral preparation if a person dies how to shroud him how to wash him the things we do with the things we don't before death after death the prayer the barrier so it's reading in one website of America of an imam of america america house correct has to be so the man is saying the imam is translating a hadith he says seven are martyrs in Islam other than those who died in the battlefield so he's saying the one who dies under a collapsing building in fire drowning and stabbed stabbed by a knife first time I hear this so I know the hadith by heart what is this in reading the Arabic the word is maroon maroon has two meanings one stabbed with an the other meaning is playing Peron so the person of dies of parole is called macaron so the man because big not Arab so sis one of the martyrs is a man being stopped so if I'm in Harlem and the man says hey give me your wallet or establish it and I'm doing alma mater and then I died in and discovered that the translation was wrong so it is important in Islam students of knowledge you learn Arabic not just learn it master it so that when you read the Quran you feel the connection but now you are depending on my translation of whatever I see and I say and this is why this is my translation and there are mistakes but you are following my mistakes and this we will come in shadow to discuss later on when we come to blind following or HD had an ugly decision so these four great companions to in Medina who say to me Chabot Balarama one in Mecca of the love that verse one in Arabic and Allah even miss Ruth again their knowledge is nothing compared to us it's sufficient to know that I'm beloved Westroads said I've taken from the mouth of the Prophet s LOM straight more than seventy surah how many suitors of the Quran 114 and he missed 44 Sulis he wasn't there but he took it the following hour or the following day from the compact but he took from the prophets mouth straight more than 70 sewers we don't even learn the Quran from a ship we just learn it from maybe memorizing it in the machine up there are scholars who memorized the Quran through the Prophet with a chain of narrators so he says it comes to you my his so and so he learned from his chefs own soul so on so on so to the Prophet Isis and their knowledge is like ours definitely huh so knowledge is something that is really heavy it's not something that you go like to McDonald's drive-through ah one Big Mac and one macro please and you move on this is not knowledge this is drive-thru knowledge this is drive-thru knowledge you have to develop you have to devote time you have to spend eight nine hours a day reading researching calling sure I read this what what is the meaning of this I don't understand you have to communicate not just attend of course and that is it you have to pay more attention Shama plain juice jurisprudence and in the tibetan era now these companions had disciples had students so in Medina who were the students we find that we had the seven jurists known as alpha ha ha ha and we had sat him whenever and as URI what is this now if we would like to go into details this would take a full day because you have to know who are the seven jurors but I'll give you the name everybody knows say didn't you see him one of the great Tiberium one of the most well known facts about him he said that I prayed in the message of the Medina for 50 years in the first row never missed the first row and for 40 years sorry I prayed 50 years never missed the takbir at la Jara but 40 years of them I never looked at the back of someone in front of me because there was no one in front of me what yeah if he was behind the Imam yes but he was made a little bit to the right don't be technical so this say diplomacy was yanny you go to his life story how his daughter he rejected the proposal of the son of the king he proposed to his daughters no and he gave his daughter to the poorest student of his whose wife died so he gave it to her to him and after the seven days of the wedding the man was prepared to go she said what are you going today I'm going to attend your father's class said stay what you find with him you'll find with me he said I started learning from her and I found her full of knowledge like her father so he skipped his father is his teachers classes he stayed with his wife she's more knowledgable sorry didn't save robot mr. Bailey who was his mother yes ma'am but he was not a companion he did not see the Prophet as he was born after the death of the Prophet that is awesome his father was a zubeida now one one of the ten heaven bound he was a knowledgeable scholar of the tambourine I will cost him the son of Mohammed in Navi Bakr so his grandfather was Abu Bakr Siddiq then you have remained alive not venomous rude then the son of Zadok nice habit his name is Hari sure so again all them parents we're companions were scholars so they mandibristar and the seventh there is a difference of opinion among scholars the most authentic is Abu Salam ah the son of Abdul Rahman if you know and some say he is other than that we will not go into this is Allah so these are the seven jurors well known in medina at the time of the tambourine to be places of well anyone who has a problem he goes to them but also with them was saddened who was Salim the son of Abdullah normal so I'm the love Muhammad was the prominent Mufti along with Zaiden Thabit so his son was at a berry salad even Abdullah neuroma the other one is not fair and who's not fair the freed slave of Amon lumen again so again all those connected to be Rama we're scholars of the religion and as URI in knew she had a zoo brie was one of the Tapani and he's also one of the well-known scholars of medina if you go to mecca you'll find the students off in a bus and you have Appa ignore ba he was a freed slave but he came to become or he ended becoming one of the greatest scholars of Islam of Mecca the halifa came for Hajj and everybody in Hajj crowded everybody was giving way to a pop whose black slave and the ha'la'tha was shocked nobody is giving me respect and giving me way but apart this slave they're giving him way and asking him about rulings of halogen you know respecting him and he was a little bit you know upset who's this slave this is a partner ABBA he's one of the greatest scholars of Makkah I said subhana Allah Allah uplifts people with knowledge this is why he's deserving it because of his knowledge I am The King nobody's even looking at me and there is a whoosh there is much ahead there is nickimja all of these are great scholars of the Tapani if you open the book living cathy you will always find them interpreting the four leaving deficit because even her bass was the leader of interpreting the Koran so they were carrying it to us if you go to a bar where is a Muslim in Iran so at the time of the thirteen we had to Basra and we had Kufa these two prominent cities in an Basra we had the famous tabary and Hasan al-basri then you have even serine Hammett ABC Deen and you have a book Padayappa and you have a talent will you go to a Kufa you have also the students of the load miss road you have a lama and his student Ibrahim and luckily you have masu you have Rho beta and you have troy al or the but again this is for your own homework you go and study their names and go into their biography and learn their way of acquiring knowledge and how they spread the knowledge of a demon point now we move on to the third category which is the period of the schools of thought we have four prominent schools of thought led by the Imams who established these schools of thought number one Abu Hanifah born in year eighty died in 850 Malik born in 93 died in 179 asha free born in 150 we've seen 150 kids before right when so he was born when abu hanifa died and he died in 204 i met and please remember these figures the birth and the death because later on in the presentation it's missing so you may need to add it born in hundreds before and died in 2:41 play before we go to the four Imams the for great schools of thought we have two special mention the Imams of extinct schools of thought we have an Hasan al-basri who had his own school of thought we have sufyani ethylene we have an imam al awzai of lebanon we have a lathe in the side of egypt and a lathe of inside for example was a contemporary of imam ali yet they all say that a lady beside was more knowledgeable than him america and one of the advantages of the imam a latham in assad he was a judge and he was a millionaire in egypt and he used to sponsor students of knowledge and scholars among them in America so not only he was knowledgeable he used to benefit people with what with money and this means and this shows you the truth through fabric of such scholars it's not only teaching it's also implementing you had also Sofia dinero llena you had the famous hug this is half in Nora Jolla and he was a contemporary of imam ahmed now is happy pintura Hodja some say his name differently you can say is happy in La Jolla and you can say is happy even dragged away like see by way or see boa it is pronounced differently jurors pronounce it differently to healthy people hadith this is some and you have a possible and even Jeanine up every the well-known compiler of after C f/c robbery the well-known pipe why do we say that they had extended schools of thought when they had more knowledge than the four Imams the scholars say the difference between these extent schools and the existing four schools that the four schools of thought had students devoted to spreading the teachings of their share these other shoe these other Imams did not have the same devoted students this is why a lathe of Nizam though was more knowledgeable than a man Malik Allah did not facilitate for hizmet have to be widely spread because he did not have a lot of students he did not have a lot of classes and conducted like Eva Malik a bananas may Allah have mercy on them all for you now if we begin we will not finish so how about we take a break and we will come back at 1205 okay"
