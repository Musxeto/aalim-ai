  "title": "Is savings account where there is no interest still haram? Saving vs current account assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign I previously asked you about getting my scholarship money to a savings account in a commercial Bank I got to know that I can also receive the money with the current account uh if I keep my savings account and tell them to stop the interest will it be the same as having a current account or must I stop this savings account I read in Islam QA that a savings account includes the river contract so one should use a current account but I am confused that if the interest is stopped will it still be considered a river contract to me the concept is the same whether you put your money in a current account or a savings account what counts is the actual initial account you begin with so yes if I go to a bank a conventional bank and they give me the choice between current or saving knowingly that the saving account will not generate riba for me I will choose current account yes I know that my money is with them and they're utilizing it in other Haram means so they're lending it to other people who are borrowing with interest and they're keeping the interest to themselves I could care less now that you have the saving account so it's the same thing but the only difference is that they're giving you a portion of the ribba they're taking from other clients and therefore if you take the money and close your saving account and open a current account it would be taking it from the right pocket putting it in the left pocket but as you already have a savings account the way I see it is keep it and make sure that every time they put interest money that you cleanse your account by taking this interest money and giving it to the poor and needy Muslims so to me this is a win-win situation and Allah Knows Best"
