  "transcript": "rasheed from tunisia my question is my two friends are always helping little girl clawed her feet her clean her and her parents say that they don't have money but they subhanallah they always buy cigarettes so i'm asking you uh what what to do because i think they are lying to my friends to get money should my his friends who are helping this child while their her parents smoke so does their her parents sin of smoking should allow you to discontinue the charity they're doing for the girl of course not this is a sin that the parents do so when you tell them that no no they buy cigarettes so you should not help the girl they're helping the girl they're feeding the girl they're clothing the girl they're interested in taking her to school and paying her fees you have no right to interfere and the prophet said it is part of a muslim's proper islam to abandon and leave what's none of his business so you don't have any right to say this to them or to discontinue such such goodness coming to this girl because of a doubt you have in your head or some whispers that you have in your head maybe maybe if we were to be 100 certain that they're misusing the money given to them rather than to the girl herself maybe you can tell them to buy the girl something that is a material that she uses so they buy her the food they pay directly for her school fees they do whatever buy her clothes themselves rather than giving her parents cash on the knowledge"
