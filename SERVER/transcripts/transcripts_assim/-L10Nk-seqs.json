  "transcript": "Uh so sh the other day I was uh sleeping and asleep and something strange happened. It was like a dream uh or I I don't even know. So I was um it's just a memory of me like saying words of kufur. So I don't I honestly don't know if it was a dream or it was a reality because the memories are just blurry for me now. Say are you a Muslim? Yes. Do you want to become a kafir? No. Do you have any intention of kufur? No. Yes or no? No. So, do you want me to label you as a kafir based on a memory, a hallucination, whispering of shaitan? Is this logical? No. So, what is the right thing to do when you get such feelings or thoughts? Just ignore it 100%. Thank you for coming."
