  "transcript": "foreign today in our 71st lesson of the islamic film we will be discussing a chapter that usually comes at the end of the books of which is the chapter that deals with judging disputes and testimonies so the issue of a shahadat the things that deal with disputes among people usually they put it at the very end and last because after we have secured how to worship allah azzawajal after how we secured the things that people need such as marriages divorces transactions selling and buying halal and haram types of commerce etc the types of food we are allowed to eat and the types of food that we are prohibited etc we come to the conclusion which is when disputes take place how to resolve them how to believe or disbelieve people's claims i could easily come and claim that i lent you a million dollars i could swear on that so someone else could claim that i had killed his relative and he could swear on that how to resolve and to judge such disputes whenever they take place in arabic the term allah means giving a ruling according to islam and making it binding on people so as to settle disputes and quarrels and this is something that societies can never live without and whenever there is a need for it then islam mandates it and you can tell that islam is not just a religion that deals with prayer and fasting etc on the individual level rather it is a religion and a full comprehensive system that governs the affairs of the individual not only on the individuals level but also on the communities countries and nations islam is the only religion that has such a system that governs the relationship between the individual and his lord the individual and other individuals and also the individual with animals and with non-living things all of this is governed in islam so solving people's dispute is a collective duty if one or more undertake this duty then the whole community is exempted from punishment but if everyone refuses to take it then they will all be sinful because no one is fulfilling this collective duty and this is similar to the fact that when we find a community that has no doctors they're all sinful this is a collective community duty that somebody has to do it and when we say that it is a collective duty this is due to the fact that communities cannot rightly function without it we need a system that supports victims of injustice a system that sets matters to right that ensures that everyone gets their dues that settles quarrels between people and maintains law and order and combats corruption and this cannot be done on the individual basis if there is an aggression against me through someone who's influential someone who's rich someone who's powerful how can i take my right back without a judicial system without a judge ruling and enforcing so it's not a fatwa it is not having a dispute coming to the sheikh i divorced my wife three times what to do and the sheikh talks and gives the fatwa and the man says thank you and he goes to another sheikh because it's just an advice that fatwa is an advice an islamic ruling but it's not binding while a judge ruling is binding and this is a very big difference between the fatwa of a scholar or a sheikh and the judgment of a low rank judge in a muslim court the first is honored and appreciated the second is implemented by force by the force of law now this when saying it's a collective duty this is not for anyone to step forward and say i'll do it no this is the ruling or the responsibility or part of the job description of a muslim ruler so it is not something that people elect tom dick harry to be a judge and he judges them because this is something that has to be backed and enforced by law in small communities when they don't have such laws it is understandable if we have a dispute and there is no muslim court around us that we go to a sheikh to a mufti to a scholar and appoint him as both of us agree to whatever verdict he's going to give but this is different from which is a position of authority that has the power to solve and resolve disputes and enforce the implementation of the ruling so it's the muslim ruler who appoints the judge and in accordance to the need of the community that they live in and being able to solve such problems and conflicts if a person is qualified undertaking such a mission is highly appreciated in islam and he is highly rewarded for the effort he has put into it because as stated before it is not something that people look up to unfortunately nowadays a lot of the people would love to assume the position of a judge usually it comes with the territory the pop the power the authority [Music] wealth that one one can gain from it and this is why the prophet gave a very serious warning when he said that the judges are of three types one is in paradise and two are in hell the one in paradise is the one who rules and governs with the quran in sunnah and implements justice the one in hell one of them is someone who knew the truth concealed it and ruled otherwise so this usually is done for money or for favoritism or because he knows someone he knows and the second type of judges who's in hell is the one who rules without knowledge so he's a fair person he is god-fearing but he has no knowledge so he's like someone who pretends to be a doctor performs an operation ends up killing the patient he was sincere in helping the patient but he did not have knowledge and hence he bears the consequences the basis of the justice system in the quran is in the quran the sunnah and the consensus of muslim scholars allah says in the quran we said o da wood indeed we have made you a successor upon the earth so judge between the people and truth and do not follow your own desire as it will lead you astray from the way of allah and this is a serious warning to a prophet of allah so he's the prophet he's a messenger yet listen to what allah is warning him do not follow follow your own desires and judges all over the world are among the first either to suffer in hell or to enjoy paradise according to their conduct because they've assumed a responsibility that they were most likely better off without if they were not confident of their knowledge if they were not confident of their fairness and fear of allah the prophet says if a judge makes a ruling after he has carefully looked at all aspects he receives double reward when he makes the right judgment if he looks carefully at all aspects and gives a wrong ruling he receives a single reward what does that tell you nowadays we live in a world of mass communication social media platforms news outlets and unfortunately when people are not brought up according to the islamic rulings you get catastrophes what does that mean there is something known as a pay grade a pay scale a janitor can never understand how a cao works and in so many companies we find that a group of janitors a low key employees gather and criticize the decisions of global merging between companies that their ceo is doing or they criticize hiring and firing of managers or directors and they take liberty to speak out not knowing that they're backbiting slandering putting their noses in places it should not be in because it is way higher than their pay grade and this is why they are janitors or low-grade employees or paper pushers and not ceos vice presidents or directors this is something that most of us cannot digest correctly now this is on the private sector level but if you go to the sector of waliyul ammar of the muslim ruler whether we like him or not this is beside the point we're not supposed to love him it's not an islamic duty to love him but it is an islamic duty to obey him to adhere what he says and to preserve and protect his dignity and honor this is an islamic ruling so nowadays we get people condemning things that are way way above their patriot judging political issues judging economic resolutions as if it is something that they're entitled to do as if it's their own god-given right to speak about which is not and this is why we have problems in the muslim world if you go to countries that manifest disrespect to the muslim ruler you will find that such countries are easily manipulated by foreign powers so in a specific islamic country someone depicts the pictures of the prophet alaihis wasalam by charles hebdo in france and they come in the millions on the streets rioting so what are you doing why are you rioting disturbing the peace looting violence what is this this is un-islamic and the poor muslim ruler is unable to do anything such countries are at the verge of destruction because kafir powers manipulate the laymen the hooligans whether in good or bad and they are ready for the waiting for the right moment to launch what they want allah has given you a responsibility as a citizen as a normal person as a layman do what allah ordered you to do what's above you what is way above your pay grade let that be to those whom allah has given them the responsibility and whom allah will hold them accountable on the day of judgment so the muslim ruler may put all of his effort look in all different aspects and then he makes a decision he's either right or wrong if he's right he's rewarded twice if he's wrong he's rewarded once so the prophet did not say allah that he's sinful no what he has done was exert all his efforts the conclusion is not of great importance because allah is the one who guides so as long as he had done his due diligence he has offered the best of efforts and tried his level best this is sufficient insha allah azzawajal it was the prophet alaihis salat wasallam who assumed the role of a judge among the muslims so the prophet was not only a prophet and a messenger he was not only a leader at battle he was not only a teacher a companion a husband a father he was also a judge and people would come to him with their cases and he would resolve it for them not only that he also appointed judges so among his companions we know that he sent muradin may allah be pleased with him and to yemen to be judges and to teach the people islam we know that he also sent adi as a judge and ali threw out the kill office of abu bakr umar anderthman used to be a judge judging people giving counselling and the companions may allah be pleased with them who succeeded the prophet allah also were judges and appointed judges and sent their companions and hired them to be judges to do to solve and resolve disputes among the muslims so this is a well established fact in islam islam the religion islam the system islam the way of life now what are the conditions of such a judge first condition without any dispute is that the judge must be a muslim and this is also one of the comic situations that we see in the media and on social media when people say that this is unfair this is bias this is segregation why do we discriminate other religions and not allow them to be judges and we hear this a lot in secular countries countries that the vast majority of the population are muslims but they are ruled by the enemy they are ruled by those who were taught in their colleges and in the universities so they're trying to undermine the infrastructure of islam by pretending that they are muslims while they are most likely or more likely to be hypocrites so they come and say why discriminate why not allow non-muslims to work in our court system and who knows maybe tomorrow they will say why not allow a christian citizen to offer friday khutbah and lead the muslims in prayer so that we would have unity and no discrimination where are they going to take us next sharia law is not a game it is not man made it is from the quran and from the sunnah and without the dignity the honor the pride of islam what is left we've never heard anyone saying let's let the pope be a muslim for for a change yet in these secular countries these hypocrites come forward and claim that we should not discriminate judges should be of all faiths because they're citizens so they put citizenship on top of islam your religion is your own concern citizenship is the sacred conviction and belief it's the deity that we worship out of allah this is blatant shirk and kufur so when it comes to ruling and judging this can only be assumed by muslims and there's no doubt in that none whatsoever because only a muslim can rule and judge with the sharia allah non-muslims would think that this is barbaric this is not logical this is inhumane and what do you expect from someone who is a disbeliever who's a kafir who does not believe in allah or in the quran or in our prophet muhammad second condition of a judge so he's a muslim he has to be sane and adult so you cannot appoint a child to be a judge you cannot appoint someone who is mentally challenged to be a judge he has to be sound in his decision and this only comes with for uh to a person who is sane and an adult thirdly he has to have this integrity property he has to have this fairness being trustworthy so you don't bring an actor or a singer or a dancer to be a muslim judge these people are not islamically classified as trustworthy they are disobedient they are sinners open sinners allah says in the quran o you who have believed if there comes to you a disobedient one in arabic it's with information if he comes to you with information investigate lest you harm a people out of ignorance and become over what you have done regretful so if a witness testimony is rejected if he's disobedient if he's a facile he comes to court and he wants to testify and the judge discovers that he was involved in a slandering case two years ago and he was flogged 80 lashes his testimony is unaccepted why because he's disobedient if he comes to testify and he is a well-known drunkard or he deals in drugs or he deals in prostitution this guy cannot testify he's not trustworthy and definitely he cannot be appointed as a muslim judge because he's not trustworthy at all number five number four he has to have sound constitution which means that he should be physically fit and would not have any illness that would hamper his decision-making you see a judge is a very important role and he must be a person who makes a sound judgment so if he has a disability that would hamper his decision-making in this case the majority of scholars say that he should not be appointed as a judge so he should not be deaf he should not be blind and he should not be dumb and this is of course an issue of dispute being deaf or dumb might be accepted though being dumb can be resolved through writing being deaf can be resolved in reading being blind can be resolved by hearing yet the most authentic opinion is that a blind person can judge and whenever there are cases where he is unable to give a verdict due to his sight being impaired and he cannot see then his assistance may help him and these are very rare because the prophet himself used a blind person and that was who was a blind companion and whenever the prophet islam went out on an expedition he would appoint him as the ruler on medina and the ruler at the time meant that he led the prayers in the masjid that he was the muslim ruler the judge who would rule disputes and being a blind man did not handle him or stop him from such a position number five judges should have a thorough knowledge and this is extremely important you remember that we said that the prophet are salam told us that there are three types of judges and by the way these three types are not percentage-wise so 33 percent 33 percent and 33 no it is classification wise so you could have one out of a hundred who's a good righteous judge in 99 who are in hell so those who do not have knowledge those who do not possess the necessary knowledge to work as judges they are in big trouble and i always tell those who opt to study law and i've seen some of my own relatives doing this and i gave them the warning that you cannot study law without mastering the islamic sharia law and unfortunately in most countries islamic countries there is this clear segregation where people study the french law the british law american law commercial law the administrative law without mastering the islamic law and this causes a lot of confusion especially to young muslim students and this is why the fatwa from the major great scholars of our times is that it is not permissible to study law unless you can master the islamic sharia law after that yes you can study british law french law and you will find that most of it is based on islamic law but there are aspects that you have to be really careful when studying if you are not qualified in the islamic law because this would cast doubts on your own islam and you don't want to go there you don't want to have issues with your own religion simply because you're ignorant so a muslim judge must have thorough knowledge of what of the quran of the sunnah he has to be well versed in all aspects of the islamic faith he has to be able to distinguish what is right and what is wrong and he has to be keen to maintain justice so it's not only the knowledge you have it's the person you are imam imam ashf is among the first to write in and specifically in phil in his great book which is considered to be the benchmark on fundamentals of phil so he clearly stated that this judge has to be of a certain scholarly level that allows him to do ishtihad and he has to have sound knowledge in the quran in the things that were abrogated or not he has to have knowledge in tafsir in hadith the on the authenticity of hadith from weakness these give him the out line verdicts and rulings he should have knowledge of his predecessors opinions over similar verdicts and different cases where the scholars agreed upon on a specific issue where they differed and disagreed and he has to be well versed in arabic language and in analogy oral ps so in a nutshell a muslim judge should be highly qualified individual unfortunately nowadays there is this tendency to downplay the importance of sharia law so the vast majority of judges we see they may look practicing and righteous but their knowledge is based on [Music] knowledge they had rather than to follow and mimic and imitate previous cases that were precedents and this is how they work nowadays in courts of law there is anderson versus johnson case in 1994. so this was a president and the judge takes the same rulings of this case that came before him not based on the quran or the sunnah or his own she had which is strongly founded on sharia law and this is a problem because now people don't solve their arbitrations through islamic sharia rather than previous cases using analogy not in the quran the sunnah but in different previous cases and this is totally wrong and not true now scholars have different views on whether women may be judges or not and with all due respect to scholars the ruling is crystal clear if there were a woman to judge is she going to judge men and women side by side or would she be in a segregated court of law that only women are allowed in this is very important it is wrong to just give a verdict without visualizing how it would be so what's the ruling on selling sugar water it's it's halal vinegar it's hella when you have a combination this usually is a combination for making wine so selling it all together to a person who is known to be disobedient and deals in these haram things would become prohibited but if we look at it individually it is halal likewise when it comes to an issue such as women working as judges masha'allah do you think that there aren't enough manpower or there isn't enough manpower for male judges to be appointed yeah there is but it's good to show the world that we do not discriminate subhanallah are you a muslim you're willing to defy allah's rulings to go against sharia law so that the world would not accuse you of this or that this is not an accusation this is a medal you should be proud of and hang it on your chest tomorrow you will come and say we have to have a woman leading the prayer as they've tried in america before in an isolated incident but the publicity and the media tried to inflate it and i i think there's a masjid in germany that is led by a woman but these are not real muslims they don't follow the quran and they don't even know what quran is so any public stunt like this shows a person that his islam is not intact at all so when you want a woman to become a judge was this done at the time of the prophet at the time of the companions may allah be pleased with them if allah told us that he has perfected our religion completed it and approved it you want to come fifteen centuries later and appoint a woman as a judge how is she going to address men with the full niqab and borka what about if there is something that has to be in secret between her and one of the clients one of the men one of the the witnesses who cannot reveal everything in public what about if she's on her menses and she is affected negatively in terms of making a decision all of these defy the purpose of hijab and cannot be accepted at all in a muslim court and we've seen problems from such free mixing so with all due respect when we get abu hanifa making it clear that a woman may be a judge in all cases except mandatory or prescribed punishment this is not true she cannot solve problems between two conflicting men over a dispute of their trade shouting and fighting and she's with their soft voice asking them to be quiet in court and also the tabari and even haslam considered that she could be a judge in any dispute or case as long as she meets the requirements of the position alhamdulillah if only these three scholars out of the millions of scholars of islam throughout the history said this this is negligible this is nothing we have the quran and we have the sunnah and never ever was a woman judging cases and issues between men in public this is unislamic and it is unheard of and allah azza knows best so i think we will stop here and we will see what questions remain so we have uh a question from someone who has his social media name alhamdulillah and this is not permissible you cannot have your name or tag it as alhamdulillah this is inappropriate and disrespectful of the quran as it being verse number one in surat al-fatiha imagine if someone disputed with you and cursed you that would be totally inappropriate anyhow according to oath one of my cousins told me to look up for her children if she passed away 2019 she passed away what i can do to help them are the children orphans if their father is alive this is not an oath this is a sort of a will and such a will making you a person who would look after their needs is almost invalid in the presence of their father because an orphan is defined as a child that his father dies before reaching the age of puberty once the child reaches the age of puberty he is no longer considered to be an orphan so if his mother dies and his father is alive he's not an orphan if he's 15 years of age he's not an orphan anymore so you have no control you have no say in their affairs when their father is present if the father is not present and if the one who gave you such an instruction was the father himself that is a different story and allah best saira says my question is husbands thought they have the duty of only earning don't they have the duty to spend time with the children and wife and don't have any responsibilities in terbia of their children is this only the the only responsibility of the wife all alone the answer is no it is a collective responsibility between them both the father usually is the person who enforces the laws in the house the mother usually is the weakest link children do not listen do not respect do not adhere to what she says while when the father says it once everybody listens and everybody is intimidated having said that it seems that um the questioner is a mother and she's frustrated because all what she sees is that the man is not doing anything in the house and this is the normal whispering of shaytan and don't be hasty in judging me okay here we go the sheikh is a man he's going to defend men no this is not true it is true i'm a man but it's not true i'm going to defend men where women are coming from is different shaytan whispers in their ears look at you you finished your degree and you're not able to work with it you did your degree in medicine you're a doctor and your home wife sitting raising the children you've wasted all these years for nothing you're locked between four walls you're supposed to clean iron wash cook take care of the children teach them and on top of all of that be a good caring and loving wife while he goes eight hours ten hours does a job meets people enjoys his time makes money spends his money as he wishes buys cars help his relatives with his money where i don't have any and when he comes home he sits like a king and then he goes and sits with his friends or if he's a a person who sits most of his time at home he sits on his lazy chair working on his computer or visiting his mobile phone and then he goes to bed this is not fair these are the frequent problems of women that they complain of yet they fail to see the bigger picture i'm not defending men again the way she described what the man does is totally wrong i agree but remember that the fatalities among men are far greater than those among women because women don't have high cholesterol levels blood pressure problems with diabetes and heart attacks and strokes like men do and this is why we find like out of every 10 women we may find seven widows but out of every 10 men we would find only one widow if he survived so the issue is that it is a collaboration the man faces much more stress when working outside because he has to deal with others unlike a woman in her home she has to deal only with her children he has to deal with his boss with co-workers with subordinates he has to deal with people in the street who may curse who may fight or may pull over him he has to deal with the police he has to deal with the authorities he has to deal with the landlord who wants his rent he has to deal with calculating expenses of the house whether he is capable of putting food on the table and paying for the school fees of the children and the medical care of the whole family and above all that he has to print the masjid he has to try to learn something of the deen so that he can convey it to the children and the wife he has to offer night prayers and to have jude and do this and do that so at the end of the day each one has his own responsibility a man is responsible for his offspring he cannot simply say that my wife takes the responsibility she teaches them she disciplines them she does everything i have no relationship with them this is wrong it is his responsibility to instruct them to pray with the seven and to spank them when they're ten it is his instruction that must be followed and he has to make sure it is implemented himself when he upbring his children corrects their behavior cleanses his their hearts from hatred and envy and enmity the mother can't do all of that it is his responsibility as well and if he helps in the house shores that would be a plus but this is not the norm because if you look at it from the viewpoint of a man he would say okay why wouldn't you participate in the expenses of the house or the school fees or paying the rent why don't you also get a job and then we will share shores in in the house this is not logical allah created a man for a purpose and created women for another purpose and we can't mix apples with oranges but you're right he has to have a say there is a responsibility on his back and he has to participate to the best of his ability yamin muhammad says i need an advice how could i make myself more close to allah and have more barakah in my life barakah comes from allah azzawajal and in order for you to get closer to allah in the hadith allah says and my servant would not do anything to get closer to me better than what i have mandated upon him so this is clearly mentioning the issue of allah loves most that you do what he has mandated upon you what does that mean if you pray five hours of night prayer that's nice allah loves this but you as a consequence miss fajr prayer and you oversleep allah does not accept this deeds of yours because the fajr prayer of five to ten minutes is more beloved to allah azza than six hours of night prayer so if you want to get closer to allah azza put your priority list in order number one do every single thing that you're ordered to do and this does not only relate to prayers or to fasting ramadan or to giving zakat or to performing hajj and umrah these are pillars of islam not limiting islam to it only there is an obligation afarido to be obedient to your parents respectful and dutiful a lot of the muslims fail to do this and focus on only praying in the masjid having a long beard etc which is good but this is also a fault connecting your kinship and the majority of muslims sivir their kinship for one reason or the other and you would never fail to get astonishing reasons and justifications for that oh they didn't call me to their daughter's wedding six years ago so i would not contact them oh they said something disrespectful oh their brother hit my sister and subhanallah the end conclusion severing the kinship which is a major sin when you do the things that allah has obliged you and you refrain totally completely from what allah has made prohibited upon you you will get closer to allah our problem is that we can't have the pull the full package so yes i pray in the masjid i fast ramadan i give charity i offer night prayer but when it comes to refraining from listening to music i'm too weak when it comes to not watching movies difficult when it comes to not backbiting others what will we talk about when we meet so we tend to put a number of obstacles ending up in the fact that we are not getting closer to allah if you look at the purity of the heart which is an essence and the purity of the heart has nothing to do with your actions i can take different actions to reprimand people in order to help them be better muslims while my heart is pure towards them and filled with love towards them there's nothing wrong in that there's no conflict in that so when i take a position this doesn't mean that i have ill intent towards you no not at all so once you manage to do your obligations towards allah and you leave no box unchecked once you manage to stay away from major and minor sense because allah has prohibited that you've accomplished 80 of your mission in getting close to allah if you add the extra 20 percent which is voluntary deeds which is refraining from macro deeds not haram we already done that but also to avoid what is disliked then you've attained the remaining 20 allah says in the hadith was mentioned earlier the mandatory act and then my servant allah says continues to get closer to me with voluntary deeds until i love him okay so after fulfilling the mandatory act the 20 remaining is voluntary acts that you offer an offer an offer until allah azzawajal loves you and this is the ultimate target and objective of any human being specifically of any muslim to attain the love of allah azzawajal and allah azzawajal knows best until we meet next monday have and enjoy a good weekend and i'll leave you with a"
