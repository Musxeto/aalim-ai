  "transcript": "Aron from Germany your name is ar ar okay what can I do for you I I ask you a questions and you respond me like that I tell you the question and then uh yes I was praying and then a man came in front of me before I did the prostration I was thinking about stopping my prayer because I don't know if this invited my prayer and then I did the frustration and after the frustration I sto my prayer and you you says to me this is stupid what I did and my question is is or because no no listen listen AR Whispers of Shan surrounds us from everywhere left right and center the objective get you out of the straight path to join him in Hellfire now if you have knowledge you would have easily gone through this someone passes in front of you and you're making or R question are you worshiping this person no she I don't even know him if you knew him would you be worshiping him no Sheik he doesn't give life and death he doesn't give me provision I I don't fear him when I'm alone there is nothing that makes me glorify him or rever him or worship Him and in this case your prayer is valid continue why interrupt it the prophet himself used to pray night prayer while mother AA was asleep in front of him she didn't pass she was asleep and whenever he wanted to make sujud he used to pinch her feet so that she would make room for him he makes sujud when he stands up she extends them again there's no problem in that at all and your prayer is valid don't ever break your prayer for just a mere thought without evidence what started right and correct cannot be broken unless we have proof and evidence that is is broken"
