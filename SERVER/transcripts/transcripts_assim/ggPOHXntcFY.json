  "transcript": "yeah I have a one quick question brother I have a issue that it has been going on since Ramadan whenever I sleep I sleep very beautifully until 2 a.m. and I woke up like choking in or shivering or somebody trying to you know push me neck me and something is kind of okay before I pray is alhamdulillah I pray five times I do zika during the day and before I go to bed I pray and sleep according to sunna but still I am having this issue and my pulation is going very fast I went to call the ambulance went to the hospital two three times doctor says clearly report no issue heart ECG is clear everything it has been going on continuously brother I don't I'm doing Rya and I'm taking shower Rya water also so what should I do I'm very worried about that I'm 60 years old okay first of all if the doctor say you have no medical problems this means you have one of two problems either you have something to do with Jin and this would definitely improve if not totally be cured by doing Rya or you are delusional and your subconscious is convincing you and playing games on you and this is very common it's like what doctors call Placebo when you convince yourself that this medicine cures my illness when this is not a medicine and you take it and you're cured so say wow what a great medicine that was and it wasn't a medicine to start with it was pills of salt that had no impact but this is what your subcon conscience does to you so if you have Jin and what they call Alum which is something that you feel like sleep paralysis and you cannot move and your eyes are wide open and you can't do anything for 5 10 minutes until you snap out of it this can be Jin and in most cases it's simp a nightmare that felt so real that you felt that it's not a nightmare it is something happening to me when it's just a nightmare the good news is as long as medically alhamdulillah you have no problem and as long as you observe your AAR in the morning in the evening before going to bed after F prayers and before leaving the home you're protected by Allah nothing can harm you and this is just as they say a computer glitch it comes like 5 10 minutes and it goes down the drain on its own shrug your shoulders and move on don't even pay attention to it and think positively in trusting Allah and depending on him because this has no impact on your health or your life just move on now the r if you're doing it wrong WR L this may not have that strong impact and what I do what do I mean by wrongly so many people when it comes to Rya they do it once in the morning or once in the evening which is wrong you have to do Rya like 5 10 15 times a day throughout the day and night like every couple of hours maybe less you do it on water you drink like seven eight bottles of the same water that has Ria in it that would have an impact and that you would see the progress in like four to five days inshallah but if you don't see any progress then this is definitely not Jin and it's your subconscious playing games on you"
