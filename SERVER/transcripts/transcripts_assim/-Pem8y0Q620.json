  "title": "Where can I learn about how to perform Umrah",
  "transcript": "Amirul from Malaysia My question is, In Sha Allah, Alhamdulillah, this year I'm going to make Umrah, but I have literally have no knowledge how to make Umrah. Can you give me a detailed explanation how to perform from A to Z? Okay, first of all, may Allah Azza Wa Jal make your Umrah easy. Second of all, it's very easy to know and learn the etiquettes of Umrah, but to do it here in details, that is not applicable because this is a Q&A, and we have a lot of people waiting to post their questions. However, I would direct you to go to IslamQA.info, and In Sha Allah, you will find a detailed description of the Umrah of the Prophet, Alayhi Salatu Wassalam, and if you were to visit my YouTube channel, you will also find the description of the Umrah there, bi-idhnillah. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website, and you will find counseling sessions, and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session, and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me, and let's speak about it In Sha Allah, within the following two days or three days, and bi-idhnillah Azza Wa Jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
