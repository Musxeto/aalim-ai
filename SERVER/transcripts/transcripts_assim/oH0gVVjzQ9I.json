  "transcript": "assalamualaikum warahmatullahi and welcome to with the Prophet I'm Allie Coleman a bureau host for the show thank you for being being with us as we continue to look at the subject of applying the teachings of Islam in our lives looking of course at the eternal example of Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alayhi wasallam our guest Sheikh Azam al Hakim from Saudi Arabia's continuing to be with us and always a pleasure to have you with us thank you so much for being with us exactly mahir from having me hmm so we've talked in first two episodes on a number of subjects touched on them and we want to continue looking at the relationships around the Prophet peace be upon him what those relationships looked like we had spent most of our time so far looking within the home of the Prophet peace be upon him and his wives we promised our viewer that we would expand that to other relationships but before we move on we'd like to spend a little more time with the wives and I would like to start this episode with a generic question that we briefly touched on before coming on and that was that these problems that we dealt with you know you said in the in the first episode that we have problems as Muslims we're not properly living Islam according to the the Sun Room and so the purpose of this show is to you know highlight how that should how we should be doing it and so this necessarily means we have to talk about our problems we mentioned the problem of domestic violence and other issues but there's a prescription for that what do we do when we have tension in the really in the marriage relationship we have an example to follow we have the the Quran to follow how would you compare these teachings I mean at the end of the day regardless of our faith we're all human beings whether we're Muslims Christians Jews Hindus or whatever and each of these religious spiritual institutions offers a set of solutions to human beings to live successful lives how does Islam compared to these other institutions what makes it so pristine and better for us Muslims than than others superhuman hamdulillah salat wa salam ala slowly learn your adios a vehement Adobe hotel I'm a dad I do not like to speak without knowledge I do not know I do not have knowledge of what is there in other religions when it comes to marital issues and problems and the likes but what I know is that Islam is the true religion of Allah ok what I know is that the Quran is the only Divine Scripture the only religious book that is still preserved for the past 14 centuries in the same language it was revealed in and is still spoken and used by millions actually hundreds of millions of Arabs let alone Muslims of non Arab origin but the language is still existing unlike all other scriptures yeah that have been translated from one language to another to a third or fourth and that has many virgins so Islam in my opinion yeah is the ultimate and the only religion and hence whatever comes through this lens of Islam is the ultimate truth that can have no other now having said that I cannot simply scratch out and say that everything that other religions teach is false or baseless ok especially when it comes to interaction between humans yeah this has been going on since Adam peace be upon him because from a sorry but from an objective perspective at the end of the day the thing that we want to know is can we be good to each other we can be good to each other but here is the trick when you're good to one another it's something that is wordly when you're good to your wife or to one another because islam orders you to do so then this is good wordly and it is beneficial in the hereafter okay so when we react when we deal with others it's not simply because it's a man-to-man it is because Allah ordered us to do this my relationship with my siblings is governed by the Quran the Sunnah so if my sibling is a practicing Muslim I love him because he's my brother and he is a good practice in Muslim but if it's sinful I love him because he's my brother but I have to tackle this act of his which angers Allah social in a wise and diplomatic fashion and not to accept him as he is so this is why Islam has an edge over all other religions okay in the sense that when I deal with my wife in a particular fashion and manner not just simply because I want to have a good marriage rather I'm worshiping Allah through having a good night okay it's a form of worship yes okay in Islam so this is important thank you for engaging me with that it's not gonna get bit off the cuff you know at the end of our last episode we talked about the prophet seller lawyers alone leaving and returning to the home and his behaviors kissing his wife being gentle and tender towards them why why do you think that's important why do we need to keep that as a practice in our lives as husbands with our wives too to leave them and return to them in a certain way well first of all I believe that marriage is as you've described it before an institution and there are people in this institution so there cannot be any form of success unless you have communication and you can have positive communication and you can have negative communication if you have positive communication it's a win-win scenario and as they say it takes two to tango of course within a sheet no music and the one you're tangoing with has to be your spouse yeah otherwise it becomes Haram but if you look at a marriage it is composed of a man and his wife so if their relationship is not good then this family is not good and their offspring would be brought up and raised or not being good to one another I've seen a lot of marriages where you have the relationship between the man and his wife an unhealthy relationship okay either to the extreme right or to the extreme left meaning that a man who wants to be at peace selfishly without caring about people's feelings would be like a general with his troops Simon Says do this do that don't do this don't do that so his relationship with his wife only is limited to orders and instructions and if you say the wrong word I'll divorce you so intimidation yeah threatening and a lot of abuse but he says that I like this way because I live comfortably no nagging no problems but this is not a marriage and on the other far left you find those who are like Romeo and Juliet so in love with his wife to the extent that he allows her to cross red lines to fall into sin and he does not stop her or prevents her from doing this though he is the man in command and he's in charge of his wife but he says I love her so much so she can go out not wearing the hijab she can mix with men she can do Haram things it's okay I love her and she loves him but this love is not for the sake of Allah so again you have to have the balance in the first example of the general not all generals are like this right you have lots of people in the military who are so caring and loving but this is what we usually tend to perceive them as being tough and rigid the Prophet wasn't like that that Alice thought was cinnamon now he is the head of the state he is the leader of this a lot of the the preacher the judge everything yet he talks in a way so kind and loving to Aisha what does he say he said Aisha I know when you are angry with me and when you or not and she said how do you know that or prophet of Allah so the Prophet is paying attention to her feelings right he says when you're angry with me you swear by the Lord of Ibrahim but when you're happy with me you swear by the Lord of Mohammed and both of them are Allah the Lord of Ibrahim and the Lord of Muhammad she said by Allah what you're saying is that is the truth I only abandon your name when I'm angry with you so look at the amount of observation that the Prophet has erased alot Oh Sarah even with the words of his spouse and how he cares about it so he tells her and look at the discipline and respect of her YCJA even when she's angry with her husband not the prophet of Allah he's her husband even when she's angry with him she only abandons using his name yes all right that good stopping point we're ready for our first break and when we come back we will continue our conversation thank you very much assalamu alaikum welcome back to with the Prophet Shaykh let's please continue our conversation could you give some examples of how the prophets Illinois Salem helped to encourage righteousness in his in his wives did what kinds of things that he do to encourage them to pursue righteousness first of all the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam used to engage his wives in whatever means that would draw them closer to allah a soldier in Ramadan for example in the last ten nights the Prophet as I'm used to send to his wives to wake them up and to pray all night until fajar because this is where the greatest possibility of the night of decree lailatul other to be he used to pray all night but when it came to witr prayer he used to wake a YCJA up so that she prays waited with him he used to teach us and he says may Allah have mercy upon a man who wakes up in the middle of the night wakes his wife to pray with him and if she refuses he sprinkles water in her face and may allah azzawajal have mercy upon a woman who except in the middle of the night to pray and she wakes her husband and if he refuses she sprinkles water in his face so all of these show us that the prophet alayhi salatu salam would do whatever is needed to encourage his wives to do righteous things then have been Josh may Allah be pleased with her the Prophet went to prefetcher and he came after sunrise which is an hour plus and he found zeinab sitting on her prayer mat as he left her before fetcher so she was staying making dhikr mmm the Prophet teaches her and he says I had said four statements four phrases if they were two be compared to whatever you had said throughout this hour plus it would overweight them and he teaches her subhanallah wa bihamdihi added the healthy glorifying Allah and praising him as much as his creation as much as his throne weighs as much as the number of his words as much as the ink his words are written in as much as he's pleased Subhan Allah Adam so this is showing you that the Prophet would not Alice a lot of Salaam except for anything less for his wives and if you compare Apple to Apple mm-hmm if you look how we treat our wives you would see a big gap in the sense that we care for them physically we care for how they look and how people look at them but rarely we would give them sound advice to how to stay away from sin or to get closer to Allah through good deeds rarely you will find a spouse telling his wife wake up with me in the middle of the night and let's pray to hydrogen or let us revise one another how much we memorize from the Quran because we may forget so ok every day we will revise a page or two for one another just to keep in touch also when they do sins or bad things we tend to look the other way we don't want nagging we don't want to depress them or to anger them this is wrong the Prophet iris of Sam was once with Aisha mm-hmm and she mentioned Sofia and Sophia who was a Jew was beautiful woman so the Prophet SR sallam was talking to her and she wanted to sort of discredit Sofia so that the Prophet would not love her more than her so she said it's sufficient o prophet of Allah that Sofia is this short that she wasn't tall she was short and the Prophet did not stop there he said RA salatu salam you have said a statement so bad that it if it were to be mixed with the water of the oceans it would have spoiled it so this is a simple word she's short but it's backbiting and Allah so John would hold you accountable to it the Prophet went into his house once and so a rope dangling either from the house of Helena Masjid so he said what is this rope and they told him that this rope belonged to Zainab your wife whenever she prayed night prayer and she was so tired and weak to stand up she would hang on to it so that she can stand up and the prophet has some told them to untie it this is not permissible you are overburdening yourself in a way that Allah does not want this from you he did not say that martial law good what you're doing is good no so this is the kind of relationship between the spouses they love and want what is best for the spouse in this life yet also in the Hira in the hereafter mmm thank you all right so we would like to in our next episode move into other areas other relationships in the life of the Prophet solonius Allah his children his relatives the neighbors of people in his community around him before we leave the wives the subject of the wives of the Prophet and their relationship with him anything that we have not yet touched on in these three episodes that you think we would would be an unjustice and injustice not to mention before leaving the subject of the wives well I believe that the whole thing is is a form of injustice because what we had mentioned is just like that the tip of an iceberg yeah we would like to go deep in how the Prophet dealt with his wives Isis a time it would take us ages literally simply because there is so much material right and not only that there are so much so many lessons we can learn from that for example what do you and I do when we enter home our homes we sit on the lazy chair and we have like two three remote controls we work on our and emails and maybe browse the net and watch something that's definitely beneficial but we disengage from our wives and what they want a woman who was like 810 hours working in the kitchen cleaning washing ironing when I come from work she wants someone to talk to while I myself I'm not ready to talk I just want to disengage of everything and be in my own space the Prophet as them it explains may Allah be pleased with her okay when they asked her how was the prophet in his own now you would expect him to chill you know like us yeah but that was not the Prophet awesome she said whenever the Prophet entered his home he used to occupy himself at the work or in the work of his wives how is that he used to milk his goat himself okay so Allah he used to clean his clothes in the sense that if they were fleas or something you just take them out he used to fix his sandals he used to stitch his robe his garments and he used to do everything that he can to help his wife did the Prophet go into the kitchen I suppose they didn't have any kitchen mother Aisha tells us that it used to pass a crescent after a crescent after a crescent two months yeah and we do not have any food and no fire is lit in the houses of a prophet imagine that so Ottawa even zubayr her nephew says aunty how did you eat what did you feed on she said the two blacks water and dates for two consecutive months in the houses of the Prophet as of Saran they would not cook so don't tell me about kitchens or doing the dishes yeah the Prophet that is a son lived a life of a humble servant he I personally would like to have a new meal cooked for me three times a day so if the mrs. I'm not like this but a lot of the people are like this if the missus brings them dinner of yesterday or last week's food that was in the fridge they would reject this they want something cooked fresh yeah the Prophet was not like this as some but I bet you if they were to have a kitchen that he would give a helping hand that insalata said because this is him so he would connect himself peace be upon him with his wives it was about the relationship and not about it's about cultivating a certain quality in the relationship he he went to them and sought them out and assisted them and checked in with them it didn't it's not like he expected to be served in his home he was very active and so this is a great example for us to fall alright so I think unless there's something else I think we are ready to conclude this episode and we'll continue in the in the next time inshallah okay alright thank you so much for being with us we hope it was beneficial for you we will continue with our discussion and this show with the Prophet thank you so much assalamu alaikum"
