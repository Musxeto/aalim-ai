  "title": "Praying 2 rakat Sunnah of Isha & accidentally added a 3rd rakat, can I change my intention to Sunnah",
  "transcript": "Zeba from India. That's right. Yes. Brother, I had three questions. So my first question is while praying the two rakahs of sunnah prayer in the Isha Namaz, so if by mistake I pray three rakahs, can I consider this as witr or should I then again pray the three witr prayer? That is my first question. What did you intend? What did you intend? The two rakahs of sunnah. Khalas, you cannot add or subtract. This is what you intended. If you added the third rakah, the third rakah is void. You can't say, oh okay, just to save time I will consider it to be witr. No. This is void. You have to immediately sit for tashahhud and continue your prayer as two and offer two prostrations of sahw. Second question. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
