  "transcript": "madiha says lizards should be killed is it so the answer is yes the jacob not uh this serbian the djokovic the tennis uh player no the the the house lizards that you see on the walls these lizards are to be killed and the prophet said assam if you kill them in the first strike you get a hundred good deeds if you don't manage to kill it in the first strike because they're too quick and fast and they run here and there but you hit it in the second and you kill it you get lesser good deeds and if you go in the third strike you get lesser and lesser and there was a hadith in that when the idol worshippers built a huge fire to throw ibrahim peace be upon him in it all animals and insects try to put it off except for the lizard it helped them ignite it so our enmity and hatred to the lizard is religious not because it's a repulsive insect which is but because it helped against prophet ibrahim peace be upon him and allah knows the best you"
