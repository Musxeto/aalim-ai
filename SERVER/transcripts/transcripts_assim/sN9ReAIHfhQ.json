  "title": "Missed a rakah in congregation, do we recite Attahiyat & remain silent in tashahhud? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "if we miss at least one Raa in congregational prayer then in the last Raa while sitting should we only recite and remain silent until the IM offer Salam when a person skips one or more raak in congregational prayer he's obliged after the IM offers Salam to stand up and complete the missing of his own Salat this is a upon the issue is now when I'm sitting in the last sitting of the prayer in congregation which is the fourth ra of the IM but it happens to be the third for me I have two options either to say until and remain silent for a minute or two until the IM offers the Salam or I can continue and say and I make Dua until he offers the Salam and I stand up without any doubt no one says do the former and say your T and just sit there watching the chandeliers and looking at people's watches next to you and observing the doesn't make sense you are in Salat there's nothing that you should stay ID without saying or doing anything you have to remember Allah make VI make Dua so the answer to your question is do the latter which is say the whole thing until he offers the Salam then you interrupt it and stand up and finish your prayer"
