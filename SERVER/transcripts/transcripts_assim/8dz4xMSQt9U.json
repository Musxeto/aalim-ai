  "title": "Should we face the grave or the qiblah when making dua in graveyard? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "is it permissible to face the grave when making dua for its occupant for the deceased this depends on the intention if your intention which is the norm for people visiting graveyards is to make dua for the deceased ask allah for forgiveness for the deceased as allah to expand his grave for the deceased then it doesn't matter where you face whether you face the qibla whether you face the cover it's all alike because the prophet hassam after concluding burying one of his companions he used to tell the companions who are alive of course ask allah for forgiveness for your brother and ask allah to make him steadfast as he's being questioned now so the prophet islam ordered them to make dua for him but he did not tell them to face the qibla which means it's not necessary but there are people who do not follow the sunnah who are ignorant of the authentic and correct and pure akida so they may go to cemeteries and to graveyards to make duas for their own selves seeking the blessing of the location thinking that this person is venerated to them so making dua next to his grave is most likely to be answered quickly by allah and this is an innovation this is totally prohibited with this intention and it can be means of shirk it can be means of shirk though you're not calling the deceased the one who's in the grave but thinking that this is a place a blessed area and allah would answer and you're making dua for your own self seeking the blessing of allah this is an innovation if this is the case facing the grave is prohibited totally because for us for yourself you have to face the qibla facing the grave which you think that the person buried there is venerated and glorified and has a status with allah azza this is not permissible at all"
