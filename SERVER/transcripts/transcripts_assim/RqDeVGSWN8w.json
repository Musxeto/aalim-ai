  "transcript": "Selma from the UK [Music] I learned that we aren't allowed to be friends with people who openly sin so does that mean I can't be friends with someone I do not understand that word of what you're saying hello yes um so I learned like we're not allowed to be with people who openly sin um so does that mean we can't like actually be friends with them to change them or we just have to like leave them straight away um and like um I find it kind of hard because like there's not much people who like uh abide by the hijab in my area so does that mean I have to like just be alone and not do anything about it or like first first of all first of all those who openly sin we are not allowed to be with them while they are sinning we can mix with them when they are not committing any sense so if you are a hijabi or a new hobby and there are acquaintance friends that don't abide by the hijab don't go out to public places with them rather you can visit them home they can visit you home and you can meet and hang out together without any problem secondly we have a say in Arabic which means this means a companion is the one who drags you and this is inevitable if you associate with righteous people after a few weeks you'll find you'll yourself compelled to saying alhamdulillah and you find that such terminology Islamic criminology Is frequent and common in your speech because you picked it up and if you hang out with rappers and people who watch movies and this Dunya all what you repeat is lyrics of songs and quotes of movies and a swear words and the likes so the prophet made a parable when he said gave us an example of a good companion and a bad companion of a person who sells perfumes any person who blows the bellows a person who sells the perfumes either you're gonna buy from him and apply the perfume on yourself and has a very beautiful scent to it or he's going to give you a sample to to test or just going in the shop and coming out you'll smell good while those who are working like blacksmiths and blowing the bellows if you go there the Sparks and the fire may burn your clothes and if they did not burn your clothes the least it would do is give you a bad smell that everybody can find and be offended off the same thing with good Companions and bad companions so it's best for you and for your heart to be alone rather than to be among open uh Sinners but if you have a high level of knowledge and Iman and you think you can make a difference and you think you can pull them over to the uh good side then inshaallah you are rewarded and this is permissible um inshallah [Music] and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and the evening I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah foreign"
