  "transcript": "um so sh I wanted to ask that I get discharged after like my periods and it stays on for like whole month so I like stop praying for 15 days and then I start to pray again but my question is that since I get it like all the time and all year do I really need to clean and change uh for every Sal the answer is if you get color discharge throughout the whole month including the seven days or six days of your monthly cycle where you see the flow of blood clearly and you identify this to be your mensis after the six or seven days when the actual flow of blood stops and you get the color discharge with a brownish or yellowish That Remains the whole month until your menes starts again in this case you don't have to wait for the 15 days rather once the six or seven days of your menses are over then you perform your but treat the rest of the month as and what is meant by it is a phase between Purity and actual Menses so what to do you do everything you do when you're pure with so intercourse with the spouse uh praying fasting business as usual the only difference is that the woman in the state of is obliged by the instruction of the Prophet Alam that once the aan is called for a prayer we know that the prayer begins with the aan and ends at a specific time in between if you want to pray your F prayer or any other prayers then you have to change your soiled clothes wash your private part and perform woodo and then you can pray the rest of the time regardless of what discharge is emitted the colored discharge you disregard this and you can pray read the Quran make ta everything you want to do once the time expires you cannot pray the following prayer after the aan until you repeat this process of cleaning yourself and Performing Wu and Allah Knows Best"
