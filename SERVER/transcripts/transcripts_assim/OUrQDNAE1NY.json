  "title": "Is it wrong to trick a baby by showing real food but giving baby food instead? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Nila from Bangladesh. Asalamu alaykumhikum. Sheh. I have a seven months old niece with me. She does not open her mouth when we give her baby foods. But when we try to give her our food, she opens her mouth. So sometimes my family members will make her open the mouth by showing her our food and when she opens it, they will give her baby food. So is this is this cheating and sinful? Inshallah it's not that cheating and that sinful because at the end of the day you are trying to benefit that child by giving her what is good and beneficial for her. So if she doesn't want to eat her own baby food that is good for her and insists on eating biryani which is bad at this age then such a trick is permissible inshallah."
