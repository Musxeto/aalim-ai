  "transcript": "so uh I want to ask what is considered like a helping in s like if I want to go somewhere and uh I ask my friend to pick me up but I know she's going to come alone with a driver so am I sinful for that and like if I hire a made to do something and she doesn't do hijab and a nonam in my house sees her so like am I like sinful for that I'll answer only one question if you ask your friend to pick you up and she comes without a Maham comes alone with the driver either way she's riding with the driver 24/7 and doesn't care about the ruling so you did not commit any Haram because this is how she is and if you need her to pick you up both of you with the stranger or non Maham driver is fine because there's no seclusion so there is no sin on you in this and Allah Knows Best"
