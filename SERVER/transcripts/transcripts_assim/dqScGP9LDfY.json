  "transcript": "which is done in congregation led by Imam is it okay or I have to pray all 14 what 14 what what religion are you following yes sir okay I think we've lost the answer um I don't know what he was talking about to my knowledge which is limited Juma prayer is composed of two rakas only and he was saying something about 14. so I don't know what was he referring to what 14 rakas is he referring to is he referring to the 12 rakas voluntary prayers which we do every single day and the prophet said whoever maintains them Allah will build him a house in Jannah these are the emphatic and whether these are 14 on Friday I don't know how he made this calculation but maybe if he calls again we can uh understand this question a little bit more"
