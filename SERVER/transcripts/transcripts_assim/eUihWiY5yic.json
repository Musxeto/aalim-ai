  "title": "Can we say Bismillah and eat Meat given to us by Non Muslims? (Full Video)",
  "transcript": "then can one eat food in which a Christian mentioned blood of Jesus on eat before servant or when one is eating together is same Bismillah at my end sufficient to eat the food what counts about the food whether it's Halal or Haram is the slaughtering so if we're talking about vegetables and fruit and some Christians says in the name of the blood of Christ or a Buddhist state in the name of Buddha or a Hindu says in the name of Krishna and they present us the food we say Bismillah and eat because whatever they had said does not impact the fruit or the vegetables or the candies or whatever no problem eat if I have meat so someone is serving steak and they say Bismillah or they say in the name of Jesus or they say in the name of Krishna and they serve it that does not impact the meat what impacts the permissibility or the prohibition of consuming that meat is how it was slaughtered so if someone while slaughtering the Sheep says Bismillah any slot is it this is halal meat if someone says Bismillah Allahu Akbar and he stabs the sheep in the stomach or guts it out while alive or bangs it with a hammer in the head or suffocates it until it dies or Electrify it until it dies all of this is called dead meat though he said Bismillah because it was not slaughtered so the two reasons or the two conditions for Amit to be Halal one you have to mention the name of Allah two you have to slaughter it three the person slaughtering it has to be a Muslim Jew or Christian any other religion is unacceptable now the Christians Slaughter and they bring us the food but we don't know what they had mentioned whether it's the name of Jesus or the name of Allah it doesn't matter the default is it is halal unless proven otherwise so coming back again to your question someone presents me with food I look is this food veg or non-veg if it is vegetables fruits candies cakes whatever bread it doesn't matter what they mentioned the name of they mentioned the name of Jin shayatin the food itself is halal I can say Bismillah and eat it if it is non-veg it's an animal I'll have to look into the animal is it pork it's Haram by default is it Lions is it monkeys is it dogs is it cats Haram by default no it is beef or camel or mutton sheep okay then I have to look into the origin of it who's presenting it to me it's a Christian or a Jew they're slaughtering is halal for me I can eat it's a Muslim I can eat it says some other religion I have to refrain I have to investigate how it was slaughtered once I am assured that it is islamically proper I can then eat it and Allah knows"
