  "transcript": "Sumia from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah So my sister, she told me to ask you that she does Hina, she knows how to draw Hina and she wanted to do this during Eid time so that she can get some money but she wanted to know if this would be haram for her because some women would not hide their hands during Eid well if she knows that such women will not hide their hands for certain she's not allowed to assist them on haram but if someone comes to her wearing her niqab and gloves there is no problem in doing her hands and Allah knows best Alhamdulillah"
