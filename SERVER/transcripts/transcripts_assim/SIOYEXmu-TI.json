  "transcript": "sh my question is regarding voluntary or Dua so if someone is someone has chosen a particular time of the day like in the morning or evening or in the in the noon and he does some certain types of zik or Dua at that time not just out of convenience because that time suits him and he knows that it is voluntary atar and is not trying to attribute any to Hadith or anything like that is it allowed or is it uh is it not low it is not at all a problem to specify a specific time for your AAR which are general which are not related for your to your belief that this is more convenient or this is closer to the Sunnah or blah blah blah no it simply is more convenient for you to do them at 10:00 to 10:30 because this is the time you have break for example or the time you don't have anything to do or the time you work out in the gym or any other reason it's not related to religion so this is a time of convenience and it's not related to another form of worship there is no problem in that inshallah"
