  "title": "Ruling on travelling alone in Islam (men) assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Basically speaking, traveling alone is not recommended in Islam. See, Islam encourages unity and being in congregation. The Prophet ï·º said, a rider is a devil, 2 riders are 2 devils, 3 riders are a convoy or a group in a journey. So, it is highly recommended that when you travel, you travel with a group of Muslims to have your back, to help you when you're in need and not to be like someone who goes mountain climbing for example, and then he's stranded and no one to help him, and in order to save himself, he cuts his hand off. Why did you go there in the first place? So, traveling alone is not recommended in Islam. This is when a person is prone to the whispers of Shaytan more than anyone else. Imagine yourself in the Rockies camping alone in a tent, and all what you hear are coyotes and wolves and scorpions, and everything is around you. What do you think Shaitaan is going to say to you? Trust Allah, say the dua. This is unheard of."
