  "transcript": "Quran in one but I requested Allah to make things easy on my nation a second message came that I should recite the Quran in two but again made the same request I was then ordered to recite the Quran in seven and this was reported by IM Muslim in theah so the the first one's bukari the second one is Muslim numerous uh uh hadiths they regarding this issue also with Omar Omar may Allah be pleased with him was in the Masjid and he was praying behind may Allah be pleased with him and he recited and while he was praying and then he heard something different to what he learned so he said I almost cut my prayer and got the man from the neck but then I said no let me finish prayer he finished the prayer and he said who gave you who taught you this he said the prophet liar and he grabbed him from his neck and he pulled him all the way to the prophet and the prophet said what's wrong Omar he said this man claims that you taught him this portion ofan so he asked recite it and Hasam recited it and he asked Omar recite it and he recited it he said both of you are right om don't doubt the religion of Allah don't doubt Quran I requested Allah to give me the Quran on seven and he gave it to me now the most authentic opinion of the scholars that these refer to dialects and as I said we have 40 different opinions but the majority say that this is the true meaning of it can refer to the different ways of pronunciation how you pronounce a word so it's a different pronunciation is the word different it's the same word it also can refer to the different words used for the same meaning so there are different words in the Quan there are different words in the but these words have the same meaning or similar meaning and this also May raise eyebrows because we know that the Quran there's not one single letter that is different well this is not the case this is what we usually say to non-muslims and it was all preserved it is presed deserve but there are different changes and you have to change this and you have to accept these changes because this is Quran this is say no no no we have this only Quran nothing changes no it changes in accordance to Quran with the conditions that we will mention inshallah and this is a science this is this is not something we have to be uh biased about no no no no nothing changes so that people would not cast doubts to us or uh allow them to attack Islam this is Islam we will not say something that is a lie but at the same time we will not conceal the facts that are with us until the pen comes inallah we move to the following uh do this exist today as seven it's an issue among Scholars that they differ why no this is true why some of them say they do not exist and this is the safest way to you know avoid attacks we call it to to dodge bullets when someone shoots at you and you do this you're dodging it so the best way to dodge an attack is say no no these not exist aldah why do you say this because may Allah be pleased with him okay the word or the ay It Was Written like this now I put dots I put Hamza in the beginning it was not written like this it was written like this can you read this I can't so it in the beginning this is how it was written now this word as we recite it can be written is the same exactly the same meaning so there is a recitation where it says so if you're praying behind someone from Morocco and he says and he says no this is the Quran we learned this is so and so this is unbelievable Quran does not change not even one letter this is and he would not re accept this from you and there's a possibility that he may reject Islam says no no no no no I know that is Quran has been preserved and there is no possibility that it can change it did not change did it change this is the copy you have and remember made how many copies five some say seven and it's not fixed whether it's five or or seven and they say that these seven copies all included different so he they made they wrote the Quran in a way that can join and combine all it can be possible to recite all but there are different wordings that are not written in this passion soan wrote a copy this is one of the opinions of the scholars so the different words were used for the same meaning the meaning did not change if you go on to the do they exist well Scholars say a portion that is compatible with the writing it does not differ the writing is a the same or a portion of these is still exist in theic copy so this opinion is accepted whether the are dialects this can be read it can be recited different dialects because it's the same word whether you say tomato or you say tomato is different now because the writing is different so it's the same word with different forms of uh pronunciation when may Allah be pleased with him wrote these five copies each one had different that was different than the other which could not resemble it in writing that's why he made five copies why not one copy and different this is one of the opinion of the scholars if if there is a need to change one word as the was recited this was one of the ways of doing it so what he sent to Sham to Damascus was different to what he sent to kufa 99.9% they were identical but there was a in some of the verses he had to change something because the prophet taught it to companion and he taught it also to others in a different fashion but it was all from the Quran this is one opinion the second opinion which is the choice of Abu may Allah have mercy on his soul and the majority of Scholars that the nowadays do not exist except to the ones that go side my side with the writings of the mus we have today and this is why Allah be pleased with him ask for the second compilation of the Quran why did he ask for it because people were different in their this one recites in this one recites in a different now people are mixed up so he said no write the Quran on the of qur that is it so this is one ruling that the majority of Scholars say and it appears that it is closest to reality and to H of preserving the Quran but again can we say 100% this is the right thing no there are difference among Scholars and we accept this so we finished with it's a very sensitive issue and believe me I only covered the tip of an iceberg because if I would like to go down it will be very difficult not because the information is not authentic because we depend entirely on the Quran and on the Sunnah and we cannot come up with things from our heads and say these exist these are the sorry the they exist and these are the seven 1 two 3 four 5 six seven nobody did this and at the same time we cannot say they do not exist entirely but we can combine and say that the most authentic opinion is that the were given by Allah there are seven the prophet knew it the companions they knew it definitely but we do not have a distinctive ruling on what these are we cannot say that they are these seven therefore we stand idle we cannot say they do not exist because they are mut and we cannot deny anything that is mut it is definitely from the religion it's in bukari it's in Muslim it's everywhere but at the same time we cannot elaborate and say they are this and this and this we definitely know the Prophet knew it the companions knew it we don't have the knowledge of it that's why we stand back and believe in it without elaborating a lot on it we move on to and maybe after finishing this would a little bit clarify a little bit not more uh uh inshallah the are a particular methodologies of reciting the Quran it's a different way of reciting Quran so each has a way of reciting the Quran is it the different Quran it's the same are they reading from the same book yes but each one has a way and this way deals with uh deals with pronounciation of certain words and instead of saying maybe one says four maybe one says six one says all of these things you cannot translate into English but there are ways of T that you say a word and you pronounce a word with is a way of reciting and are attributed to what is who is a he's a person who recites but a professional reciter and the origin of these were when when may Allah be pleased with him made these copies of the Quran and sent it to the regions he did not send it by DHL he sent it with aari IM and he taught the people to uh theseis to convey and to teach the people the which was approved by all the Companions and this was the har of qu now we have to remember that all theseis took the originally from Seven famous SC companions sahaba among them wasman and Ali so was one of the master of to teach people andman a lot of people take him and for granted take him lightly and may because of the bad uh uh media and propagation of some of the enemies of Islam the enemies of Allah they tarnish his reputation so when you hear Abu Bakr and Omar it's overwhelming no one can come close to them no one can say any bad thing about them because even them when they say bad things about them you know they look under the ground and and sorry but this is what we have to say no one can tarnish the reputation because his rule was longer and there were a lot of stories that were inserted into his s from the liars and from those who fabricated Hadith they in Inc incorporated it into his s and the S unfortunately that the history was based on four almost four of the enemies of Islam who were and they put all these bad things about baate they put all the bad things about Abu Bakr Omar which all are not founded and not true so may Allah be pleased with him people don't know Allah lot except that he was rich and that he married not one two of the daughters of the prophet and that he gave generously to the cause of Islam the prophet said nothing would harm after today whatever he does Allah will forgive him and this is a cart Blane as they say it is a check that is signed and you put whatever amount you want from the prophet may Allah be pleased with him was one of the most knowledgeable people of Quran so when he called zit to compile the Quran he did not do this because he was not qualified he was more qualified but he wanted to be objective he is a manager so you do the work I revise it was reported that on Haj season the successor the came and said after is all of a sudden I looked behind the Mak and there was and he started praying he said Allah he started with until he went he read the whole Quran in one ra and then he made he made one W after until before the whole Quran he recited it by heart not by holding it in his hand so may Allah be peace with him was one of the greatest reciters of Quran and that is why when we learned that he compiled the Quran he ordered zit he ordered zit while he himself was a famous person to recite Quran also was known among those to have a copy of his own of the Quran from the time of the prophet of course it was burnt along with the old other copies so that they can only rely and depend on the approved copy that was compiled by all the companions there was also Abu musar and ab D they were also knowledgeable people who taught others the Quran we have uh zbb and a number of other abdah of course all of these are the seven most famous people that all the we have come from them through them because every even now in India you have someone who says I have a license and if you look at his license you find out that it leads to the prophet his took it from his from his to or to abdah or to or to any one of the seven famous again the seven has not to do with the or with the it is different but it so happened that the number is confusing here whether it's or or the companions may Allah be pleased with them all right the also are attributed to the the way that you recite this uh uh verse or this Surah the manner as mentioned before uh and it's attributed to the seven part who will mention their names or to the 10 because there are an addition three parties and we will mention the condition conditions as well why do we attribute it to these people are they companions no are they some of them and some of so why do you attribute these to them because they were the head the leaders in this field uh but okay I don't know how this was arranged was this my presentation it's bro broken down it's breaken broken down a lot okay now I'm confused they represent the various ways that the companions learned the Quran from the prophet so as we said we have seven companions and they had students but these students are not and I repeat they're not limited to seven they're not limited to 10 they're not even limited to 40 they are Beyond count are Beyond count but why do we limit them in seven this is the work of Ahmed muah this is his work his way of looking at things but this does not mean it's limited in them originally why did we present this why didn't we leave it as it is because when the companions relayed the Quran to their students and their students went into the different countries and related"
