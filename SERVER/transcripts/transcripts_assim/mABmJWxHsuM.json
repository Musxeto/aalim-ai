So are you asking me if the Sheikh has no hair, he's bald, can he do Ruqya? Yes. To fix his baldness? Yes. This is possible but most likely it would not have an impact because this is something that can be inherited, it can be to many other reasons. It's like when someone has a broken arm and they say okay I would like to make Ruqya. You have to put in a cast, you have to go to an orthopedic surgeon and fix it. So no no no, I'll just do Ruqya, it will not be fixed. So Ruqya is not magic, you have to take the necessary means for that but nevertheless yes go ahead and do it."
