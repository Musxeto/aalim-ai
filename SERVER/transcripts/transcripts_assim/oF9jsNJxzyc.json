  "transcript": "um sometimes we make Dua for something so hard but the Dua doesn't get accepted and the opposite happens in this situation we lose hope and we feel like none of our Dua will get accepted th way we want but you said when we make Dua in the time of acceptance like in suud the Dua get accepted in the way we want but I failed I feel like my Dua doesn't get accepted the way I want even though I'm doing everything correctly what to do in this situation to get my duas accepted the problem is not in getting your Dua accepted this is a minor issue the problem is in you being a real Muslim or not you see when you make Dua I'm not talking to a colleague at my company hey Ahmed bring me a sandwich with you and a cup of coffee please I'm asking you this is a colleague when I'm talking to my Superior my director my supervisor my CEO I wouldn't say get me a sandwich and black coffee no milk no sugar I would say I have a request and I don't know if it's difficult or not if it's possible or not but still I'm going to make it I beg you to do the following things if it's possible there's no inconvenience now my boss has the right to reject my request and say you're crazy go and ask someone else go ask ask the coffee boy do it yourself I don't work for you and I wouldn't be offended I would be okay no hard feelings no harm done thank you the problem with you belly is that you are talking to the owner of the Universe and everything in it to the creator of the Heaven and the Earth and everything in it to the one who possesses all the treasuries in this universe yet you show your disappointment you're expressing your despair whether you say it or not it's in here and Allah knows what's in here and this is much much worse than your prayers being answered or not because you don't know who you're calling who you're begging who you're asking do you think Allah is obliged to obey you or to answer your prayer or to do whatever you want of him then you don't know who you are and most certainly you don't know who Allah is we are mere Servants of Allah we're nothing compared to this universe literally nothing yet Allah showers his favors and blessings and mercy upon us all and he gives us before asking and he gives us folds and fold holds more than we ask so when we once ask him for something that he knows that it is not good for us or that postponing it is better for us or he tests us to see how we behave if it doesn't come as we want we fail miserably so you have to scrutinize your thinking with your Iman and and increase your Iman because you have a really serious problem in knowing who Allah is and knowing who you are in reality you have no other solution but to beg express your poverty show your humility to Allah asael hoping that he answers your prayer but if he doesn't you attribute this to your own shortcomings and flaws and your sins while still revering Allah asael praising him and glorifying him and showing your gratitude for whatever you have only then Allah would give you what you need and not what you want and Allah Asel Knows Best"
