  "title": "Should I teach my kid to fight back? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "neither says my husband taught my three-year-old that if anyone pushes you you push them back should I support him in this what should I teach my child to do when someone pushes him intentionally first of all this is a delicate situation we have to understand that we cannot teach our children to be aggressive and to be offensive and at the same time we must not teach our children to be a punching bag and allow every time they can have it to step on them we have to carry the balance so yes if someone pushes you you push them back you stand up for yourself don't allow people to take your stuff at the same time instill in them feelings of generosity being kind tolerance doing good to the others so that the child would grow up with balance insha allah azza wajal"
