  "transcript": "Asna from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Barakatuhu I am struggling with the pronunciations of some Arabic letters. I can pronounce all letters except Ghayn and Fuad. I am struggling with those letters. I hear you saying it beautifully. So, it seems to me that Shaytan is messing up with your head. So, what's the problem? Recite it to me if you wish. I don't think I can do it because I am having some problems with my technique. Okay, if you have problems with such pronunciations, the easiest of all solutions is say it silently. When you say, غير المغضوب عليهم ولا ضالين and you have problems with Daad or Sirat, you just say it silently. Listen. I said it perfectly. Yeah, but I didn't hear it Sheikh. You don't have to. Saying it silently exempts you from the whispers of Shaytan. Did my tongue reach the ceiling of my throat? Or did I do this right? No, just move on and Inshallah things will be fine."
