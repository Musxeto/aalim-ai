  "transcript": "Jeremiah raheem alhamdulillahi rabbil aalameen Wow Sun Devils LD model Maruti rahmatan lil Adam II nabina muhammad wa ala alihi wa sahbihi woman instead of a Westen a vision that he Diomedes morado assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wa barakato today we shall begin insha'Allah with a new chapter on or with the new section on wills and inheritances so first of all what is meant by will what is a will so a will is to give the ownership of something to an entity or an individual providing this takes place after death of the person writing the will whether this is in wealth property or benefits and this word was a is derived from connecting to that person or the entity that a individual wants to give to after his death what are the wisdoms of it there's so many among them would be that people when they're alive they may be a bit careful over what they have a bit stingy a bit negligent and Islam wanted to give us room to be able to give away something that would benefit us after death so this is a chance to catch up even if a person had died yet still he may have the possibility the chance to make a difference by giving something of what he possesses now when we talk about Messiah will most people think that this refers only to the financial aspects so I write in my will I give X amount of money to this person or to that organization that's it and this is not entirely true was he can refer to keeping part of the wealth of the money to individuals you make a will that they take care of your family of your kinship of your children of the orphans of how it is spent that is the wealth and the greatest will of all is when you advise your heirs religiously so most great wills contain and advice to the children to the wives not to mourn in a sense that is Haram such as wailing and tearing the clothes or pulling out the hair etc expressing their sorrow and grief this is all Haram this is wailing and it's a major sin advising the children to observe salat on time to protect your legacy and name not to cause problems with others etc and also you can have general ways of rossia where you will ask and this would be a recommendation some say would be an obligation that your daughter would be given in marriage by such-and-such guardians people whom you think that would take care of a good selection likewise if you leave orphans who would take care of them who would be their Guardian and look after them and their wealth among other things so in short this issue of writing a will is mentioned in the Quran it is mentioned in the authentic Cigna and it is the consensus of all scholars that it is permissible to leave a will and we will come to whether it's permissible or mandatory or recommended or prohibited in the Quran so many places Allah says as thousand-member D was he getting your CB ha outing when speaking about inheritances about inheritance Allah says this division is done after a will or a debt to be paid off and this is why the scholars said that there are 4 rights that must be taken from the wealth of a deceased so the minute one of us dies there are four rights and they come piled it into the Arabic word tattooed T in Arabic that the letter tap done Wow mean tattoo so the first thing when a person dies is that we block his wealth so no one has the right to take from his ATM from his bank account from his wallet because this is now the heirs wealth not the wives not the children so the moment he dies his financial must be secured and the first thing to take from his wealth is the letter tab in Arabic which is the beginning of tetazoo and janaza the preparation of the funeral so if we need money to hire someone to come and wash the deceased body if we need money to buy shrouds if we need money to buy perfume all of this is taken from his wealth if we need money to buy a spot where we can bury him in because some countries don't have public cemeteries that you bury people for free the insists that you buy a plot of land or a family space where you can be buried in so we have to take the money from his wealth the wife and children say no no no no no we this is our money we are the heirs we need to divide the money now unfortunately this what happens after a person dies everybody like hyenas wild hyenas they jump and want to take their share which we will come to discuss later on Hashanah so the first thing we do is take the inheritance take what is needed to prepare the corpse of the deceased after that we have the letter Dan the D and this is allocated for the deaths so before we give a penny to any of the heirs we call out people we check his will if he had left that's behind we have to pay them off so one says well he didn't leave a lot of cash in this case we have to sell the property but my mother lives in the house this is not our responsibility yet the deceased death meant that all of his assets must be allocated for these four things that we've just mentioned first priority preparation of the funeral secondly paying off his debts so we sell the house we sell but the plots we sell the stocks we sell whatever we can sell just to pay off his debts and the debts are not something that are hearsay so if I come and I say listen your father borrowed from me a hundred thousand dollars okay uncle we respect you we believe you but you have to have two witnesses testify we had no witnesses okay then uncle we need a document proving that we have no documents okay uncle cycle ahead this is the exit you can leave whatever you want after thanking your team this is rude I know but this is not a charity organization anyone claiming that he gave money we give him without proof and evidence otherwise the whole neighborhood will come and claim that he borrowed something from them so we have to pay off the debts tah-dah Wow the letter W which stands in English and Arabic to will after we prepare the funeral and paid for it after we have paid off all of his debts he still has money then we have to look into the will that he left behind either testifying to men about on that issue that I leave so and so to so and so or he wrote a document and authenticated it with the signature or with a lawyer or something that is credible and legal and beyond all doubt so we execute the will as we will come and see and see how to do that finally the fourth right which is mean which is the heirs the inheritance now we can divide the inheritance according to the Sharia law after all these rights were cleared with the grace of Allah so when we come to the issue of will what is recommended in what is Haram and what is mandatory what is permissible etc so the permissible will is the one that when you have a lot of money and remember that this is a common note when we ever speak about will the will is recommended is needed when you have a lot of money and it becomes prohibited when you do it it means that are not permissible and it becomes McCraw and not preferred when your money is little and your heirs are a lot so you have to always consider that writing a will is when you have plenty of money left behind now the first thing you have to pay attention to is that there is a limitation in terms of how much you can write a well for and in terms of who to you can write a well for so in terms of amount the prophet alayhi assalam in authentic hadith visited one of his great companions sad did nearly Wow may Allah be pleased with him one of the ten heaven bounded he was so sick that he thought that he were going to die and that was at the beginning of Islam when he only had two daughters so he said o prophet of Allah I am thinking of getting close to death how much would I write a will giving away a portion of my money can I write two thirds he said no can I write a half he said no can I write a third the Prophet said a third and a third is a lot so he approved Ali slots and that when you want to write when you want to donate when you want to give after your death you're entitled to give away one-third of your wealth and he said that one third is a lot this is why even I've asked may Allah be pleased with the man with his father said I wish people would write their wills not more than a quarter because the Prophet said a third is a lot but the Prophet is not prohibited so a third is your limit a third of what a third of what ever a deceased left behind and this is why we have to calculate the possessions and the wealth of the deceased before distributing it so it's not sensible to just divide what he has in the bank account and few months later we calculate how much is this and how much is that how much stocks he has if he had jewelry if he had expensive watches no the thing is you should calculate and estimate the value of everything he left behind the plots the house our houses the cars his clothes the furniture in the house his valuable personal things such as watches pens cufflinks if he had stocks in different companies if he had bank accounts if he had investments here and there all of this is calculated and then we look at the will if he says I leave one-third of what I have two charity organizations to that TV two-piece TV to hood a TV or to the Islamic Center in West Virginia or to a publication that publishes Islamic knowledge and information for free or for taking poor pilgrims to perform Hajj every year etc whatever this has to be executed as he wished so 1/3 is the max now when we come to the types of wills we have a will that is recommended what is that will it is a will where I write that after my death 1/3 1/4 I always drop the mic this or that much to be given out after my death why do we say this is recommended because if you have a lot of money and after giving away 1/3 your children will still be very very well-off then it's best that you benefit yourself remember that the Prophet said in the hadith of Sodom nay Aviva pass after he told him that a third is a lot he said it is best for you to leave your heirs well off than leaving them begging people for money so yes giving money away it means of charities could only if you have a lot of wealth that would not require children to beg after you now will can be mandatory and this is logical to most people when is the will is considered to be mandated either when there are rights related to me or there are rights related to others kindly explain I will do that rights related to me such as I was negligent I did not perform hajj during my lifetime so i a locate an amount to be taken so that after my death people would perform hajj on my behalf a myself oh of course you are but this is the least you could do is a cut money I feel that I'm gonna die soon and my zakat is due in maybe like a couple of weeks three weeks I don't know if I'm gonna be around to pay it so I have to write a will saying that my zakat is on the 1st of Muharram and if I die calculate it if I die within the period and give it out on my behalf expirations I swore and broke my oath couple of times I need to fit 10 or 20 poor people or Allah knows how much and I didn't so you write a will that they take money and give it to your expiation above all if I have debts towards others now this e these are rights related to others so I borrowed a hundred thousand from my best friend I didn't write the paper we didn't have witnesses and I know that if I die and he comes asking for his money my children will say uncle with all due respect drink your coffee and leave we don't you don't have any evidences how can we believe you so it's a must upon me to write a document stating that my best friend had given me a hundred thousand and you have to return it back to him likewise if I gave my best friend alone or someone else or my uncle so I have to write down because this money now belongs to my heirs if I have documents to support it that hamdulillah if I don't then it's my word after death against his and the judge would ask him to swear by Allah that he did not borrow anything from me and then he's off the hook in this world but in the day of judgment may Allah make it easy for all of us so this is all part of the mandatory will some scholars and they are minority they looked at Alma's verse stating prescribed for you when death approaches any one of you if he leaves wealth is that he should make a bequest for the parents and near relatives according to what is acceptable a duty upon the righteous so near relatives have rights the vast majority look at this ayah and say that this was abrogated some scholars say Allah said prescribed fry for you Couty ballet which is mandating it so there are a number there is a number of scholars that say that this is not abrogated it's mandatory if you are rich condition 1 2 and you have near relatives who are not heirs who will not inherit you like cousins uncles etc who are poor and needy it's a must that you leave them something behind in your will but it seems that the majority of scholars are correct and this is abrogated the third type of inheritance is the unrecovered and we gave an example when a person has little money so he's all what he has is $500 oh but he left behind in his bank account is $500 and he has six children so he wants to donate one-third of it in his will mother Aisha may Allah be pleased with her was asked a man having an X amount of money which is little and six children what will should he write she said he should donate the money to his church six children it's not a donation they were inherited meaning that he should not at all write it as a well because this is unfair to the children and finally it can be Haram the will can be prohibited and when is that it will can be prohibited if a man increases the amount of money to exceed the third when he knows that the prophets have said that you have only 1/3 to give away and how is that so I I come if I especially in countries that give president and give a priority to man-made law so if I'm in the States and I write my in my will that I leave all of my wealth to my dog or to the Islamic center or to this or that by law they will accept this and they will give all the money to whom I designated it to in my will in Islam this is totally Haram this is prohibited I can only give 1/3 so in a Muslim country the Muslim judge would look at this will and only allocate 1/3 of my wealth to that person or that area that I had designated it to but not the whole thing so it's Haram to give more than 1/3 it is also prohibited and Haram to write in your will something for one of your heirs and this happens a lot so I have wealth and I write in my well in my will that the house I live in would not be divided by the rules of Sharia rather it is belonging to my wife and I give it to my wife this is prohibited because your wife by default if you have children will get 1/8 of your property and if you don't have children she'll get 1/4 of all what you possess to come and add something to that more than what Allah has legislated that this would be a transgression and it is prohibited now some books of Phil go into details and some of these details have evidences to back them up and some are just HD had this is what the scholars came up with for example they said that there are conditions that the testator the one who writes the well he has to have conditions and this is acceptable he has to be an adult he has to be sane he has to have a sound mind does he have to be a Muslim No so even a non-believer a disbeliever can write a will and it should be executed there's no problem but again his will must not exceed 1/3 because Allah ordered us to rule with our Sharia over such matters so the testator has to be an adult saying sound mind qualified to make a donation owner of things I cannot write in my will I give my neighbor's house as a gift to an Islamic organization I don't possess his house how can I write a well what I don't possess it without what I don't own it and it has to be from a person who can donate so if I were a slave I cannot write a will giving anything away because all what I own belongs to my master and some scholar said that if a child who's in his sound mind and is able to choose but he did not reach age of puberty if he writes a will for example to take care of what is needed to be taken care of it is valid but this is redundant and this is Elementary so if a child says in his will take from my money after I die such and such so that you can prepare my body for burial and to buy shrouds and this is done without saying but if he says take from my money one-third and give it to the Masjid this is an issue of dispute is he entitled to give while he's alive that says no because he does not have the sound mind to do so and to do the right choice likewise they said if someone was me weak in his mind and he makes a charity it should be carried through and again this is an issue of dispute and we don't know sound evidences backing it up and it could open a lot of doors that are not needed so the conditions again about the person writing the will the condition of the recipients the beneficiaries that they are not any of his heirs I cannot write a will to my parents to my children to my wife they're all inheriting by default so any will I write to them would be ignored of course we mean financial will a portion of my possessions but if I wrote a well advising them to fear Allah to abide by Islamic laws etc of course this is yummy valid and acceptable what else one of the ways of bypassing some of the difficulties such as if my parents are disbelievers they know that when they die I cannot inherit them so they would like to write a will I tell them that this is acceptable if I write a will for you after my death or you write a will for me after your death be as long as it does not exceed one third of your wealth this is permissible and la social knows best we move on to the the questions so we have najiba says is it okay my girls ten and eight years old playing with boys in school i do teach them not to play with but they are kids ten eight are usually young so if they're playing with same age of boys Shabba this is tolerable though it is highly recommended that you immediately take the ten-year-old out of school and put her in an islamic segregated school this is the age where their eyes open and boys in their twelve and thirteen years get the age of puberty and is not safe I have seen girls in the US and Europe who reached the age of 12 and 13 and were pregnant so it is something to be scared of and you have all the right to fear for your children but you can't put fuel next to fire and ask it not to ignite this what happens in mixed public schools and you have to do something about it and Alonzo gel knows best so Habib says one last question please to me it's the first while combining prayer can I pray Risha first then Margaret if Asia time is coming to end very close to midnight so one decided to pray first Tricia then Margaret I am presuming South that you have a legitimate reason for delaying Risha this law so if you delayed Malory intentionally without any legitimate reason and came to the end of Asia time and wanted to do yes this is permissible but you cannot pray mother if mother is gone because you delayed it until the time came out without any legitimate reason but if a person went to bed after a so you're so tired he was sick he was this use that only to wake up at 11:15 p.m. skipping mother Benicia knowing that Trisha time ends at 11:25 so he has 10 minutes to offer a prayer we in this case tell him pressure first then make up for mother because if you prayed mother which has already been missed and you're making it up this will make Aisha being made up as well so to minimize the losses you are instructed to prayer Asia on time because the time is still do you and afterwards you pray Maghrib which is to be made up whether at the time of ratio or afterwards it doesn't make any difference allah azzawajal knows best Roseanne says what should be recited in such that sell all types of salute whether such that itself or such the to sugar or says that too till our recitation you recite what is normal subhana wa BL Allah will be hungry also hanna barbera allah alone this is up to you if you want to add afterwards something that might be prescribed from the sunnah there is no problem in regards of Ceuta so there isn't anything prescribed for you to recite except subhanAllah Bella Nita says does thunder or storm bring any form of evil with it I don't know if we had answer this question before but the answer is this depends if Allah wanted that storm to be a torment to a nation or to a person then it has some torment in it and if not then it is to intimidate people to feel Allah Azza WA JAL and it can be a blessing it was reported that remark NAMBLA Aziz may Allah have mercy on his soul was in Hajj one day with the khalifa of the time I think it was already night with medical or a big medical one I don't remember and there was a thunderstorm and everybody was so afraid except Rama was smiling and in having a good time so the high leaf asked him why are you smiling he sits of han allah allah azza wajal tells us about this rain to be the signs of his mercy and people are intimidated and afraid this is Allah's mercy coming to us so this is again depending on the person's positivity and negativity and how he reacts to such things so I hope this answers your question abdel I've been a crumb it crumb it's not one of Allah's name so you have to change your name the Quran says is it sinful to watch news channels with star with music so I will presume that the news channel has anchors and you're talking about female anchors or they're interviewing stars artists actors and actresses etc and there is music music is prohibited for you to listen to and watching such stars and celebrities tarnish is your heart filled that fills it with darkness and it might kills it looking at these actors and actresses and singers and performers and entertainers this darkens your heart and takes you away from Allah these are people of sin they endorse it they publicize it and they they advertise and ask people to come and join it looking at them would reduce the amount of Eman in your heart without any doubt myah myah says what is the ruling about photography photography is an issue of dispute in a nutshell taking photographs of men and children beyond or below the age of puberty is permissible taking pictures of women without a legitimate reason and keeping them saving them is prohibited hanging pictures of anyone living creatures is prohibited and Elijah knows best the Quran says what if I ask duaa by raising hands after the vicar well salat is a form of worship vicar is a form of worship dua is a form of worship where do we learn our forms of worship from from the prophet alayhi salatu salam which means that any innovation in religion is rejected and not accepted this is why scholars say that we cannot maintain a form of worship that the Prophet did not do allah wa salli wa sallim ala muhammad the prophet prayed and the Prophet ordered us to make duaa while institute in our prayer and after the salutation before salam in our prayer after Salam he ordered us and he showed us how to do with liquor but there was no dua so those who insist on raising their hands and making Dharma after every faults a lot we tell them that this is wrong and this is an innovation Zaha Jeanine Amador ovale God says I'm a river to Islam my husband was a born Muslim but he was not practicing and he does not like to live in the law of Islam I want to live by the law of Islam what should I do this is too generic Zahra because when you say that he doesn't want to live by the law of Islam did he commit an act of apostasy did he declare that he doesn't love Islam did he abandon salat is he now a non-muslim if the answer is yes you cannot stay with him you have to immediately leave the house and apply for a separation based on these facts that is an apostate if he is not a Muslim if he still pretends to be Muslim you have to apply for Haller and we've talked about the rules of color Abu nor Hanna says regarding the Salah social distance which is not mentioned the Quran and the hadith but currently doing now in the world for Muslim countries as mentioned that is an innovation and due to this new German Sallah procedure in not is not mentioned Quran the hadith so I did not pray in the masjid is it permissible that i pray in home with my wife and children until back to normal the salat in the masjid this is an issue of dispute we discussed this so many times some scholars say that praying with the social distancing and the mask is better than abandoning the salat in the masjid so in order to keep it active and working we have to do that other scholars say that this is an innovation and the need for such social distancing is not urgent it's not like when a person is infected with Black Plague for example that would kill him in 4 or 5 days we can see that if someone is having literacy or someone who is active contagious and is sick yes it stem tells us stay away from but never ever we found the fear to exceed what is actual now what the wh o is telling us is that we have to fear 7 billion inhabitants of Earth and assume that they are infected and this is insane to come and instruct people to wear masks and to keep social distancing when others are normal said yeah they are normal but they might have a virus one of them one of a thousand whatever ten thousand one of a million and how would I live for the rest of my life after this the WH Show tells you only to look at the tip of your nose countries that are enforcing so distancing and the likes enforcing they're doing this because their their failure in accommodating the ICU cases they don't have capacity not that they think that this is a necessity they're afraid that they will reach a level where they cannot accommodate all of these infected if you look at the fatalities and measure it to the rate of infected people you will find that it's less than 2 percent so 2 percent of your population dying is not a big deal in order for the economy to move on in order for the people to pray and message in order for them to resume their normal life but when you scare the heck out of them and you make people live in fear intimidated tomorrow they announce that covered 19 is gone forever do you think that the WHL would allow people to go without masks without social distancing I doubt it so I'm against the theory conspiracy but I'm the same time against dismantling Islamic law due to this no handshakes ok this is part of my religion the Prophet tells us whenever we handshake our sins fall like leaves of fees no hugging when someone comes from abroad maybe he's infected no eating from the same plate okay this is soon as prophesied the Baraka is there said well that was at the time of the Prophet there's no buttock anymore I would whenever a young Seon J you have to be careful we have to take the means take the means when there is a real need for that when the someone is sick in front of me but to assume that he's sick and I'm not doing this said yeah this is the best thing doctor's advice what about my wife isn't there a possibility that she's sick as well why not cut us from one another and not let us meet what about my children living him - no no they live in the house it's okay who said it's okay maybe they went out and brought it back to me so this is not logical using the miswak if I have a miswak definitely the doctors would say don't use miswak it was exposed to air so what do you want me to do keep my mouth shut not breathe this is too much and I can go on and on in Islamic tradition where it goes head-on against what the doctors are telling us because it is not a fact yes this is a patient I wear my mask I don't shake hands I stay away but to assume and presume that the hundred thousand other people who are totally healthy they can man they may be infected now I believe that this is too bogus so what to do this depends on the person and individual if you feel okay with wearing the mask and going to pray in the masjid because you love the message then you're afraid that it would be abandoned and and and boycotted by others just go ahead and do that if you feel that this is an innovation and you can't pray with masks on you feel like a muzzled dog as some people said and you prefer to pray with your children and wife this is a Charla permissible when it comes to Friday you have to pray in the message even with the social distancing because this missing or skipping at 3 Fridays in a row would seal your heart and Allah knows best ham rule says I have a friend whom I loved for the sake of Allah he is a very good Muslim sometimes when he makes an obvious mistake I remind him that this is wrong but he doesn't accept his wrongdoing and gets so offended that changes his attitude with me for a long time what kind of relation should I have with him well first of all this is true genetic again I don't know the kind of mistakes you're talking about I don't know if you are right and these are two mistakes or you're assuming or you're choosing the safest opinion secondly it is obvious that you are a bit controlling because we all have friends and relatives that we tell them that this thing is wrong and we move on we don't persist and insist on them changing immediately or raising the white flag accepting their guilt and shortcomings now this is not right the right thing to do you gave an advice move on Hamas you've done your due diligence you've done your duty but to insist that every time you seem you did not change you did not stop what I told you is Haram why are you doing this are you a hypocrite nobody accepts is Safi so if you are the type that I've just mentioned maybe it's best best to take a step back and relax a bit and stop doing what you're doing because I could I would not blame your friend for yani avoiding you and Allah knows best Rabia Ahmed says I'm am I allowed to make a simple and single drop without adding drop of glorification to Allah and without the salutation to our beloved Prophet Ali saw some acid yes if I want to ask Allah o Allah forgive forgive my sins no problem if I want to say o Allah pay off my debts no problem so Allah my card is not working let the mechanic find what's faulty and fix it with the cheapest cost possible no problem however praising Allah offering salutation upon the Prophet Isis I would make your chances of getting answered more likely for what incident the Prophet entered the message a little of Sam and he heard a man making dua and he said this person is haste and he told him that to make dua you have to praise Allah and then offer salutation and in another hadith the Prophet said that is awesome the door is blocked between the heavens and the earth until one offers salvation upon me so when you make a single door like you have just mentioned and you do not praise the Prophet a least you praise allah azzawajal enough facilitation upon the Prophet Allah your chances are less in getting your door answer and allah azzawajal knows best this is all the time we have until we meet next time on Monday I leave you fear man in love Salam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
