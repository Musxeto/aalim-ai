  "transcript": "smelly rahmani raheem alhamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa nibiru rahmatan lil alamin nabina muhammad in wada and he massabi ajma'in Badu assalamu alaykum warahmatullahi wa barakato when you see people competing running when you look at sprinters approaching the end line you see that they give all what they have because this is the final moment this is what makes it or breaks it tonight we have the same feeling these are the ten blessed nights the last ten blessed nights of Ramadan whenever they started the Prophet array sought was salam used to change his entire system he as mother Aisha and others say used to tighten his waist wrapper and this is a metaphor for not having intercourse with his wives and some say no this is also a metaphor for wanting to do hard labor and to work this is what you do when you want to do that and he used to wake up his wives normal nights he would create night prayer on their own they want to pray it's okay they don't they want to sleep this is their preference it's not mandatory but on the last 10 nights of ramadan he used to wake all of his wives and he used to spend the night time in prayers reading the quran during this blessed ten nights it was a sunnah from the Prophet SM to perform a decaf and now unfortunately with the lockdown may allah's ocean uplifted from the whole world we are unable to perform a decaf in the messages so many people ask can we perform it in the houses and the answer is no this is not permissible it cannot be performed in prayer halls or in homes it has to be performed in messages and the etiquettes of ehtekaf are so many but this is not the time to talk about it we would like to focus on the last 10 nights why are they so blessed what is so special about them scholars say that during these blessed last 10 nights of ramadan there is a single night and this is why we strive to worship allah and excel in these last 10 blessed nights not because of the last 10 nights but rather because we don't know which night of them is this glorious night known as lailatul cut off the night of decree and this beautiful night allah azza wajal has favoured with a number of things among them this is the blessed night that the Quran was revealed in as mentioned in the Quran in and zelner who feel a little cutter we have revealed the Quran in lailatul other and even our best says may Allah be pleased with him and with his father that the Quran came from the preserved tablet to bethe larysa to the house of pride and honor and then from there it came over different occasions over the period of 23 years this blessed night the Angels descend in a lot of numbers due to its Baraka do it's using as we know the Angels descend whenever there is vicar whenever there's recitation of the Quran this is a blessed safe night where the devils can't do evil and can't harm people as they used to in other nights in this blessed night there is less torment and punishment and a lot of reward and safety because of what individuals offer to get closer to Allah and to seek His forgiveness in this blessed night allah azza wajal divides the provisions for his creation for a whole year so everything is divided coming down from the preserved tablet to the angels so that it would be given to the people among the blessings of this blessed night is what the Prophet told the Sarah his salat was sinner he said he comes a month the month of Ramadhan which Allah has obliged upon you to fast in it the gates of the heavens are open and the gates of hell are closed and masters of the jinn and the devils are chained in this month there is a night better than a thousand month whoever is deprived from its goodness he's deprived from anything that is good so this night you should look for the Prophet said that is awesome whoever prays the night of other believing in the believing in it and anticipating the reward from Allah Azza WA JAL Allah would forgive all of his sins subhanAllah so why was this night hidden well this night was hidden so that people would do their level best in seeking it and trying to find out which night it is the prophet alayhi salat wa sallam told us that we should look for it in the odd nights and in another hadith he told us that to look for it for nine nights left seven nights left five nights left three nights left etc but scholars say we do not know nine nights left unless the month is over because the month can be 29 and it can't be 30 so nine nights left is different when it's 29 then nine nights left when it's thirty and therefore it is not true that people think that it has to be the night of the 21st 23rd 25th 27th and 29th this is not true it can also be the night of the 22nd 4th 6 8 therefore one has to devote his time to worshipping allah azzawajal in the whole last 10 nights doing what night prayer option number one the best in the highest so you spend 2 hours 3 hours 5 hours holding the Quran reading from it praying to allah azza wajal this is what the Prophet used to do ELISA so in the Companions option to recite the Quran without prayer option 3 make a lot of duaa if you go to chapter 2 Surat al-baqarah you will find verses about fasting ramadan and how it is when a person is sick or on or traveling when to make it up etc and then you find verses about ehtekaf and when to refrain from eating and drinking etc so these are all connected about fasting Ramadan there is a one ayah that comes in between dividing these and it is about Dora when My servants ask you about me say that I'm close I answer the door of people who call upon to me so devote a lot of time for dora mother Aisha the Dora she learned from the prophetess er alum in the careful one - hubba-wha - so you repeat that and you make whatever dua you want fourthly you got tired from praying from reciting Quran from making dua McVicker the best of the curse of hanuman hamdulillah for Lila in Allah it doesn't matter which one you begin with you want something else listen to a beneficial lecture that gets you closer to Allah that's often Jews your heart do whatever you can to reach Allah so John and finally this hadith or story circulating among the people that every night of Rama the last 10 nights of ramadan give $1 because this is better than 83,000 whatever they have this calculation and pray 2 rakaats because this is better than this and that and call your next of kin feed a poor person all of this is baseless and not true these oh this night is better than a thousand months better but it doesn't say that your good deeds would be multiplied accordingly it is better and we should leave it as it is what did the Prophet used to do Alice Oh Sarah what you have heard from prayers reciting Quran making dhikr making duaa and any good deeds that you can afford i pray to allah azza wajal that he makes me a new among those who win because whoever is deprived from its goodness he is by allah deprived from all types of good either Allahu Alem was allah allahu allah ma barik ala nabina muhammad why lad he was happy he is mine"
