  "transcript": "uh amina says can we brush our teeth instead of doing the miswak before every salah and get the same sunnah reward of doing miswak see miswak is this little twig and scientists nowadays say that the material in this arak twig has many many benefits medically the sunnah is to use this the prophet used to use it and he used to highly recommend it before praying and while doing wudu and he said had i not feared that i would burden my umm i would have instructed them to do it with every wudu in another narration with every prayer so it is a highly recommended sunnah without any doubt some scholars looked into the act itself so is it the twig that adds value or is it cleansing and purifying the mouth with any other tool that does the job so a lot of the scholars say that if you use a toothbrush that does the same job of cleaning your teeth though it does not have the same material but they say it is the act of brushing your teeth cleaning your mouth freshening your breath this has the same job and the same impact if if this is the case then it is the same reward and by doing it insha allah you will get the sunnah of it but definitely if you can and if you're able to use this twig specifically alhamdulillah it's sold in most countries and now even it's an industry where they can they sell it packed in a package and it it is any usable alhamdulillah then and it's not that expensive then this is best for you to do and allah knows best"
