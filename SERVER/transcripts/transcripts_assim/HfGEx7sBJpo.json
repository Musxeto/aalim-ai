  "transcript": "Fizan from India. If, uh well, \nSalheen on behalf of Fizan.   He says that, 'if I taught someone something \nwrong, must I rectify it and correct it to   him?' The answer is 'Yes'. If I taught my \nbrother that eating with the left hand is   permissible and I discovered later on that this \nis wrong, it's haram to eat with your left hand,   and I see him eat, or I know that he took this \ninformation and adopted it and he's embracing it   and i still don't correct him, I am sinful \nand my sin would continue throughout."
