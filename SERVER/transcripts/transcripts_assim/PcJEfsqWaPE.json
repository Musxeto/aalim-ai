  "title": "Doubtful how many times he washed arm in Wudu, ignored  doubt to catch Imam before he said Ameen",
  "transcript": "we have a house from bangladesh uh before the show we had balcory and there something happened is that i i was in the masjid doing and the imam already uh started the salah so i i began to rush while doing wudu i removed my attention from mudu and so after wiping after cleaning my hand up to the elbow i realized i i was in doubt that whether i uh cleaned my left hand more than thrice or not so sheikh out of rush i didn't redo the wudu but i continued uh the wudu and then uh joined the salad because i wanted to catch the a reward of saying amin so i'm afraid that do i have to uh pray maghrib again was my wudu invalid i will answer inshallah bangladesh he says i um it was time for prayer so i went for wudu and while i was making wudu the akama was given so i was doubtful whether i washed my arms twice or thrice so i finished washing the other arm and i went to attain the prayer because i wanted to catch the imam before he says i mean i don't know what's all of this and you have to work on gaining islamic knowledge you can't live like this off youtube asking random questions building thoughts in your your head without acquiring proper knowledge from the quran and from the sunnah why do you say this sheikh first of all catching the imam before he says i mean to my knowledge has no basis what has virtue and high reward is saying allahu akbar in the beginning of the salah with the imam this is what counts but if he starts reciting the fatih whether you say i mean with him or not this is not something that you want to put emphasis on yes i know that you will say that the hadith of the prophet of whoever says amin and his amin coincides with the i mean of the angels allah will forgive him but this is a byproduct what counts is the first takbir this is what you should follow now having said that your question about the wudus number also shows a deficiency in knowledge because if you were to watch and i'm advertising this and this is for free there is no monetization of my youtube channel i'm not making money out of it if you watch on my youtube channel which i did for peace tv may allah reward dr zakir naik immensely for his a great help if you watch it you would understand the etiquettes of wudu the ins and outs of wudu and one of them is that you don't have to watch to wash your limbs more than once it's not a must the minimum is once whether it's turning the water in your mouth your nose washing your face washing your arms to the elbow wiping your head and your feet these are minimal you can do once and the maximum is three with the exception of wiping your head and wiping your ears only once you cannot add more than that and it is part of the sunnah that the prophet used to alternate so maybe he washes this once or twice and washes other limbs three times or once so you don't have to be fixated on once all the way or two all the way or three all the way you can alternate so if you washed your right arm once and then you right washed the left arm three times no problem which means that doing him two times or three times or once it has no impact on your wudu so i hope this answers your question"
