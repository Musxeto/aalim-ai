  "title": "Give Dawah or stay in our homes in times of corruption? Hadith assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "foreign [Music] so I know it's part of our faith to share our dealing with others and let people know about the religion but I also heard the Hadith that said when certain types of corruption are occurring in the world you should adhere to your home and protect your hand and mouth from doing sin so my question is where do we draw the line should we be more obliged to give double or should we be more obliged to adhere to our home and not okay I mean the the Hadith you're referring to has nothing to do with dawa the Hadith the prophet is referring to Allah to assalam is at the end of time when there are two Muslim factions fighting against one another and you're caught in the crossfire so taking sides would mean that you would be taking sides in this case the prophet says confine yourself to your home and avoid such fitna because there is ambiguity there is confusion and chaos who is right and who's wrong if you know for for certain that this is this group is right they're backed by the Muslim Amir and they have the legitimacy while these are the oppressors and the rebels who must be fought against in this case you have to take sides but when there's confusion I don't know which one is right which one is wrong in this case you have to refrain as in the case when the battle happened between some of the companions may Allah peace with them a lot of the companions withheld from participation and confine themselves to their homes and they would not take sides because they did not know which one is right which one is wrong so they had all the right to stop what you're talking about is that one there's nothing wrong and going out even in the commotion and the chaos and the spread of evil there's nothing stopping you from making devil online social media uh physically visiting neighbors uh going to the masjids and and checking on Muslims who have dropped praying in the Masjid trying to revive Islam in their hearts this is something totally different than Allah Knows Best [Music] oh and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and the evening I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah"
