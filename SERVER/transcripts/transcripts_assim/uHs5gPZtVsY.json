  "title": "Is my islam nullified if I don't consider Muslims kafir if they commit acts of kufr? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "then is about not making Tech feel but rather considering someone to be careful or a mortar uh from like our point of view Yani so like when it comes to like uh the kuffa like Christian Hindus or the padiani ETC the metal is crystal clear but my question is regarding those who are claim to be Muslims but commit acts of coup for or apostasy whether it be by directions or speech or beliefs that become apparent so uh what should be our approach towards them like I'm asking this because whenever the question of considering someone a cancer or Mozart arises people also point out that if we don't consider them to be a castle then our own Islam is notified as well so the last thing in me or any other Muslim would want is to notify our Islam because we're not because of samuta and he's giving me a solved answer this is a very wide topic the issue of techfir is a very sensitive issue and the problem is that when you read a small booklet about the 10 nullifiers of Islam and you take them as if they are Divine words as if they are Revelations from the Quran or from the Sunnah and you want to implement them not knowing that these are the work of Scholars honorable great Scholars who may hit H the nail right on the head or may have made a mistake out of their ishtihad now it is our problem when we read such literature and want to Cascade it without the proper knowledge so a theoretical uh assumption or a an idea we take it embrace it and want to practice it and then not only that we go an extra mile by saying that if you don't implement this then you're a kaffir as well subhanallah so this is a new religion altogether that we are embracing and this what results in nicest Al-Qaeda Etc who go on cascading things and as a result if you don't do this then you're this and if you don't do this you're this if the ruler does not rule by Sharia then he's Cafe the ministers are Cafe their husband their wives and children are captured the Army's Cafe the Civil defenses Cafe the paper pushers are kafir the janitors are kafir who are guarding them what is this this is not Islam but this is how shaytan messes up with people's heads so going back to the fundamentals to be careful in not giving Tech fear for the whole entire population is better than giving Tech feel to a single person to refrain to say I'm not ready to spoil my Iman by giving take fear to an individual let alone a group of people based on the speculation that they have said or done something that is allegedly allegedly takes them out of the fold of Islam No there are conditions to be fulfilled I did not have the time to interrogate and sit with them and explain to them to see if the conditions are fulfilled or not there are obstacles to make sure that are not found before giving takfir and this is something to be done by Scholars after sitting and talking with that individual and ensuring that everything falls into place by a panel of Judges not by Tom Dick and Hattie not by you and me so don't go that route because this is what shaytan wants from you you're doubtful Let It Be Allah did not send me to label people to sit on a cafe drinking my cappuccino and say okay this is Cafe this is this is munafirk this is this he belongs to that group this is not my job Allah did not send me to do this and Allah will not question me why I did not do that and Allah Knows Best"
