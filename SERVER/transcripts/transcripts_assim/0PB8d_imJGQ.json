  "transcript": "uh she we know that if a person for example repents from drinking beer but he doesn't repent from drinking whiskey for example his repentance is not is not valid yeah beer beer and whiskey is the same if the beer is alcoholic beer if it's non-alcoholic beer what you repent from if a person is okay what's your question Amar sorry sorry uh if a person curses Allah and no no what is the question regarding whiskey and beer no no I brought that analogy like for my question okay so for example if a person curses Allah and he curses someone's mother and then he repents from cursing Allah but doesn't repent from cursing someone's mother is his repentance valid of course it is valid because there is no comparison and between cursing Allah and cursing anything else cursing Allah is an act of apostasy is kufur takes you out of the fold of Islam anything else is sinful so it's like saying okay she I cursed Allah and I shaved my beard I repented and I accepted Islam I said the shahada and I'm remorseful because of what kufur I committed but I still shave my beard is my repentance acceptance duh there's no comparison these are two different things this is different from alcoholic beer whiskey Jin vodka and the likes it's all intoxicants if you repent from drinking one type of intoxicant because you don't like the flavor but you don't repent from the others your repentance is void"
