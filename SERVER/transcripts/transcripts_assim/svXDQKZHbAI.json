  "transcript": "[Music] and if i find someone like this but at first again if i don't like him what should i do should i push myself to word and maybe him i i understood the first part of your question you don't follow madhhab you follow the quran and the sunnah but then i could not understand what is it you're asking about someone proposing to you who's following a madhhab blindly [Music] if i find someone like this but at first guys if i don't like him what should i do should i push myself to marry him uh okay i will answer inshallah first of all marriage is a lifetime project which means that it's not something that you can simply quit whenever you want or you don't like who you got married to so change him no it's a serious issue if you're following the quran and the sunnah and someone proposes to you who's following a medha as in the case of your of your country who's a hanafi follower schools of thought do not impact the validity of the marriage so if hanafi proposes to you he's blind following the hanafi school of thought there's no problem it's an issue of dispute among scholars we can coexist with one another he may learn in the future from you little by little no problem that the issue is not in being a blind follower of a math the issue is in akida and unfortunately when we hear someone saying i'm a hanafi this doesn't mean he's only following the hanafi school of thought in terms of sharia rulings and etc that's not a problem he could be hanafi shafi maliki or hanbali no problem the issue is with the akhida that is accompanying it because the vast majority of those from the subcontinent who say am hanafi usually they are matured or ashari in akida or generally speaking ubandis and this akida by itself has nothing to do with the school of thought of hanafi shafi this is a whole different bowl game because it relies on what their conviction is especially when it comes to the attributes of allah especially when it comes to issues of kadar issues of the hereafter etc and these are serious issues that cannot be compromised so if the person proposing is a blind follower of the hanafi school of thought but he follows the aqeedah of the seraph there's no problem in accepting him and allah knows best"
