  "transcript": "Bilal from Serbia Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh So I had a question about the Salaf Istikharah Some people they've been telling me to do like Salaf Istikharah before I'm certain of something or after So let's say for example I want a Samsung or an iPhone I don't know what to choose Should I do it like before I make like a decision or after? Jazakallahu Khair So unfortunately this is a very widely spread misconception upon people They think that Istikharah is to be performed when we're hesitant between choosing one of these two things Should I go to this city or to this city? Should I study in this university or this university? Should I marry this woman or this woman? Should I buy this car or this car? I'm lost So they say pray Istikharah and something will happen that would make you have a choice And this is totally wrong and bogus If you read the translation of the du'a Because Istikharah is to be performed as two voluntary prayers, rak'ahs A prayer of two voluntary prayers of two rak'ahs After the salam you make the du'a Allahumma inni astakhiruka bi ilmik O Allah I ask you to choose for me with your knowledge and with your ability And I ask you from your great favour O Allah if buying this mug I don't have three, six months No I've made my decision I'm going to buy this black mug I made my decision I'm not going to buy the purple one or the white one I made my decision So I make my du'a If buying this black mug has goodness for me in this life and in the hereafter In all of my affairs O Allah facilitate it for me and make it easy And make it happen If not then take it away from me And choose what is best otherwise for me And make me content with your decision So you're basically asking Allah to make the decision that you've done go through If there is goodness in it There has to be a decision first And this is the beginning of the hadith Itha hamma ahadukum bil amr Whenever one of you intend to do something Not is hesitant between two things He intends to do a particular thing He made his decision Then he should pray two rak'ahs and make the du'a that you've heard earlier So what the people are telling you Bilal is totally wrong and not true And Allah azza wa jal knows best"
