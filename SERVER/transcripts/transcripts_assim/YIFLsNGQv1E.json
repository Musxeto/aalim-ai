  "transcript": "[Music] can dear brothers and sisters in Islam and I pray to Allah that he has by now elev ated our hearts to be something that he's pleased when he's looking at and that he has purified our hearts and filled it with Iman peace and Tranquility today's Hadith was narrated by Abdullah Mas may Allah be pleased with him he says he said that the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam said if a person who's afflicted by anxiety or sorrow if he says this Dua Allah will relieve him from his anxiety and sorrow what is this Dua listen to it carefully oh Allah I am your slave slave the son of your slave the son of your female slave my forelock is in your hand your command Over Me Is forever executed and your decree over me is just I ask you by every name belonging to you which you named yourself with or revealed in your book or you taught to any of your creation or you have preserved in the knowledge of the Unseen with you I ask you that you make the Quran the life or the spring of my heart and the light of my breast and a departure for my sorrow and a release for my anxiety if someone makes this Dua Allah the almighty will take away his sorrow and grief and give him in their in their stead he will give him Joy so the companion said shouldn't we learn it oh prophet of Allah and the prophet of Allah said sallallahu alaih Al wasallam indeed everyone who hears these words must learn them this Hadith is quite long and it is actually loaded but we don't have enough time to go through it yet we would like to take what is mostly related to our topic which is the hearts so in the beginning as the Hadith says the prophet is directing us to say words at times of Sorrow or anxiety so sorrow is a depressing feeling you have over something that took place in the past anxiety is a depressing feeling you have over something that you're expecting to happen in the future and this is what life is all about something that was done in the past or something that we expecting in the future so whenever you have this and you say say this Dua then Allah would Grant you these favors number one whatever you have in your heart towards events that took place in the past Allah will take them away and whatever you expecting to happen and you're afraid of Allah would make you firm and a third benefit and a blessing is that the Quran and nothing else will would become the spring of your heart the life to your heart so your heart would be revived by the Quran so you would never never go astray and you would never be someone of sins the life of one of us and his death the happiness and his misery the health and and his Calamity all of those are in Allah's hands subhanahu and if you believe that your for loock and the for loock of all humans and creatures in this universe are all in Allah's hands controlling them as he wish subhana tala he controls them as he wishes if you believe in that and this is what your conviction then you would never fear anyone and you would never hope anyone and you would never place them as if they are owners you would never have your hopes attached to them only then your your and trust and Reliance and dependence on Allah your worship would be solely devot Ed to Allah so he said out of confession con confessing his own poverty his own need that your command Over Me Is forever executed this is total submission and surrender not only that when the decree is done your decree over me is just whether whether my son dies whether I'm Afflicted with a disease whether poverty strikes all of this is Allah's Divine decree and I believe it is just so I will always be content and this relates to all types of decree whether it's health or illness whether it's wealth or poverty whether it is things that we desire and find a lusts in all things that are painful whether it's death or life whether it is a Calamity or a punishment all is part of Allah's decree and we submit and accept that it is fair and just then you beg Allah by his beautiful names and you say I ask you by every name belonging to you and Allah has names that are countless we can't count them as per the Hadith Allah has 99 Names 100 minus one this does not limit the hadiths of this does not limit the names of Allah Asel to 99 rather these 99 names if we were to understand their meanings memorize them Implement them in our lives and worship with by them then they will admit us with the grace of Allah to Paradise so there are names that we don't know of but I ask you by every name belonging to you whether you revealed it in your book or you taught it to any of your creation so people other creation may know it or you have preserved it in the knowledge of the Unseen with you which means that there are names that no one knows of except Allah then after expressing my humility and my poverty and asking and after I'm showing and glorifying and revering Allah through his names I then go directly to what I want and all of this that came before it was to reach my Target and what is my target that you make the Quran the life of my heart that you make the Quran the spring the word the word r is spring and spring is the season of the year where happiness is spread all over the place the animals go and graze and find what they're grazing and feeding upon visible and available spring is the season where you see Allah's mercies signs after rainfall and when the earth is revived and becomes alive and likewise the Quran is the reason for all types of Allah favors and blessings to appear on us whether it is the favors and blessings of Allah of Iman of knowledge of the relief from the darkness of kufur and ignorance spring or the word r re refers to the season and it also in Arabic refers to the Rain which Allah Rev Dives the Earth with so the Quran was giving the similitude and the similarity of rain because as rain revives the gland Quran revives the hearts IM says in the Hadith we're asking Allah that he makes the Quran like the spring like the rain which allows the animal to feed and graze and likewise the Quran is the spring and the rain of the hearts which makes the heart comfortable to the Quran inclined to it interested in reciting it and in contemplating upon it the Hadith has many many benefits but this is the most important benefit that you want life for your heart you have to to ask Allah to make the Quran the life and the spring and the rain for your heart that would relieve you from sorrow from grief from anxiety from the fear of what may happen in the future and Scholars stated that no one will benefit from this Hadith to relieve their worries and anxiety except those who are considered to be people of the Quran those who recite it as it should be recited and they act upon its rulings and they have it in their character because how would Allah make the Quran a source of light and healing and guidance to someone who has has abandoned the Quran doesn't recite it does not act upon it the Quran is the spring of the heart is the light of our chests it's the relief of our sorrows and anxiety only to those who are considered to be among the people of the Quran those who are not among the people of the Quran they are among those who have abandoned the Quran and they would not attain such a favor and blessing from allaha unfortunately a huge chunk of the Muslims nowadays have abandoned the Quran and this is a cause of grief and sorrow it is a reason to worry about when you find that the Quran has no place in your daily routine a day a week maybe a month may pass and you don't even recite a single Ayah let alone contemplate upon the meanings and learning the T and knowing the vocabulary of the Quran isn't this shameful we watch movies we listen L to songs we read novels so many times I travel and I see people on their 8 or 10 hours flight or a train trip holding books and novels and reading it rarely you will find someone holding the Quran studying it contemplating upon it memorizing it on the contrary a lot of those called Muslims if they hear the Quran they say turn it off why said I don't know when I hear it I feel that it's it's a funeral that someone is going to die I I don't have a good feeling this is how Allah described the disbelievers that whenever they hear the remembrance of Allah their hearts are repelled but when anything else is mentioned they are filled with joy may Allah protect us those who the moment they open the Quran they start yawning and falling asleep those who do not know anything about this glorious book the word of Allah how do you expect their hearts to be yes on the exterior they look fine their bodies are fine and they're beautiful or handsome and healthy but their hearts are dead there is no life their hearts are Barren it's like Barren lands there is no Plantation there is no rainfall there is no life in it how many of us have such dead Hearts we hear the reminders we hear the Vick we hear the Quran and we don't even blink isn't this sad this this Hadith is a wakeup call for all of us we all have worries and anxieties we all have our mental problems but if we don't start studying the Quran and dedicating a portion of our daily routine to it our hearts will go sick and inevitably it will die and that would be the end end of our life and the beginning of our confusion and our depression and our loss may Allah Revive Our Hearts with the Quran and grant us studying it loving it and understanding what Allah wants from us in it we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back"
