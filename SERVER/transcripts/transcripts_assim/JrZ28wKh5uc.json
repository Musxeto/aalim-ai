  "title": "What's the ruling on giving our guests who visit us priority over our ownselves? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so hey from malaysia he's asking about the hadith and i think during the break the channel usually plays the same hadith the hadith where a pro where the prophet assalam had a guest and no one of the companions would host him because they didn't have any food not only that all the houses of the prophet's wives may allah be pleased with them complained that they don't have food at all so the prophet allah asks one of his companions to volunteer and allah would make them with him in jannah et cetera so ansari takes the guest with him he goes ahead of him to his house speaks to his wife um the mother of anas and she says that i don't have any food except some food for my children so he tells her prepare the food put the children to sleep hungry and when you serve the food pretend that you are fixing the lantern and then turn the lights off so she did that and the guest kept on eating in the dark thinking that they were also sharing the food with him and in fazer time the prophet salaam after prayering fajr he asked what they had done so abu had told him so he said that allah was in a sort happy or pleased with what you had done with your guest yesterday so this is a beautiful hadith in giving your guest something more than what you can afford and giving him priority over yourself and your children you"
