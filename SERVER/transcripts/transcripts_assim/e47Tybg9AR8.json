  "transcript": "Munib from the U.S. Sheikh in one of your videos I've heard you saying that the angels have free will and I'm a bit confused that you know we know that angels don't have a choice so be it Allah as we humans do so I did not get I did not get this the angels have free will what's your dispute with it no I don't have any dispute I'm just I'm just trying to like understand like we know that they can't disobey Allah so they don't have choice in that matter so how can we say that they have free will no no when they do not disobey Allah not that because Allah forced them to do this there's a big difference the wall can't disobey Allah Azza Wajal is it something to be praised over when you say mashaAllah the wall doesn't disobey my orders there's no praising in it so when Allah praises the angels and says that they la ya'asoon Allah ma amara hum wa ya'afaluna ma yu'maroon they do not disobey Allah whenever he orders them and they do what they are told to do this is praising them if they were compelled there would not be any praise on that they would be like animals who do exactly what Allah tells them to do but they have free will yet through their free will they do not dispute or they do not disobey Allah when Allah tells them to prostrate to Adam they comply Satan did not comply because he is not an angel he's from the jinn as clearly described in the Quran when Allah tells them that I'm replacing or placing a an individual that they will take turns one after the other on earth they asked oh Allah how do you place someone who would shed blood and cause corruption on earth so they do have free will they do ask and they do comply with whatever Allah tells them to do out of their own free will and Allah knows best"
