  "transcript": "should the husband be giving to the wife and what should the wife do with the with the money should she spend the money after the marriage or should she keep it in a legacy for locker and Sheikh nowadays YouTube this economic inflation for example if um if a marriage happened like 30 years back what Mahar was given 30 years back today that is almost like you know because of these uh inflation things like the values change a lot so what should the wife do with the money of them how many questions as were those how much Dowry should a man give to his wife there isn't anything specific in the Sharia so there is not a certain amount of money to be given to the wife it's according one to the norm of the society to to the agreement the norm mandates that we look into the community for example I go to a man do you give me your daughter in marriage he says I give you my daughter in marriage I say I accept her marriage there are two witnesses Boom the marriage takes place she's my wife we didn't talk about the Mahar no problem now we can discuss it a week a month a year later what is the Dowry I said uh one shilling he said he claims that it is a hundred thousand pounds this is a huge difference so who would the judge ruled in favor of ah the judge here comes and says let's look at the other families from her same social status how much do girls her age her social status charge for Mahar they said well they take five thousand dollars done five thousand dollars this is the first way of deciding the second way is by negotiating so Uncle I'd like to marry your daughter he says okay how much Maha are you willing to pay he says five thousand dollars the girl says no I need twenty thousand dollars so he says well my daughter says she wants twenty thousand dollars either I say okay I'm good for it or I say I can get four for that sorry I'm not interested so it is a demand and supply and Allah knows best now his inserted other question was about inflation we don't have the concept of inflation here if I had lent you ten thousand Syrian letters 30 years ago that was a fortune at that time now it may cost like five dollars or ten dollars so if I want to get back my loan should I say at the time 30 years ago this was the equivalent of two thousand dollars so I need you to give me two thousand dollars the answer is no whatever currency I had lent you is the currency and the same amount that I'm getting back so it if it was 10 000 Syrian letters this is what you're gonna pay me even if it costs two pounds there's no concept of inflation because if the opposite was there ah you would not have permitted it if you had lent me the amount in dollars at that time and the inflation caused the letter to drop so the ten thousand dollars at the ten thousand letters which were two thousand dollars at the time today is equivalent to five dollars if I were to give it back to you if it's increased or decreased one of us would not be happy so if it decreases I'm the lender I'm not happy if it it goes way off the roof you're not going to be happy and this is why Sharia had blocked this and said whatever the currency an amount you have committed yourself to as a dowry it should be given in the same amount and currency and Allah Knows Best"
