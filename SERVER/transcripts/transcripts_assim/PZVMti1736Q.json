  "transcript": "my question is is it macro to talk unnecessarily after the russia player okay i will answer you sean brother fuad from bangladesh says is it not recommended to speak or to talk after risha prayer there was a hadith where the prophet sam used to hate sleeping before isha and speaking after it now the prophet allah hated it either because it is something that he didn't like not necessarily that it is an islamic but he preferred to not sleep between maghrib and asia not that it is haram rather because those who sleep between maghrib and isha would definitely either miss asia or they would pray on time but they would won't be able to sleep until 1 or 2 am which may jeopardize their fajr prayer so the norm is you sleep after asha likewise talking after asia this is permissible there are so many hadiths where the prophet saw salaam spoke after isha where the companions used to come after isha and host their guests like in the hadith abu bakr may allah be pleased with him and his guests who he had sent to his house and the brawl took place between him and his son for not feeding them until he came etc all of these hadith and there's so many indicate that it is not prohibited it is not something that is disliked unless it leads to something that might be disliked or haram so if people and this is the norm everywhere almost speak after asia they dine after asia they chit-chat maybe until 10 11 maybe 12 o'clock midnight and then they retire and they are capable of waking a good hour before fajr praying to hajjud and reading the quran and then praying fajr on time there is no problem in that none whatsoever you"
