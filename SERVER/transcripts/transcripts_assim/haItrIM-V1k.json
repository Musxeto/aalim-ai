  "transcript": "the second question is from brother fahad says is a person sinful for not giving dawah as i know it is mandatory to give dawah to the non-muslims what about if a person does not have enough knowledge first of all a lot of the muslims believe or have this conviction that dawah means or is equivalent to giving lectures and sermons and attending or presenting conferences and this is not true at all yes this is maybe five percent of dawah but the vast majority of that were 95 is done differently now if you look at the people of the southeast asia indonesia for example quarter of a billion muslims 250 million muslims if you look at malaysia if you look at singapore if you look at other places not a single soldier conquered or went into these countries yet they have accepted islam what do you mean by muslim merchants traders who went there once the natives saw how truthful honest and kind they were they accepted that and embraced the religion they were giving the subhanallah when you have dawah done through your actions through your kindness through your honesty this benefits people more than a thousand lecture in a lecture we can speak and talk and talk and talk endlessly but this is not walking the talk walking the talk is when you get the people actually seeing how truthful honest how punctual how kind how generous you are this is the excellent way of making dawah dawah can be done through writing through a gift through co-existing dawah can be done through a gentle kind word to your colleagues at work or in school so it is not just simply presenting a lecture no this is a small part of dawa now it is important that you don't speak and you don't indulge in conversations or arguments about islam when you don't have knowledge it's not that you're riding the tide just because you're a muslim and they're asking you questions you have to come up with an answer no this is wrong if you have knowledge yes go ahead and address it or coat a scholar but don't shoot from the hip don't make yourself a bridge over hellfire where pop people cross over it by walking on your back you don't know simply say i don't know let me check let me verify let me ask and i'll come up with an answer so i hope that one is not as scary as many people think and they try to avoid rather be proud of your islam this is a form of dawah there are thousands of leaflets distributed for free for you to go and give them away with a smile let the people reach for themselves usual center the one you see my uh uh poster behind me and the one i used to have the mug before the kids took the mug thinking that i had a drink in it um this one this usual center www.osuolcenter.com this has hundreds if not thousands of materials that you can print on your computer on your printer and give away two colleagues to neighbors all talk about different topics in islam that would be an eye-opener to people so you don't have to be a rocket scientist to be able to understand and to do what is needed to be done in allah you"
