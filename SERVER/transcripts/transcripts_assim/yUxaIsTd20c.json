  "transcript": "the third question was about if an imam or anyone else while praying the mobile phone goes off so it's ringing and it's annoying people so what's the ruling on inserting my hand in my pocket taking my mobile off turning the sound off and put it back again this is permissible isn't this a lot of movement chair I will come insha'Allah hopefully if there's time to one of the questions which talk about movement in salat and inshallah we'll elaborate a little bit more"
