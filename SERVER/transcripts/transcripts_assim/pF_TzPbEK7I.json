  "transcript": "um my question is that um a few days ago I was having a argument with my father and um he got really angry and both of my parents they called themselves a disbeliever in the argument they were like a um that you think that you're such a moment a Believer and that we are you know they call themselves disbelievers so shik you know uttering words of disbelief takes one out of the folds of Islam whether he believes it believes in it or not so um she my question is okay I know that my parents have committed apostrophe but they but they don't know that um since they've said it they are they've uh they've done an act of apostacy so Sheik what I wanted to ask is okay do I have to give them T Fe is it mandatory and I know in my heart that they've committed Act of apositive Fe and I believe in it but do I have to say it verbally to their face because if I do so it will cause a lot of fighting and enemity and they will call me an extremist and this will lead them more further away from Islam and they will um not listen to anything I have to say or can I believe in my heart that they've committed an act of apostasy but not say to their face and slowly gradually with time I find proof and help them and show them what they've done is wrong you are an extremist and it is your fault whatever they're doing because of your attitude and approach Subhan Allah you are the opponent you are the judge and now you want to be the Executioner you want to label them as apostates and condemn them with kufur when it all started because of your attitude provoking them with your bad way of calling them to Islam or showing them what's right and what's wrong with your arrogance with Simon Says attitude speak to them from your Ivory Tower arguing with them until they're angered by it like so many husbands do with their wives when they're bickering and fighting and the wife is so mad of her husband's abuse and all of a sudden he says you don't believe in Allah are you a cafir and she out of Rage says yes she admitted kufur this is what you're doing to them fear Allah and stay out of their lives it's not your job to label people as Believers and disbelievers let alone your own parents what do you want to do execute them is this what you want you want them to end up in Hellfire you're the one who's pulling them there so first of all stop any type of Halal Haram discussion with them don't give them da we don't need your da don't call them to anything that isal Oram stay away from their lives focus on acquiring the proper Knowledge from authentic sources that would benefit you not that would give you leverage on people to control their lives and to uh monitor their behavior like what you're doing at the moment this is not the way Islam tells us to behave with others yes you may say she don't judge me you can say that but I have all the Liberty to judge you sue me if you want because I've seen many many types like you and how they forced their families and loved ones to go astray because of their attitude you've just read a book or an article or a fatwa here and there and now you've become masallah Islam going left right and Center giving takir this is not the way Islam had knowledge had wisdom had the diplomacy to address people you have none so my advice to you is fear Allah and try to rectify your Affairs by showing them that you're a daughter not a tutor not a teacher not a mentor and show them that you know nothing about Islam so that maybe after six months to a year they would start loving you back again and considering you to be their daughter and then you may give them little dosages of Quran and Sunnah that they would accept from you then but not now and Allah Knows Best"
