  "transcript": "um is there an authentic Hadith or anything that states about where when firon was drowning um Islam came and uh kicked mud into his mouth so that he would not repent to Allah because if he had repented Allah would have forgiven him that's my question yes this is an authentic Hadith that jibril said that he would put mud in Pharaoh's mouth so that he would not be able to say the shahada feeling that Allah azzawajal May uh forgive him if this happens to my recollection that this is an authentic Hadith nevertheless we know that in the Quran Allah says that Pharaoh said the shahada but as his soul was leaving his throat and this is one of the times where Allah does not accept repentance and Allah says now after you have seen an an uh death coming and uh after all the uh verses and and the science came to you and you rejected it no so Allah did not accept his repentance and Allah knows best Maria"
