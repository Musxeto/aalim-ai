  "title": "The mark of prostration on a person's forehead | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Nazz says can you explain the last ayah of surah al-fatah Surat al-fatiha chapter 48 and the last area is along i am muhammad rasool ullah who live in Amara Ashida or a little Clefairy rahama albania home and the issue that she is asking about or he Naza don't know what is this a male or a female the questioner is asking about is what does the mark on the forehead mean because in the ayah there is a part of it Allah says what translates to their mark is on their faces from the trace of prostrations so NASA is asking what is this mark most of the people think that this mark is the trace on the forehead the dark area on the forehead which some people have and they believe that this ayah is referring to that and this is not true even I basked may Allah be pleased with him and his father said clearly that this is not true this mark is not what you people think rather the mark of implementing Islam in your life meaning that the posture the way you look the way you talk the way you behave it lays and leaves an image and this image is the mark mentioned in the area this is one interpretation the other interpretation would be that it is the pale color of your skin which usually results due to long times spent in praying at night so when a person wakes up in the morning he was the self deprived from sleeping because he was engaged in night prayer and had jute he would look a bit pale so this change of color maybe he's a little bit yellowish or pale in the face is the mark that is referred to due to prostration but definitely it is not the dark area on a person's forehead because this can appear with disbelievers with Muslim sinners actors or politicians and we we have examples of this this has nothing to mean or insinuate that these are people of righteousness because it is obvious that they're not so this physical mark is not what is intended in the ayah and allah azzawajal knows best"
