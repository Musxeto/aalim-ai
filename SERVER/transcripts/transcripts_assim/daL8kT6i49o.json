  "transcript": "Uh I'm a rever to Islam and my parents are non-Muslims. I would like to know if it is mandatory to include the names of the grooms and brides parents' name on the marriage invitation card. Is it is it mandatory to do what? Yasira. Uh it is mandatory to mention the names of grooms and brides parents. Names of grooms and bride. No, no. If I am inviting a friend and my name is Asam, the son of Kumar, uh, uh, the son of Brahma, he knows who I am. He knows I'm a revert. So, what's the problem in mentioning my parents' names or my family name? I'm I'm I am a Muslim. I don't care about my lineage. I don't care about my disbelieving father or grandfather or my family. I'm proud of being a Muslim. None of the companions were ashamed to say that, \"Oh, yeah, I'm a Muslim, but my father is a kafir. He's a mushri.\" No, this is life. There's nothing to be ashamed of. Allah selected you and chose you to be a revert and to embrace Islam. Be proud of it. Now, is it a must to mention is marrying? No. The the son of so and so is marrying the daughter of so- and so. No, you can just mention the first names if you wish. But if you mention the whole uh name and the full name, there is nothing uh wrong in that either."
