  "transcript": "slamming Rahim hamdu lillah wa salatu salam o allah rasool allah he re yo sabe dear brothers and sisters Salam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatu and welcome to lessons in fill yourselves that was still studying the chapter that deals with nullification notifications of boo-boo ablution and brother nora believe we'll read the following hadith spindler of man rahim narrated aisha radiallahu anhu a las messenger sallallahu alayhi wa sallam said whoever vomit bleeds through the nose or religious mother should go perform ablution and then complete his prayer by continuing from where he had stopped at on condition that he doesn't speak in the process this hadith has been regarded by Imam Ahmed as weak and unauthentic and this is correct it was also regarded as an authentic by an imam al albani so we don't have to go through it and explain it as you can tell that it is not true the hadith tells us that whoever vomits during prayer or bleeds through his nose or has this discharge of mattie during prayer he should he should go to the toilet before moodle and then go back again couldn't continue where he stopped so if he prayed to rocailles then he should stand and continue the third and fourth raka providing that he did not speak during the process and of course this is completely unacceptable how would a person cut his prayer and goes to the toilet and perform would bow and wash his clothes maybe and then go back and continue as nothing has happened no one of the pillars of Prayer is the sequence you cannot pray one wrecker and then go and after half an hour continue the second one there should be a sequence and you have to follow this sequence there should be an order and there should be mula it should be all together there shouldn't be separated by any thing that comes in between so this hadith is not valid now why is it mentioned in the notifications of Woodill of evolution because some of the scholars said that these thing nullify would the first thing vomiting does vomiting nullify wouldl now for in order for us to say yes or no Danny I'd ask Mustafa I'll ask Mustafa to tell me how would we say yes or no what determines if it nullifies will do or not there has to be a specific text that says okay from the Quran or the Sun this is the easiest and logical process that we apply in every single thing that we do in our lives regarding religion don't listen to Tom Dick or Harry saying that this is halal this is Haram all the time you have to connect yourself to the Quran and Sunnah and by doing this you are following the footsteps of the Prophet Allah which will lead you insha Allah than which will lead us all to paradise meaning in prayer this is just a simple example where should I put my hands while standing position should I put it on my chest or my bellybutton or my private parts as some people do and this is really funny you know spying people standing in prayer and putting their hands on their private parts as if they're protecting a goal for a free kick or something what are you doing well you know I'm a sportsman I have to do this not is completely unacceptable okay what or who determines what is acceptable and what's not the Quran and the Sunnah you have to go through the Sunnah and learn where did the Prophet SAW salam placed his hands while in the standing position and this is not our topic we will come to this in sha allah when we describe the prayer of the prophet of islam we go to that to our topic which is vomiting now vomiting does it nullify your evolution or not some scholars say yes it does why they thought well if someone urinates or someone passes stool defecates then he is taking the filth and the bad things out of his body from his private parts so it should be similar that if you take the bad things from your stomach through your mouth then it should notify your model now is there an hadith that states this say well authentic No so how do you say such a thing said well we gave it the matter some thought then it looks okay so we wrote it in our books of jurisprudence of bophit and people have been taking it teaching it to their students and it became a rule well I'm sorry I apologize I cannot take this why how dare you differ with the shaykhs with the Imams who came with this verdict it's very simple when I testify I say and I bear witness that muhammad salla Salam is His slave and messenger his servant and his messenger I don't mention any of the scholars do i I don't mention any of the Imams do I I only follow him the Prophet salah salem and by doing this you feel easy about things because if you say well Imam so-and-so says this you will have a hundred people jumping and saying well we have our own Imams we have our own different version of what you're saying and Allah says in the Quran if you have dispute if you have conflict among each other always refer to the Quran and Sunnah always refer to Allah and His Messenger that is the Quran and the Sunnah and this is the criteria that we judge things so going back to our topic vomiting doesn't nullify what though no it does not is it a nice thing to do while praying of course it's not but that's there's a person control his vomiting this is something that is abnormal this is a sickness so if it comes it comes but my Widow is still intact now bleeding through the nose does it know if I would Oh again there is no authentic evidence that it does therefore it remains on the original sense that whatever comes out is you're still preserving your model and finally maybe that's the discharge of mattie nullify would all times a does it does a discharge of methi nullify water fatty yes everybody agrees on that and this because of the hadith of of who what what hadith tell told us that mattie nullifies will do can you read it do you remember it yes very true and very correct the son-in-law of the Prophet a son Ali ABI talib so you always have to remember evidence because you will need this in life if somebody tells you prove it to me how do you say that the discharge of Mahdi nullifies would you give me your evidence if you don't have evidence then you don't have a case but if you always recall this evidence and it's always at the back of your mind it makes life very easy for you and it makes things clear to you so the hadith is not authentic fat do you have a question yeah concerning vomitus isn't there an evidence that when one vomits that his cm he's fasting it's broken and then we can then apply this for fasting through quiesce on prayer or what do you think Mustafa I don't know very good this is half of knowledge excellent well what we have left is the other half so we'll try to gain that your question is relevant to the topic that is and it's irrelevant at the same time evolution is different than fasting so things that nullify evolution do not necessarily nullify fasting and the the opposite is true eating and drinking notifies your fasting does it have anything to do with evolution does it know the fight no it does not coming back to your statement that vomiting breaks fasting is this true does anyone of you have knowledge of this issue there's vomiting nullify fasting well some say yes some say no some of saying from commenting actually it does not nullify fasting unless it is done intentionally the Prophet says is thought - Salam whoever vomits intentionally must make it over and whoever vomits unintentionally it's not with is Andy he just did it then he must not make it over he should continue fasting and this is realized if a person eats too much and after the break of dawn he's really filled and he doesn't feel good and he cannot sleep but he cannot take anything to help his digestion so what does he does he puts his finger in his mouth and vomits and this is intentional so this day is void he has committed one of the notifications of fasting but if a person is ill he's sick in the midday just vomits then there's nothing wrong in that you should continue fasting going back to evolution there is no relation none whatsoever whether you do it intentionally or unintentionally it is not part of the things that nullifies booboo and it's it's very essential to know that the things that notify your Woodill are handful and they're all governed by hadith or by verses of the Quran which means that if you know them by heart you can have a general realization in the sense that a guy comes in with a cigarette and he's smoking and the call for prayer is called and he drops a cigarette and wants to pray do we tell him go and perform ablution again well do we and we don't know we told her we tell him quit smoking because it's bad for you it's Haram but it has nothing to do with evolution your evolution is in still intact what you've done is a sin so don't mix up things now the things that nullify your voodoo are a handful we've mentioned sleeping we've mentioned discharging of Mary of course urinating duplicating whatever comes from the private parts and we've gone through this and we also mentioned touching the private parts so you have to keep them so once you realize them nothing else comes in to them we have a short break stay tuned and we'll be right back insha'Allah salam aliekum wa rahamtullah and welcome back we have talked before the break about the weak hadith of Asia may Allah be pleased with her and we said that we have to build our allegation on correct and authentic hadith and the following one insha Allah is authentic reported by Adam a Muslim brother Fatiha I believe will read it for us similar manner him narrated JBAB new samara may allah be pleased with him a man asked the prophet salaallah alayhi assalam should I perform ablution after eating mutton he replied if you were so he then asked should I perform ablution after eating camel meat he sallallahu him said yes now this hadith clearly tells us that it is obligatory to perform ablution after eating camels meat and it clearly clearly tells us that it is not obligatory to perform model after eating mutton meat or goats meat or sheep meat whatever and before we go into this hadith it was at the very beginning of Islam that it was a must for Muslims to perform ablution after eating anything that was cooked by fire so if anyone cooked a chicken or cooked mutton or beef and ate it he should perform model because it it was cooked with fire this hadith obligates it because the Prophet SAW Salah is asked should we perform model after eating mutton and he said if you wish what is the meaning of if you wish it means that I am already on in the state of ablution I have performed ablution and I ate mutton now does this nullify my order or not it it's strictly says that it does not but if you wish to perform Moodle again then this is good one would argue argue and say why should I perform model while I am in the state of Moodle what's what's the benefit of this the benefit is more reward we have a saying in Arabic whenever it's time for prayer someone would ask the others are you on Moodle would you like from ablution and he would say yes I would like to renew my evolution as I did with Bui now what does renew my evolution means if you are in the state of evolution why should you do this now this is an innovation no it's not some people would think that if you are in the state of Buddha why do you perform Moodle again this isn't an innovation no it's not an innovation because it's more blessing and it's more cleanliness when you do it and the hadith states this the Prophet was asked if a person eats mutton meat does he have to perform would--well again What did he say if you wish which means that yes you may if you want to do this there's no problem if it was wrong he would have said no you shouldn't you already are in the evolution status so remain as you are okay the issues that one would like to also talk about is eating camels meat now the three scholars of Islam disagree with an imam muhammad the only school of thought that says that you should perform moodle after eating camels meat is the humbly school the followers of Imam Muhammad in Hamburg while Imam Abu Hanifah Malik and Shafi and their followers say you don't have to perform moodle it's preferable but you don't have to perform although after eating camel meat in the way that we think nowadays what do you think we should do perform model or not we should follow the hadith this is clear and simple we should follow the hadith with all the respect that is due to our Imams and our scholars we respect their very self saying that no it's not a must but we respect the hadith of the Prophet SAW Allah has a lamp more than respecting them so if the hadith is authentic and is it authentic it is 100% authentic it's in sari Muslim which is regarded to be one of the most authentic books of sooner after the Buhari so we take it as it is and we believe that it nullifies woudl now it's talks about camels meat okay what about camel's milk does it nullify water because it's part of me of the camera does it nullify what though what do you think Mustafa that's camel milk nullify water well unless there's a specific texture okay what do you think nor things it doesn't only firewood why the answer is correct by the way it doesn't notify what though how might you have we don't have it in in Hadees that it says this is only by eating the meat of Yemen it's meat it says camel's meat so if you consume anything else then is considered to be meat then it does not notify you what so camel's milk does not nullify your photo now we come to another thing what about the guts the liver the heart of the camel if we cook it does it know if I would do or not is it considered to be part of the camel meat I think for the same concept as long it does not meet well actually it does follow the same concept simply because when we talk about general speaking meat Laham this falls under it because it's cooked it's eaten while milk cannot qualify as food cannot qualify as meat or flesh or whatever therefore the scholars say anything that is cooked from a Campbell then it is nullified water now milk does not nullify water and one again would come and argue and say why the three-letter word that usually you know buzzes and bugs people why what's the difference between camels and other animals there isn't a clear-cut answer to that is there a difference between cows camels and other animals yes there is there are differences now the hadith has an ending but it's not mentioned here the prophet saww Salam was asked can we pray in the barns or pens of sheep he said yes so he was asked again then we pray in the barns or the pens the way the place where they stayed of camels he said no so there is a difference people say scholars that is not normal people they say that a camel is different than other animals the camel has pride and arrogance when you see a camel walking man hey this guy is confident he's standing tall and when you see sheep you know sheep is humble and modest and and that is why the Prophet SAW Selim made this difference in said that those who shepherd sheep who walk with the Sheep are people of tranquility and Sakina they're humble and modest and those who stay with the camels and shepherd the camels are people of arrogance and of pride and this is found we find this in Arabia those who stay with the sheep are you really very humble and modest nice people and that is why the Prophet says our son that all messengers and prophets of Allah have Shepherd sheep they all at one stage of the time stayed with the sheep and walked with with the sheep and lived from the sheep so they told him the companion is even you prophet of Allah said even I I did this on so much and much for a woman in Mecca before Islam I did it as a source of income and we see this the people that always raise and and and and shepherd camels are always arrogant and they're not polite and you find this pride in them so there is a difference now also there are hadith that tells us that in the barns and pens of camels Satan is present because of this arrogance therefore it is not permissible for us to pray in these areas to wrap it up eating camels meat nullifies a person's model although it is the the verdict of Fatima Muhammad but the hadith backs it up the following hadith narrated abu huraira of the one who the prophet salallahu alayhi wasalam said whoever watched a dead person should take about thereafter and whoever carries it should perform ablution of course in islam it's very ritual thing but it's very easy and simple people die this is human nature the only person or entity that does not die is a lot of the almighty all creatures of Allah died without any differences with no discriminations they all died angels Devils humans plants animals they all died now in Islam it's very easy for us when people die simple we grieve within sorry we wash them we perfume them we wrap them up in garments and we take them perform funeral prayers asking Allah for forgiveness put them in a ditch in a hole bury them it's history he's dead he's gone we don't have any you know conveys convoys or caravans carrying them with musical instruments in front of them and behind them we don't have any big receptions and spending money and wasting it on food and beverages and so on we have it very simple all people die and the more you need things the more it's made easier in Islam and this we have to pay great attention to you need water and you need oxygen air that you breathe what do you need more oxygen so it's found everywhere do I have to pay for it I have to breathe water I need but my need for water is less than my need for air can I find it everywhere yes you can find it mostly everywhere but you have to put some more effort to it our time is up but I'm afraid that we still have some issues to continue so we'll postpone it in sharla until next time and until then via Manila was Salaam are they come one hot allahi or barakato"
