  "transcript": "salamualikum' shaikh ali khan salaam I apologize for taking so much time off the phone yes nothing okay Mohammed from Algeria yes sir I am a man in Sweden any new Imam Mossad I can't speak good English can I speak I can ask the question in Arabic please yes yes go ahead but make it short because I have to translate it for that viewers okay yes he had come a tad now yes we the end Amish culture khalid al Malaki on my scale Kabir how did father to select integer will ensure work America market value and she said we share Ramadan and MTV who keep the stop another worsen semihot I come with a jihadi Xavier absolute rated Erlich okay Barak illogical so brother Mohammed he said he's from Nigeria but now he's asking about an issue of Sweden so maybe Nigeria is a town in Sweden ah I haven't been there so yet so he's asking about a common problem worldwide and this problem is always found in UK when measure is actually do some sometimes you find an hour and a half difference between opinions this can't be this much an hour and a half the only five minutes ten minutes I can tolerate this but when you say an hour or an hour and a half so in Sweden especially when there is problem with the shortness of the night when they have like four hours five ten minutes more would add a lot of value to them so they're having problem with the moon sighting as well okay Mohammed this isn't something that can be answered in a very direct and precise manner because the moon sighting depends on the Islamic Authority in Sweden so if you have an Islamic center that the majority not all because definitely will not have all the Muslims collaborating with it but the majority of Muslims consider that Islamic center or that Islamic sharia board to give them the rules on divorce marriage inheritance fatwas to rule cases between Muslims so they considered to be an Islamic Authority they give the timings of Ramadan and eat and you have to follow that whether they do this through calculation which is wrong or they do this through sighting of the moon which might not be very accurate or possible or they do it through following Saudi Arabia which a lot of the Islamic centres are doing nowadays especially in the UK because it's always difficult to cite the moon always clouds raining etc so they thought it is safer to be with Saudi Arabia all the time and a lot of scholars have permitted that so this is for moon sighting as for fetcher prayer and Asia prayer and motherly prayer etc sunset we have no problem in everybody knows when sunset is but even though if it is not possible the scholars have to improvise and come up with a calculation a method of calculation the most reliable method of calculation that I know of is on malpua when you have an app it tells you would you like it to be collaborated or to be synchronized with Karachi University or with esna or with the Muslim League or with amon korra choose on McCory this is the best for fashion Laura Esserman rib timings Asia is not accurate because they always have it as at one and a half hours after sunset throughout the whole year 11 months and in Ramadan they make it 2 hours which is totally wrong so what to do when it comes to Isha you can use the University of Karachi or any other one because usually it is almost accurate why do we say that o McCory calculation is accurate because this is what the great scholars such as solid fusion has stated here in Saudi it was said that the Fed time is not accurate and so many people came and said no this is too early you have to wait another 15 minutes to pray or 17 minutes and she came and said this in that so they confused the people I heard this from cher Mohammed bin Saleh he'll manage it himself when I asked him this question he said I asked Shahada follows on myself so this is a connected chain of narrators and Sheikh Saud helped us and said my son I went to a place out side the outskirts of Riyadh and I spent the whole night facing the east anticipating and waiting for the honest or the true dawn to break and once I noticed it it was horizontal it coincided exactly with Omar para timetable so depending this insha Allah you will be successful"
