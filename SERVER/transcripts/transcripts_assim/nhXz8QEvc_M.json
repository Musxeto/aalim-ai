  "title": "Wife works; can husband control where she spends her own money? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "the RAB asks and says a man isn't working currently but his wife earns decently in a business she spends 1/3 of what she earns on family 1/3 she keeps in savings and the remaining third she gives to her parents her husband objects to it and asks her to stop sponsoring her parents as they're not needy and keep the remaining third also in savings he told her it is his right to channel her spending she denies it and asks for evidence they are from India this is a frequently asked question and through my humble experience whenever issues over money arise this usually does not end well whenever there is a dispute over wealth over property over spending this means that the relationship between the spouses is not positive and the vast majority of such problems come when the wife is working and she's earning and sometimes she earns more than the man and this is when the man intervenes and wants to have control even on the wife's salary or to at least have control where she spends her money and dispute arises so what's the ruling first of all we have to go to the basics it is not something that is dependent on our logic or our tastes or even our culture no it's not the way to judge things in the early 60s and 70s of the previous century the 20th century the Muslims were bombarded with movies TV series with programs depicting and ready cooling a man with more than one wife so what is called polygamy or having more than one wife was fiercely fought and attacked and this changed a lot of the perception and the ideas of the people to the extent that it became normal for housewives even in the lands of Islam born to Muslim parents living in a Muslim country it was normal for a woman to say let my husband go abroad commit adultery fornicate does whatever he wants and come back to me after a month as my own husband and this is better for me she says than him taking a wife in halal where she would be a co wife to me Subhan Allah she accepts him to commit adultery and she turns a blind eye to that so that he would not get married in halal as Allah has prescribed for him when there is a need likewise nowadays we're bombarded through the media through women movements you too me too we too he as well movements calling for empowerment of women we have bloggers we have youtubers we have celebrities coming and brainwashing with filth the brains of women telling them in confidence you can make a difference you can be your own decider of how your life goes you don't need no one you can be independent you have your choice you have your freedom your face is your identity don't let anyone cover it don't let anyone suppress you and hide you and tell you what to do and what not to do audhu billahi min ash-shaytaan-i'r rajeem if Satan were to come he wouldn't add anything more because all what they're calling people to is to go out of the boundaries of Islam this is what their actual mission is now some of them out of courtesy would probably say you can do this through the Islamic channels or through the Sharia how you want to give women empowerment you want her to get married without a guardian you want her to travel without a Muharram you want her to do whatever she wants take off the hijab come out in western clothes mixed with men where is Islam she says I pray five times a day why do you cover your hair when you pray because Allah told me to cover and my prayer would be invalid if I prayed without covering my hair to shake so why don't you cascade this to the rest of your life the moral of what I want to say I don't want to waste my your time on on such a topic the people nowadays are bombarding women to be independent so if you work then you're independent you don't need a man and so many times we hear this my job is more important my husband and my kids because my job gives me empowerment my husband and children they'll tie me down and I would not benefit from that so if we go back to the basics we know that this is not the way Islam works a wife is dependent on her husband this is the norm she is obedient to him and he is the Guardian and he decides almost everything in the household he decides for the family for the betterment of their lives and for them to progress and to move on forward this is the norm but there might be exceptions there might be black sheeps sheep in the family so we have to look at each case by case scenario now as for the rehab question if a woman is currently working let us ask was this condition stipulated in the marriage contract meaning that when you proposed her guardian or she said I'd like to have your consent that after marriage I continue to work and he says I agree so they stipulated a condition and he agreed in this case he's obliged to allow her to work not only that he has no control over a single penny of what she earns and he has no right none whatsoever to tell her who to spend it on and who not to spend it on this has to be cleared secondly if the condition was not fulfilled what was not stipulated they did not ask for it though she was working but when they made the Manish contract they did not stipulate this condition after marriage it is the right of the husband to decide whether to allow her to work or not to work why because this is the meaning of the Constitution of marriage that the the wife stays home and the husband works and provides simple as that now if he allows her to work this is his decision and by allowing her he would compromise some of his rights because instead of her being home 24/7 taking care of his house and it was children of him he is losing like ten hours a day for her to work here it is something that they must reach a mutual agreement so the husband in such a situation has the right to say I don't want you to work and it's a must that she obeys him or he says I allow you to work but you have to compensate me by paying for example for the driver or for the mate who's working instead of you cooking and cleaning or to give me like 25 percent of your salary this is what they agree upon it's a business transaction the wife has all the right to say this is not fair you're not a man to ask such thing from your wife I'm quitting this is her god-given right she quits she sits home it's his job but does life go on like this either my way or the highway it doesn't basically speaking I do not approve of men taking anything from their women I do not consider a man to be a proper real man when he stretches his hand begging his wife for allowance or for her to buy the food if his stone broke he should act like someone whose stone broke rather than being arrogant and insisting on this and that as if she's obliged to work she's not obliged to work and at the same time I'm addressing this to the wife you have to be wise so you have to balance things up first of all every single penny that you pay for the household for the food for the rent for the electricity the utilities Allah will reward you for this if you anticipate the reward from allah azza wajal because it's not your obligation you're not forced to do this even if you are rich it is not your responsibility to spend a dime on yourself on your children or on the house this is his duty and obligation if he's jobless tough luck my money is my money he has to manage so if you are giving a helping hand may Allah reward you this is good now if he says that you must not pay one-third of your salary or income to your parents I think that this is a bit stupid with all due respect yeah and he he doesn't work he doesn't provide and he wants to be treated as a man at the end of the day and Simon says don't do this Simon Says do that this is pathetic this guy is out of his mind so as a woman I am addressing your diplomacy and intellect don't go to down to his level don't share with him any of your expenses beware of having a mutual bank account this is one of the wrong places to be in your income your money your wealth keep it in your savings your own bank account nobody knows about it his savings and money nobody knows about it it's his but when you share everything that oh I got a raise I got a bonus my salary was deducted so and so with him he tends to get greedy so you have to separate these things and don't tell him whether you gave him your mom or your parents something or not this is not his responsibility may Allah reward you for spending one third of your income over the house when he's jobless but you have to reach a compromise with him you have to reach a mutual understanding that listen Andy let's be realistic you cannot beg and at the same time set conditions so I give a euro to this beggar and he says what would I do with a euro I can't buy a pack of cigarettes at least give me ten look at him what is this when you're begging your ha we're having the lower hand so whatever comes you say alhamdulillah praise Allah and move on not to put such conditions but at the end of the day Islamically we judge it upon whether the condition to work was stipulated in the contract or not if not then you have to reach a mutual understanding compromise and try to find a solution out and remember that you're setting a target and that is to preserve your marriage and your family if you go down the road of checking every single penny you paid and where he placed it and he's holding you accountable and he is doing the record books behind you then this marriage is not going to end well may Allah's will make it easy for all of you"
