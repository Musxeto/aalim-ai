  "title": "The masjid I lead prayers in does lot of innovations & except me to obey, what to do assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "this question was about the Masjid that he leads in is involved in a lot of Innovations and as an Imam they expect him to make congregational Dua after fault prayers or to offer Witcher as the hanafi way of praying that is similar to Maghrib so as an Imam what is he supposed to do the answer is no you should not do anything that goes against your beliefs especially if it's something major if your congregation expects you not to raise your hands every time you make takbeer or something Allah I'm fine with that no problem it's a Sunnah but if they expect you to innovate to make an innovation like congregational Dua or to make your Witcher 3 Raq as similar to Maghrib no this is not permissible you should not obey them in this and Allah Knows Best"
