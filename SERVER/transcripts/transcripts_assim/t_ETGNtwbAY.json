  "transcript": "[Music] fasting while traveling can one break their fast which is of Ramadan while they are traveling through plane train or car the answer is yes allah azza wajal in Surat al-baqarah that you should fast however whoever is traveling or is sick or the opposite whoever is sick or traveling from can amiko Mary Ellen o Allah safar then he should compensate this on later days now what is travelling so sure I work in a district and my work is and I lived ten minutes away from there so when I travel from home to work should I break my fast Arkady's is not traveling this is commuting traveling is to move from one city to the other which the people the community do not consider this to be commuting so for example if a person lives in Jeddah Saudi Arabia and travels eight hours by Road to Riyadh or four hours by Road to Medina is this considered to be travelling everyone in the community would say definitely this is travelling and when you leave home you bit your family farewell and when they call home people call your home they would say oh he is travelling he had gone to Riyadh he had gone to Medina he had traveled to London this is considered to be travelling but if it the proximity is close like in this case of Mecca and Medina let me rephrase that like in the proximity of Mecca and Jeddah it's about an hour to an hour and 10 minutes drive no one in Jeddah says okay see you guys I'm travelling to Mecca we travel to Mecca maybe a couple of times a day a lot of the people living in Jeddah work in Mecca and very subversive likewise when it comes to Dubai and Abu Dhabi or Dubai and charge' commuting between these two cities is not considered to be travelling anymore people do it on daily basis and it's almost as if they are one they're so close there are so many buildings and houses in between so this is not travelling but if you're travelling to a different city that people consider this to be travelling in this case you would exempt it from fasting sure if I want to fast can i ah this is a different story likewise if a person who's sick really sick can he fast if he wants to there are three levels level number one when there is harm resulting of fasting or really true hardship so a person who's sick if he fasts his health would deteriorate or his recovery would be delayed or he would get more harm maybe dying in this case fasting is prohibited what about traveling same thing if the person's fasting would result in him dying if he's travelling or causing real hardship to himself and to others or harm then it's Haram imagine a person who's a pilot traveling from Kuala Lumpur to Jeddah Saudi Arabia the flight is about nine hours eight and a half hours but he's headed towards the West which means that the flight takes off at 12 o'clock noon so it's been fasting for six hours from six o'clock to twelve local time in Kuala Lumpur and he flies eight and a half hours so these are fourteen and a half hours of fasting he ditches Jeddah at two o'clock p.m. local time which means that he has five more hours to fast which means that the total hours of fasting would be twenty-one for him this is hard but the problem is not in it being hard the problem is in his concentration with 300 passengers plus on board and he's the one who's flying if this would cause his concentration to be bad and to endanger the passengers and himself fasting here becomes prohibited and Hara Stage two for a traveler and for someone who's sick I can fast there is no danger from that but there is hardship it's gonna be difficult but hamdulillah my passengers will arrive safely I'm safe I'm not putting myself in danger the sick person says my recovery is on track but the hardship is there I'm not gonna suffer but it is really hard here fasting becomes makrooh disliked why there's no harm done yes there is what that Allah has gave you concession Allah has given you permission not too fast a new reject a Las favour and blessing upon you and insist on fasting why as long as there is hardship and some difficulty it's best to accept a Las gift to you this is phase 2 phase 3 when fasting and breaking your fast is totally equal and this is imagined when you're fasting and you have a flight from City a to city B and the flight is like half an hour any hardship not at all as if I'm sitting home a person who has an illness that allows him to break his fast but he suppresses himself and there is no pain a lot of pain but he can manage in this case whatever the fasting and not fasting are equal scholars say to fast this best why isn't it a lot concession to us permission to us to skip yes but the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages because when you fast in Ramadan you attain the reward of Ramadan when you fast with the congregation with the others around you all fasting it is much easier than when you fast a few months later when you are the only one who's fasting everybody everyone else is not so if fasting and breaking the fast they're equal then it's best for you to fast as long as there is no hardship [Applause] you"
