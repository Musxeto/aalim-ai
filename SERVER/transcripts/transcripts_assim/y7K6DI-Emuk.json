  "transcript": "Jahar from Chechnya Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh I have a question, so according to a Hadith, when you wake up late for Fajr and you miss it because Shaitan urinates in your ear, right? And since urine is najis, do we need to purify our ear and make it Tahira before we can play again? If you can see it, yes, you have to, of course, definitely. But if you can't see it, how will you purify it? And if it is related to Fajr prayer, the urine of Shaitan is not physical, you cannot see it. So if you say to yourself, no, it's your najis, I have to wash it. Okay, keep on washing it. Till when? Till Zuhr. No Sheikh, that's a lot of time. So why? How do you know that it was removed? Maybe there's something left. And this is what Shaitan does to you, and he messes up with your head like this. So ignore it and move on."
