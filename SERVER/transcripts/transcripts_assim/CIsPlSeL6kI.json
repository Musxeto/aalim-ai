  "title": "Since water & oil don't mix, do cream or oil create a barrier, remove before wudu? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "the issue of oil and water do not mix so usually we apply not me usually some people some folks apply oil and cream on their bodies and when it's time for Voodoo they are reluctant is this oil and cream a layer that prevents water from reaching the skin hence my water is invalid or was the essence of oil and the cream absorbed by the skin and it is not a layer anymore the latter is the most authentic opinion if I do this and I have a skinny skin you'll find some oil coming out this grease or oil is natural does it constitute a barrier the answer is no though I can see it I can see on my shiny wrinkled skin it's there but it does not prevent water like when the case I have a a spot of paint that's a layer that can be a scratched out and peeled out therefore the scholars say if you have oil or cream on your skin just rubbing it like this with water normal rubbing is sufficient for your Voodoo to be valid insha Allah"
