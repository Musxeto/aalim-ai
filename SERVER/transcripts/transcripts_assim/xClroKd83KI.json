  "title": "Salafi Imam makes dhikr in congregation, he says its bid'ah but he has no choice, boycott him?",
  "transcript": "Last Shah from Georgia Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu Sheikh I'm from Georgia and here Muslims we are minority. We have and our Imams majority are Maturidis, Sufis etc. We have one Sheikh who is Salafi and he gives lectures in months one or twice in month and sometimes he does not have another option and goes as an Imam. After Salah he makes Congregational Zikr and Dua. He says that this is an innovation but he does not have another choice. Some people say that because of this because of that we can't take knowledge from him. So what's your answer about this? Those who say we cannot take knowledge from him are they as qualified and knowledgeable as him? Yes or no? Abdul Latif uh last year sorry last year you're gone okay no problem no no no no sir are they are they qualified or as knowledgeable as he is no in this case they have no right to speak they they don't even know how to purify themselves after answering a call of nature they don't know a surah of the Quran or a word in Arabic so how dare they assess a mistake he did out of Ijtihad out of weighing the pros and cons he may come to this conclusion by saying I have a conundrum I have a dilemma if I don't make Congregational Dua they will not allow me to be an Imam and they will not allow me to give lectures and teach the proper Aqeedah and the proper Sunnah. By doing the lesser evil doing Zikr after Salah while hating it resenting it I get to teach a lot of good and do a lot of good and let the people trust me and believe in my knowledge and maybe in six months time or a year time I can transform the Masjid into a Salafi Masjid. This is a legitimate reason and this is an issue of Ijtihad and he has the right to do that Ijtihad and not you guys and Allah knows best. you"
