  "title": "Should I stop making dua if my income is Haram & it will not be accepted? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "arfa says should the people having haram income stop making dua till they find the halal job as their dua aren't accepted in anyways the answer is no dua is a form of worship though it is not accepted one does not stop making dua until he finds a halal job rather he continues to make dua and ask allah for assistance it's exactly like if someone goes to a fortune teller and he acknowledges that 40 days of his prayer won't be accepted is it logical for him to say okay if it's not accepted i'm not going to pray alhamdulillah for 40 days i'm going to skip all five prayers of course not if he does this he becomes a kafir so he has to comply and do it and allah azzawajal knows best you"
