  "transcript": "Dima from Germany. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Are you Dima? No I have Dima is supposed to be waiting on online. Siddique from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Assalamu Alaikum. Sheikh I want to know like we know that Allah gave our Prophet ﷺ a high status in Islam and he is beloved to Allah Azza Wa Jal among every prophet among every prophets that Allah sent before and Allah didn't call him by his name directly in the Quran. So my question is why Prophet is so beloved to Allah? What is the reason behind that? Allah Azza Wa Jal loves whomever he wishes. You cannot ask this to normal human beings let alone to Allah Azza Wa Jal. You cannot ask a person why do you love this person more than the other. There is something that he sees in that person that makes him love him more than anyone else. Of course we know that our Prophet ﷺ is the perfect human being that Allah has created among all other of his creation and he bestowed upon him characteristics of perfection in all aspects of life and this is why he deserved to be loved by Allah Azza Wa Jal more than any human being that Allah has created and Allah knows best."
