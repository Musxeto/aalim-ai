  "title": "Non-Practicing family calls me extreme. What to do and how to advise them? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "federer fazer is talking about a situation where she is the youngest in her family and her family are so indulged in innovation that whenever she tries to correct them they argue with her and they say that you have become extreme and most likely a Wahhabi so they claim and they claim that she goes on the internet searching researching the wrong path what should she do first of all our prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam is our role model he did not have his path filled with flowers he suffered a lot from his closest relatives and people his own tribe shunned him and did unspeakable things this did not prevent him from continuing and being steadfast on the straight path and this is how you as a Muslim should be you should be tolerant you should be kind you should be patient you should be smiling all the time don't take it personally these people are ignorant it's like a dentist with a patient who is in pain and agony no matter what he does the patient is gonna shout and scream and maybe kick and punch and do things if the dentist became angry as he is and started cursing or swearing or even hitting his patient this is a lost cause so being the youngest you have to be more tolerant learn and do your homework and do your research and learn how to reply to them in the kindest and most diplomatic way coating only a Quran an authentic Sunnah and that is it use scholars names so that they would not label you they follow X Y Z scholars of their own deviant beliefs so if you use other names they will call you a hobby or a Salafi or whatever so don't use scholars names just simply coat the Quran and show it to them and code the authentic Sunnah of the Prophet I still am if they claim that he loved they love him they must follow him and if they don't listen you have done your duty in front of Allah so you keep on making dua for them and keep on trying our level best to choose the time to give them dower try as well not to give them Dawa when they are together if there are five or six of them and you give them that WA they will all be against you but if you choose one - one person to person then convincing that person you have more chances of doing so rather than when you are addressing five who would all compete in showing how ridiculous your argument is and to look down at you and Allah surgeon knows best"
