  "transcript": "Mina from Saudi? I have two questions. In Sha Allah this year I'm planning to perform Hajj and I will opt for Hajj Kiran. I am very clear that I have the option to go directly to Mina on 7 Dhul Hijjah and 12 Qudoon is actually Sunnah. But there is a confusion among my colleague that no, you have to go first to Haram to perform Tawaf Umrah followed by Sahi Umrah and then start going to Mina and do the rituals and then do Tawaf Ifadah and Sahi Ifadah. First of all, what your friends had said to you is totally not correct. A person when doing Hajj has three rituals to perform, either Ifrad or Qiran or Tamattu. As you're opting for Qiran, this means that you have the option of doing one of two. Either you follow the Sunnah, which is to go to Mecca on the 7th and you perform Tawaf Al-Qudoon, which is a Sunnah. What do you mean by Sunnah? This is not Tawaf Al-Umrah? No, it's not a Umrah. What your friends are telling you is totally bogus and wrong. This is Sunnah. You offer seven rounds, which is Tawaf Al-Qudoon, followed by seven rounds of Sahi, which is not part of the Umrah rather, this is called Sahi Al-Hajj. And then you go to Mina. And you do the rituals and everything on the day of Eid, you go to Mecca to do Tawaf Al-Ifadah, which is a pillar, but you don't follow that with Sahi of Al-Hajj because you've already done that on the 7th, after Tawaf Al-Qudoon. Oh, so I have the option to offer Sahi Al-Hajj earlier than Eid? The answer is yes, this is how the Prophet offered this. Okay, then what's the second option? The second option is you don't go to Mecca at all. On the 7th of Dhul Hijjah, or the 8th of Dhul Hijjah, you go straight to Mina. I don't do Tawaf, I don't do Sahi? No. The Prophet did the Tawaf Al-Qudoon, did Sahi Al-Hajj, and went to Mina. He did not clip his hair. You never clip your hair if you're a Mufrid or a Qarin until after the day of Eid. So your second option is to go straight to Mina. Okay, then what? Do all the rituals of going to Arafat, Muzdalifah, and then on the day of Eid you go to Mina? Now, you have two pillars left. Tawaf Al-Ifadah, and by the way Tawaf Al-Ifadah is a pillar of Hajj. Without it, your Hajj is invalid. It has three names so that you don't become confused when you read some of the books available or on the internet. Name number one, Tawaf Al-Ifadah. Name number two, Tawaf Al-Ziyarah. Name number three, Tawaf Al-Hajj. All three are for the same ritual. Afterwards, you offer Saa'i Al-Hajj because you did not do them on the seventh. And after you do the Tawaf Al-Ifadah and Saa'i Al-Hajj, normal clothes. You don't have to be in the state of Ihram. And you don't shave or clip your hair afterwards. These are pillars of Hajj. These are not a Umrah. So I hope this makes some sense to you. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days. And bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all. Bi-idhnillah."
