  "transcript": "Mail from Germany. Assalamu Alaikum. Alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. If I accidentally forget a letter in a verse in prayer in something that is obligatory, can I just repeat the sentence or do I have to pray Sujood As Sahoo? I don't know if I'm changing the meaning of the word so I'm not sure. Give example. For example if I say um I make a mistake in Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim and I just forget for example the air. If you make a mistake and you realize it immediately just simply repeat the wrong word you had said. So if you said Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim and you forgot one letter you just repeat it say Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim and there's no Sujood As Sahoo for that. But if you made a mistake that entirely changed an obligatory act for example in Ruku' instead of saying Subhana Rabbiyal Azeem you said Samee'Allahu Liman Hamidah or you said Subhana Rabbiyal A'ala Subhana Rabbiyal A'ala Subhana Rabbiyal A'ala then you raise your head Samee'Allahu Liman Hamidah then oops what have I done I didn't say Subhana Rabbiyal Azeem. In this case yes you have to expiate this by offering two Sujood As Sahoo before your Salaam and Allah knows best."
