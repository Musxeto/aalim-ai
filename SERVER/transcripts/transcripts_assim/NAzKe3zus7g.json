  "title": "Family Conflict Resolution: The Prophetic Way #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "[Music] as you can see I have reached the age of puberty with the grace of Allah and my voice inshallah Will Carry Me Through the two sessions I hope and I pray to Allah both ways you're not going to understand what I say so it doesn't make a great deal a great difference but inshallah we will try to gain something out of these sessions so that when we go home we may fix what is is broken if we have things that are broken so before we go into how to solve conflicts between the family we have to understand that the bond of Brotherhood is the strongest of all and Brotherhood is divided into three types or levels number one one Brotherhood through blood relations your siblings your brother and sister number two Brotherhood referring or related to conviction and belief Allah says in the Quran what verily the Believers are are brothers and the third level is when you have a combination when your Brad relations are Muslims and this is the strongest of all and what is the word kinship in Arabic no sah is connection to connect kinship anyone and when I went to Indonesia they say means kinship this is one meaning the other meaning is the womb where a fetus is formed in so the word Rim kinship is derived from the womb and it shows that this strong bond is formed there imagine the prophet saysat when Allah created the creation when Allah created the universe and was done with it stood up kinship stood up is kinship a creature of Allah yes it's a creation of Allah like death like life so it stood up and said oh Allah this is the standing up the position of someone seeking refuge in you from being SED so Allah asael said yes wouldn't it please you that I connect those who connect you and civer those who civer you Alim said yes this pleases me Allah said I shall do that and your prayer is answered so the issue between you and your siblings is not rivalry is not something that to be taken lightly it is something that may make you enter J and it may make you enter hell the prophet said the one who Shivers his kinship will never enter whoa that is scary I pray five times a day I make once a year I pay charity I try to do many good things but I have problems with my siblings well you have a problem with Jenna nowadays we are seeing so many problems surfacing in our communities problems between the siblings problems that turned into enmity and hatred they have become real enemies we have case issues Court ISS cases between the siblings do you have it here we have it a lot in where I come from siblings they are filing cases against their own siblings not only that it Cascades to their children so my children must not communicate with their uncle and his might must not communicate with mine and they're total strangers sometimes they live in the same neighborhood they don't talk for 10 20 years and if my son speaks to his cousin I will cut him off and kick him out this is Shan's handiwork the bond of brother Brotherhood is one of the greatest of Allah's favors upon us to feel the pain of your brother when he's tired when he's suffering to support him to give him the impression that your strength is mine and mine is yours your weakness is mine and my weakness is yours Allah asael says in the Quran and hold firmly to the Rope of Allah altogether and do not become divided and remember the favor of Allah upon you when you were enemies and he brought your hearts together and you became by his favor Brothers Subhan Allah Allah is showing his favor to the companions that they've become brothers and this shows you you the strength and the beauty of this Bond so Brotherhood and I'm talking about that between the siblings your Brotherhood with your brother and sister from the same father and mother this is not a list of names found on your ID cardim IB Muhammad IB no no no no the Brotherhood is not a list of names it is not Le leaves in the family tree that we're proud of oh this is my lineage it is not a friendship that I can end and terminate when my friend betrays me or stabs me in the back this Brotherhood is not related to if you visit me I visit you and if you are kind to me I'm kind to you no it's not like that that with your brothers and sisters the prophet saysat wasam the one who maintains a relationship with his relatives only because they maintain a relationship with him is not truly upholding the ties of kinship the one who truly upholds those ties is the one who does so even if they break off the relationship the beauty of Brotherhood is when you make your sister or your brother feel their value in your life when you make them feel that you miss them that their issues and worries are your own that when they cry and shed tears the tears come from your own eyes before it comes from theirs the real Brotherhood is when your brother or sister is inclining and about to fall you're there to help them it's when you are their cane without them asking you to assist them you are siblings brothers and sisters you have been made in the same womb drank from the same milk ate from the same plates lived in the same house have the same Memories the same DNA runs in your veins the blood it's the same it is very important to know the status of your siblings not only for yourself but also for your wife or your spouse and children you have to draw a red line that is not possible to cross because the vast majority of problems between siblings are caused by the spouse and the children and they put fuel to the fire and they say no he did this he did that you should not have remained silent you should respond you should make a stand to it Subhan Allah don't allow anyone to come between you and your siblings and I mean anyone not a wife not a husband not children all can be replaced not your siblings this dun Wallah is not worth an hour of boycotting your own siblings one smile one SMS one phone call one message that you give Salam to your brother or to your sister sister it will demolish and annihilate mountains of hatred and enmity one smile it will fill his spirit with joy and with love for many many days to come you need to make the first step this is where shatan stands firm no after all what he had done to you after all what she said after about your wife about your children no this is Shan the more you listen to shatan Shan is happy with you and he's pleased with you the bad news is when Satan is happy and pleased who's angry Allah is angry with you one meeting with the families W it cleanses your heart it relieves you from stress and problems but you have to make the first step step so this introduction was necessary it's a reminder for each and everyone don't look around people are look usually when we are reminded we look yeah yeah he's sinful he's sinful he's sinful he's sinful what about yourself no no Sheikh is not talking to me no you are the one who's being addressed revise your relationship with your siblings and how Shan has infiltrated your heart filled it up with hatred with enmity with grudges would you like to see all of this in your grave she but he hurt me a lot he did very bad things let go life is nothing soon it's going to end one small piece of of of uh uh uh uh peas can shoke you and make you die one heart attack can make you die a stroke can make you die a car accident can make you die so many things so life is not worth it fill up your grave this is what's going to be inshallah a garden of paradise don't make it a pit of of Hell Fire what are the reasons of conflict between the siblings whoa mashallah good morning yes what are the reasons of conflict between the siblings some researchers divide people into two segments below 12 and above 12 so if anybody is in this category yeah forgive us so those who are below 12 why would they have conflict and fights main reason that we never ever suspect it huh what do you think y let us get you to interact so I can get a break and I don't speak huh as if I'm getting it h good good okay okay huh misunderstand 12 years of age okay yeah it can be H what else ah yeah you spoiled it yeah why couldn't you wait a little bit attention of the parents the vast majority between fights between the children below 12 is to draw attention of parents it's not about selfishness it's not about greed it's not about enmity or hate no no no no I just want to bring attention and if I get this much attention is better than zero so they make problems they shout they misbehave and what is the solution definitely it's not preaching don't bring sheim and say okay come and sit with my kids I hate sitting with kids to preach them my M my own I can but Outsiders it they kill me when they bring me to conferences and say shh you have a session with 12 years or eight years of age what do you I'm not youfest this I can't do this I'm not good at it I speak with only teenagers and above those who have evil thoughts because I know how they feel pure souls are not my type are not my cup of tea so so usually the best way the best and only way to solve such problems at a young age is what to give the children attention you have to give them quality time when you see a naughty child or a naughty boy disciplining them in the bathroom and closing the door for two hours only makes them possessed by gin and then you come to me and say do I don't do R even because I have so many gin and demons in me I would be harming you if I do R so the best way to discipline children is to give them love unconditional love and this is something very difficult for us how can I love them how can I do this when they're naughty and not disciplined and not obedient no no you have to when you give unconditional love you get love love and respect in return children need to be emotionally fulfilled and we fail miserably in this uh uh section especially fathers mothers by Nature they're loving they're kind they're cuddly they love to hug and kiss and mush all the time fathers alikum what's up you're we're cool okay y the the child is dying he's in surgery be strong don't cry huh this is how fathers are this is wrong Your Role Model is who Muhammad our Prophet what did he do with alassan Al Hussein um he used to hug them kiss them he would come down from the member of Juma imagine giving and all of a sudden the sheh whoa comes down and picks up his grandchild and goes back again what is this the prophet he says I could not control myself I saw my child my grandson walking I just out of love came and embraced him and hugged him and kissed him this is how we should treat our children how do you treat your children so many of us have problems and I know this is not my topic but yeah who cares so many have problems when they especially the fathers they are so rigid and stiff memorize the Quran you have to do this you have to do that instructions only No Love No care no kissing no hugging no quality time and they put all the pressure on the poor woman poor mother it's your mistake it's you your Arabic is not good you should have learned more Arabic so that you can teach your son okay what about you I don't have to teach anyone why would I learn learn Arabic so Subhan Allah there is an imbalance it this is not good management so coming back again you have to give your kids unconditional love is it a valid reason to go and solve problems every time they fight no no you're not the heg you're not Security Council and they are children every time okay sit here and sit here what's the problem you tell me okay no no no don't interrupt now you rebuttle it doesn't work like this so how does it work give them conditional unconditional love give them ice cream each individually and collectively let them feel that there is sufficient and enough love for everyone because if you try to break the problem and the issue and solve it you will take sides and the moment you take sides it's gone yes it doesn't mean that we do not reprimand we have to reprimand you broke his toy I'm going to take your toy in in instead of his and this is one of the ways of solving conflicts the prophet did thisat how once imagine look at the Prophet this is for the men who consider them themselves real men male Alpha our alpha male huh so many videos nowadays spreading between the youngsters I'm a male Alpha what what's male Alpha I don't know this but when I saw some of the weird ideas they have this is UN Islamic they're treating women as trash this is this is part of being a male Alpha look what the male Alpha didam he was sitting with his companions in the house of AA may Allah be pleased with her mother AA it's her day all of a sudden a maid comes in with a plate with food from the house of safia the co-wife it's not her day but she's sending food to the prophet saw this and a fuse was burnt she could not handle herself may Allah be pleased with she's young she's beautiful she's beloved to the prophet yeah she knows who she is she stood up in front of every other man in the Gathering of course with his hijab from head to toe and struck the maid's hand making the plate fly and break on the ground and the food scattered the companions may Allah be pleased with them said and froze because whoa what has just happened this is too dramatic we we've never seen things like this what did the prophet say Alam oh the calculations in our heads I'm a male Alpha h I should beat her up no I should divorce her no I should make a stand how is embarrassing in front of all these men what did the male Alpha doat he said to them don't worry don't worry your mother AA is jealous it's okay sit down Sit you can breathe he go he went and collected the food because the food is it's not to be thrown away and he collected the food and he said TOA I'm taking one of your plates in exchange for the plate you broke end of story call would you do this male Alpha oh I'm Bravo Alpha she I'm Charlie Alpha I'm I'm not this no no this is how we should solve conflicts with wisdom with patience with perseverance but this is not the time okay what about if they are above 12 years of age what's the main reason for conflicts usually it's violating the others rights in my home usually the conflict is she took my blouse she took my shoes without my my permission she is using my stuff without my permission and when you go and ask why did you do this what's the response two months ago she did the same I what's what's wrong and it's my my father's money it's not her money he bought us this so if I'm using it or she's using mine it's okay now this is a clear sign of disrespect here is where the parents have to draw a line you remember yesterday we said the parents have to put ground rules in the house this is the ground rules that shows that you have a closet family without these rules it is like a jungle survival of the fittest who is Ever stronger who ever louder would live no here is where the parents have to step in and say no enough is enough you're not allowed to enter someone's else room without their permission you're not allowed to trespass on their privacy or take their things without their uh uh opinion or without their permission okay so let's go into conflicts are conflicts healthy do they have benefits or they're all pure evil everything in life has benefits even Satan even Satan has benefits even illness I'm Ill this has benefits correct what's the benefit many and if I were to list them and speak about them this would take us an hour but I'll just give you headlines number one they erase sins so a conflict a problem erases sin it doubles your reward with Allah it indicates that Allah loves you and this is a clear sign when Allah loves people he does what he tests them so this conflict is a test for you number four these conflicts they train you and purify your heart because it conditions you and teaches you and prepares you for the Future IT grants you number five the ability to be grateful so when when a conflict takes place this is a test whether to be grateful or to be ungrateful it also conflicts pushes you to ask Allah for forgiveness when problems happen between the siblings what do you do curse bang your headche against the wall some I know listen to music as loud as possible what are you doing I'm stressful when you're stressful you listen to music this Haram or watch movies just to relieve themselves you're sinning so no it is a way for you to ask Allah for forgiveness seventh benefit is that it reminds you of the nature the true nature of Dunya when conflicts happen you see how cheap and silly and trivial this life is and all what remains is with Allah eighthly it motivates you to repent and ninthly it shows you the favor and blessing of Allah yesterday we did not have a conflict I did not appreciate Allah's favors and blessing now with the conflict Subhan Allah so how to solve conflicts when they take place first of all you have to pinpoint what the problem is you cannot solve any problem without identifying it and knowing the cause of it when it happened why it happened how it happened so you have to identify the problem and this is what most of us fail to do again yesterday we spoke about the headache a person with cancer suffers from giving him two pan adults would not solve his problem it will solve the symptom so when you look at the symptom lots of shouting lots lots of bickering lot LS of uh uh lack of cooperation these are symptoms look at the core of the problem and identify it then number two look for Solutions because you identify the problem but you don't search for Solutions and you may number three have a number of solutions but you have to choose the best you can't choose any solution in the battle of the trench or Al the prophet and the companions in Medina were attacked by 10,000 Warriors from the tribe of gatfan and from quray what was the solution number one let's go and meet them number two let's stay in our homes and fight from rooftops now number three let's wait until they come many solutions were there the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam studied all the solutions and picked one which was the advice of a companion it was allegedly Salman Al faresi to build and dig a big trench and he did this so he chose the best of the solutions and number four implementing the solution so many of us identify the problems they have the solutions they choose the best one but they lag behind and they do not implement it you need to solve the problems sometimes for a a person who manages is the problem and the solution sometimes you may not be the right one sometimes you need to delegate sometimes I'm Too Hot Blooded if I get involved I'm going to spoil things so I may delegate it to an elder sibling I may delegate it to the wife I may delegate it to someone who is much wiser and better you need to look at the appropriate person to run the solution for this problem and one of the most important problemsolving Solutions is you do not exaggerate we Muslims tend to exaggerate the problem sometimes it's a trivial issue we make it so big that Satan makes us depressed and worried because it you know what is an and is mentioned in the Quran is the secret conversation of two in the presence of a third when they speak together see secretly and the third one is present with them what would happen to him he will become depressed and why he thinks that they are laughing and plotting and talking about him this is totally prohibited in Islam if you are three in a car or in a room you cannot whisper in the ear of your companion without informing the third one Allah says the reason to depress the Believers so Satan focuses on depressing you on making you sad on making you intimidated and this is why he inflates big things the vast majority of people who come to me for counseling they suffer from OCD obsessive compulsive disorder and this only or mostly comes to people who are religious who are practicing they come to me sheh last year I was a womanizer I used to party all night long I used to drink booze I used to do everything that is Haram I never had a waswas in my life the moment I started practicing and I stopped doing all of this I cannot even breathe why because Satan is trying to bring you down so he introduces this he introduces overthinking exaggeration this is what is happening when we have a conflict and always think of Allah's favors and blessing upon you that this conflict was not bigger Muhammad was one of the great Scholars had a pimple or a sore um thing on his hand so it has P it was swollen it looked ugly so one of his students came and saw it and you could see he was disgusted by it it it didn't look good what did Muhammad he said to him my friend imagine if this was at the tip of my tongue imagine if it was at the tip of my eye imagine if it was at my private part how would that have been horrible so alhamdulillah it was he said this student of his he said W when he told me this I thought that this was nothing because when you see the big problems that could have been facing you compared to the problem that you have you see that this problem of yours is nothing we have a problem of exaggeration and as usual I always like to pick fights with the sisters the most yeah uh uh people who exaggerate are the sisters why this is mentioned in an authentic Hadith the prophet saidat oh women folk give charity for I've seen you the ma vast majority of people of Hellfire said prophet of Allah why he said because you show your ingratitude in Arabic kufur so they said do we make kufur with Allah he said no you show your in gratitude to your husband if your husband is good to you all year round but he makes a mistake once you say I've never seen anything good from you Subhan Allah and this is something that most women not all most women do when they're angry so they neglect all the goodness in men in her husband is is it possible that she never had a good time with her husband not a single day nothing no but when she's angry this is what comes out of her now the sisters they say okay but Sheik men do this do men do this the men are saying no the men are known to be Liars the men do this religiously we do this all the time the only difference is that Allah placed a lot of burden on women more than men so if they do this they go to hell if we do this we will be punished but not as much why because we have more responsibilities than the women we have to work we have to provide we have to uh meet the people outside we have to suffer greatly while the sister is sitting between four walls yes it's boring but she's safe she doesn't have to go to bed worrying like me ah how am I going to pay the rent how am I going to pay the electricity bill they gave me a notice if you don't pay in 5 days we going to cut the power this and that okay what about the children's school fees what about this my father is asking me for money my mother says that I did not send her her monthly uh uh allowance and while the sister they have problems mainly when I'm going to do the uh the laundry when am I uh going to cook the Biryani is going to be chicken or meat they have problems but the problems of the men are far greater this is why the prophet saidat in aith to prove that yes men do the same he says no believing man should hate a believing woman if he hates one of her characteristics he will be pleased with another so even men when you find that your wife is nagging I hate this in my wife yeah but she's beautiful she is a good cook my mom loves her because she's nagging she speaks a lot my mom loves people who speak I don't speak at all so my mom sits 6 hours with her chitchatting I don't know what they talk about but she loves her and thinks of her the world so if you hate her nagging there are so many things you love be fair and realistic and sometimes when conflicts happen there may be no solution other than being patient there are so many members of our family who are born to be a nuisance they whatever you do they're hard to get by you cannot live with them they're always controlling they're always putting you under pressure they're always making you feel like you've done something wrong I haven't done anything wrong but this is how they speak to you so what to do there is no other choice for you but to be patient when Kabab may Allah be pleased with him came to the prophet Alat wasam in Mecca complaining of his back being whipped and flogged and being tortured and he said oh prophet of Allah wouldn't you ask Allah Asel to avenge us can't you see what's happening to us what did the prophet sayat the man is complaining what is the solution what do you want me to do I I have no solution for you so the prophet said to him before you there used to be people like you and they were tested to the extent that a man would be brought with a saw placed on his head and his whole body is saw into two divisions two parts and this would not make him reject Islam and it would be brought to him coms of iron and he back the flesh would be combed with a comb of iron taking the flesh oh mallah 5 minutes okay I have in so and this would not repel him and throw him away from his religion what does this mean it means that I have no solution so some conflicts you do not have a solution for them except patience you have to have patience you have to have wisdom in dealing with your siblings in conflicts because if you are granted wisdom Allah has granted you great favor and blessing Allah says and whoever has been given wisdom has certainly been given much good this is not given to anyone the wisdom sometimes you have to accept the problem and divert it a man comes to the Masjid in the presence of the Prophet Alam urinates in the middle of the Masjid in Medina what happened to the companions not angry outrage they wanted to go and eat the man in front of the prophet in the Masid what are you doing you crazy but look at the prophet alam's wisdom the man urinated kalas it's done the the harm is done if you go and interrupt him the guy is going he's going to soil the whole Masjid but if you leave him it's going to be contained in what a small area I said leave him leave him the man finishes go and pour a bucket of water on it and end of story come the man comes terrified after he saw the the Sparks coming out of the companion's eyes and they said my nephew this is a beautiful word my nephew these places were not made for such filth they were made for prayer remembering Allah reading the Quran the man loved the prophet the most and he thought of him the most to the extent in the prayer when the prophet was praying the guy was making Dua loudly oh Allah forgive Muhammad and myself and have mercy on us and don't have Merc Mercy on anyone else because of the way the prophet treated him now we have to in in in solving conflicts focus on the core of the problem why so many men come and ask shh my wife doesn't beautify herself for me this is a symptom look for the cor of the problem go to the sister why aren't you beautifying yourself she says he does not take a shower except once a month he stinks like a stun a skunk he smells his mouth is always repulsive he doesn't brush he doesn't use miswak he doesn't eat meant okay when we spoke to the brother he was offended but he took care of himself and I told him you want yeah you pay peanuts you get monkey pay something expensive you get something expensive so he took care of himself he started shaping up you know taking care of his beard the beard H because we don't put perfume in it we don't put shampoo condition it men of wisdom do this they take care of themselves one week later things have changed they've never came back I lost $100 but alhamdulillah we have a from Allah beware when solving conflicts from resorting to Haram sometimes one of the parties would not accept except by having something Haram you cannot have this in order to solve conflicts it has to be an Islamic way of doing it start with the easy then go upwards in hardship don't kill a mosquito huh with a cannon the cannon would kill the mosquito and everyone else so when you have a problem a conflict don't start by okay I'm going to kick him out of the house I'm going to boycott him I'm not going to speak with him for six years or 10 years no begin little by little and then gradually go up and maybe you have to reprimand you advise you intimidate but when the last resort is to buot then you bycott some of the parents do this I have a problem with my son kick him out why try to use and likewise with the wife the wife is disobedient divorce her wait Allah said in the Quran that those wives from whom you fear arrogance first advise them one month of advising advising advising then if they persist forsake them in bed don't have any intimacy show them that you don't desire them and if they persist finally strike them lightly not with a baskball baseball bat not from the very beginning boom no this is gradual and this is for the goodness of the marriage you don't beat a wife just out of the blue you have these instructions in the Quran and the beating has to be in accordance to Islam so it has to be with a miswak that doesn't leave Mark doesn't shed blood doesn't break a bone it's something symbolic to show her that you have reached the end of the rainbow if nothing is fixed then divorce can be uh resorted to um we have lots of things to discuss but this yeah who cares what are they going to do they're going to cut the power I'm going to speak nobody's after me I'm the only one and you guys don't have to eat breakfast uh so um you have to also look for Solutions outside of the box sometimes the solution is not in front of you and for example a man the prophet tells us this is Hadith a man bought a property from another man when the man took the property he found a jar of gold what would you do it's mine I'm not going to do it's mine I bought the man was so honest he went to the seller and he said I bought the house from you not this jar of gold this is yours that's stupid in our standards now what's more stupid is the seller he said I sold you the house with whatever was in it the jar is yours and they started fighting no I'm not going to take it no you have to take it if I was there I said guys why fight I'll take it so what did they do they went to an arbitrator someone to solve the problem and the man thought out of the box what did he say he said to them do you have a son he said yes and he went to the other do you have a daughter he said yes said okay my advice is marry the daughter to the son with this gold and make them live a happy life end of story this is an authentic Hadith the prophet is telling us this this is thinking of the Box don't always think it's black and white one is wrong one is right no sometimes you have to compromise likewise Malik may Allah be pleased with him was a rich man he gave a loan to someone and that someone did not have money to pay back so started asking for his money that's his right and the man said wah I don't have and they started shouting in the Masjid so the prophet looked at them in the Masjid he said what's the problem said I gave him money long back and he's not returning it and the man says Prophet I don't have so the prophet said how much is it kaab said XY Z so the prophet said take half of it and leave half and forgive him in half of the debt and he said to the man give him half of the debt said okay half is better than nothing and the man is happy because now I can afford half but not the full payment so problems can be solved but if we try to do this with a good intention and with loving one another w we will have a good life and a good Community I apologize I have so much material but no gas to take this vehicle away and the brothers are throwing me with pibbles so I have to conclude don't worry"
