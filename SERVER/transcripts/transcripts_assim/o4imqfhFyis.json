  "title": "I don't pray with my father as I don't know if his Wudu is valid or not, is this ok?",
  "transcript": "Unice from Germany How are youum alhamdulillah um so my father explained me how to do in a rather strange Manner and if I see I don't know whether it's wiping or washing so because I don't know whether his prayer is valid I pray alone since like 2 years or so and he's fine with that there are no other men at home so my my question is can I continue like that if no one gets angry or must I be certain okay PR valid or invalid and then pray with him accordingly the default is that his prayer is valid until proven otherwise without proof you cannot decide not to pray behind him as this is theab of Al so the would come and enter a Masjid and say this Imam we don't know of his a so we're going to not call him a cfir but we will not call him a Muslim because we're not certain and they don't pray behind him so I hope you don't have the same and Shan did not lure you down to that level yet"
