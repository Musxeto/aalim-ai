  "transcript": "in the case of a person who delays making up Mis fasts is there any experation to be paid at all by that person the right ruling is that if a person misses any fast in the month of Ramadan he should make it up as soon as possible latest by next Ramadan if he doesn't make up for the fast before the next Ramadan then it's a sin in this case you should ask for forgiveness and you should make it up as soon as possible as as far as experation is concerned the difference opinion some Scholars said that because he delayed he should give some experation and feed one poor person for every F has missed but there is no proof in the authentic Hadith that experation should be given the Quran is very clear in Surah Bak chapter number two verse number 185 that if a person is ill on a journey he should make up the fast later on from the other days there's no experation mentioned here so the right ruling is that if he has delayed too long he should make it up as soon as possible offer the but there's no experation and this is the ruling of most of the scholars including sh Salman he says that you know it is he should make up the fast as soon as possible but there's no proof for experation but he should ask for forgiveness for having delayed to make up the fast"
