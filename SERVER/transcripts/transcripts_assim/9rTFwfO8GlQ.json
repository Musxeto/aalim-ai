  "transcript": "Zen says is it permissible to watch football matches and support our favorite football teams I personally don't like football and this is my personal preference it's a bit weird that 20 men run after a ball by each one of them a bowl and let them enjoy themselves but the trend of football the FIFA the money involved the chaos and this money spent the time spent the efforts and the fights this is planned for and Muslims should not be hooked and addicted to such a thing yes you enjoy something that is beautiful a beautiful game a beautiful goal this is probably you enjoy watching a match once every couple of weeks or once a week acceptable but to go and buy sport channels like I have friends and brothers who do this pay real hardcore money for subscriptions and watch like three hours or four hours of tennis of badminton of MBA of the FIFA of Bundys League of whatever they have names for it and then you ask the brother to to perform five push-ups and he is unable to do this this is pathetic this is a waste of time and effort you go and play yourself and become a sportsman become healthy and strong rather than just sitting on your backside and watching people run away and making billions while you're just sitting there worthless watching football is okay providing that there is no aura exposed and that does not consume a lot of your temp time or divert you from what allocated you for"
