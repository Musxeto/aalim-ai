  "title": "Upto what age of a non mahram child can a woman be around without hijab? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh at what age is it permitted for a male child to see a woman's face um for a woman to take care of that my own child and to socialize with him or touch him from the offense agenda do you mean I mean what what age is a woman allowed to sit in front of a boy who's a nun mahram and uncover her face correct yes okay so there isn't a specific age all Scholars agree that if a boy reaches the age of a pube of puberty he's a man so everything goes for him as a man not mixing not looking at women and not being alone with them and if a woman believes that her face must be covered then she must cover her face and if the child is seven or below they all agree that there is no hour to be covered from him in the sense that she is entitled to sit in front of him like she sits in front of her brother her father her uncles not that she's naked but she's wearing normal clothes with her hair open face Etc now when the child reaches an age most likely it's about 10. this is when their perception their knowledge their way of perceiving things and looking at things differ so at the age of 10 and above generally speaking not all children not all boys they start comparing they start admiring and they would recognize when a girl or a woman is a bombshell and when she's not and they would look at points of attraction if we can say that in a woman this is when a woman should cover but she should cover her full body and she can keep her face and hands out because still the child has not reached the age of puberty when the child is like 11 and a half 12 or 13 years of age this is approximating the age of puberty then she should cover totally from him and Allah azzawajal Knows Best"
