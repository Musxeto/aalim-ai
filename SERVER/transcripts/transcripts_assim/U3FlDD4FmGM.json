  "transcript": "Abdul Mujib from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So my dad, my dad doesn't keep beard, he's clean shaved and I've tried to give him down a few times. He said it's not wajib, it's not recommended, so no. But my question is, he's coming to stay with me for a few weeks and would I be sinful if he asks me for my clipper, that he wants to use it to shave his beard or perhaps maybe facilitating, I mean in helping him to get maybe his own clipper or shaving powder to shave his beard. Jazakallahu Khairan Yes, it is not permissible for you to assist your father or anyone else in committing such a sin, such as shaving the beard. But if he asks for a shaving kit, and we know that Muslims use such shaving kits for pubic hair, for their armpit and different areas of the body, so this is probable. Yeah, I know he's going to most likely use it to shave his beard, but probably he's going to use it to do something else, which is part of the sunnah. I see no problem in doing that. But if it's a particular thing that can only be used with the beard, like aftershave for example, definitely not. You cannot assist him on that and Allah knows best. Al Fatiha."
