  "transcript": "The last two questions In Sha Allah. Sheikh, what is the ruling of giving adhan to a newborn and shaving head on the seventh day? Is this part of the aqeeqa? The most authentic opinion among scholars is that there is not a hadith that is authentic in the adhan in the right ear of a newborn. And definitely the iqama in the left ear is totally fabricated. I don't know about the two sunnah raka'a afterwards. If you do the adhan and do the iqama, might as well pray two raka'as. Let's get it over with. So the adhan is not authentic. If it's authentic, why wouldn't we do it? And the problem is that the hadith is not authentic, yet people justify. Oh Subhanallah, do you know why do we give adhan to the ear of the newborn? Huh? Enlighten me, oh Einstein. Says because when he dies and we pray a funeral prayer, we don't give adhan. Hmm. That's very interesting. What is this? Where do you get this nonsense from? If the hadith is authentic, do it. The vast majority of scholars, even those who say do it, they say it's not authentic. But it's the word of Allah, do it. No, don't do it. Shaving the head of the newborn on the seventh day is authentic. It's part of the sunnah. And to name him on the seventh day is also part of the sunnah. But you can do it before because the Prophet did it on the seventh and before. And the circumcision can be done any day according to the convenience and when it is appropriate. And Allah Azza wa Jal knows best. And also the aqiqah. It is sunnah to be done on the seventh day. But they're not interlinked. Shaykh, I shaved my son's hair on the seventh, but I did not offer aqiqah except after one year because I did not have money. So now my child is one year old and I will slaughter two sheep. Should I shave his head again? Why? Because no, they're not interlinked. These are different sunnahs to be done alone. And Allah knows best."
