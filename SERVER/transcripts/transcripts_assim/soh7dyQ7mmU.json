  "title": "Using Condom as contraceptive & delaying pregnancy until problems are solved - Sheikh Assim Alhakeem",
  "transcript": "from saudi arabia's question if i understand it correctly if the couple have issues and they would like to delay conceiving until they solve these issues and get to know one another is it permissible for them to use contraceptives and specifically he mentioned condoms the answer is if it's something that is like couple of months few months it's permissible though not recommended because one has to trust allah azzawajal and as long as you've prayed sihara you married her she's your wife you have to be committed so get it over with and begin to form a family if you want to delay it for a legitimate reason a few months here and there no problem however using condoms is not permissible without the prior permission without any pressure from the misses because your wife has rights and using a condom may make her compromise her rights and not enjoy the procedure therefore you have to take her approval and permission for that"
