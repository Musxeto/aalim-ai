  "title": "Transparent socks or socks with holes: can we go out, wipe over or pray with them? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "says what is the ruling on transparent socks the see-through socks and those that have holes in them if you're asking about praying in them or going out with them transparent soxes are not permissible and the reason is that it is as if you're not wearing anything so when a man or a woman wears a see-through shirt that you can see what's underneath can they say that i'm wearing clothes no in the hadith where the prophet said allah that there are two categories of people of hell fire whom i did not see till date one of them are women who wear transparent or tight clothes the hadith says that their covering their bodies but they're actually nude how can you be covering your body and be actually nude by either wearing transparent clothes see-through or tight clothes that give out the shape of your body which you are obliged to conceal so wearing transparent socks falls under this category if you're talking about wiping in wudhu then there's no problem in that because wudu is different for from praying and going out you can you could easily cover your feet with your abeya or with a long dress that falls to the ground while still wearing transparent socks and this doesn't impact your prayer as for the holes it's an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion among jurors that the companions themselves used to wear socks or tessahin or hoof that were worn off and had holes in them so such holes would not invalidate wiping over the socks because they are few and little compared to covering the whole foot analyzer who knows best caramel from"
