  "transcript": "a brother sent an email and he says if someone in the evening realizes that he has a hole in his pants uncovering his Allah is his Salah during that day still valid or should he make up these prayers again it is the consensus of all scholars of Islam that one of the conditions for your prayer to be valid and accepted is to cover your Allah and a man's aura is from his knees to his navel and a woman's aura is her entire body with the exception of the face and the palms of her hands that is of course providing no nun muharram men are looking and the conditions of this dress that a person wears well while praying it should not be Haram in origin so it should be halal a man cannot pray wearing silk he should not buy oh well let us rephrase that he should not be wearing something that is Haram such as pork leather or leather that is not permissible or that he addressed that he stole with a difference of opinion among scholars whether the prayer is valid or not it has to be ample loose not tight if one prays in tight clothes that reveals his hour or if a woman does this her salat is invalid regarding men this is an issue of dispute it is highly not recommended at all for a man to wear something that exposes the shape of his hour it has to be thick and not see-through so either the man or a woman if they wear something that is see-through and exposes the color and the skin of their aura in this case the prayer is invalid now when it comes to praying in trousers that may have a hole in it if the hole is negligible meaning that from a distance a metre or so it is difficult to tell the color of the skin underneath so the hole is tiny the prayer is valid but if the hole is a little bit big in size to the extent that anyone who looks would see the hour or the skin or the color underneath it if a person knows about it yet still prays the prayer is invalid because he did not cover his hour but if it occurred without him knowing it this is a difference there is a difference of opinion among scholars the humbly school of thought and abu hanifa say that if he didn't know then the prayer is valid providing that it is not so wide meaning that he doesn't have his whole back side exposed throughout the whole prayer if it exposed for a short period of time and then he covers it up like a woman praying and then she finds that maybe part of her chest is appearing without her knowing and she tucks it and and hides it immediately the prayer is valid and those who adopted such an opinion used the hadith of amber ELISA Lama may Allah may Allah be pleased with him where he stated that he once used to lead the prayer with his people and he went prostrating he was a child of eight years of age when he prostrated his backside his hour would be exposed so women shouted afterwards saying that cover your Imams anus it's too exposed so they bought him a garment that covered him properly and he was so happy with it at the time because it's the first gift ever to be awarded to him so the scholar said that though it was exposed and it was the major our but it was exploited for exposed for a short period of time and it was unintentional and hence the prayer was valid analyzed Oh gel knows best"
