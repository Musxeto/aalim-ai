  "transcript": "The next question is, how can we hurry up and stop following innovations in Islam? First of all, this is again a long process. We think the moment we acquire some knowledge that we are Sheikhul Islam Ibn Taymiyyah. Some say, no, no, Sheikh, not to that extent. Ibn al-Qayyim okay, but Ibn Taymiyyah, that's too much. In your parents' eyes, you're considered to be a child, a kid. Even if you have a PhD, even if you are a CEO, you're still a child in their eyes. So you can't come from your ivory tower with an article you read on Islam Q&A or Islam Web, or you heard a lecture for Sheikh XYZ, and you come and start giving commands. Do this, no, no, this is innovation, this is haram, this is bid'ah. Nobody accepts this. And this is why in the beginning when you start to practice Islam, you feel isolated. I felt this when I started practicing Islam. Everybody is against me, everybody is my enemy. Well, I still feel the same now because of the media, but who gives any whatever. So no, seriously, when you start to practice Islam, you feel that you're carrying a jewel in your hand. So someone comes to you, you say, assalamu alaikum. Wa alaikum salam. What's the time? Why? You think that he wants to take the jewel. The guy is asking about the time. So first of all, you have to realize that with knowledge comes diplomacy, wisdom, respect, not control and authority. This doesn't come with knowledge. Now we took it the other way around. We're holding the stick from the other side. So we come to our parents, we come to the elders, we come to the respected, we come to the imam of the masjid. We come to the shaykh and say, this is wrong. MashaAllah tabarakallah. Do you memorize the Quran? No. Do you read the sunnah? No. Do you have fiqh? Do you have any credentials? How dare you come and speak to me like this? And if you see my Twitter every day, I'm facing this every single day. People are trying to get under my skin, but my skin is like a rhino. It's too thick. I'm too old to be influenced. But people, wallahi, say insulting things. Alhamdulillah, with age and with wisdom, we've passed this. They come and say, shaykh, you're an ass. This is my nickname. Ass, I am. This is how they spell my name. What do you want me to do? Yeah, they want to insult me, but do you think I'm insulted? No. When someone says to me, you're an ass, do I think I'm going to grow two ears and a tail? Say, from here till tomorrow, I'm going to get your rewards on the Day of Judgment. I'm okay with that. The issue is, when you come to your parents, you can't all of a sudden shove everything down their throat. They will not accept it. Not your siblings, not your cousins, not your relatives, not your colleagues. What to do? Ya akhi, gain their love and respect. Take it easy. Don't rush things. Learn how to gain their love and respect. The moment you start to grow few hair on your face. These are red flags. Oh, Taliban, ISIS. Oh, extremists, Qaeda. Why? There's something wrong. Where is he? In the masjid. Allahu Akbar. Khalas. It's over. Khalas. It's done. Our son is lost. Therefore, you have to gain their love, their respect. Show them that Islam makes you a better son. A better brother. A better neighbor. That you're going out of your way to help them. To assist them. Unconditionally. But if you're like the moral police. Your thob is below your ankle. Oh, your beard is shaven. Wear your hijab. Don't put perfume. Don't do this. Don't do that. What do they see in you? Nothing to be respected. So, I know this is too long. But I think you get my point. Let them love you. This goes as well to the husband with his wife. And with the wife with her husband. When there is difference in Islamic level, the other side feels inferior. So, the moment you open your mouth, they get offended. Don't open your mouth. Give them time to see your sincerity, your love, your devotion. And then it will come little by little. And Allah knows best."
