  "transcript": "zubair says what are the conditions to open a hotel that would make it islamically halal this is a wide topic but generally speaking zubair if you want to open a facility if you want to rent in an apartment if you want to build a hotel you have to avoid anything that is haram so if you serve in your hotel halal products you don't serve pork you don't serve meta dead meat and you don't serve alcoholic beverages then you're okay if there is no music no nightclubs no bars then you're okay if there is segregation meaning that you employ only men or women who are working in segregated areas like accounting etc in their own offices this is okay what is haram is not to do any of the above what is haram is to have the genders mixing men and women what is haram is to facilitate haram in the hotel room so you have satellite channels that display music movies etc which is nowadays unfortunately an essential part of any hoteling business but as a muslim i cannot facilitate such haram things so if you keep this in mind inshaallah your business would be halal final question is from muhammad"
