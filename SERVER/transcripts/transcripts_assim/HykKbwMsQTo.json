  "title": "I see people in Islamic Universities doing bidah but I donâ€™t have knowledge to correct them",
  "transcript": "Okay, first of all, the beauty of Islam is that it defines us and we do not define it. What does this mean? I am an individual. No one can say, oh Sheikh Asim did this, Sheikh Asim did that, which means it's good or bad. No. Islam is what defines me and says if I'm doing good or I'm doing bad, I don't represent Islam. Therefore, Mawlana, Ustaz, Scholars, Professors, Alim, they don't mean anything. If they do good, it's for their own good. If they do bad, then we have to stop. What counts is Islam. So, as Muslims, we are obliged to look at people and label them according to how strict in abiding by the Sunnah. They don't abide by the Sunnah. Disrespectfully or respectfully, you have your way, I have my way. And this is why Allah says, oh Muhammad, this is my way, my straight path. Follow it and don't follow other paths so that you won't go astray. The only path is the way of Allah and the Prophet Muhammad. So, when we see someone who is a scholar or a professor or an ustaz doing bid'ah, I know that this is not following the Sunnah. I don't have to respect or not, let me rephrase that, I don't have to follow him. Who should I follow? Look for someone who follows the Sunnah and be with him because those who follow the Sunnah will take you to Jannah, bi-ibn Allah. And those who do not follow the Sunnah, leave them alone. I don't care. I don't, Dr. Riza says you have to do a surgery in your spine so you can correct your posture. I don't want to, but he's the professor, I cannot have knowledge unless I have his academic knowledge, I cannot speak to him. So, if I don't have the level to talk to him, he may convince me that the bid'ah is good because I don't have strong knowledge. So, no, stay away. He has his bid'ah, leave him and go and be with someone who follows the Sunnah."
