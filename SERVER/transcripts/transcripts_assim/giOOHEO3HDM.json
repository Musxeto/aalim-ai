  "title": "Should we believe in the stories about Prophet Sheeth Seth if it is not backed by the Quran & Sunnah",
  "transcript": "we go to our callers brother [Questioner] from \nthe U.S so Sheikh um I've been watching countless   videos on a particular Prophet named sheet or Seth \nProphet (Peace and Blessings Upon Him) Islamic   preachers like Mufti menk and others have \nspoken about how during the prophet seths   time shaytan came and manufactured the world's \nfirst instruments essentially and also about   how the prophet seth received 50 Chronicles \nout of the 104 that have been sent to mankind   by God they also mentioned how partying and zina \noriginated as forms of fitna during the time of   the Prophet Seth now Sheikh this is personally one \nof my favorite prophetic stories but I'm not sure   if these stories are authentic I know that the \nprophet seth isn't mentioned in the Quran and that   he really isn't mentioning the Hadith as far as I \nknow so my question to you is should we as Muslims   consider these stories true even though to my \nlimited knowledge we don't really have the Quran   and soon not confirming that most of this stuff \nreally did happen during the prophet seth time there are so many stories and fables about \nprophets and messengers of Allah azzawajal   it's Muslims our religion is not about \nstories our religion is about Quran and Sunnah   and there is a very tiny window it's very small \nwhere the Prophet told us whatever you hear   from the tales of the sons of Israel from the Jews \nthrough old scriptures and they don't go against   Quran and Sunnah don't believe them and don't \nlabel them as false just keep them as they are   but don't take any rulings \nfrom them it's just a story   now this is a very tiny window \nwhich may make 1.01 percent nowadays people are so engaged in such stories \nand tales and you never know they love dragons   and they love Sorcerers this is why they watch \nall of these novels and and movies about them   but they are not related to Islam so whether \nSeth is a prophet or not to my knowledge   I don't know so I would say that I believe in \nall prophets and Messengers generally speaking   but those who are not mentioned in the Quran \nand Sunnah I would not go out of my way to say   that Danial for example is a messenger or \nprophet because I don't know yosha is not   a prophet because I don't know we don't have a \nconfirmed evidence backing it up and therefore   as a Muslim I believe that whatever benefits \nus is found in the Quran Sunnah anything else   is elective is not mandatory so we don't spend \ntime and build uh uh castles of sand over   stories that are not authentic or do not have any \ncredibility so I advise you to ignore all these   stories and focus on learning your religion \nand the seerah of the prophet Prophet (Peace   and Blessings Upon Him)"
