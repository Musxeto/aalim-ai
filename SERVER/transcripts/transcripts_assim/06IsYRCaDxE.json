  "transcript": "Bilal from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. How are you Sheikh? Alhamdulillahi Rabbil Alameen. May Allah grant you Jannah Sheikh. And you as well. Sheikh my question is that around maybe five or one two weeks ago, I was like feeling boosted with Iman Sheikh and suddenly, I don't know if it's true, my mind just suddenly went flat down. I think Allah knows best. I don't know what to do Sheikh. Well, you have to go to my YouTube channel and you have to search for videos that talks about increasing your Iman. And I believe I have maybe few lectures and video clips where I give you steps to follow. And Inshallah if you do this, you will restore your Iman and strengthen it."
