  "title": "Divorce from an Alcoholic husband - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "says that a person who is alcoholic was summoned in front of a Shar Court the wife is demanding divorce and separation due to her husband's uh uh not being fit to be a husband the Shar Court looks into the case and says this is totally legitimate the woman is entitled for separation this is her right she no one can force her to stay with a drunk and an alcoholic this destroys his life his marriage and his religion the prophet told usat wasam that whoever gets drunk 40 days Allah will not accept his Salat his prayers even when he's sober so the court says you have total right in asking and demanding divorce however if you were to give the man another chance we will put a condition that if you were to see him drunk again then this would be a divorce and the man says I agree to that if I were to to drink again then she is divorced she has the right to leave and mother sister says that the man when he said this he said it out of being forced to do so otherwise she's going to be divorced so is such compulsion valid does the divorce take place or not first of all generally speaking compulsion prevents divorce or other choices from taking place and materializing example someone brings a gun puts it to my head and says divorce your wife or I'll kill you and I know that he will do that so I divorc my wife afterwards I do not have to do another marriage contract or or anything similar because the marriage is intact and this divorce that I had said has no value at all but in the case of this alcoholic the divorce is the right of the wife and it was delayed and postponed to give him a chance so when he said that if she were to see him drunk again he would be uh uh she would be divorce and he gave her divorce this is a valid condition and it is to take place if he makes what he pledged not to make meaning if he got if he gets drunk and she's aware of that in this case she is divorced automatically and Allah knows best as from sadya"
