  "transcript": "fim from Bangladesh asalam alaykum sh nowadays in this materialistic world nowadays when a family member passes away I don't know why but there is less grief even among the family members L alone the relatives throughout the year due to laziness we rarely find time to keep in touch with relatives it often takes on occasion like a funeral or a marriage ceremony to bring us all together again so my question is sometimes after the B of a deceased relative we stay in the deceased house for a day or two and become more busy in gossiping sharing sorrows and happiness because we got to meet meet each other after 5 10 20 years I'm wondering is it permissible to do such activities during the morning period the answer is no gathering for the purpose of mourning and eating food as if it's an a holiday and feasting and exchanging memories and experience this is not mourning abdah may Allah have mercy on his soul says we at the time of the Prophet Alam the companions used to consider gathering for morning and cooking food for the guests as part of wailing and wailing is one of of the major sins in Islam nah so it is not part of the customs of the Muslims that they gather and feast for a day or two the relatives and they catch up and they this is time for being sad to mourn the dead not to enjoy time and have quality time and crack jokes and engage in normal talk as if we did not lose any love one so with this purpose no this is not permissible and Allah Knows Best"
