  "transcript": "she says that i promise allah to read the quran and never to stop in unless i'm sick i'm unable or i'm on my menses so is promising allah azzawajal considered to be binding this is an issue of dispute some say that vows or known as another can only be mandated if you use the word nether or when you say something that obligates it upon you it is a duty upon me to allah but when you say something that is not one of the ways and forms of making another then this is not a binding thing so when you say oh allah i promise you to do this or that you're communicating with allah some scholars say that this is ambiguous vow which is dependent on your intention so if your intention was i promise you to do this is to mandate it upon myself to force myself to do it then this is another and if it's just a promise without any commitment of obligation then this is not another and allah azza knows best"
