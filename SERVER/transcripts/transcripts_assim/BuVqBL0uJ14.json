  "title": "Scolding Parents for Bringing their Kids to the Masjid (Raising the voice in the Masjid)",
  "transcript": "from the us so my question is um one of the incidents that happened like last week friday the bringing a woman walking with a little boy so the boy was really shy and he started crying in the masjid so after we finished praying jummah one of the ladies started yelling at her and some of the whole ladies started yelling at her like why can't she just stay home and bring you know so then she went to the restroom she was really ashamed so i went to her and told her like is she okay she said well this is the first time you know coming to the masjid with a little boy so he wasn't used to that environment so is the way the lady corrector right okay i will answer latifah from the u.s she says that an incident took place on friday when a woman brought her child and during the salah the child was agitated and he started crying and shouting in the masjid after the salah was over as usual there has to be this person who stands up and appoints himself as the judge and the executioner at the same time so this woman most likely she's an old grumpy woman started to shout in the masjid scolding the mother for bringing her child into the masjid so latifah is asking is this right the answer is no this is not right at all now you cannot say that two wrongs make a right you cannot fix a mistake with another mistake the harm has already been done imagine a man coming to the masjid urinating in the masjid of medina when where the prophet saw his companions are sitting and watching now you can scroll the man you can shout at him you can even beat him but the harm has been already inflicted what did the prophet say allah leave him leave him don't cut him off let him finish what he's doing because the harm has been already done so don't expand the harm let it be isolated in a certain area afterwards he told them to rectify the problem with pouring a bucket of water he spoke to the man and said may allah azzawajal have mercy upon you these messages were not made for such filth they were made for prayers for they care for reciting the quran end of story he taught him and this was the most diplomatic and polite way of the prophet has some the best of teachers what was the impact on the man's heart he loved it he embraced it and he kept it with him to the grave now look at this grumpy old woman who shouted that this woman and her child what impact would she leave on that woman regarding attending the salat in the masjid and on the child who the trauma would probably remain with him for years to come this is not the way of doing it the woman was wrong she should have tested her child and once he started to cry she should have broken her prayer and left the masjid so that she would not annoy the other worshipers but to be treated publicly in this fashion what if she were to reply to that grumpy old woman and say shouting it's none of your business and she cursed her and swore against her she would go into mma physical contact with her what is this this is a masjid and the prophet said allah do not raise your voices in the masjid so if the child was wrong the child is unaccountable this old grumpy woman is accountable for raising her voice and addressing that mother publicly like that she should have spoken to her softly sister next time please be careful if your kid is not well behaved and would cry like this prayer in your home is much better for you and allah knows best you"
