  "title": "Things that amazed him ‎ﷺ | Part 14 - The Role Model | Ramadan 2023 (1444) | AssimAlHakeem",
  "transcript": "There is a good example for you in the Messenger of Allah, for those who hope for Allah and the Last Day and remember Allah much. In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. All praise is due to Allah, Lord of the worlds. I pray and send peace and blessings upon the one sent as a mercy to the worlds. Our Master Muhammad and upon his family and companions. Dear brothers and sisters in Islam, Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh and welcome to this new episode of the role model, Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam. Like any human being, the Prophet ﷺ had feelings. So he may get angry and he may become pleased and he may become happy and he may become sad. Sometimes the Prophet ﷺ would see things that astonish him, things that would amaze him and hence would make him a bit surprised. Whether these things are of Allah's creation and Allah's actions and doings or whether they are from someone else, his companions or anyone else. However, the Prophet ﷺ was never amazed by the adornment of this dunya because Allah told him this directly in the Quran. Not to be fooled by what people possess in their hands, the adornments of this life. Don't be impressed by their wealth, their children, their health, the things that Allah gives to them in this life. Because these are only a test. So the Prophet ﷺ was never impressed by worldly matters. Unlike us, when we see a fancy car, we're shocked, we turn our heads looking at it. When we see a beautiful mansion, a lavish lifestyle, a hefty bank account, we're amazed by it. Not the Prophet ﷺ. Because Allah brought him up ﷺ to not give any importance to such materialistic things. Once, the Prophet ﷺ was given a garment made of silk. And for the Arabs, and non-Arabs, even to us nowadays, the touch and feeling of silk is so soft and nice. So the companions kept on wondering. They were amazed by touching this soft fabric and how beautiful it was. So the Prophet ﷺ redirected their attention. And he fixed the way they look at things by saying to them, do you like the feeling of this fabric? Are you amazed by it? By Allah. The handkerchiefs that Sa'd ibn Mu'adh, may Allah be pleased with him, has in paradise are much better and softer than this. And we know that Sa'd ibn Mu'adh, may Allah be pleased with him, died in the Battle of the Trench. When he was hit by an arrow and no one knows who hit him with. And he kept on bleeding from that injury for a whole month and then he died. And the throne of Allah shook out of happiness when he died. Because he was coming to them. As per the authentic hadith. So the Prophet ﷺ is telling them, this is worldly issues. Neglect it. Don't be amazed by it. Think of the bigger picture. Think of what lies ahead in Jannah if you're destined to enter it. There will be much softer and better fabric than this. Allah, as stated, warned his Prophet ﷺ for being amazed or impressed by such things. Allah says, so let not their wealth or their children impress you. Allah only intends to punish them through them in worldly life and that their souls should depart at death while they are disbelievers. And also Allah says, and do not extend your eyes towards that by which we have given enjoyment to some categories of them. It's being but the splendor of worldly life by which we test them and the provision of your Lord is better and more enduring. This is the attitude of Muslims when you see the richest billionaire. When you see the lavish yachts or palaces they possess. We're not impressed. Good for you. Enjoy it while you can. It's a few years, couple of decades and another one bites the dust. You're six feet under and then you'll get what's coming to you. And for us, we're terrified in this life. We enjoy whatever we can put our hands on only if it's halal and pleasing Allah. And when we look at others, we could care less. Let them enjoy what they want because they're going to pay the price. And we are going to pay the price of whatever we earn unlawfully or we enjoy without having the concession from Allah to enjoy it. So the Prophet, salallahu alayhi wa sallam, sometimes was amazed and impressed by Allah's actions. And this is to glorify Allah. When you're impressed of Allah's actions, this is to glorify Allah and to show that you're amazed by His creation and His actions. Once the Prophet, salallahu alayhi wa sallam, said to his companions, Don't you feel amazed how Allah, azza wa jal, deflects their insults to me, the people of Quraysh? Why? They used to nickname him, Muthammam, meaning the insulted one, the one who's cursed. And he says, Allah deflected this by my own name, which is Muhammad, the name I was born with, and it means the praised one. So no matter how you insult the Prophet, salallahu alayhi wa sallam, no matter how you depict him, wanting to make fun of him or ridicule him, he's still on top. And you are a stinking corpse in a few years' time. Nothing you could do that would tarnish his reputation, salallahu alayhi wa sallam. His name is being called five times a day, every single inch of earth, round the clock, 24 hours, seven days a week. His name is being called in every adhan, in every iqama, in every prayer two billion Muslims offer to Allah, azza wa jal. So you can't touch him, salallahu alayhi wa sallam. You can do nothing. He is the praised one. Allah has praised him and given him the beautiful name of Muhammad. Also the Prophet, salallahu alayhi wa sallam, was amazed, astonished, shocked by how negligent ignorant people are. Aren't we all? We're all ignorant. We live our lives, we pass 20 years of age, 30, 40, 70, 80, and we still think that the energizer bunny is still ticking. We still have time. We still have credit. We're not going to die. And the Prophet, salallahu alayhi wa sallam, was amazed by this and he said, I haven't seen anything like hellfire. Those running away from it are deep asleep. And I haven't seen like paradise. Those seeking it are deep asleep. So neither when you're afraid, you're running away. And neither when you are pursuing and seeking paradise, you're running to it. You're asleep. You're doing nothing. Also the Prophet, salallahu alayhi wa sallam, shared with us his amazement of the disbeliever on the day of judgment. When he stands in front of Allah, azza wa jal, to be held accountable and he says in defiance, No, I don't accept your records, O Allah, that show my sins and my disbelief. I need a witness. So Allah says, you have a witness from your own self and a witness from the angels. So his mouth is shut and his limbs are permitted to speak. So his hands, his legs, his body parts all speak and testify against him that yes, he did this and he did that. Then he's allowed to speak and to open his mouth and he would curse his own limbs. Damn you. I was defending you. I was trying to protect you. And all I get is condemnation from you. You're testifying against me to Allah, azza wa jal, and he's tossed in hell. The Prophet, salallahu alayhi wa sallam, also was amazed. And by the way, when the Prophet, salallahu alayhi wa sallam, sees something that amazes him or impresses him, he would say, subhanAllah. And this is how he would express his amazement, alayhi salatu wa salam. He was amazed once when Umm Habiba, his wife, came to him once and said, O Prophet of Allah, why don't you marry my sister? So the Prophet was shocked by this request and says, would you like this? Because usually jealousy would not allow a woman to want someone else to share her husband with her, let alone her own sister. So he said, would you like this? So she said, O Prophet of Allah, I'm not someone who does not want you, but I would love my sister to share this goodness that I am enjoying in this life. What could be better than the Prophet himself, alayhi salatu wa salam? So the Prophet, salallahu alayhi wa sallam, said, this is not permissible for me. I can't join between two sisters. This is prohibited, as mentioned in Chapter 4, Surat An-Nisa. And then he said, do not display your woman folk to me. Don't propose to me such things. Also the Prophet, when it was related to marriage, alayhi salatu wa salam, used to be shocked by the amount of dowry people pay. A man married a woman from the Ansar and gave her four ounces of silver. And we know silver is nothing. It's what? It's not that much. So the Prophet was shocked and said, alayhi salatu wa salam, four ounces of silver? As if you are taking the silver from this mountain, meaning you're finding it freebies. You just take it and give it away, not having to work hard for it. And what would the Prophet say if he were to see how much dowry people are paying? How much expenses they are wasting over one night in a five star hotel or a wedding hall? Throwing the money over food, over people who would at the end of the night condemn and consider that food was tasteless, not well cooked, not much salt or too much salt. Despite all what you've spent to please them. The Prophet, salallahu alayhi wa sallam, also wondered how could people do such a thing? When they do not give Allah the proper estimate. He visited a man who was sick and really badly sick. And he was so sick that he was so thin. That it was noticeable. So the Prophet, salallahu alayhi wa sallam, asked him, this is strange, did you supplicate, did you make any dua that is out of the ordinary? The man said, yes, I invoked Allah and said, oh Allah, whatever you were going to punish me for on the day of judgment, Oh Allah, make it a punishment for me here in this life so that when I come on the day of judgment, I have no sins to be punished for. And this is why he felt this sick. So the Prophet said, subhanAllah, this is the word, subhanAllah, nobody can tolerate Allah's punishment in this life. Wouldn't you have said, Rabbana aatina fi dunya hasana, wa fil akhira hasana, waqina athab an-nar. Why wouldn't you ask Allah for forgiveness and ask him to give you something that is good in this life and the hereafter and to protect you from hellfire. Then the Prophet made dua for him and Allah cured him with his grace. Sometimes people, when it comes to illnesses, they don't appreciate Allah's power and ability. So once there was someone who's wounded. So the Prophet called the doctor. So the people around him said, oh Prophet of Allah, what would medication do to him? And the Prophet was amazed by the response and said, subhanAllah, Allah Azza wa Jal did not make an illness descend to earth without having a cure for it. So why are you so in despair of Allah's mercy? Every illness has a cure and a remedy for it, a healing for it, but not all people know you have to keep on looking. And the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam would teach his companions if he sees something nice or hears something nice by expressing his amazement. Once he heard the man praying and he said in his prayer, and this is one of the dhikr in prayer, Allahu Akbaru Kabira, walhamdu lillahi kathira, wa subhanallahi bukratan wa asila. The Prophet said, I was impressed and shocked by what he has said because the gates of the heavens were opened for it. Ibn Umar says, after I heard this from the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, I never left saying these words in my prayers. And also the Prophet was amazed by seeing people entering Jannah with shackles in their necks and hands. And we explained this in an earlier episode and these were the captives of war who were taken into captivity as disbelievers. And while they were enslaved, they discovered Islam, accepted it, and this made them enter paradise because of their captivity. The Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam also expressed his amazement when two men from the east came and they delivered a speech in front of the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, pledging their allegiance to him, accepting Islam. So they introduced this with an oration, a beautiful, eloquent speech. The people were amazed by their eloquency, by their beautiful selection of words. And the Prophet said, some of the speech of people is a form of magic. And this is to express his amazement and how impressed he was by what they had said. Praising that the choice of words can have the impact of magic. Of course, the good magic, not the bad evil sorcery. And the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam once was with his companions and all of a sudden he smiled and laughed. And he asked his companions, why wouldn't you ask me what's making you laugh of Prophet of Allah? So they said, what is making you laugh of Prophet of Allah? He said, I was amazed and impressed by the affair of the believer. All of his affair is good. If he was afflicted by a blessing and a favor of Allah, he would praise Allah Azza wa Jal and that would be good for him. But if he was afflicted by a calamity or a test or something that he does not like, he's patient. And that is also good for him. And this is not for anyone except for the believer. Which shows us that the affairs of a believer is always good, perfect, and he's always evolving and ascending in goodness. Whether he's favored and blessed or he's tested and tried by Allah Azza wa Jal. He's always content. He's always praising Allah Azza wa Jal and this can only be to a believer. Non-believers, disbelievers don't share this. And that is why the Prophet was impressed and amazed by how tolerant and content a believer is with the predestiny and the divine decree of Allah the Almighty. We have a short break. Stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back."
