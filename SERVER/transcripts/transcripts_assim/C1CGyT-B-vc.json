  "title": "How to educate parents, relatives on non sunnah culture without hurting their feelings Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "now i i think most of us uh the ones who are young have always experienced this how do we educate or advise our parents or grandparents regarding the non-sunnah culture that they are practicing without hurting their feelings see we have to do whatever it needs whatever is needed to convince them to make them understand and to be committed but at the end of the day only sharia prevails so if i talk to my parents my grandparents about sunnah about wrong practices and they don't want to understand we give them the benefit of doubt by preaching them by speaking to them with wisdom and fair preaching trying to show them the sunnah trying to show them the fat was of the scholars trying to show them evidences from the quran being diplomatic with them showing them things from the seerah which clearly indicates that it is not something that can be tolerated in islam to go against the rulings of sharia for the customs and traditions if they adhere alhamdulillah it's a win-win but if they don't at the end of the day there is no compromise in religion we have our way we have our path that we must uh uh follow and they are adults they chose this path we can't do anything we've done our due diligence and this is what allah will hold us accountable to"
