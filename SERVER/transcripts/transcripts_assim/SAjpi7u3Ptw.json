  "transcript": "Then we have Taha from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh. Wa'alaikumussalam Wa Barakatuhu. Can you hear me? My question is, Allah loves odd numbers and the Prophet ﷺ used to eat three dates. Now if I eat three or any odd number of other food items, it is because Allah loves odd numbers. Then will it be considered an act of worship or will I be rewarded for that and will it be a sunnah act? Jazak Allahu Khairan. Wa Jazakum. First of all, the sunnah in eating odd numbers is when you break the day before going to the Eid prayer of Al-Fitr. So before leaving home, the day of Fitr which is the first day after Ramadan, the sunnah is to eat dates in three or five in odd numbers. Breaking the fast normally in Ramadan or in any other day is not part of the sunnah to eat it in odd numbers. The Prophet ﷺ was not reported to have done this. Therefore, you should not do that. If you do it, that's fine but it's not sunnah. Would you be rewarded for it? It's an issue that is debatable. Yes, the hadith, inna allaha witrun yuhibbu alwitr, yaa ibadallah faawtiru, this is in regarding of witr at night time. But is it recommended that we do everything in odd numbers? It's debatable. If the Prophet ﷺ did not do it, then it's not part of the sunnah and it's not recommended. It's only permissible and Allah Azzawajal knows best."
