  "transcript": "Ahmed from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. So here in the United States you cannot like drive a car without car insurance nor get like any medical treatment without health insurance and there's also like life insurance and what to do as a Muslim like in regards to that? First of all car insurance is mandated by law so if you drive without it they'll fine you and maybe they'll suspend your license and maybe they'll put you in jail. Life insurance is not mandated by any law and it is not permissible in any case. Medical insurance the vast majority of scholars say that it is like gambling it's like a lottery and it's haram. However in some countries where the laws are designed to make life difficult if you don't have or even impossible if you don't have medical insurance so if it is only to fix your tooth you'd pay like five thousand dollars which is not extravagant it's ridiculous. So they're twisting your arm to have one whether you like it or not. In this case this is a necessity as some scholars say because it is gharar and not riba or gambling. Gharar there is ambiguity in it and whenever the gharar is needed and a person has an urgency to use it then it is forgiven inshallah and one can use that and Allah azza wa jal knows best."
