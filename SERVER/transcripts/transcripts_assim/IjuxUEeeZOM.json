  "transcript": "um so for our third question um there are a number of muslims with tattoos in my country who feel offended and belittled after being admonished that having tattoos are prohibited in islam so how do i go about advising them who cares this is problematic when you feel inferior when you feel so weak because telling people about islam and they feel offended so it's like someone is sitting in the restaurant with a big sign saying no smoking so the one next to you says uh excuse me with a big cigar do you mind if i smoke and the people say oh don't offend him you're gonna hurt his feeling he doesn't care about my feelings he doesn't care about my health why would i care of course not i don't want you to smoke it's against the law and i do mind do smoking so when people come to you and they're offended because of their sins why don't you speak to the brother he's he's having girlfriends oh i will hurt his feelings the sister whenever i say to her it's haram to have boyfriends she's offended who cares we have the religion of allah to display if we were to care about people be offended when displaying to them what is wrong nobody would correct others people who pray wrongly if i approach them the prophet islam prohibited people to do this and this and salah and the guy gets angry he says who are you to talk to me like this and people say well you were wrong you offended him i am trying to save him from hellfire i'm trying to save people from falling into a major sin someone is going to have a tattoo i say this is haram you will be cursed someone who has already done tattoo he's a muslim he comes to me with all this paint on his body and i say to him if he did not know the ruling this is haram but if you repent ask allah for forgiveness do good deeds and be morseful allah would not hold you accountable for such major sense if he is offended who cares let me be offended i told you the religion of allah you like it you don't like it who yeah would be worse affected by that you you're the one who's going to be punished for that and my job and duty so it is always um a duty of ours to remind at the very least we this is again coming back to the main point that i always try to reiterate in my lectures it is not the do's and don'ts that count it is your robudia it is your being a slave to allah a servant to allah this what counts the moment we have this arrogance in our hearts that made us offended this is a sign of not being a true servant of allah so this is what we have to focus not on the symptoms rather on the illness itself we have reached the end of our third session of the conference please keep on sharing any perls of wisdom that you have gained throughout the session on your social media with the hashtag tsp2021 be steadfast uh we do have some live polling uh session going on in our telegram group chat so if you are in it please do um participate in our polls our fourth and final session tomorrow uh which is on the 28th of march 2021 will begin at 2 30 p.m malaysian time inshallah"
