  "title": "The Role Model (Prophet ﷺ‎) (13) - Things he admonished - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "is as the perfect human being used to be happy and sometimes be sad sometimes he's pleased sometimes he's angry but he would never be angry for his for himself or for things that had happened to him rather he gets angry only for the sake of Allah for the sake of Allah and whatever thing that wasn't good took place against his own self he would pardon he would forgive and he would meet bad things with good deeds he was patient and tolerant to the rudeness and ignorance of Nomads and the likes but whenever the boundaries of sharia where interfered with he would become angry sometimes he would punish sometimes he would reprimand sometimes he would admonish and you can see clearly on his face when he hates something and sometimes he would look the other way maybe his face would become red when anger when angered and we will mention today some of the scenarios and the incidents where the Prophet Allah admonished his companions for things that they had done how was it was it to get even was it to vent his anger was it to degrade people never it was to elevate them to teach them and to draw them closer to Allah azzawajal through guiding them the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam did not frequently admonish and advise his companions because when you sit with people who would only detect what's wrong with you oh you said this this is wrong you did this this is wrong you should have done that you you feel like you're being scrutinized and people don't people do not like this as a matter of fact this can't backfire in so many cases so be careful when to admonish how to pick the right timing and the right environment and situation once the prophet Allah admonished his beloved wife so his love and compassion would never ever prevent him from saying the word of Truth the prophet was always objective and was always talking for the sake of Allah even if he hated people he would stand up to the truth he would defend any form of oppression that is unjust the Jews whom we all hate and we do not hate them because of the color of their eyes or the tone of their skin rather we hate them for their ill deeds and evil ways and for their disbelief in Allah azzawajal this is what we were told about them in the Quran their treachery their betrayal their continuous lies and deceit and a couple of nights ago they desecrated the third holiest place on Earth and that is they desecrated it under the protection of the police and the army and no one is saying anything and this shows you how weak and cowardice the Muslims are nowadays they desecrated the Masjid they attacked the worshipers business as usual and even the westerners who claim to be Democratic and fighting for freedom did not say a thing did not do a thing and they will not do a thing because they are biased they hate Islam and the Muslims in Sweden yesterday they the court overruled a ban on burning the Quran the court goes this low for what only to humiliate the Muslims which they have so many of in their country in which they have a lot of commercial ties with in the Muslim world but the Muslims business as usual burn the Quran who cares burn the Masjid kill the Muslims and nobody speaks out this is why in Islam we love for the sake of Allah and we hate for the sake of Allah we have allegiances for the sake of Allah and our enmity is also for the sake of Allah so look at the fairness and Justice of the prophet the Jews whom we all hate used to come to the prophet Allah and greet him with a twisted word so instead of saying assalamu alaikum which means peace be upon you they used to say which means death be upon you see the difference and the prophet salallahu figured that out and whenever they came and said be upon you he would say and upon you so mad Isha may Allah be pleased with her could not hold herself back and she shouted at them saying May the death and curse and the wrath of Allah be upon you see she bluntly said it the prophet said reprimanding and admonishing Aisha Isha Allah does not endorse or like being offensive abusive or using such profanity such aggressiveness Allah does not endorse us or like this she said didn't you hear what they said a prophet of Allah he said I heard and I just replied to them and upon you where Allah would not answer their supplication that death be upon me but Allah would answer my supplication by saying and upon you over them even when we hate people we're fair and just we do not endorse any form of wrongdoing or oppression that would be driven by our hatred to them also the prophet Allah admonished his poet the prophet had three poets and cabin Malik on the battle of to book on the ninth year of Hijra was a bit reluctant and lazy in catching up with the prophet is so when the Army set off every day he would say tomorrow I will go I'll catch up with them in a while and he kept on postponing it until it was too late and that was considered to be a sort of desertion as if he deserted the army so when the prophet came back he admonished him and said to him why didn't you join us didn't you have a right to accompany us did you have money enough and he apologized by saying I had no excuse or prophet of Allah and you know what the story happened the prophet did not let it go he admonished him also sometimes he would admonish his companions over things that normal people would think that it's nothing there was a black woman who used to clean and sweep the Masjid of the Prophet Allah which is a great form of worship but in our eyes it's it's nothing it's for the workers it's for the janitor not for us so this black woman used to do that and one day it so happens or one night that she passed away she died so the companions may Allah be pleased with them did not think highly of her enough to go and wake up the prophet Allah and notify him so they took care of business washed her shrouded her offered funeral prayer and buried her and when the prophet salallahu came to know he admonished them why didn't you inform me why didn't you tell me so the companions answered as if she's nothing of prophet of Allah she is not of great importance and the prophet Islam ordered them to show him her grave so they went all to the cemetery and he stood there with the companions behind him and he offered funeral prayer for that woman whom we do not even know her name and he said that these graves are filled with Darkness and Allah would fill it with light with my prayer upon them the prophet Allah admonished those closest to him as stated earlier his love and compassion did not prevent him from saying the word of Truth we all know the status of husam may Allah be pleased with a man with his father you remember we've mentioned this before was the adopted son of the Prophet Allah before adoption was demolished and prohibited Osama was his son and the prophet loved both dearly as a son and a grandson on an expedition Usama came back from he was telling the prophet Allah how they won and there was a duel between him and one of the disbelievers and the prophet was anxious to hear about it was very happy until Osama said that I managed to Corner this disbeliever and when he felt that he's going to lose the duel as form as protection he said I bear witness there is no God worthy of being worshiped except Allah which means that he's a Muslim now so Usama said this did not prevent me from putting my sword into his chest and killing him then the prophet was shocked and he looked sternly to Usama admonishing him saying you killed him after he said Allah he said oh prophet of Allah he just said it as a form of protection he wanted to Shield himself he didn't mean it we were just fighting he's a disbeliever he's an enemy of the religion and the prophet kept on saying you killed him after he said Allah what will you do with on the day of judgment and he kept admonishing him by repeating it over and over and over until Osama said to himself I wish I only became Muslim that day so that it would have erased this incident from my records and this admonishment benefited Usama greatly years later when this ruffle and dispute took place between the companions factions and they had to fight with one another Osama was neither with any of the parties he wasn't there he did not fight he refrained from participating in such a fight not only that Osama did something similar again and he was admonished again a woman from the tribe of Mach zum dignitary a highly reputable tribe she used to steal things from people and never returned them back like borrowing utensils are never uh giving it back saying that it's mine so when they complained to the prophet Allah the prophet ruled that she has to face the punishment for stealing things and that is to cut her hand off so the people of the woman went to Usama because they know that he's close and beloved to the prophet Allah complained and asked him to intercede a young boy went to the prophet he said the prophet of Allah if you can have some leniency on the woman her family came to me and the prophet Allah was outraged saying to Usama do you intercede in one of Allah's prescribed punishment do you intercede then he made a public speech to teach the people the gravity of such an act and he praised Allah azzawajal and he offered salutation upon the prophet and then said to the people beware those before you were destroyed and annihilated when their dignitaries stole and they let them go while when the poor stole they used to chop their hands so it must be known to all there's no intercession in the prescribed punishment once it's finalized and this is to indicate the importance of prescribed punishment for the security and the safety of the community of course above all because it's the law of Allah it's the Sharia but compare Apple to Apple compare the countries that Implement Sharia laws with the countries that Implement man-made laws will you have prisons filled unjustly or justly with murderers with robbers and thieves with a raper rapists and they don't have places to put them in anymore and it's costing the government a lot while in Muslim countries where prescribed punishment are implemented you don't find this it's safe with the grace of Allah because people know what the punishment is and the punishment is divine and from Allah the prophet sallam sometimes reprimanded his companions over things that we may not pay attention to the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was once in the Masjid when a convoy came and they started speaking to the prophet salallahu and he found this smell that he prohibited the Muslims from entering the Masjid when eating such plants onions garlics and the likes that have a offensive odor so the prophet said hadn't I prohibited you from eating from this tree and coming to the Masjid be aware that the angels are offended from what the humans are offended of or offended from so nowadays in Ramadan we go to iftar and then go to marry prayer organ and attend the Asia prayer and tarawih and subhanallah you are surrounded by people that offend you and the angels in the Masjid and the other worshipers with the amount of garlic and onion that comes out with their breath now we don't say it's Haram to eat nobody said that it is Haram to eat it but it's Haram to attend the Masjid and due to the fact that people want the reward of attending congregational prayer and talaweeh they Overlook the prohibition and they still attend the Masjid with this offensive odor that is repulsive that is offending the angels and the worshipers and they'll they are sinful for that the prophet salallahu also reprimanded his great companion when he used to prolong Isha prayer which was difficult for the worshipers behind him in an incident he came to lead them in Asia and he started reading with Surat al-baqarah one of the companions had so many things to do and so many errands and that was taking too much time so he completed the Isha on his own and left to attend his things people told moath said that this guy is a hypocrite same people went to the guy and said to him why is it is accusing you of hypocrisy he went to the prophet and complained the prophet was angry and he admonished are you trying to repel people away from Islam from from prayers when any one of you leads prayer he should acknowledge that behind him there are those who are old there are those who are sick there are those who have errands to accomplish so make it short and easy and finally the prophet Allah admonished his own cousin his own son-in-law Ali may Allah be pleased with him once he visited his daughter's house Fatima and her husband Ali and when they permitted him to enter he found them lying in bed and it was night time he said why don't you pray why aren't you praying night prayer immediately Ali may Allah be pleased with them replied and said o prophet of Allah our souls are in the hands of Allah whatever he wants to set them free for us to wake up we will wake up and pray but other than that we don't have any control we're asleep the prophet did not reply Allah he gave his back and went out striking his thigh and saying but man has ever been most of anything prone to dispute argument which means that the prophet Allah did not like the answer of Ali that was quick and instead of saying yes insha Allah we will do that to prophet of Allah he gave a justification that was not adequate to the prophet I assume this is why he said this Ayah and left admonishing Ali who understood and the message and learned the lesson"
