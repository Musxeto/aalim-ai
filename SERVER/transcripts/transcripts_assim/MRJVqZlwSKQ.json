  "transcript": "and his second question is about a brother of his who died couple of months ago and we pray to Allah that he has Mercy over that brother the strange thing is that brother Asar is saying that during the month of Ramadan is it possible that he is not being punished now because it's a holy month of Ramadan and the gates of hell are closed and the Gates of Heaven are open and the MS of uh uh the devils and demons are chained so does this mean that inshallah he's not being punished now this is strange because how do we judge that your brother is being punished why think negatively of Allah as long as he was a Muslim as long as he was among those who prayed and as long as people praised him and complemented his character and moral conduct inshallah we pray to Allah that he is in Paradise at the moment in his grave that Allah Asel is giving him from his blessings and favors uh things that cannot uh go we cannot imagine but to think otherwise in the negative side this is not acceptable because then you are doubting Allah's generosity and mercy it is exactly like some people do after they bury their dead they bring two branches with leaves and then they put it on top of the grave and when you ask them why are you doing this they quote a Hadith where the Prophet Alat wasam once passed by two graves and they said and he said they are being punished in their graves but they're not being punished in something that is Major by Allah it is Major and then he requested these two branches with leaves and he placed them on top of their graves and he said may Allah Asel make it easy upon them until these branches dry so some people out of ignorance do this and pretend that this is a Sunnah and it's not first of all this is an isolated incident the prophet Alam did not do this with his uncle hamd did not do this with uh all the other companions who died in his life second of all the prophet Alat wasam was revealed to that they are being punished in their graves how do you know that your brother is being punished may Allah have mercy on all of us you don't so why assume he is being punished third of all these branches were a miracle to the prophet Alat wasam Allah favored him with this and that is why he said that Allah would reduce their punishment in their graves until these leaves uh uh remain green but if they get dry then they will resume being punished Now can anyone of us claim that Allah would do the same if we put not a branch a whole Tree on top of the Grave definitely not that is why that is why we should be careful in picking what we choosen like from the Sunnah without referring back to the books of knowledge referring back to the scholars who would explain these things uh to us so in short no inshallah your brother is not being punished uh uh in his grave and Allah's Mercy is far greater than what you and I would uh uh think or inter ipate or even imagine"
