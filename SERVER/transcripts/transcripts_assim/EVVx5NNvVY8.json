  "transcript": "now his third question about covered 19 and how in this lockdown people have spent most of their time watching movies dramas etc wasting their time over things that are if not harmful they are not beneficial so what's the ruling on that and would the earning of a person be Haram there is a difference between what you pay to watch and what you earn from others watching so this means that if you work in such places if you prove you are a provider of such a service and you give people access to movies to dramas to shows to music etc your earning is totally Haram but if you are buying such a service so someone who is having a subscription subscription and he pays money monthly to watch Haram what he's paying is Haram he'll be held accountable for it but this does not influence his work at The Electric Company or at a a pharmacy his earning is halal from halal work that he does but what he's spending is Haram and he will have to be questioned about it now he's also said that what about if these movies did not have or do not have Haram well I don't know of any halal movies but if there is a movie that has no music it has no deviation in a paid it has no free mixing with women this is totally ok inshallah I don't see anything wrong in that once every blue moon and to watch like shows that has that have animals in them like in the National Geographic for example wild sometimes there are shows that are so beautiful captivating but it has music in it so you have to mute it and watch Alice creation there's nothing wrong in that there are no women and you all know what you're seeing is nature then this is totally legit and had a insha Allah who has ever yet"
