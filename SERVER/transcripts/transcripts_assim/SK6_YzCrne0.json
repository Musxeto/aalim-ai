  "transcript": "sarah says sometimes while i'm praying my mom or someone calls me so is it permissible to respond by saying a word from the praying louder for example allahu akbar or a word from surah i'm reading in order that the caller knows that i'm praying such a notification is permissible especially if you're a woman and she's a woman and when she calls you say alhamdulillah so she knows that you're praying or when you go for courage loudly this is permissible and if you just simply clap that would be sufficient because the prophet said alaizusam that if anything were to happen the prayer the men should say subhanallah subhanallah subhanallah to notify others especially the imam of a mistake but women should clap so clapping would be the best alternative for you the moment your mom hears you clapping she knows that you she would know that you you're praying and not dancing of course yes"
