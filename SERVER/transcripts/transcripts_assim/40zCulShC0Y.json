  "transcript": "so my question is that we know that specifying an iPad to a specific time or place which the prophet salallahu no other companions ever did is considered a bidder but I heard from someone that if we follow this rule then the same thing would then apply to other things such as uh an example is called unclass where a person goes to a certain place or institution at a certain time every day to read or memorize the Quran so basically he was saying that then such as Quran class would be considered as if we follow this rule so it is true no this is not true at all and this is a deficiency in a person's intellectual powers of uh stemming and getting a ruling and I I'm not proud of this but I did this like 30 eight years ago with one of my shoes when I called him and I said to him we know that wearing gold for men is Haram so by analogy wouldn't be wearing diamond be Haram because it's more expensive and the guy just exploded in my face how thankfully it was on the phone and he said he was Egyptian who are you to make a knowledge analogy is made for men and men who are qualified not the likes of you and he showered me like for maybe 50 seconds it felt like 50 hours and I was sweating cold sweat and I said and I hung up and I was there in a trance maybe for I don't know how long but it gave me a one heck of a lesson which is totally true who are you to get these fatwas and to speak out of your whims and desires without studying and knowing what are the pillars what are the conditions how to compare this to that and this is a science and it has to be taught by a Sheikh and the Sheikh has to give you examples so that expands your mind in understanding your person or this person who's trying to water down innovation they looked at anything that wasn't at the time of the Prophet Allah said okay this is also a Bida you say stated in the beginning if you've noticed or you watched the replay that attaching aribada to a fart or a specific time that makes it an innovation totally true so if I decided to pray to rakas after every Salat of let's say um whatever Salat and attach it to it which is not part of the Sunnah and consider that to be part of my daily routine that would be an innovation because an innovation can be something related to time something related to place something related to quantity something related to the nature of it there are a number of things that can be associated with Bida now if a person during the day decides that this time is most convenient for him to conduct vicar so a person for example fasts every Friday he fasts Mondays and Thursdays but he also fasts a Friday why because he says I'm off I don't have work I don't think that fasting Friday is a virtue by itself but because I fast Thursday I'd love to fast a Friday which helps me curb my sexual desires and gets closer to Allah azzawajal would we say that this is an innovation of course not fasting is recommended and the reason he's doing it is appreciated and the format is accepted fasting a day before or thereafter designating a Monday after Isha to give a DARS in the Masjid there is nothing wrong in that I'm not thinking that Monday is a day of adarsh or that Isha is a preferred time for a DARS but this is a routine where I can make people understand and acquaint themselves with my schedule which is after Russia prayer every Monday this is not related to having a specific ibada like for example uh uh saying Allah some people say this every Salat and when they say they add something was sugar these are Innovations the prophet did not do it assalam thanking Allah is good but associating it in Salat at this particular point of time and place is an innovation and I hope this answers your question"
