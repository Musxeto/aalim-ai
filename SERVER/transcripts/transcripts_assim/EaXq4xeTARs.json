  "title": "Forgot to recite Fateha, Should I pray an extra rakah (Behind imam or Praying alone) Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "says i heard that who ever does not recite the fatiha should after concluding the prayer add an extra raka well this is not very clear if you're praying alone and you skip the fatiha and you remember in the second or the third or the fourth raka this first rakai is becomes void and your second rakah becomes your first your third rakah before becomes your second and your fourth rakah becomes your third so afterwards you stand up and pray the fourth so actually to me you prayed five but due to the fact that the first one was invalid so the truth is you prayed for if you're praying behind an imam in this case the imam [Music] if he is reciting a loud recitation in the first or second raka if you skip the fatiha it's okay his recitation is sufficient for you but if you skip the fat in the third or fourth raka which are usually silent in this case after the salam you have to offer a raka for the mist invalid rakah which you did not recite the fatiha in and i hope this answers your question"
