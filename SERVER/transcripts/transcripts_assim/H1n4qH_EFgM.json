  "transcript": "Something you have to authenticate it. I cannot come and say that uncovering the face of a woman is haram and just put a full stop to it. Although this is what I gave fatwa and I have a debate with Abu Usama Al-Zahabi like 12 years ago in Birmingham Masjid in Green Lane Masjid and we spoke about this though we did not have enough time to elaborate. My opinion is yes it is haram for a woman to show her face but is this the only opinion? No. There are so many scholars that say that the awrah of a woman is her whole body except the face and the hands. I disagree yes but this doesn't mean that all the ulama are lunatics or they are sinners and they're going to hell. No. This is an issue of dispute among scholars even Sheikh bin Bass may Allah have mercy on his soul whenever he was asked the fatwas is all over the place he would say it's an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion is that she has to cover her face so we have to be fair when we teach people knowledge you just can't you know shoot from the hip and because you're convinced of it say my way or the highway all of you are infidels in hellfire you infidels no I will not say that so these sisters who come on public platforms and give dawah do I disagree with them 100 percent I believe that it defies the purpose of the hijab hijab is made to conceal and when you come on youtube or on tv with your face exposed and a little bit makeup and foundation what is this haram and when you add insult to injury and have a sheikh next to you and you exchange jokes whoa my pleasure yours what is this this is totally inappropriate but this usually is found in america usually and this is the land of modern islam no we say women must give dawah only for women this is safer for both men and women and men can do both why because the prophet sasa did both and women are usually covered so men will not be able to uh intermingle or mix or be in place of fitna the other way around is not you're coming in your face and everything and gestures and your smile everybody's watching this is inappropriate and allah knows best"
