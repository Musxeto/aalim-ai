  "transcript": "Ilyas from the Emirates. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa'alaikumussalam. How are you Sheikh? Alhamdulillah. Alhamdulillah. Sheikh, I was wondering where could I get information on lesser known Sahaba like Abu Jandal, and those companions who became bandits against the Croatian and they moved to Medina later. Where could I find authentic information on them? Most likely you will not find any, a lot of it because only this incident they're famous for, but afterwards I don't believe that there are a lot of reports about them. You can try the famous book of Seer A'lam An-Nubala of Al-Imam Al-Zahabi. I think it's in, I don't think it's translated to Arabic, to English, but the Arabic version is about 23 volumes. You could give it a shot there inshallah. Alhamdulillah."
