  "transcript": "we should not take the Jews and Christians and non-muslims as um um we do see that a lot of non-muslims especially here in Singapore they are actually caring and nice towards the Muslims so I would I'm requesting some explanation on on this case because sometimes I I tend to see some some non-muslims being more caring towards us than the Muslim Community themselves okay first of all this is one of the main reasons you were prohibited to take the non-muslims the Jews and the Christians and those who fall under that category as awliya so that your heart would not be inclined to them which is the case in your case and it's obvious because you're saying that there are so many of them who are kinder to us than Muslims this is not the point the point is you first have to understand what's the meaning of awliya and there is a difference between who are close allies and confidants taking them more than the Muslims and between just being nice and kind to them so was the prophet Islam kind to the Jews the Christians and sometimes the polyphus the the idol worshipers yes he was never rude sallallahu he was never hostile and he had in some occasions visited the Jews in their own homes as in the woman who tried to poison him and as for the boy who used to serve him before he died so this is not something that Islam prohibits you can go and visit and be kind but you're not allowed to take them as close allies and confidants where you take side with them against the Muslims as in some countries do no are Allegiance is to our brethrens in Islam in a religion yeah I may don't like how he acts I don't mean I may not like how he behaves but he's still a Muslim and I'm ordered to align with him to be an ally of him and to be my Confidant while the non-muslims we deal with them nicely we give them gifts and read we treat them nicely we greet them and we answer their greetings but we don't hang out with them we don't favor them over none over other Muslims and think that because of their disbelief they're better people this is the Trap Of shaytan You may be falling into my friend and Allah knows best this"
