  "transcript": "How can I develop true in my prayer and build a sincere lasting tawa in my daily life so that my connection with Allah is not just a habit but something deeply felt and lived. Don't you? Well, this is not a very easy question to answer because theoretically speaking, this is dependent on your knowledge of allahel. Is to be able to stand in prayer without thinking except about who you're talking to, who you're praying to, who you're standing in front of. And if you don't know allahel, that would be almost impossible. See the vast majority of people in this Allah abar. They think about where did I park my car? Oh my slippers. Are they in the box or outside? Would somebody steal them? They're very expensive ones. Oh, what did I do? Did I put my mobile in the car? Is in my pocket. So while in pray they reach for their pocket. Where is the I don't know came and just told me that the mobile is not in my pocket. Other than okay. So I have to go to the grocery shop. I have to go to the vegetable shop and and get some. Okay, my wife told me this and what what I'm in. I don't know. Let me follow the one next to me. Whatever he does, I'm going to do. So, the salat finishes and the dude doesn't know what's happening. So, you ask him why are you doing this? I don't know. I'm trying to get for 20 years, but I'm unable. Okay. How many names of Allah do you know? Well, I've heard that he has 99 names. Okay. How many of them do you memorize? Um, maybe 10. 20. Mashallah. Good. Of these 20, how many do you know the meaning of? U maybe three or four. So how do you expect to face Allah when you only know three or four of his names? You have to learn Allah's beautiful names. You have to know what is you have to know what is you have to know what is Aliz. Aliz everybody knows the word. What does it mean? 99% of the people who are watching say okay good thank you this is problem when you read one of the shortest surah that everybody knows what does mean pass what does mean what do you mean is one of Allah's names is it like this is the first time I know gosh I don't know so what do you expect how can you reach the of tawa if you don't even know who Allah is. So you have to go to the basics. What we are doing is looking for in public relations. We call it the wow factor. When you have a presentation, you just look at the bullet points that when people hear this, wow. So when I'm making a presentation, well, we've managed to be in 60 countries. Wow. And we've managed to open x amount of masids. Wow. And we've done this with minimal amount of money. These are the key points. Instead of talking for half an hour. So nowadays all what we care about is the wow factor. How many you've done? Five in Ramadan. Wow. How many? Oh, I go for every three weeks. Wow. How much money do you have? How many cars? Do you have an SUV? Do you have a boat that we could go skiing? Do you have this? Do you have that? But where is the beef? Where is the quality? Where is the essence? zero inside. It's hollow. It's empty. Yes, you may like my physique. You might like my body, my muscles, my uh uh the way I look. This woman is gorgeous. She's a bombshell. She's beautifully crazy. What's inside? Nothing. And that is why when they stand in prayer, they don't know who's they're talking to. That's why they're depressed. They have panic and anxiety attack. That's why they're always lost. That's why they're moody. That's why some of them consider themselves to be bipolar and with with ups and downs and all of this because they don't know Allah. So I can't answer your question about the salat and the it's a full system that you need to transform your whole life in order to reach there."
