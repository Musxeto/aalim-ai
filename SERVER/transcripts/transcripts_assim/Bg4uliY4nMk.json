  "title": "How to repent to Allah for all Major and Minor Sins and have them completely forgiven?",
  "transcript": "The next question is, what is the way to ask Allah for repentance for all major and minor sins and have blessings completely from Him? Repentance is not asking. Asking is istighfar. When you say Astaghfirullah, you're asking. Repentance is a process where you have to first of all have remorse. In the authentic hadith, the Prophet ï·º said, remorse is repentance. As if all repentance depends and relies on remorse. Without it, your repentance is rejected. Like saying, Al-Hajju Arafah. Hajj is Arafah, but we know that there are other pillars. But this is the most important pillar of Hajj. So in repentance, the first and most important pillar is repentance. It's the burning of the heart that you've done something wrong. Then you come to quitting the sin, intending not to do the sin, asking Allah for forgiveness, sincerity, to be at the time of acceptance. If it's related to others, you have to return the rights to them. So it's a process and it's not only something you say. Because we are big liars. We sin and we say, O Rabbi, ghafir li yutub alayh. Guys, when are we going next inshallah, to do it again? So we always say, but we don't walk the talk. So repentance is a process. The most important thing is the burning of the heart. Feeling that you have done something that you're remorseful for. For an Allah Most Merciful."
