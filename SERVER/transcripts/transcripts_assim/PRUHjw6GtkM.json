  "transcript": "Adrian from Serbia sh there is a problem with your website for sometimes I don't receive answers from for my questions even though it says that question is um that question is recorded I don't know how my website works there is a team dedicated to receiving 50 questions every day I answer them and they dispatch it to the people who had sent it now having said that my website to my knowledge works exactly at 6:00 p.m. meca time so you could imagine that there are at least a thousand if not more waiting to press the paste button and send and this takes few seconds after 6:00 when you get the box ready so most likely that people try and already the 50 the quota of 50 Questions had been already collected and then they block whatever else comes afterwards so we do apologize but this is my ability unfortunately uh I cannot go more than 50 because I have so many things on my plate and may Allah grant us sincerity and uh the power and the support to do this"
