  "transcript": "from bangladesh he says we have whispers about allah and i don't know what to do about these whispers and he gave an example and may allah forgive him for what he had said why why are you doing dua for him because the prophet said the almighty has forgiven my um for my sake for whatever they cross whatever intrusive thoughts that cross their minds as long as they do not talk about it nor act upon it so allah has pardoned you for these intrusive thoughts when you come and say i have these usuals about allah being so and so and so and so you blew your chance because you talked about it you should not talk about such intrusive thoughts okay i was asking a sheikh i was not boasting about it well next time ask the sheikh in a third person's voice not altering your own voice rather say someone says that he has intrusive thoughts about allah in the sense that this and this and this happens is this person kafir or not not about yourself secondly these intrusive thoughts come because you invited them in if someone knocks on your door and i usually use this example in my counseling sessions with ocd people and you say who is it and he says i'm a house burglar if you open the door invite him in lead him to your living room and ask him not to steal anything do you think he would comply the answer is no he will clean your house of everything valuable in it whose mistake is it then his or yours is not his this is his nature and he identified himself before coming in it's your mistake because you let him in likewise with shaytan intrusive thoughts it's your mistake for giving shaytan the chance to do this okay how can i block it very easy if you're walking in the middle of the market in mumbai or delhi or dhaka you will have one beggar nine-year-old child walking next to you uncle give me some rupees give me some taka please do this for me please i need to feed my family my mother is sick i have to buy some medication uncle please may allah take you to jannah this child who's a professional beggar walks next to you if you stop for a second to give him some change or to communicate with him and say why don't you work why don't you do something where do you live you will cause another hundred children to rampage you they will be like swarms over you because you're a potential customer they will rip you from your wallet from your watch from your whatever you're having on you it's your mistake the same thing happens with shaytan you listen to his intrusive thoughts and try to communicate with him he overwhelms you with a hundred more whispers that would make you helpless would block your thinking from doing any transactions you cannot think how else you're blinded by this fog and this mist that hampers your sight what to do when you walk in the market and the child walks next to you walk in a fast pace steady paced do not pay an attention do not look at him do not even pretend that there's something talking to you after 10 steps he will leave you and go to someone else and this is what will happen with shaytaan it is your problem in the beginning it's your problem in the end no one can help you unless you want to help yourself by seeking allah's help"
