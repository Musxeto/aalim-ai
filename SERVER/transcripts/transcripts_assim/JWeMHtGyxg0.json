  "transcript": "Layla from Pakistan um my question is about vaginal discharge which is not attached with Menses like in the middle of monthly cycle if one gets grown or red is discharged so one should pray or not and if it is permissible to pray so is it obligate free to make voodoo for each prayer and for to make Woodway ginger for each prayer okay now we are discussing an issue that is totally not related to Menses or the monthly cycle so a woman in her period of Purity she prays she fast she acts normally if she gets brownish or reddish discharges these are not her normal vaginal discharges and therefore such discharges by default invalidate the wudu and they're rendered as nudges or impure they must be washed off if any traces were found on clothes they must be washed off and she has to perform Moodle if such discharges are continuous so this is known as istihaba and this is a phase between Menses and purity so she can pray only if she performs fresh wood now if it is continuous and it's it's the harder then it is sufficient for her whenever she wants to pray as long as the Advan was called and the time of prayer was due to clean herself wash herself from impurities perform wudu and pray and she can pray the whole time until the time of the prayer is over okay what about during this time when she gets these discharges her her wodo is still valid and she is not obliged to wash off such impurities why because it's a continuous process which burdens her and puts a lot of hardship if these discharges are once and once she washes herself up and performs wudu she stays for two three hours without having them in this case she can pray if she sees them she has to wash herself and offer wudu again but if it continues to the following prayer and still she's clean she can pray with the same mudu and I hope this answers your question"
