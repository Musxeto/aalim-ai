  "transcript": "hii from the Emirates how are you I'm fine alhamdulillah how can I help you alhamdulillah sh I remember in your previous program you advised us about the Rukia water to do it on the water bottles and you can consume maybe two days 3 Days Seven Days uh is it possible if you can do the Ria water on the water dispenser the huge big bottle and we can consume even for our tea for for drinking day and night of course you can do that without any hesitation or problem now the best water to do Rya upon is zamzam but if you're living in the Emirates it's difficult to get unlimited supply of it so if you can mix it with normal bottles or uh a tab water that is drinkable that's fine if not then you can use the normal water that you buy in bottles or your tab water if it's uh uh fit for uh human consumption and it's healthy and you can do Rya to drink from it to use it with coffee tea and the likes and to cook with it without any problem inshallah"
