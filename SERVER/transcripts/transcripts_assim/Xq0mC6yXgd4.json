  "title": "Does saying \"if I hadn't sinned...\" in repentance go against belief in Qadr? #islam assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "She I have heard from your lecture that we shouldn't say about our past that I shouldn't do do that uh shouldn't do do that or this uh if I did that it would not happen but at the same time after committing any sin we should repent remove uh from our heart. So while repenting there is a difference there is a difference between objecting to destiny that oh if I did not do this and that none of this would have had happened it's already predestined and divinely decreed live with it happened nothing could have changed it accept it embrace it this is different than falling into sin and then saying oh I can't be remorseful Because if I'm remorseful, then I'm going against the divine decree. No, you've done a sin. You've done a mistake. Rectified it and correct it by repenting, by pledging not to do it again by having deep remorse. This is different than saying, \"Oh, if I didn't call uh uh this uh um escort agency, I would not have fallen into haram. Oh, if I did not drink this bottle of wine, I would not have been intoxicated.\" No. This stops you from repenting and asking Allah for forgiveness. Instead, you're just whining. And you know what? No, this is not the right approach. Don't say if I had not done this, this would not have had happened because this opens the gateway for Shayan and Allah knows best."
