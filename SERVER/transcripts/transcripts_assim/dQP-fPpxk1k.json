  "transcript": "[Music] a question says many part of the world will have summer which means longer hours of fasting what are the motivating factors to fast in hot days first of all who mandated fasting the answer is Allah who knows how long or short that they would be how cold or hot the temperature would be as there is Allah now when Allah mandates fasting upon different regions yet he does not get give any permission for them to fact to break their fast due to hot weather or to long hours wouldn't that fall under the category that Allah does not burden a soul beyond what it can bear the answer is definitely this means that if a person in the Scandinavian region and he is too fast for 20 consecutive hours and break his fast does his maverick and Isha antara we and eat his  in only four hours and then fast again for 20 hours isn't this hard of course it is hard is it possible definitely it is possible and the Muslims over there are doing it without any problem at home Delilah you see the Baraka the power the energy comes only from Allah it doesn't come from our food and drinks people would argue say share come on this is not logical watch out logic is not something you can apply in religion because your logic differs than my logic and our logic differs then shaytan's logic what does Satan have to do with it he is the father of all weird and sick logic imagine Allah creates Adam with his two hands subhanahu wa'ta'ala and orders the angels and the jinn represented in Satan to prostrate to Adam they all prostrate except Satan him please why don't you prostrate is it with all due respect logically this cannot happen I am better than him you created him of clay and I was created of fire and fire is superior to clay the conclusion it's not logical for me to prostrate what was the consequence of such logic Satan is doomed in Hellfire for eternity now if you try to apply the same logic watch out because you may fall under the same category food and drink is needed for our bodies but when a man comes on top it's perfect limit you do not need food and drink as you think you do come on share what do you mean it was reported in sahih LM a Muslim and others that when the Prophet was giving us the prophecy of the coming of the Antichrist known as a dead JAL the Prophet was telling us that the first year the rain and the crops one-third of the rain and crops would cease to come the second year 2/3 of the rain and crops would stop the third year no rain and no crops would grow and the animals would die and starve because of that so the companion said o prophet of Allah if there is no crops no animals and no rain fall what would make the people live the answer was Subhan Allah alhamdulillah allahu akbar would substitute for their food and drink Wow imagine when people's Eman reach its peak they would suffice it would suffice them to make thicker than to eat and drink so 20 hours of fasting in the North Pole or somewhere close to that area is not that difficult as you would suspect as for hot areas the same applies but usually it's not this long usually it's like 16 hours 15 hours give or take an hour it's hot it's humid people are sweating and losing fluid yet they are still capable of fasting with the grace of Allah so what motivates them easy to say when I fast when it is all air-conditioned and I'm resting and not working he's my reward the same as those who are fasting in hot areas and losing and wasting a lot of their energy the answer is definitely not so what motivates them is the greatest reward that awaits them which is greater than the reward of lazy people like us sitting in the comfort of their offices and in their homes [Music] [Applause] you"
