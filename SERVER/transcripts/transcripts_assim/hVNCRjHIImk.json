  "transcript": "sh here in Bangladesh some of the Muslims are so much fascinated with the arrival of IM mahadi the battle at the end the end arrival of what arrival arrival of Imam madii when is he coming that's that's my point they so much fascinated with that I mean they sit in the lazy chair they just fascinated with the arrival of IM mahadi the battle and the end and they don't even think of fixing themselves Muslim Community that they do da in an offensive way on social media believing they are superior to CF in terms of getting J at some point for being Muslim and many people are Islam for partially because of their activities so how we Muslim should approach in such cases that's my question people are delusional we as believe without any doubt that IM m is coming and that he is the son or the descendant of the Prophet Alat wasam his name and his father's name is Muhammad abdah similar to The Prophet's name and that Allah would guide him overnight meaning all of his life he was I wouldn't say a Playboy but he wasn't a practicing person but overnight Allah guides him and he becomes a righteous practicing Imam and in his era and time Jesus be peace be upon him would descend from the heavens and would fight the Antichrist the Dalal and kill him this would happen at the end of time not now but his arrival their arrival doesn't mean anything to you and me because we we know that among those who will follow the deal are many Muslims who would turn on their heels and leave Islam and this is why the prophet sallallah Ali wasallam ordered us to seek refuge in Allah every single Salat at the end of it before offering Sal what we say I seek refuge in you Allah from the tribulation and the testing of This calamity this FNA this trial of the Antichrist or the Dalal the prophet told us that those with weak Ean would come to see him and they would turn back on their heels and follow him and this is why the prophet says whenever you you hear of the Dalal do not confront him and run because one of you goes to listen to him thinking that he's a Believer and after listening to him he flips and becomes a cfir therefore don't care when the when Al Mahi is coming because if he comes in the state that you and I are in today most likely we would not follow him our Iman is weak we're not committed to Islam we can't even pray fer on time in the Masjid we can't even say the truth without lying or cheating or consuming people's wealth unlawfully we abuse our wives and we're not fair with our children and we're not good with our neighbors and we do not connect our next ofkin what kind of a Muslim are you talking about so be careful of these people and don't spend time debating or arguing with them let them be focus on yourself on fixing yourself your family your relatives your neighbors your colleagues those around you and build a strong foundation and cement Iman in their hearts because if you do so then inshallah when Imam Mahi comes you will be one of his supporters if not one of his commanders with the grace of Allah"
