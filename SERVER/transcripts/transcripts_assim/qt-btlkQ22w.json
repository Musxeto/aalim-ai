  "transcript": "Alum 55-year-old woman wishes to visit her husband's grave from a very close distance it's been 3 years since he passed away and she never ever visited his graveyard but now she wants to visit his grave with her adult son as maharam she also wants to bring her teenage daughter if permitted so are they allowed to make this visit at least once in their life jaak first of all visiting graveyards is a recommended Sun for male for men as for women it's an issue of dispute Scholars differed whether it's permissible or not I'm inclined to follow the opinion that says that this is totally prohibited and not not permissible and this is the opinion of Sheik binaz and other great Scholars of our time so I'm inclined to say that no she should not do that rather she should do what's more beneficial which is making Dua giving charity on his behalf making om or making ha and Allah Knows Best"
