  "transcript": "Fahim from Bangladesh alikum allum Salam she in t some people feel lazy and delay joining the IM at the start of every two ra so instead of standing with the IM from the first T they rest and only join right before the Ruku of the first Raa so my question has two parts uh is this practice sinful and since he intentionally delays is he still required to recite Surah Al FAA if he gets enough time before moving to the ru he is not sinful because this is not a mandatory Salat but definitely he's losing a lot of reward as for the fat yes it is a loud and as long as he joins the IM before the r the im's recitation would be sufficient for him but the question that you did not ask would be would this man gained the reward of praying with the Imam until he concluded his night prayer which would give him as if he prayed the whole night and the answer is no because he did not pray with the Imam the whole prayer until it was over rather he selected parts of it"
