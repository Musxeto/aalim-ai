  "title": "If you dry one of your limbs during Wudu before compeleting Wudu, does this invalidate it",
  "transcript": "from australia my question was if you're having a water and before you finish you dry the body part like for example your foot is like on your right foot does this invalidate the bottle so let me get it straight you washed your right foot you dried it then you washed your left foot yeah okay any body part but yeah okay in sram from australia what's the ruling on drying one of the limbs before completing the wudu the reason people ask such questions is that the scholars had made six pillars for wudu one washing the face two washing the arms till the elbows three wiping the head and the ears four washing the feet to the ankles five the order you have to begin one two three four not one three two four six to be simultaneous meaning that you do it one after the other without leaving a gap going answering the phone or opening the door or checking the microwave if the food is cooked or not simultaneousness so people especially jewelers when they identified what simultaneous means they came to the conclusion that the limbs don't dry before you finish the wudu because if you washed your right arm and somebody knocked on the door so you interrupted your doodle you went and you spoke to the milkman and you took the order and you paid him for the next month and you went back to the toilet you'll find that the water on your face and on your right arm has already dried scholars say that this means it was not simultaneous do the wooden from the beginning so people thought that the dryness of a limb even if i'm in the actual uh woodle process means that i have to do it all over again and this is problematic this is not from the quran or from the sunnah why i'm making i wash my face now it's time to wash my arms so i roll up my sleeves which leads to drying of my hands so now i think i have to do my wudu again so i do my wudu again and when it comes to raising my feet to the sink so i can wash them i touch my jeans or my trousers or my thobe and this leads to drying them maybe i am in summer in saudi arabia when it's 45 degrees so just as i finished washing my face and started doing my arms my face is dry oh ho i have to do it over again no you don't so drying a limb as in the case for example for someone who washes his right foot then he wants to put on his socks and where's his shoe then wash his left foot this is legitimate because it is simultaneous despite the fact that he had worn his socks and this does not have any impact on his wudu so i hope this answers your question"
