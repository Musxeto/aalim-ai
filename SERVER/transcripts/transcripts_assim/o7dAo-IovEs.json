  "transcript": "[Music] alhamdulillah [Music] death is not a subject that people like to hear about because Allah described it in in the Quran as a disaster a Calamity and if you want to depress your wife and children mention death to them I'm very good at this I've been doing it for the past 30 plus years till the extent that my one of my daughters said it you know in in in a burst of anger father please don't speak about death anymore you've been speaking about it for the past 27 years and you have not died yet so when it's going to come it's going to come now death is inevitable it's going to happen it's going to happen to you it's going to happen to one you love maybe if it happens to you you wouldn't care I died game over but when it happens to your loved one to your siblings to your spouse to your children to your parents this is when you feel devastated you feel that you've lost something of value but life does not end with death death is the beginning so many people look look at death as being the last thing no it's not it's the beginning of your life and we as Muslims believe that it is the beginning of prosperity of paradise inshallah and this is why all of the companions when they were on their deathbed they were very happy it's very strange you're dying you're leaving all your loved ones your wealth yes but I am rejoining the loved ones I want I am going to be with Muhammad with his companions I'm going to be with those who went before me so when death takes place this is not the end this is the beginning and there are many rights that must be fulfilled to our loved ones and it begins when they are on their dying bed now the right of a Muslim over another Muslim when they are on their dying bed that you remind them of what of Allah's punishment of Hell Fire no this is the wrong thing to do you don't visit someone in the hospital who's on his dying bed and he said you know how many gates Allah has prepared for those in Hell seven how many gates does Hell have and how many gates does heaven have why because Allah's Mercy is greater than his wrath so there are eight Gates of paradise so so the Sunnah is when you go to someone and visit him when he's sick is you give him hope that you give him positivity oh you are going to be fine inshallah Allah Asel will eras all of your sins and you're going to be stronger and healthier not like so many people say Ya Allah who this is really bad I remember so and so he died with such a disease this is the wrong thing be positive if the person is about to you know kalas expire he's on his deathbed then remind him of Allah's Mercy the companions when people used to visit them they used to tell those visiting remind me of Allah's mercy of Allah's forgiveness of Allah's repentance over those who are s ERS so you give them Positive Vibes and you make sure to remind them to say what why the prophet said teach those on their dying beds to say for who ever last statement from this life is will enter Jen but be careful not to to bother them meaning not every single minute say ill the guy is dying 30 seconds later say ill get away from me you're making him bored the scholars say if he said ill and did not say anything for five hours that's good that's enough he will enter Jenna inshallah but if he says I'm thirsty give me water you give him water and say to him say so that it would be the last statement he utters if he doesn't speak afterwards leave him alone also it is part of the Sunnah that you place the one who is on his dying bed who's about to die on his right hand side facing the the prophet said to who was on his dying bed and he said I give onethird of my money to the prophet Alat wasam and you have to make me face the he said he has been successful in following the F in facing the when dying as for his third of the money I give it back to his children I don't need the money and this is when it's possible but when the deceased is finding it hard then it's okay to lie on his back facing the if possible and this is Sunnah it's not mandatory what if if he releases or what if his soul is is departing his body the prophet told usat when the soul departs the body the first thing that follows it is the eyesight and this is why people when they die they do this they're watching their soul departing their body and they die with their eyes open so the Sunnah is to close the eyes immediately as the prophet did and this is the moment that all the Angels attend so the Sunnah for those surrounding the deceased is to make Dua with goodness and not to wail like many people do they start wailing oh I wish it was me the Angels say am mean this is true the prophet said when a soul is departing the body the Angels attend and whatever Dua you make they say a mean so say oh Allah forgive him oh Allah have mercy on him oh Allah make it easy for him because the Angels say a mean and the Sunnah is to cover the body why because it's not a pleasant sight to to look at a deceased it breaks the heart and sometimes the face changes the color changes so the Sunnah as done with the prophet Alam is to cover the body I forgot to put on my mon my timer then it's time to follow what the Scholars combine in a word tum and this is one of the words that they combine the procedures of dying tum the letter T the letter Dal the letter wow the letter M and what is meant by this this is the financial issues related to the deceased is the first thing is to take from his wealth the money to prepare his funeral washing him buying him the shrouds the burial if there are expenses to be taken from his wealth not to be donated or giving as Charity no this is the Sunnah if someone comes and gives a charity or as a gift alhamdulillah the second is DAL which refers to D so the second thing is you pay off his debts immediately after his death how much wealth did he leave a million how much debts does he have 500,000 immediately take it and give it to those who lent him the Third is wow not wow as boo wow no the letter wow in Arabic refers to and was is the will so any deceased who wrote A will his will is to be executed and I will come to that later on inshallah and the final is me referring to Al the inheritance after all these three had been paid off we distribute and divide the inheritance on his hirs so now we have the deceased he's dead what should we do we have to hasten in washing him not like some Western countries or disbelievers they leave the body for 3 Days 10 days 40 days and some of them put it in a glass casket so that people can visit and watch no honoring the diseased in Islam is by hastening its burial so you start to wash the deceased the men wash the men and the women wash a deceased woman it is not permissible for men men to wash a deceased woman or for women to wash a deceased man except the spouses the prophet saidat to if you die before me I will wash you and the wife of Abu Bakr when he died she was the one who washed him and her name was Asma may Allah be pleased with her this blessed woman was married to three Companions and this is an advice and an example to women who said oh I am divorced who will marry me no you you will be married when your risk comes Allah Asel sends you the best of men as who is she a companion but what's so special about her her first husband was the one with the two Wings when he was martyred in M she married huh H Abu Bakr ass sik and when he died she married Ali the brother of jaar three highly decorated companions may Allah be pleased with him she's the one who washed Abu Bakr and may Allah be pleased with her said if it were to me no one would have washed the prophet Alam except his wives no man would have washed him but we could not have a say in it and they wash the prophet themselves so this is the right way of doing it men wash a man and women wash a Woman except when there are uh in the case of spouses the sun who among you has washed a disease before raise your hands please mashall who I am in a cemetery Mah that's very good because it makes you closer to Allah to know that this is what's going to happen to me soon the Sunnah is when you wash a deceased you do not disclose anything some people come and say well I washed my uncle and man the smell was so awful he looked this he looked that and his face was black you must not disclose anything that is bad because the prophet saidat and listen to this carefully whoever washes a Corps of a Muslim and he conceals what he had seen Allah will forgive him 40 times for Zero just by concealing and after you wash of course the washing procedure is quite lengthy it would not suffice in our uh short lecture after you wash and perfume and cleanse and this is strange we're about to throw him in the ground and bury him with sand why would we do this thing it shows you how we honor a corpse of a Muslim deceased and why how we prepare him to meet the angels and to be in the best of form not only we wash him we perfume him and put perfumes in the places and the spots of sujud so when you smell you smell beautiful fragrance we shroud we put and wrap the body in white shrouds pieces of cloth the men are to be shrouded in three pieces the women are to be shrouded in five pieces why women are more because they have to be concealed more than the man and the Sunnah is to do that in white uh uh pieces of cloth after shrouding them and putting them in what is known as Al cfan and a lot of the people have this misconception of preparing caring the Cuffin in their homes a lot of the people have a box with their shrouds with their uh um uh material needed for the washing in their cupboards or prepared this is wrong this is not from the sunna and it is a waste of money this can be used for people who are dead now give it to them when you die we will buy you one don't don't worry we will not be short of it inshallah after we do this we offer janaza prayer and this procedure of washing shrouding and praying is a f upon the whole ummah if a minority does it the whole ummah are Exempted if no one does it the whole umah are sinful it's called a communial obligation so it has to be done and it can be done the prayer of the funeral can be done in the house can be done in the Masjid can be done at the cemetery can be done multiple times because it's Dua for the deceased and the prophet sallallah alaihi Al wasallam told us that the more those those who offer the prayer in Number the greater their intercession and the reward for the deceased the prophet saidat no muslim that dies and 40 men don't associate others with Allah stand at his grave except Allah would forgive him and would Grant him the their intercession so the Salat of the funeral is intercession you're interceding to Allah oh Allah forgive our deceased you're helping him but at the same time you are rewarded the prophet saidat whoever offers the funeral prayer will get and whoever follows a funeral until it's buried will get to what is aat equivalent to mount of Good Deeds mount a mountain just by praying how long does the Salah take 3 minutes the longest but so many people in Haram I see them they go pray Sunnah and they neglect the Salat of the funeral how crazy can can people be they don't want the reward they don't know the great reward that Allah has appointed to that so following the funeral until the graveyard until it's buried gives you a which is as big as a mountain of good deeds and those following the funeral should not be engaged in answering phone calls or messages on Whatsapp thit Alani the student of anas malic he says if you were to see us at the time of the Companions and the when we used to follow funerals you would see most of us covering their faces either crying or pondering and contemplating silence there just following and what are we doing we're following to their burial place someday we're going to be carried so they were C all crying and weeping or contemplating of what will happen to them what is the Sunnah to walk slowly or to walk uh uh quickly h quickly you're not afraid that you will drop the funeral no the Sunnah is to hasten while walking but not to an extent that you may drop it and not to walk slowly like you know dying people because you are taking this funeral to Jenna inshallah if it's a good Soul what about if it's a bad Soul you're just getting rid of it you don't want to carry it just get throw it so either way you have to be fast in taking it when you come to the Grave how do you place the body in the grave by slitting it feet first and you put it down and you place it in the the grave on the right hand side facing the and this shows you the unity of Muslims any cemetery in the world whether it's in Russia in Morocco in the US in China all Muslims are lying on the right hand side facing the nowhere else no other religion has this sign of unity even in death and you have two ways of burial you have a sh and you have a and it depends on the soil and the ground how it's done usually it's a the Sunnah is to do it an L Type so you dig the grave like this and then you make an opening in the side you place the corpse in it and you put bricks to cover it and protect it from the sand then you put the sand and bury it and when you bury when you put it and you place it the Sunnah is to say when you are the one who's carrying it and placing it not the one who are watching no the people who are handling the deceased the Sunnah is when they place the body they say this is the Sunnah for those handling it then you put the sand back in and fill the grave of course because of this cavity the L Type there will be extra sand and this is why you'll have a little hump on the grave and this is from the Sunnah why so that people would know and recognize that this is a grave so that they don't walk on it and they don't sit on it which is sinful it is totally prohibited to walk or to sit on a grave and the Sunnah is after you bury the deceased that you remain standing by his grave raising your hand hands and making Dua the prophet sallallahu alai wasallam after concluding the burial of one of his companions he said seek forgiveness for your brother and ask Allah for him to be St fast because now he's being questioned the Angels make him sit in his grave and question him the three principle fundamentals you know the book of she Muhammad ABD wahab very important book and it is the three questions each and every one of us will be asked in his grave what are these questions what is who is your lord and what is your religion and who is this man who was sent to you the answer is Allah Islam Muhammad Alam that's why every Salat we say and this is part of thear of the morning we say it three times so this is what you're going to be asked the bad news is you will not be able to answer it unless you have practiced it if you had doubts you will not be able you would say huh huh I don't know I I've heard people say and I said you don't have certainty in your heart those who walk the talk practice Islam they will have no problem they will answer it in a heartbeat with the grace of Allah may Allah make me and you steadfast and among those who answer it so the prophet said seek forgiveness for your brother and ask Allah to make him steadfast he did not say read the the vast majority of Muslims they consider marriage a form of death slow death that's why when they make marriage contract they say and also when someone dies and they said he died so oh the poor thing let's read fat as if marriage and death are the same all of this is an innovation yes Al is the best Surah in the Quran but reading it when coming out of the toilet is it good if you answer the call of Nature and after you come you say Al why not it's the best Surah in the Quran is inappropriate why because the prophet didn't do it alhamdulillah BOS the prophet did not do itam when getting married or when people got married nor when people died so it is not part of the F he said ask Allah for forgiveness for your brother and that he remains steadfast because he's being questioned no recitation of no recitation ofran nothing all of this is do what the prophet wasallam did and and told us to do unless you know more than him anyone knows more than the prophet the shotgun is ready huh anyone no one alhamdulillah okay so we finished buried our disease what to do we go back to the financials we have to see the debts and give them to the lenders we have to see the will what is the will every one of us unlike what we think because a lot of us in modern Muslim countries have to write a will what to do with my property what to do with my money what to do with my savings in Islam we don't have to do any of this we have to write a will only islamically if I have debts and nobody knows about it so my family does not know that I borrowed a million dollars from XYZ when I die he comes and says where's my money we say show us proof he said I don't have proof sheam was a good friend of mine and we didn't write any document they said well you don't have documents no Witnesses we're not going to give you anything it's a million dollars and and they're right and he's right in asking for his money who's wrong me for not clarifying it so each one of you has to go today and write down a document saying that I borrowed this from this guy and I borrowed this from this guy and I lent this guy this much and I gave this guy this much so that when you die everything is documented this is your will an extra bit of will is that if I want to give and donate money and this is per permissible with two conditions condition number one that I only donate onethird or less of my wealth so I have $900,000 in my total wealth property stocks and uh uh bank accounts the total is $900,000 I can write before I die of course after I die I can write anything this is rhetorical H before I die I can write 300,000 which is 1/3 I give to the Masjid I give to charity organizations I give to my cousin I give to she and I will love you very much I will make Dua for you I will make if even if you wish 300,000 well I can get so many people to make for you anyhow this is okay this is condition number one that I can donate okay can I say 310 no only the third the prophet said to you can write a will by oneir and oneir is a lot so you cannot exceed one3 second condition is the money I'm giving cannot be given to an [Music] air meaning I write in my will and I I'm going to die and when I die I'd like uh $100,000 to be given to my wife immediately I tetir it up and throw it in the garbage after your death has no value I give my property to my son I give this to my father all is to be thrown in the garbage can why because the heirs that are prescribed in the Quran have been allocated a percentage so my wife gets 1/8 of my wealth if I have children if I don't she gets one quarter my father gets one sixth if I have children if I don't he gets oneir and the distribution is very crystal clear in the Quran I cannot give one single penny extra because this is Haram these are the two conditions of the will and some people write in their will something a bit extra what is extra they say if I die I'd like to be buried in Mecca you don't laugh in Saudi Arabia this is happening especially in jida because we're close to meca we're 1 hour and a half and the vast majority of them say especially those who were born in Medina we were to be buried in Medina now it's an issue of dispute among Scholars whether such a will would be executed or cancelled why because the Sunnah is to hastening the burial and to make it as quick as possible to ship it from one City to the other that is going to cost money time and a lot of effort so the vast majority of Scholars say that this will is not to be executed for example I made a will to my family long ago that whenever I wherever I die I should be buried meaning if I die in quala lur I'll be better than qual lumur not to be shipped all the way to Saudi which takes a long time and lot of procedures and a lot of money no why oh so that they can have the last look look at what my videos are online you can have my picture anytime so this is ridiculous so this is a valid reason some people say after we die I'd like you to build a Masjid on My Grave don't say oh we know people have done this huh a lot of VIP people do this this is Haram and this Masjid has to be demolished any Masjid that is built on a grave must be demolished because the grave came first and the Masjid is not established to worship allaha some people say uh that if I die my will is the that you throw a party like in America for example when they go to bury a decease they have a musical band in front of the funeral playing music what is this they're happy that he died they playing music no no he used to love this music or in so many Muslim countries Unfortunately they write in the will Muslims that they want to be cremated and wait a little bit insh a few years you will be properly and not to be done this life this is very very strange of people why would you like to go to hell twice I don't know so this is unfortunately what is happening to a lot of the people unfortunately now how much time do we have because I've finished the material I don't have a second session huh minut 10 more minutes okay so they told me that we have two sessions I read it as one session so I prepared my material for one session the second session we will manage inshallah to talk about maybe uh I'll make something up don't worry it will be useful as well inshallah don't worry now when a person dies a loved one how could I benefit them there are four authentic ways to benefit a deceased and many many unauthentic number one from the authentic is Dua the prophet said when the son of Adam dies all of his deeds are interrupted except three number one continue charity give example a well Masid school I'm buying time I have to minutes I have to waste time huh Quran books um Islamic Channel Islamic Channel Islamic newspaper uh dawa organization orphanage the sky is the limit it's what's the key it is Ono if you feed someone is it no he's going to eat it and then two hours later it's going to be flushed it's gone but a continuous sod is ongoing a well people keep on drinking from it drinking from it a Masjid a book a Quran it's continuous and the Deeds are regenerating so the prophet says beneficial knowledge like the one I'm doing hopefully so when I'm dying and I'm dead in my grave you watch my videos you watch my lectures I am dead but the the meter is clicking it's working this is beneficial knowledge when we hear the name Imam Ahmed Imam Malik Imam sha IM Abu [Music] hanif what continue I will stop man if you want to stop um when we hear IB T these Mountains they're dead but they left their legacy so they have number three and this translates to a righteous Offspring whether boy or girl because some of the translators say a righteous boy and the sisters were angered by this wed in Arabic refers to both boy and girl and a lot of the Arabs don't know this but in the Quran it STS meaning refers to boys and girls so this is what the prophet saidat so the best is Dua when you make Dua for the deceased whether you are of his offspring or a total stranger is it will reach him with the grace of Allah whether you ask for forgiveness for Mercy expansion of his grave putting light in it opening a window from Jenna any kind of Dua it will reach number two charity whether from his offspring or from a stranger any charity you give such as Ramadan is coming okay this Ramadan there's an organization here is money I want to feed need fasting people break their fast over 100 people on behalf of my father or my mother or my siblings or my relatives or my friend it reaches them without any doubt number three and four and ha and with the grace of Allah Allah blessed me I live in jida every month I make one om for my father and the following month I make it for my mother and I do it every single month with the grace of Allah why I love them I don't have anything that could reach them except this om and it's 1 hour and 15 minutes drive and I stay in a five star hotel I enjoy it so it's two birds with one stone so you can do this oh she it's a long way I can't do it pay he for maybe 1,22 200 ring someone will do it for you so many poor people in meca they'll do it for you for 12200 for Hajj maybe a little bit more but you can do that and this would reach anything else no it's disputable such as reading the Quran there is nothing in the Quran or the Sunnah says that when we read the Quran and give the theab it will reach them what about praying for them every night I pray two ra for my deceased father no this is not good what about fasting ah fasting is different fasting if they have a debt the deceased had debts on him he had vowed to fast 10 days and he died did not fulfill you as his relative can as an heir you can fast on his behalf only if he has debts not voluntary fasting and so on okay how what what to uh give to the deceased so we have Dua we have charity we have omah and we have Hajj and fasting only when there is a debt such as a vow or a Mist fast in Ramadan that he did not make up and he did not have a legitimate reason not to make them up but if he was sick and he died before being able no we're Exempted from doing that and Allah Knows [Music] Best"
