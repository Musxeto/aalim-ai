  "title": "EMI provided by Store itself vs provided by third party like bank or finance company Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Sam sue or Sam sue says I am planning to buy a laptop my bank offers e/m I I think it stands for equated monthly installments without interest but when I purchase through Bank they charge taxation 18% OGS D I don't know what that stands for if I give ready cash I need not pay taxes instead the seller will pay the taxes my question purchasing product in this EMI scheme is halal or Haram regardless of the issue of EMI Samsung regardless whether it is halal or Haram regardless the taxation is halal or Haram the most important issue in this transaction is that you are getting the bank to finance something that you want to buy now if the EMI was done by the retailer shop by the shop you're buying the laptop from so I go directly to this bookstore or to this shop and I see a laptop and I want to buy it they tell me that the final price is X Y Z and it is fixed there can be no more money added to it and the percentage is not increased the final price is fixed in this case if I want to buy it through am i from this retailer shop there is no problem in that it's Helen but to have a third entity joining in and saying that we will finance you for it though they claim that it is zero percentage it is not zero percentage because they're making a profit either from raising the price on you or from the seller themselves and hence this is not permissible the bank cannot finance something and not make profit out of it and definitely the bank cannot sell you something that it does not possess or own and Allah knows best"
