  "title": "Signs of the Last Day (Day of Judgement) Part 1 - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "talk about the signs of the hour sometimes we may think that this is luxurious something accessory something not essential because in most of the cases it deals with storytelling so people come not to learn but rather to be entertained they come to listen to stories and probably myths and things of the past or of the future that is entertaining first of all when we talk about the signs of the hour this is an essential part of our religion how is that we know that the Prophet told the sari solids and that in hadith of Ramadan haha also known as the hadith of gibreel peace be upon it when a man came to the Masjid white clothes black hair no signs of traveling and no one among us knows him so if he did not travel he doesn't seem like a traveler and no one knows him he wasn't staying in any of our houses which means that we don't have any hotels then who is he and you know the story what is Islam what is email what is exam when is the hour what are the signs show number two Eman six pillars of Eman and Tom in a builder he William and after part of belonging in the day of judgment is to believe in anything that is related to it such as the science of the day of judgment the day of judgment self there is erection the accountability and his app the hell heaven everything that goes with it is included in the belief of the day of judgement which is a must for you to learn because this is part of the six pillars of a man unfortunately people just know how to pray barely but when it comes to details of the Day of Judgment hmm they are quite doubtful about it if you ask them about the scale that has a tongue and two eyes and ways your deeds never heard of that if you ask them about this the path which is as sharper than a blade thinner than a hair and all of humanity pass on it believers and this and an hypocrites the disbelievers don't pass it on to sell out they are taking from day one to help but only the believers and the hypocrites who claim to be Muslims pass on it people don't know so this is part one part two when you come to the signs in the hadith of jbeil he asked when is the hour the Prophet said men must fool the one who's being asked is not more knowledgeable than the person asking me Jonnie our knowledge is nil then he asked about the science of the day of judgment and the Prophet told him one two three when he departed what did the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam say to Rama listen carefully Rama do you know who that man was the Prophet said that is Homer said may Allah be pleased with him Allahu Allah alum I don't know the Prophet said it was what debris teaching you your religion what was he teaching us Islam Eman Sam when is the day the day of judgment or the hour and the signs this hadith clearly explains us that studying the signs of the hour is part of your religion so don't come and tell me that this is storytelling yes there are people who made this business and all what they do in the lectures is storytelling and they put spices salt pepper Hanna but when the people got used to these spices they started using nutmeg now this is going a little bit extra and using ingredients that are Haram because they want people to buy from them what they're selling what is or what are the benefits of believing in the Day of Judgment why is it so important that it is part of the six pillars of Iman when you believe in the day of judgment when you believe that there is a day of reckoning analyze that what Jen will hold you accountable for your actions when you fear punishment and you are wishful and hopeful for the reward of allah azza wajal when your eyes at the scales on the day of judgment not on the scales of this dunya in this dunya I evaluate you according to your wealth your position in your company about those who you know but these are nothing in the skills of a large division so once I have this imbalance then all what will result from it is goodness because all your affairs will be to the good and to the benefit of yourself and the for Humanity not only for Humanity even for animals when you believe in the day of judgment you will benefit even the animals Roberto haha may Allah be pleased with him he said if you were to trip and fall in Iraq is in Medina I would be afraid that Allah would hold me accountable for it so he fears the day of judgement over the welfare of a mule the roads were not paved enough or not paved well and this shows you that a believer who has a strong belief in the day of judgment he would fix all of his affairs according to what pleases Allah unlike those who are a Phasis those who are disbelievers of the day of judgment reincarnation we die if we were good we will become humans if we were bad we will become a fish and then finding Nemo what is this although he was a bad man in the previous life this is what a lot of those Hindus and atheists believe every incarnation they died they come into a different life form that's why this is all what they care about this dunya this moment we are in let's make the best of it let's do everything we wish to do the consequences are not important we die house it's over game over Muslims don't think of this we die the game begins either heaven forever or hell forever this is why we work hard to achieve what pleases Allah as the virgin now then this is a dissonant reduction and getting something to open our eyes before going into this important topic now the signs of the hour were mentioned in the Quran generally speaking Allah so Allah says do they then wait anything other than the hour that it should come upon them suddenly but some of its signs have already come so Allah is measuring the hour in the Quran and Allah Azza WA JAL is mentioning that some of the signs had already come which means that there are much much more to come among the signs that took place Allah mentioned the hour has drawn nearer and the moon has been lift asunder split and we will come to talk about this briefly Shama now in the Sunna as mentioned earlier hadith of Allah and Jibreel this clearly shows that the Prophet told us about some of the signs yet there are so many signs of the hour that you can compile a very big book and there are a number of books among the best books you can buy I believe they are translated into English the collection of dr. umma even Sulaiman and Ashbaugh may Allah have mercy on his soul who died on the 27th of ramadan one of the great scholars of islam I think he was residing equate if I'm not mistaken he has a great collection that is highly thrust double authentic and the hadith are all according to chicken and man so it's very reliable to depend upon and others and when you study the signs of the hours you are comforted by this science why because we see so many calamities around us we see that the Muslims are being slaughtered not only on riddle of half but throughout the whole year they're slaughtering them they're brutally attacking them abusing them and you tend to think we are the best nation that Rama has given to the world why is this happening when you read the signs of the hour when you read the prophecies of the Prophet array salado's that I'm telling us that this would happen you rest assured that this is the truth that we believe in not to sit back and relax but rather to move forward be positive and try to change whatever is possible to change I have selected few of so many there are backed by authentic hadith so all what you will hear in today's workshop and in tomorrow's workshop insha'Allah are all 100% authenticated by chicken and banning all those before him like Bihari Muslim etc so it's nothing that is a bit shady or let me check the authenticity feel free you want to check the authenticity this is best because don't we have a saying in Arabic don't give your beard to someone to hold it for you if someone holds your beard is drag you like a coat you control you so don't let anyone control you depend on your knowledge after asking Allah Allah for guidance look and see but for those who are lazy like myself I'll tell you that these are all authentic ishyama so when we want to look and study the signs of the hour we will find that they are divided into two types major and minor the major are 10 and I'll postpone them to tomorrow's work Shama Shama the minor are so many but these minor are also divided some took place and are over with some did not take place yet some are frequent taking place over and over again so among the signs that had taken place some considered to be major but the most authentic is that is a minor sign which is the death of our prophet alaihi s-salatu wa sallam is this a minor sign scholars say it's the most major sign but it is not a sign of the day of judgment we depressed by it we are saddened that we did not get the chance to see our prophet or a solution but it is it a major sign of the Day of Judgment the Prophet said Ras salat-u-salam I was sent and the hour like these now one would say this was fifteen centuries ago so what is this what is the hour there's still much to come because this distance between these two fingers are equivalent to the length of humanity on earth so whether it is a couple of million years less more which shows you that the remaining is still far to come and allah azza wajal knows when it is going to come one asks when is the hour shift the answer would be what do you get seriously okay when is it the chant coming what do you care since i would like to be ready I think your day of judgment your hour is when you dine so whether you see all of these signs or you don't it doesn't matter the moment you die this is your hour so are you ready not yet then there is no use of it so we go into the hadith of the prophet alayhi salatu salam he said to one of his companions count six signs before the day of judgment among them is my death so the Prophet is telling us this is one of the signs it happened the Prophet is dead do we have to go to the concept of some of the deviant sex that the Prophet assume is hazard nozzle and he's alive and he is with us and we don't have to go this because you're all a whole signal jimana you're not beyond inshallah sharing the deviant belief in the Prophet is the Prophet alive in his grave one says yes one says no do I have to go there is he alive he's alive he's alive is my father alive my father died 45 years ago he is a life in his grave but is his life similar to mine No if he was a life like me I will open his grave and take him out let him live again with us his life is the person which is a stage between this dunya and the hereafter this is where all the dead live the way they live it's to allah azza wajal they do not eat drink go to the toilet get married like us but there are life in the sense we see their core process we may see the remains of the bodies or not but there are life a life that is not similar to our world they do not come to us in our dreams they do not whisper - they do not watch over us like in the movies he is watching over you he'll be happy with you know that come on the connection with this world is over bye I hope we move on to the signs so that we can finish because this is about the I need about 54 pages the workshop of today and tomorrow and I very much doubt that if we take though it's very important yeah ok I can listen to you and finish but I believe that standing for a pause with each one and commenting on it is far greater than just listening listen this thing it we need to get a reminder if I need to get a reminder I don't care I don't care what you I need to remind myself every now and then so let us each other progress by one of the signs that took place and will never come back again is the fire of Hejaz what is this the prophet alaihi s-salatu wa sallam told us that they will come a fire in Jesus meaning in Medina area that from the light of this fire the camel next the necks of camels in a sham and Basava it's a town in Syria will be lit and people will see the traces of the fire imagine the distance now this incident was extensively written about it took place in the year 6 654 hidden meaning in the 7th century eg so this took place six hundred plus years after the death of the Prophet Elisha the son and who wrote about it trustworthy scholars such as an imam and never win because remember now he was a contemporary of that era and time and even Kathie Lee wrote it reporting and efficient and not DC and so many historians wrote about this great fire one would say what's so important about fire we have fires we have blazes we go to America in California and Miami and so many fires are taking place what's so special what is special is that this fire lasted one for 52 days the second duration they said it lasted for three months what was it it started in three days Little Earthquakes people did not feel it so clear second day the trembling in Medina shook the Masjid of the Prophet I serve until the ceiling squeezed squeaked and make noises the third day more than 18 shops everybody was terrified the whole medina was trembling everybody ran and rushed to the Masjid of the Prophet s son anything would happen it wouldn't happen in the Masjid the ruler of Medina came to the Masjid started train freed all his slaves returned all the wealth he took unlawfully from people repenting to Allah Azza WA JAL he uplifted the taxations he used to take from the people the fact the income tax all these nine yards and repented and asked Allah soldier but the fire came from the east towards Medina and then went north what was this fire it was like volcanic lava but it was so intense in light that they saw it in Mecca they saw it in Tama they saw it in the book and the light of the Sun and the moon faded because of the strength of this light the funny thing is this flow a river of lava could shoot everything in its face on a suede mountains trees rocks it all melted yet no one was harmed for it and beautiful cold breeze kept on coming to the people of Medina this is scary it's like when you see a volcano coming to you but you don't feel the heat yet you can see the light you can everyone who was terrified scared repented to allah azza wajal now I wish I had more time order brought you pictures from these places in Modena in the hammer in the cracks on the ground where scholars have documented this today saying that this is the path of the fire and how it came but we would have required three four more days just to explain and elaborate on this so this is one of the signs that took place and is over with and it is documented no one can claim otherwise one of the signs that took place unfortunately is that XI Xia and garage are not given to the Muslims anymore what is GC GC has mentioned in surah at-taubah chapter 9 where Allah orders us to fight the Jews and the Christians until they pay us the jizya the taxation and this taxation by the way is less than the zakat we Muslims pay now human rights bla bla bla this is for the benefit of the Jews and the Christians living on Muslim soil imagine the Christians come and complain all you do this you do that you segregate between the religions you consider a second-class listen I pay 2.5% of my savings I paid 2.5% of my trade they pay 2.5% of their gold jewelry etc and the crops that we grow the cattle that we raise you guys how much do you pay a very fixed minimal amount per year only on the working men women don't pay old men don't pay children don't pay only working men pay and in return of what that you live safe and sound in your countries that is ruled by Islam or in our soil and if any enemy army would come and invade or try to fight you guys do not fight it is our responsibility to fight and defend you so after all you call this taxation this is peanuts so this was the case until the Muslims went so way down in their lack of commitment to Islam that now no Jews no Christians no other religions pay the jizya and this is exactly what the prophet alayhi salatu salam prophesize the Prophet said in the hadith of over Iran may Allah be pleased with him the Prophet said a lot with our would withhold its dinner hams and the fees fees ISM a measurement of science so now era was Muslim at the time of the Prophet assertion no that's a prophecy in a prophecy so a lot would withhold its Durham's and a feast syria would withhold its wood and dinner again a prophecy Syria was not Egypt with withhold its tip and dinar and you would recoil to that position from where you started and you would recoil to that position from where you started and you would recall to that position where you or from where you started what does this mean the Prophet is telling us Egypt Iran Syria will all come under Islam they were being Christians and the Muslims they will give the jizya but there will come a time when it will stop even because it's all Muslim and hamdulillah or either because of the empowerment of the non-muslims over the Muslims so this is page for hand alignment we are on the wing half still 50 to go now moving on to the signs that took place and our continuous to take place and possible to take place more in the future first of all there was a plane in a town called it was in Cillian the prophet alayhi salat wa salam among the six he told us to count before the day of judgment among them is his death he said two that's two plagues two pandemics that will spread in you like a disease that spreads in a herd of sheep there is for those who a green sheep they know that there is some disease when it hit it kills everybody so the Prophet is warning us of two of them one of them is the one of us and it was took place on the eighth year of Islam they say some said that it is a little bit later which means that the Companions were there and twenty five thousand people died with the calculation and the population of the people at that time this is a lot and among those who died because of this plague war obey and in July one of the ten heaven-bound who robbed the hot tub said if a more Abeyta were alive I would have appointed him to be the hanifa he said this after being stabbed and then they appointed as you North man even I find me a lot pleased with them more and also among those who died is the scholar of the Companions more an image available they all died in this plague that the Prophet warned us from to place in the past there is a possibility of it taking place in the future now among the signs that the prophet told us about is the glad tidings of the conquest of Muslims to other countries the victory of Muslims over other countries and nations and this was a little bit tricky we know that the Arabs were the worst of all people in terms of strength and power the Prophet came elect salat wa salam migrated to Medina in ten years he managed to conquer Mecca Medina and some areas around it but in the few decades afterwards the expansion of the Muslims was astonishing so when the Prophet says alehissalaam is sternum in cycle I'm a Muslim he said you will invade the Arabian Peninsula and Allah will open it for you then he is addressing the Arabs on you will invade Persia the greatest empire and Allah will open it for you then you will invade Rome the Byzantines the Romans and Allah will open it for you and then you will conquer and invade the dead child himself and Allah will make you prevail upon him now if I tell you this nowadays you will in sha Allah conquer the Christians Europe and America and you will go to Russia and you will go to the Kremlin and you shall Allah make you far on the Caesars table and you what will you say excuse me but then is something wrong we don't have tomahawks we don't have f 15 16 17 18 I don't know where they reach now we don't have anything that Muslims are so poor this is true but when the Prophet said it an institution what did the Companions do they believed in it 110 percent they acted upon it because this is from Allah this is revelation and in few years it happened where is Percy now with the Byzantines you know where were they aware they were in Jerusalem a pox Syria Jordan when the Prophet pointed out to us the main art of Klump he pointed that for the people of Syria there is a joyful which is called now Brabham for the people of Allah there is so-and-so for the people of Yemen who were not Muslims there is the aluminum of sardinia there is soup and the companions were looking at each other not at this belief sit in astonishment sin Wow all of these areas would become Muslim and they become so this is not from what's-his-name destroyed or messes this or something something this is not from this is all facts and this is why you might time you put the 15 in your car and cruise now they have 68 78 new cars much taller they have so many gears you don't have to doubt a bit in Islam you have 110 confidence everything is the prophets inertia is what is reality true you can see it and the kuffar are helpless we want to cast doubt in the religion of Islam the Muslims are not leaving us anywhere to doubt they everything is false poof alhamdulillah so the Prophet is giving us light tidings now this light tidings is also cascaded when the Prophet told us that we will invade India the brothers from India please do not be offended with Muslims before we are Indians the Prophet told isalud isalud was set up there will be two groups of my Ummah who Allah will protect from Hellfire a group who will conquer India and a group who will be with recently Mariam this is good tidings from the Prophet to those who conquered India now let's come back to India has Islam conquered India and says yes twice once in the time of morale eeeh may Allah be pleased with him even Cathy says the Muslims invaded or conquered India in the times of mahalia in the year 44 - so after Abu Bakr Umar Osman Ali came Wow the a ruler of in Islam it is time they conquered India even Cathy goes on to say and the Honorable Great King Mahmoud even cetacaine the man of heussner he invaded India in the year 400 his mom so this is the 5th century of Hitler we are in the 15 10 centuries ago and he went in he took prisoners he took slaves and he managed to gather a lot of wealth and he entered assume that I don't know what that and temples may be I have no idea about this and he broke the biggest Idol that they used to worship he took the swords that they used to sacrifice and an offer and he went back safe and sound now the Prophet told us that they will come a third conquest but they are blessed when it's going to be abolished there are so many fabricated hadiths wake hadith that support this and put some spices and not mock and we have spoken about this so we will not go into it because this is not important to us not only that the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam gave us the glad tiding of conquering constant TW known as postponed tinea and this was the capital of the Byzantine Empire of the East it was conquered once and it will be conquered again so some scholars say that this is in reference to Istanbul this constant Toto Constantinople is Istanbul to Istanbul now is what Turkish or Muslim is under Muslim rule welcome a time that it will be overtaken by the Christians so if you have investments there Danny maybe you should be considered changing your portfolio the Prophet says are they solid Astana and this hadith is authentic the Prophet said to them it's in Arabic so I'm going to translate it to you have you heard of a city part of it is on land and part is in the sea so the companion said yes is referring to this city the Prophet said that the our would not be called until 70 thousand of the sons of Isaac is happy this is a reference the Christians in the Jews because the Muslims are the sons of is married so this is a clear indication that there will be an invasion and there will be war the 70,000 scholars say that this number is in Arabic language in my language it is used as an exaggeration so whenever I want to tell you something oh I have been to that place a gazillion time what is a gazillion time share meaning countless of times and this is why when the Prophet says our sir seventy thousand of my Ummah will enter gender without reckoning scholars say seventy thousands are not mentioned so that seventy thousand and one is not or seventy thousand minus one know this is a sign of exaggeration and this is why in another hadith the Prophet says observe with each one of them seventy thousand Wow this is like having million seven hundred fourteen forty nine ninety four billion nine hundred million and this is not sought after it's not meant as a literal meaning so a great number of Jews and Christians mainly Christians will invade it so when they go there they will take there will happen a war now the hadith is great some of the scholar said weak weak weak weak seventy thousand of the sons of Isaac are Muslims Oh meaning that they are leavers and they will invade Constantinople and they will invade it in a fashion that is unlike our conventional war the Prophet says is awesome when they come they will set their camps they will not fight they will not throw any arrows they will say la ilaha illallah w'allahu akbar these 70,000 would only say la ilaha il'allah w'allahu akbar the Prophet says one of the signs will fall into the sea of the city and then they will say for the second time la la la Allah Akbar the second side would fall into the sea in the third time they say Lida allah allah akbar allah azzawajal would open the gate and they will invade it without any problem without any fighting without any killing what kind of a man do they possess that Allah opens a whole city for these people by a snake Lila ha wah wah wah wah wah when you tell people do drama what is Dharma they have weapons they have machine guns they have bombs this is dry Allah Allah Allah Allah the prophet says an institution they entered the city they are collecting the booty of wars and treasures and so on and while they are doing this they hear someone shouting that the Dajjal has appeared so they leave everything and they go trying to find that the jail and fight him off they are warriors they are army of real true believing Muslims but then they are faced with the Christians the room who say to the Muslims because there are mixed Muslims and the 70,000 of the sons of his half so the Christians say leave us to fight with our brothers those who reverts leave us fight with them the real true Muslims born Muslims they would say first this is not accepted these are our brothers and we will never leave you to fight them alone we live together or we die together this is the bond of Islam nowadays people say hey please locals here expansive you go fight me there is nothing like this in Islam there's no experts in Islam you see lorina handlebar you come and lead the prayer yeah but I myself am from Mecca Medina I'm the one who's supposed to lead no if he recites foreign better if he is knowledgeable he's to be respected more nationalities are a document tear it and throw it away but Islam is a canary and belief so the Prophet says la sala fusa they refused and they decide to fight alongside with the reverts brothers so they fight one third of them run away allah azza wajal would never repent upon them allah deprives them from repentance because they are hypocrites and the hypocrites are the first to flee and done away and one third would be martyred at the side of Allah and the Prophet says they are the best of martyrs at the sight of Allah and the third third they are the one who would conquer Constantinople and they will never be trialed tried nice and they would never face fitna they would never face trial they were so steadfast on Islam that nothing can harm them at all this is a glimpse of what will happen in the future so definitely without any doubt there will take place a big battle between the Muslims and the Christians we will come to mention this later on in sha allah before talking about the dead jack so until now is it boring whether your guys no need to sleep bring a pillow or something right now when we talk about Christians we tend to curse them a lot of pharma Kirsten I will destroy them now that do this do that to them they might deserve this but it is wrong to generalize oh Allah destroy all the Christians my mother is a Christian what are we talking about so there are Christians who are close to us who do not show empathy who do not fight us to get us out of our homes amar tells us to be kind to them but there are those who fight us plot to destroy us to divide us those which should take them as enemy this beautiful hadith is not part of the science of our but it shows you because it since I hate Muslim which is the most authentic along with Bihari so a you stirring and brushing may Allah be pleased with him said in the presence of Allah in the last water contains he said I heard the prophet salallahu alaihe wasalam said that the hour would not take place except when the christians are the vast majority of the people which means that they will remain a majority who's more Christians are Muslims Christians of course one would say yeah but they're not real Christians do you mean to tell me that the world point seven billion Muslims are being Muslims they're worshipping shrines are going to peers to Mawlana to so and so so but the name Muslims and Christians so when he said this I'm from the US said hmm if the Prophet said that the day of judgement would not be called until the Christians are the vast majority of people by Allah they have four characteristics in them that are good meaning that they are not in the Muslims what are they this is an observation of one of the most intellectual smart companions of all antonella's was known to be someone who plots plans and make strategies better than anyone else among the companions so he said first of all among the people of Earth they are the first to react and wake up after a calamity Muslims are when they struck by a calamity until they reconvene and they assemble and meet it would be six months one year just to meet and to discuss people are dying okay in November we will meet the Sharma and after they meet in November January meeting will take a decision the Christians they take action what immediately a volcano and earthquake a calamity immediately if they immobilize done - they are among the best to control their emotions when fitna takes place so they are not impulsive they don't take decisions and then think later you know that they say should and then ask questions no they wait and they plot and they think and then they take their time unlike the Muslims the Muslims take an impulsive decision and then suffer the consequences for years to come thirdly they if if heated they will counter-attack so their warfare is not loose and run away no it's going forward and going backwards in a battlefield and this gives them room to maneuver fourthly Africa says and they are the best for a poor and an orphan you go to the jungles of frickin you will find a missionary staying there for 27 years on his bike wearing his shorts and khaki or green suit his wife is also there documenting the language of a tribe of 500 people that no one knows their language they gave it alphabets and they documented and what are they doing 27 years you leave all things of enjoyment city area will feel feeding the hungry with during their illnesses we're teaching the children they have a lot of charity and share a Batman sweat may Allah have mercy on his soul one of the great pioneers of Kuwait told us a lot of what he had seen over there and our glasses and a fifth characteristic that is beautiful and that is in addition to the other four is that they prevent their kings from transgression the Christians would prevent their rulers from transgressing they will take him to court they will impeach him they will drag him in an investigation if he lied under oath or if he cheated or if we did this and that they have no problem with this now the Prophet as he gave us is Abu Salam the glad tidings of fighting the indians the christians are the romans in constantinople he also told us that we will fight the moguls of course this took place when centuries ago the prophet salallahu alaihe wasalam said the last hour would not come unless you fight with people whose face is our like hammered shield their faces are like hammered shields and the last hour would not come until you would fight against those wearing shoes of hair what kind of shoes do the Moghuls wear from the skins of their animals they have small eyes broad snub noses and their faces are like hammered shields and we know what the Moghuls did to the civilization of iranian when they invaded about that when they invaded Egypt when they invaded the whole area and destroyed the thousands and thousands of literature in the libraries of Baghdad which contains so much knowledge they threw it in the Euphrates until the water turned into black because of the ink that it was written in a century or so before an moon one of the caliphs of the Abasi era used to give translators weight in gold if he translated a book into Arabic so they used to go to the Greeks take their philosophy take anything that needed to translate they translated they bring it to him he makes them standing on the scale and he puts gold in it and he gives it to them it was a fruitful business but it led to so much knowledge coming into Islam good and bad because it's philosophy it's a twisted mystery they just anything so we fought the moguls and have build up where are the moguls now there are Muslims no not China it's a derby Jon Cassar hey Stan Jurgis Stan it's Asia where they were all under the siege and power of Russia old Soviet Union they're all Muslims masha'Allah we have from them albahari and Muslim all these great scholars of Islam okay part of the signs of the Day of Judgment is the false prophets the prophets entered a salat wa salam the day of judgment or the hour would not come until imposter Liars approximately 30 of them all claiming to be prophets of Allah in another hadith the Prophet said I serve in my own map there will be 27 impostor and Liars claiming to be prophets among them will be for women for women will claimed prophethood and I am the seal of the prophet hood and there is no prophet after me and this is an essential part of Islam to believe that there is no profit no messenger after the prophet of allah salallahu alaihe wasalam at the time of the Prophet Ali Saleh to Sam there was an impostor someone claiming to be a prophet who was he mouselina I look at that who killed him anyway why she would give them a price there's no prices who's where she worshiped the happy is the slave of hand-built route back who killed handsome with a spear and after a few years he accepted Islam he came and apologized to the prophet alayhi salatu salam and the Prophet told him I forgive you but don't show me your face I'm a human being don't show me your face you can so the man went until he heard of josé Lima and the war went between the Muslims and the words of apostasy when the Prophet died Ursula a lot of the Muslims apostatized and abandoned Islam among them is Bama Hanifah in the center of Arabia in nation so they went to fight with them and to try to bring them back to Islam why she said I killed the best of people on earth after the Prophet SAW was just Hamza today I will kill the worst of people so he went and he with the same spear managed to kill a Muslim and cata also there was an ice wet and rainy see who appeared at the time the Companions ceejai also she was a woman who claimed prophethood but then came back to Islam and hamdulillah at the time of the Tapani there was a lotta attakathi and a century ago approximately came a man called mirza Adi hamid river se hace he was a Shia he learned sufism Shiism where else other than Iran and he became popular among his followers and he claimed to be a prophet after the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and he invented this religion of baha ism' so then follow his followers are known as the Baha'i and he is called in their elegant as the bath the door and they are so few there so negligible nobody pays any attention to them later on came Mirza Ghulam Ahmad and he is the founder of the idea Nia also known as Ahmadiyya now this is a deviant cult the vast majority of Muslim scholars worldwide consider him as a kafir and those who follow him they consider him to be a prophet this is HD and okay so they considered him to be a prophet this is why all the scholars of Islam considered them deviant and disbelievers he said that there is no jihad anymore because who invented his cult supported it the British colonizers and they said that the best way to counter attack the Muslims and make them accept what we are doing is by invent this new religion and tell them that you have to have your allegiance to the crown of the queen and this is why you find a lot of peace at the end E's are doing the same thing he changed hatch and cancelled it and made his followers go to Padian and perform Hajj there he gives similar attributes to a lot of that to the humans and he believes in reincarnation he attributes a son to allah azza wajal and he claims that he himself the this miserable damned he claims that to be a son of allah there are Mahamaya who do he considers that there is no seal for the prophethood anyone can become a prophet and the biggest supporter of the pad Yanni's and the ACMA DS is Israel they have centers and they finance them and they allow them to or empower them to make a yearly publication and an annual and monthly etc I've been once I think to London and they have this big huge center that looks so much like a message it not attended by a single person it's just a monument there because it is supported by all enemies of Islam okay now we're in page what [Music] done well really page nine so anyway progressing and have within that almost forty pages left right before we go on do we have any questions just in a change of scenery so that we don't any have a routine any questions sisters brothers continue although they don't even want to give me a five-minute please yellow managed this is science of the hour the Prophet said that is salat-u-salam in the hadith of gibreel when he asked about the hour Jibril said when you've been asked about the Prophet said malmö sworn we are on a minister the one who's being asked is not more knowledgable of it than the one who's asking so he asked about the signs he said then tell me about its science the Prophet said Isis on the slave girl will give birth to her mistress or master and you will see the barefoot naked destitute herdsmen the Bedouin competing and constructing lofty buildings now this is so clear that it fits like a glove what does it mean that a slave girl will give birth to its mistress or its master what interpretation is that when the map of Islam is so widely spread a man would have a lot of slave girls concubines and we know that in Islam it is permissible to have intimacy for a man only with his wife always come to mind if you buy them now this causes or raises question marks so what do you mean by come to mind slave slave girls slavery is against human rights on Geneva Convention number one two five seven eight this is I just made it now but giving numbers you know give you a lot of credibility who cares sube so what to do slavery is in Islam slavery was in all religions before Islam it was practiced by the Romans by the Persians by the Christians by the Jews it's mentioned in their Bibles so why look at Islam as inferior or something that of an innovation but unlike all other religions Islam has one source of slavery and that is captives of war of non-muslims while in other religions still today you can have slaves by buying them lend someone money he doesn't pay off take his children you go to Cambodia to Vietnam you buy four three four hundreds of slave the father is just have to he has to sell and the outcome of slavery there are so many branches you swear by Allah and you break your oath free slave you have intimacy in the daytime of Ramadan with your spouse free asleep you kill someone by mistake create sleep you make mehar with your spouse free a slave and the list goes on and on and on so Islam doesn't support slavery it shows you how to get rid of slaves but it solves an existing problem Muslims have a war with non-muslims it's inevitable we don't have Gaunt animals we don't have concentrating their content concentration camps we can't have jails without ends so this is a win-win situation a slave is sold to a family lives among them sees this lab without knowing it he accepts Islam after few weeks house end of story now I've saved him from Hellfire after few weeks free oneself I'm gonna free him because I've done a sin that needs explanation now for a girl to be a concubine this is also means of salvation if she was pregnant and gave birth to a child because she is the mother of a free child she cannot be sold she cannot be inherited she stays as she is until her master dies or he frees her but he cannot do anything else with that so her child what freed her for life so it's a blessing to her or not definitely is a blessing so when the map of Islam spread why the Prophet is telling us that part of the signs of the hour that a slave girl would give birth to her missmiss or master because now he is actually owning his own mother because he's a free master of the palace and off the wealth other interpretations say that the man who owned this slave and got the child of her went against the slab and shoulder which is Haram and the money's Haram and the transaction is invalid and later on few years later without knowing it her son buys her so he becomes what the master of his own mother and so on the scary thing is when the Prophet said are in salat wa sallam said you will see the barefoot naked destitute hurts then competing and constructing lofty buildings as I was driving to the Masjid we came from an area and all of a sudden in front of me I saw like ten high-rises immediately I said to Pamela okay I have high-rises in Southie I've seen them in Dubai I've seen them everywhere but sometimes it just clicks so high buildings which the prophet alayhi salatu salam distract to us nowadays in the arab world what are they competing in building the fastest fighter plane or the biggest missile or the nanotechnology in curing cancer cancer cells and stem cells or the DeLuca's they're competing in who has the highest riser is it bush - or is it the kingdoms tower and jet the hooch is to be built it's about three meters higher and they're learning another one I think somewhere in Singapore that is ten meters higher they're competing in nonsense why because they don't have the essence of Islam they have the name yes we are proud of the label but the essence of true Islam we don't have this Allah knows and says in the Quran in this chapter of unity put the hypocrites Allah says and when you look at them their bodies please you and when they speak you listen to their words they are as blocks of wood propped up they think that every cries against them they are the enemies so be aware of them this is the Quran Allah is telling us about the hypocrites now we may fall under this category when we try to boast about things are worthless what does it matter if we have the biggest bicycle in the world I lived in that bicycle by the way the biggest bicycle in the world is next to my home Hajis completed them and they come in the hundreds and thousands why they coming teaching them what are they doing and I asked and they said oh this is a bicycle or father Adam he came looking for how wa for even the greatness we have my cemetery in Jeddah called the cemetery of Eve Oman aha one graveyard and they said that she was buried there and they joke about people what benefit did it bring the Muslims when we have the biggest largest water fountain in the world who will it feed who will it benefit the Muslims are diverted from their true problems they are delusional about the proper meaning of success prosperity this is what Muslims should think about one would say ok but we rich we can afford it this is one of the signs of the Day of Judgment the profit Center in Seoul Abu Salam count 6 before the Day of Judgment one of them is that the wealth is so much that you give a man a hundred Dina and he is not pleased with it in another hadith the Prophet said give in charity for there will come a time when a man walks around with his charity trying to give it to someone and every time he gives it to someone this person says if you yesterday we would have accepted it but now we have no need for it there will come a time when prosperity is everywhere and people will not accept charity 100 dinars you give it to a man and he is not pleased do you find this today so many people who come and ask you for money the dinner here is not similar to your dinner don't be happy the dinar at the time of the Prophet Elisha - Salam is equivalent to four point two five grams of gold four grams of gold and approximately two hundred one hundred and fifty dollars one D now he is given a hundred of them and he is not pleased nowadays people come share home I'm in trouble I'm in difficulty okay here is a hundred dinner this is a thousand two hundred reals in my currency that's a lot is it what is this this doesn't do anything subhanAllah now with this it tells you it doesn't do anything a poor person you give him five free else than B us what do you not I cannot buy a pack of cigarette in this you know how much sickness cost and that was me this is nothing so this is exactly what is happening but there will come a time where it was it is prevalent everywhere money is there and this is not a good sign part of the signs of the Day of Judgment is the hadith where the Prophet said are they saw Austin am said the number of things among them is giving Salam to individuals so you are in a gathering a man works in and says Shahi mad Salam alikoum and does not give Salam to everyone of the modernist road happened when he was there and someone came and said I said my they come about the black man and he neglected everyone else I'm not talking about shaking hands the proper way of saying is assalamu alaikum then you go to a bar by man or two I met or Thomas Road and say how are you share how this is okay but two specifically single outward person this is among the signs of the day of judgment also the spreading of Commerce is one of the signs that the Prophet told us there will come a time that everybody deals in trade and nowadays the vast majority of Muslims if not dealing in drop shipping which I get hundreds of questions about they deal with e-commerce so they buy from Amazon from other websites and they sell some of them even travel to Arabia to buy fake jewelery and go and sell it elsewhere or like myself come to Kuwait and I buy a Kuwaiti dress I do this by the way but not now this visit is strictly business but I do this I come and buy the stache' of women and I give it to my girls and they make good business of it and this is also part of the signs of the day of judgment when we say part of the signs of the day of judgment doesn't mean that it's prohibited be careful don't think that this is a warning because at the end of the day said okay how us might as well sit back and die everything is this is sign of their judgment this and this and this no the Prophet told us that there will come a time when women help their spouses in trade and the best of traders are women seriously they can convince you and they can convince their gender as well they're good in marketing they know what sells and they have a good eye for making profit also part of the science of that we often see the signs of approaching of the day of judgment is severing of kinship that the prophet mentioned that is awesome and each one of you must have at least one of his kinship that he doesn't speak to the reasons and justifications are endless why don't you talk to your cousin Elijah he did not invite me to his daughter's wedding and I got angry and this is disrespectful what about you your uncle my uncle said bad things to my father and they are not on good terms so I said with my connect my kinship with him and with his sons and with his whole entire family but this is not your fight this is your father's fight so even though he didn't do anything back to me but I have to do this dad why are you saving your kinship will I my uncle's wife did black magic did you see that no but I can feel it subhanAllah and it goes on and on and on and we all claim that we are proper Muslims the Prophet said I sir he who serve as his kingship will not enter paradise full stop you will not enter paradise but I pray I fast I give charity I attend this ha ha ha awesome sorry I can't help you the Prophet said you silver kingship no no camel so you have to go into your contact list check every one of your cousin's sin gender of course don't go and call your cousin sister and this for you guys damn kitchen no it's not kitchen this how about you go and see who you sip it giving them a call send them an SMS send them a gift do something to show how yeah I need a hard you're trying ok what the signs of the Day of Judgment is when the means of measurement are interrupted and not accurate what do you mean when scales become disrupted what are the means of evaluating things nowadays it should be for either shouldna what is Halab we will do it what is how we will stay away from it this is the norm nowadays this norm has been diverse how do I know that this is halal or Haram crunchin know it depends on what the culture says it depends on what the people of influence say and this means that the whole concept of Islam submission to Allah as evidence surrendering your will to allah azzawajal is gone what does the Prophet say on his lobster in an authentic hadith the Prophet said salallahu alaihe wa do salmon there will come years of deception upon the people where a liar is believed and a truthful person is accused of lying when a person of betrayal will be trusted and a trustworthy person would be accused of betrayal and when the way Buddha would speak so the company said well what is the ROI you know this is a new word for us so the Prophet said it is a silly man a man who has no value speaking about Affairs about the affairs of the Ummah nowadays this fits as a glove every single word of it so years of deception we are living in years of deception at the moment when people of truth when scholars when honest people speak the media says that they are liars they are extremists they are this they are that and they discredit people who are truthful and when Liars speak the media highlights this and says that this is a fact that no one can challenge and we know that this person who's speaking is the biggest liar on earth when people who are known to be teachers and who betray the confidence and the individuals they even trust and they're given even honest names such as Sharif or a chef names of dignity in our and they are the biggest cheaters when the people that should be trust worthy who are trusted we know them to be students of knowledge people of piety of righteousness never ever caught them red-handed lying or stealing or cheating yet we refuse to make them assume positions in leadership of the community of companies etc then we have a problem and away boom on the silly man who has no value speaking in affairs of the OMA is this happening now who represents the OMA who represents a community where is their education what is what are the results that they can put forward you asked me for my CV I give you my CV then you might be impressed you may not be but it's a good CV those who speak about the uma that we should do this we must not do that we have that they take decisive decisions that impact the whole community the whole country are they worth while are they qualified then this is what's happening among the signs of the Day of Judgment the Prophet told the sorry salat-u-salam about tyranny about oppression about volume he said that at the end of time there will be men with whips like the tails of cows they go in the anger of Allah and they come back in the anger of Allah who are these these are the people of security these are the soldiers these are the people who control as I say riots we see them all over the median men of the police of army battering people have seen this in Kashmir with sticks hitting people like well by worse than animals what is this this is what the Prophet as is warning us of coming and this is not only in Kashmir but is also in so many Muslim world we see this in the bigger the media doesn't cover it you see that slapping innocent people hitting them sticks with shoes kicking them brutally treating them in and inhumane way and this is what the Prophet is telling us a little after Sarah among the things that the Prophet warned us of would be the uplifting of knowledge the consumption of intoxicants the white spreading of zina as for the uplifting of knowledge what is meant by this every day we find that the amount of Islamic knowledge among the Muslims is going down and the Prophet told the Salus awesome that Allah does not extract knowledge from the chests of men today I know tomorrow it will go it Elijah that uplifts knowledge by the death of scholars 20 years ago 30 years ago actually 35 years ago Allah blessed me that every single day I used to call three scholars they're all dead Shelton bass she had been attending and Sheikh Abubakr Raja Sahib who died couple of weeks ago and by the way his staff seal I thought that a seal is one of the greatest and easiest contemporary tough seeds I don't know if it's in available in English or not but it is so easy and so comprehensive and has good knowledge that if you know Arabic I advise you to buy it's for big volume but very very easy it's much easier than going into any caffeine and it's also reliable I used to call these three chefs on daily basis I used to have a yellow pad and I write questions throughout the day anything I read I don't understand I give them a call nowadays who would you call Ghostbusters doesn't work this is a big problem if you have an issue you want to ask a scholar who do you go no one I personally cannot get hold of any of the Grand move teas in my country the top scholars and the supreme scholars can't they don't answer the phone I can travel to their cities what about the masses of the Ummah 100 million 150 million in the Arab world who will they call they will call Tom Dick and Harry imam of the masjid someone like me who comes on TV oh is she what do you know obvious knowledge you're asking about something that is decisive in your life I divorced my wife share this is a fifth time so can we go back or not what's okay just said okay you might be living in Haram she said what do you know about this  day before yesterday a brother was calling me from Egypt he said share this question that question five six questions and I said okay share Allah you have done so much benefit to me me no more award you Mia rectify your affairs Mel giving duck ship just can I ask you a question what's your name well like I said your your she is and you're asking me questions and you don't know who I am and Ayatollah Khomeini what do you expect Hawaii how then you ask someone in religion when they don't know their background when you don't know their credibility apologize share but someone I trust directed me to your number said what if you have a problem with your spine and you have to go and operate a neurosurgeon and I give you the name of my nearest mechanic would you call him Genosha I'd have to go and check same thing in religion the problem is that nowadays the scholars are fewer and fewer and fewer they're so rare and this is how Allah uplifts the religion by a bike the death of the scholars I think we stop which Allah force a lot and we will continue after the mother let me show that you've stayed awake"
