  "title": "Shirk in my School! What can I do?",
  "transcript": "uh rafath or rafat says I work in a school in Saudi Arabia an international school or a school that belongs to a particular country and in our school assembly uh it begins with the recitation of the Quran but after that there will be some two or three items like news uh thought and there will be a dance then it ends with this country's national anthem which we all know is full of shik it deeply hurts me that we are beginning with the Quran and ending with shik so I request you to please guide me in this regard moreover our school uh principles uh are mostly Muslims please guide me this is a big problem now the school is in Saudi Arabia but we know that some schools that belong to different countries so you have uh uh an American School a British school Indian School banglades school SRI lanan schools they H they they have their own curriculums because they follow their embassies and most of these practices are governed by the management so to begin their day with a recitation of the Quran this is not part of the Sunnah but if it is a reminder of the Quran and the people uh the students the pupils that is and the students would would hear the Quran this is inshallah okay a reminder of Hadith that's beautiful some news uh uh Clips saying that this happened and this uh took place so and so okay this is in the early morning then to have a dance now this is a an issue this is not part of Islam and to have the national anthem of that country which includes shik words in it so praising the gods or praising the land or saying that we worship the land or whatever this is unacceptable totally now if the principal is Muslim then he should stop this immediately because he's a Muslim first before being uh a citizen so you do not accept anything that goes against Quran or Sunnah if you're a Muslim otherwise leave your religion and follow something else because you cannot have both at the same time either you believe or you disbelieve and this is a big problem not not only in your school uh uh rafath but it is a problem in the Muslim world when you have those who are Muslim by name controlling places agencies companies uh Ministries Etc and they do not Implement Islam in some cases they are more more against Islam than the enemy of Islam so you probably find someone who is a Christian but he is not as evil as that pretending to be a Muslim because they want to be more Roman than the Romans themselves and this is a problem in inferiority complex that they have and it would never go until they feel that they've satisfied their masters the Muslims should abide by the Quran and Sunnah there's nothing wrong in being patriotic there's nothing wrong in loving your country as long as you follow the Quran and Sunnah but if your country tells you to do something that is forbidden that Allah tells you it's Haram what would you choose to love and obey your country or to love and Obey Allah and the Prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam this is a true Fork of the road and your decision would determine whether you go to paradise or hell so I advise whoever runs such institutions to fear Allah now you are on your chair in your high position and it's not going to last nothing last on Earth nothing lasts at all except Allah's face and don't be delusional you will leave your post soon and all what would remain for you in your grave are your good deeds so if you do bad Deeds for a raise or to please your Masters or uh for the people to praise you then you have a problem because Allah Asel would not be pleased with you and hence he would make everyone displeased pleased with you he would be displeased with you and you will find the wrath of that in this life and in your grave and also in the here after so we should fear Allah Asel uh and do our level best"
