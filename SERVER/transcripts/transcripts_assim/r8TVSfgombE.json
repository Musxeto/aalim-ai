  "transcript": "Misbah from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Sheikh in congregation the Imam forgot the surah which he was reciting and someone from the congregation recited the surah for him to make him remember. Is it permissible? No problem to remind or to correct the Imam but not to recite the whole surah. This is not the right thing to do and the Imam shouldn't even entertain this. He should have immediately go for ruku and make an end to that. Ameen."
