  "transcript": "the one who dies by the plague is a martyr the one who dies drowning is a martyr the one who dies with pleurisy it's an illness that comes in the intestines in the side the person who dies with the stomach disease so this can also include cancer the one who dies in a burning house who dies in a fire the one who dies in a collapsed building and the woman who dies while in labor or while in the state of pregnancy all of those are martyrs in the sight of Islam also in another hadith the Prophet tells us that the person who dies with the illness of the lungs tuberculosis is also a martyr so all of these are martyrs providing that they do not complain that they are patient and tolerant until they die this severity of pain and calamity that afflicts them qualifies them with the Allah's mercy and grace to be martyrs and when we say that they are martyrs we do not give them all the treatment of a martyr who dies on a battlefield we do not wash a Shaheed on the battlefield we do not shroud him except with the clothes he was wearing we do not offer salat al janazah the funeral prayer we bury them but these seven we deal with them and treat them like everyone else we wash them with shroud them we pray for a funeral prayer and we bury them among those who are classified as marked at the side of Allah those who defending their wealth their livelihood their families their honored their religion all of these are considered to be martyrs the Prophet said Ali salat wa salam whoever dies defending his wealth he's a martyr whoever dies defending his family someone is attacking your wife your sister your daughter you fight him off and you die you are a martyr whoever defends his religion he's a martyr and whoever defends himself he is a martyr and by saying that you die in the process you do not go to the far extreme and kill rather it's an Islamic principle that you ward off evil from the minimum to the maximum not the other way around so someone wants to take your money you don't kill him straight away rather you try to defend it defend your money to fight him off to impair him and if not possible except by killing him then you kill him because he's oppressor and you have the right to defend yourself the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam was once asked by one of his companions o prophet of allah a man comes wants to take my money the Prophet said RA his salat WA Salam remind him of Allah remind him of hellfire so the man says o prophet of allah if he does not remember the Prophet said then seek the help of the Muslims around you and the man said o prophet of Allah if there were no Muslims around me the Prophet said then seek the assistance and the help of the authority of the ruler the master if the ruler is far away and is not accessible the Prophet said alayhi salat wa sallam then fight for your wealth defending it until you are either one of the martyrs of the hereafter or you preserve and safe keep your wealth I say what you hear and I seek Allah's forgiveness for you and for me so ask allah azzawajal to forgive your sins"
