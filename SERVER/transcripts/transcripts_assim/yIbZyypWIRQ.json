  "transcript": "abu hamza from egypt he says he needs some motivational word he resigned his job in an interest-based bank and may all praise be to allah azzawajal that saved him from working and facilitating riba because it is totally prohibited to work for an interest-based bank that solely deals in long-term and short-term term loans with interest this is ripa nobody doubts this unfortunately nobody talks against this nowadays and we have been indulging in it so deep that you have even people legitimizing mortgages and borrowing from banks and in financial institutions with reba over a loan and student loans etc so alhamdulillah allah has saved abu hamza from such a fate because we know that allah has cursed the one who deals in riba the one who gives riba the one who witnesses riba and the one who registers the clerk's riba he wants motivational words of encouragement because all of his family are against him and this is understandable especially in families that don't know what islam is don't know what shariah is and if you ask them straightforward question would we want to follow sharia or your whims and desires they would do this and say who wants sharia alhamdulillah you know your answer you ask yourself if you were at the time of the prophet salatu sinha and he was alone and he did not have any supporters he was spreading the message of islam would you take his side and tolerate and endure the torture physical and mental that the idol worshipers are inflicting upon you or would you quit and say nope this is too difficult for me i'd rather be with the gang rather than face such calamities and hardship of course you would be with the prophet salaam so praise allah azza that you're a muslim praise allah that you live in a muslim country praise allah that you don't need such a haram job and you will have other alternatives that are halal inshallah and pay you better bid but always remember when people don't talk against what you're doing when they keep on just praising you there's something wrong if the enemies of allah praise me if the hypocrites praise me if the liberals praise me if the openly sinners praise me i should reflect on my image in the mirror and say what's cooking good looking there's something wrong why are they praising me because it is the sunnah the way of allah azza in his creation when you walk the straight path you have to suffer this is your trial this is your test in life so alhamdulillah you have to remain steadfast because allah azza is testing your iman allah is testing you whether you will remain on the straight path or go back on your heels allah says in the beginning of surat al-anka al-iflam and do people think that they will be let alone to claim that we are believers without them being tested nay we have tested those before them and we shall know allah shall see whether they are saying the truth or they are liars whether they'll pass their tests or not but testing is inevitable each and every individual among our the human race and the jinn they are he is being tested some are tested with wealth some are tested with poverty some are tested with health some are tested with illness and sickness some are tested with security and easy going in their affairs some are tested with calamities and hardship etc so be steadfast and allah will make a way out for you"
