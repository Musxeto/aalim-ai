  "transcript": "uh so my question is that sh is it permissible for a Muslim woman to ask when the reason uh with the reason that her husband had started to find a second wife for himself and she did not mention uh any uh point in the in her marriage contract while marrying him first of all a woman asked asking for divorce from her husband without a legitimate reason is a major sin the prophet saidat any woman who asks divorce from her husband without a legitimate reason would not find the fragrance the smell of paradise of Jenna and the fragrance of Jenna is so strong that from a distance of 40 years travel you can find find it so this shows that it's a grave sin so it's a major sin secondly a man taking a second wife is not a legitimate reason for divorce otherwise all the Muslims would have divorced their wives no woman on earth is usually happy and jubilant because her husband took a second wife you won't expect her to go to her husband am I invited for the wedding no she's not going to dance in your wedding of course she's jealous she's sad but this is life and it is not a legitimate reason for divorce as long as the man is a real man he's providing for you he puts a roof on your head and food on your table you should be grateful to allaha now is he Flawless of course not he's he has his own shortcomings and flaws but who's perfect no one however if a woman says the jealousy that I have is not natural and it is so bad that I am unable to fulfill his natural uh uh um duties that he may want from me I can't give him his rights and this is not something I can fight I I've tried but I can't if this is the case in this case yes she has all the right to ask for as mentioned in the Hadith when a woman came to the prophet and he said she said to him I want to leave my husband and he says why is there anything wrong with him she said nothing is wrong with him he's a perfect guy but I hate kufur after belief after Ean Scholars interpreted this phrase or this sentence by saying she hates being unable to fulfill his rights and to do her duties towards him because of the resentment she has which is something that she can't fake or pretend to do so the prophet said Alam return to him his garden or his farm that he gave to you as a dowy and she willingly did so and the prophet separated between them with so if this is the case yes you can ask for without any problem inshallah"
