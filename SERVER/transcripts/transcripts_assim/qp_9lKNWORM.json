  "transcript": "Shiha from bangladesh.   He says, 'is there a difference between \nAllah's Will and Allah's Commands?'   This is a technical terminology that may confuse \npeople. Allah says in the Qur'an, [Arabic], 'Allah   does not order people to do bad things', or \n'sinful things', or 'openly sinning.' This is   well known. However, nothing happens in \nthis world except by the Will of Allah.   Even the people who sin, they sin with the Will \nof Allah overwhelming them and giving them the   ability to sin because, you cannot sin without \nthe Will of Allah. Allah did not force you.   Allah ordered you not to sin. \nWhen you come to a crossroad,   here it says 'going to the city', here it says \n'going to over the cliff, watch out and you'll   die'. If you go left and you fall off the cliff \nand die, I told you not to do so. 'So yeah, yeah,   you could have put a block and prevented me from \ndoing this.' Why would I? Life is a test. So Allah   created us. Allah gave us free will. However, \nAllah's knowledge is far superior than ours,   so Allah knows exactly what we will be doing. \nAnd we cannot do it if Allah did not Will it,   create it, write it, knew about it and allowed it \nto happen. However, Allah told us 'Don't do this.'   Allah does not love sin. Allah, Azza wa Jal, \ndoes not love shirk. Allah does not endorse   or promote anything that goes against what He had \ntold us about. So yes, Allah does not command it,   but it happens with the Will of Allah and \nwith the creation of Allah, the Almighty."
