  "transcript": "is asking about the ruling on in Islamic insurance basically speaking Islamic insurance when it was first introduced about 30 or so years ago the scholars gathered and they gave the verdict that this type as portrayed to them is permissible and what is that type it is like a group of people joining forces let's say a thousand person agree on allocating a wallet apart where they contribute a thousand riyals for a year so a thousand multiplied by a thousand this is a million riyals in this part and they agree that anyone who has a car accident or his house is burnt or he has to pay something for an accident that took place they will compensate that person and they would consider that this money allocated the 1 million riyals now it's for charity it's in the sense of helping one another only for the 1000 people and that is it so people would have a car accident or the house would be burnt or a burglar breaks in and they give this fifty thousand ten thousand one thousand depending on their meat once the money is finished they've spent the whole million even if it was in the first or second week if someone comes in and says listen someone crashed into my car and eat five thousand reals to fix it and we say tough luck we don't have anything in the in the pot or in the wallet so yes but I gave you a thousand realities listen you contributed you did not do this as a form of commercial insurance where we have to pay you the money is over if this is the case then this is halal insurance why because it is a form of collaboration on virtue and on and on good what's happening at the moment unfortunately to my knowledge maybe I don't have sufficient knowledge but to what I know is not like this they're having corporate corporates running the show they're giving high salaries for the management for the CEO for the VPS for the managers etc they are utilizing the money in the pot and investing it and this is not what we agreed for we agreed to give the money so that we would help one another so they're investing part of it and they are offering normal insurance services what happens in in the middle of the year if the money ran out if we have floods and all of a sudden everybody wants a financial aid so we give them from what they've contributed and the money runs out what happens they say we will borrow then this is exactly what the commercial insurance companies are doing said yeah yeah but we will borrow on the on good terms no interest so they claim and it goes on and on so what I see it the way I see it that there isn't any such thing as correct Islamic insurance at the moment especially those run by the corporates and a large social knows best"
