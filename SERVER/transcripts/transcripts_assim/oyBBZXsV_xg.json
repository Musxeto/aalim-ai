  "title": "Fortress Of Muslim 48 Dua when afflicted by calamity Dua when closing eyes of deceased Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign um the following chapter is about supplication for one afflicted by a calamity in the quran allah mentions death to be among the calamities so death is definitely a calamity to be reckoned with so what to say hadith 154 to allah we belong and unto him is our return o allah recompense me for my affliction and replace it for me with something better what is the origin of this the origin of this hadith is um the mother of the believers may allah be pleased with her when her husband died she wanted to wail to cry to weep but she remembered this beautiful dua that i've just narrated to you because the prophet said aslam whoever says such a dua allah the almighty would substitute him with something better so when her husband died he was among the first to migrate to medina a great companion of the prophet he was the brother of the prophet so she said to herself i will say this dua but who can be better than abu salama she said this dua with conviction guess what after her edda or waiting period was over for months and 10 days the prophet proposed to her and she apologized by saying i'm an old woman and i have children and i am extremely jealous so the prophet said assalam to her i'm older than you your children are in my custody and i'll take care of them and i'll ask allah to take away your jealousy and she agreed and the prophet married her this shows you the power of this dura that we all must memorize in the moment we have a car accident the moment we have a calamity the moment we have a problem i'm sitting in the home one of the grandchildren drops an expensive vase and it shattered into pieces what is the first thing i do i curse the grandson i go and shout at his mother no i just said alhamdulillah nothing happened that's it and i believe that allah would substitute me with something that is better the following chapter when closing the eyes of the deceased the prophet the name of the deceased so forgive abdullah forgive ahmed forgive fatima the one that i'm closing the eyes of and raise his rank among the rightly guided so i'm asking allah to raise his rank and be a successor to whom he left behind meaning he left orphans he left children he left a widow he left people who were dependent upon him so oh allah be his successor to them and forgive us and him o lord of the worlds make spacious his grave and illuminate it for him when did the prophet say this dua when abu salam died and he entered upon him he found him looking to the sky of course he was dead and the prophet explained sallallahu alaihi wasallam to us that when the soul is extracted and taken from the body the sight follows it meaning as it is being extracted you are looking at your soul coming out of your body and then you die and this is why your eyes are open so the sun is to close the eyes and to say this beautiful dua in order for the deceased to benefit why because the prophet told us that when a person dies the angels are filling up the room saying amin for whatever you make dua so if a wailing woman comes and starts slapping herself and tearing her hair and clothes and saying oh may i be cursed may i be the one instead of him may allah take me instead angels say so be careful of what you say and what you wish for and this is why a person has to have this always at the back of his head not to say anything that may be a cause of regret for him this is all the time we have until we meet next time i leave foreign [Music] foreign"
