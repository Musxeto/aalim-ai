  "transcript": "is it correct for a Muslim to reply in the same manner to the one who abuses him whilst he is doing islah as far as when a person is doing islah or da the guidelines are given in the Quran Allah says in the Quran in chapter number 16 verse number 125 which means invite all to the way of thy Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching and argue with them and reason with them in the ways that the best and most gracious so as far as da is concerned or ISL is concerned we should do with and husna in ways that are best most gracious with beautiful preaching even if you're opposite person the Muslim or non-muslim while doing ISL dawa he gets angry he starts cursing he starts giving verbal abuse yet you should be kind and loving the way the prophet was and we seen the example of the Prophet that many a Time the non-muslims they troubled the prophet and we know the story that there was a lady who used to always throw dirt on the prophet whenever he used to pass by she used to throw dirt on him and one day when no dirt falls on him he's wondering how did this non-muslim lady didn't throw dirt so he went up to find out what's happened to her and there he realizes that she was sick so then he goes and he prays for her she was so happy that she accepts Islam the prophet did not retaliate in the same way and we find several such examples it's mentioned inkari Hadith number 6030 that once a Jew he comes and Wishes the prophet Assam alayum Assam alayum in Arabic means May death be on you and the prophet replies back on YouTube AA may Allah be pleased with her the wife of the Prophet she hears this and she gets very angry she tells to the Jew that may Allah's curse be on you may the wrath of Allah be on you and she starts getting angry so the prophet tells to her that you should be calm you should be humble you should not get angry so a she replies that did you hear what they told you so the prophet replies did you hear what I replied to them and my Dua would be accepted their Dua would not be accepted so this was the way the prophet dealt with the people it fur mentioned in s Muslim volume number four Hadith number 6280 that it's not proper for a person who s to invoke curses me a person who is Sincere that means it's not right for a Believer a believing Muslim to invoke curses on others invoke and speak rudely and verbal abuses Etc and it's mentioned had of Hadi number 2019 that a Believer should not invoke curses it's not correct for a Believer to invoke curses and that's for the prophet always said that when people get angry said that I have come as a mercy and blessing have not come as invoker of curses so here we realize that this was the example that we have to follow and as Allah says in the Quran in Surah aab chapter 33 verse number 21 that verily in the prophet is the most beautiful pattern of conduct so while doing dawa while doing Islam we should never get angry we should not retaliate we should win them more winning over is much better than rather than retaliating have to be fine soft and merciful for the answer"
