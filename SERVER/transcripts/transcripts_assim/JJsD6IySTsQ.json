  "transcript": "Medina from Germany. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. So how can one stop labeling people as kafir in their head since they believe they would commit kufr by not doing it? By looking at the mirror. Because if you have the audacity to label people as kafir without knowledge, without proof, then look at the mirror and recognize that you might be a kafir for doing such a thing and others may consider you to be a kafir for many things that you are doing without you knowing it. So it's a two-way game. Two can play this game. As Muslims, whenever I look at someone older than me, I feel envious because he had done so many good deeds I could not reach yet. And when I look at someone younger than me, I pity myself because he did not make as many sins as I have done or committed. So I always look little at myself. You're doing the opposite. You're boasting about your deeds thinking that you're the only one who's a Muslim and everybody else, everyone else is a kafir for one reason or the other. This would, which would probably reserve your seat in hellfire. You have to stop thinking like this and start to be modest and humble and express your poverty to Allah and think well of everyone else while thinking badly of your own flaws and shortcomings and Allah Azzawajal knows best."
