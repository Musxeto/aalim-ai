  "title": "Can we share posts of women with or without hijab if it has good content? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um so my question is uh many girls on social media they post themselves either they're wearing hijab or they're not wearing it like is it permissible for us to share what they post if it has um nothing wrong with it except the fact that they're not wearing it or they're posting themselves first of all the purpose of the hijab is obviously to conceal a woman from those who can not or who are not allowed to see her so posting her photos without the hijab certainly defies the purpose of hijab which means that this is something prohibited even if she posts her photos with hijab this is still not permissible because in so many proven cases the norm is within few months she will compromise her hijab little by little until she takes it off because a very important aspect a lot of the Muslims a lot of the people don't know about is that Fame kills a lot of Scholars di or normal people They just want to become known they want to be famous and in Arabic we have a saying that is beautiful with which goes like the love to be famous broke people's backs it killed them it injured them because it makes them do things just for the sake of recognition just for the sake of people following me I want more followers I want more attention and this what diverts a Muslim from the true path to the path of deviation I have to come with a up with a new gig so that people would share my post a lot I have to be more funny I have to say jokes I have to appear in jumpy Bungie is it Bungie jumping or do something outrageous so that people oh wow so women who start to put their feet or the foot on the path of such social media they are on the path of Destruction unfortunately now what is our role we're not doing this but a sister shared her photos with me so can I share it can I post it can I repost it of course not because Allah stated in the beginning ofah chapter 5 five collaborate upon virtue and righteousness and do not collaborate upon VI Vice and evil and Allah Asel Knows Best"
