  "transcript": "um I want to know about the morning and evening as car which we do so sometimes for example that 30 times along was for 33 times and uh and and three-time cool in the morning three times and we do sometimes I I forget the three three times sometimes I increase sometimes I decrease and I need to read it all over again so is it permissible or do we need to stick with the numbers like 33 times three times three times first of all Heidi you are confusing the morning at car with Fajr prayer at car the Fajr prayer of Carr is like any you say subhanallah 33 alhamdulillah 33 Allahu Akbar 33 and then you say once this is foreign and also after four prayers we say once now when Fajr or morning at car and evening at car we don't say subhanallah alhamdulillah this is only for four prayers but we say the three calls three times each I can combine both if I say my morning at car after performing Fajr prayer so instead of reciting one one one for Fajr prayer then three times for morning at car I can combine and just recite three olds three times and that would suffice likewise Ayatul Kursi once after every fourth prayer and once in the morning at car if I recite it once with both intentions that would suffice your question is what happens if I make a mistake do I repeat it all over again the answer is no alhamdulillah if you're doubtful whether you recited it two or three and you added one to make it three then actually you recited it four times there's no problem in that and Allah Knows Best"
