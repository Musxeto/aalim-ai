  "transcript": "uh one of the famous issues that usually happens in families when Distributing the wealth a lot of the men are infair are unfair and display a lot of Injustice especially in Arabia women cannot inherit the property is only for the family my name women will get married to someone else from another tribe from another country and he will not not have a share in my house in my property in my land so a lot happens of Injustice with women and this is Haram you cannot play around with inheritance of property just because you don't want other tribes other families to share your property when you die it's not your property anymore it belongs to the family how to distribute it is mentioned inaha the Ayah is very simple and the science of Al or is one of the first to be lost the first science to be lost among the umah is this science because rarely you will find people working in it and it needs practice rarely you find people asking you questions and and it's very mathematical very simple so if a person dies leaves only children no parents no spouse he leaves only children this is very easy the children inherit everything the division is two shares for the male and one share for the female end of story very simple he left a boy and a girl 2/3 for the boy one3 for the girl alhamdulillah okay what if he has a spouse ah if he has a spouse then the spouse gets one of two either she gets a quarter if he doesn't have any children or she gets 1/8 if she has if the the disease has children not from her from anyone else so a man dies leaving a wife and a boy and a girl the wife gets how much 1/8 and the rest is divided by three shares two for the boy one for the girl end of story so when we come to the issue of no he the deceased had Parents oh no problem so he had parents and he had a wife and he had a boy and had a girl no problem the wife gets 1/8 the father and the mother get one six one sixth and the rest is distributed between three shares two for the boy one for the girl this is an easygoing way what about if he did not have a boy he had only one girl okay no problem the Quran says if someone dies leaving one girl she gets half whoa the girl gets half yes okay if he did not have one girl he had one boy the boy gets everything everything if he did not have a father a mother and a spouse but if he had a father and a mother and a spouse we give them their percentage one six one six 1/8 and the rest goes to the Sun so in inheritance there are two ways of inheriting either by F or by how you translate this how do you translate L this F is a percentage and we have six percentages half and half of it third and half of it fourth and half of it these are the six percentages half who inherits with the half the daughter and no no not the wife the other one the husband when the wife dies leaving no children the husband gets half if she had children and she died the husband gets quarter so half is inherited by these two either one daughter or a husband who whose wife did not have any children half of it is what a quarter who inherits by a quarter huh the wife when when the husband does not have any children and the husband when the wife has children if she did not have children he would have half then we have this these are two huh half and half of it then we go to the number three which is one3 who gets one3 the parents the mother when the deceased has no children and one sibling only one brother or one sister he gets she gets onethird if he has more than one siblings automatically she gets one sixth which is half of the third the father gets 1/3 if he has no children and the rest but this is his F who gets one six the parents the mother if he has more than one sibling and the father if he has children because the father gets like the mother only one sixth anyone anything else one sixth P command sixth yeah these these are the two okay now the fifth percentage is what loan 1/4 one quarter and half of it so one quarter who gets one quarter the wife if the deceased husband does not have any children and the husband if the deceased wife had children who else nothing half of it is 1/8 who gets 1/8 the wife if no not she he if the husband the deceased husband had children then she gets only 1/8 noteworthy do you know what is the co-wife called in Arabic the co-wife if a man has two wives what is the second wife called in Arabic it's called what does means from harm why is she called because if a man has two wives each one of of them gets half of 1/8 so both share 1/8 but if she was alone she would get 1/8 for herself she has a she's harming her even after his death so she's sharing 1/8 if they were four they would share 1 18 so imagine the percentage this is why it's called in Arabic because in his life and after his death she does this to him these are the six percentages allocated in the Quran okay what did we say one we think I think we missed one huh half and quarter ah yeah yeah we we mixed it half and quarter 2/3 and a third there are 2/3 I did not mention a quarter I mentioned it twice yeah this is wrong half and a quarter 2/3 and a thir and quarter and an eighth 2/3 are given to whom no no son huh if they're left more than two or more daughters if a deceased dies and he has one daughter she gets what half if he dies and he has two daughters or more they get two3 of what he has left two3 they participate they uh uh take this much this is called f now others of the HS have what is known as or they inherit the remaining and who are these the sons the daughters the Father the siblings if he has no children and no father the uncles anyone who's related to him by name so the wife and the husband they inherit by percentage by the mother inherits by F either 1 six or 1/3 the daughters if there are no Sons they inherit by F half or 2/3 but if there is a son no they their percentage is gone they go by and so on so in a not this science is very nice and beautiful and easy little bit complicated but once you get the hang of it it becomes very easy for you to understand and Allah Knows Best"
