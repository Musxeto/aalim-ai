  "transcript": "so I have a question regarding the moon sighting on Ramadan because I know there's a lot of confusion between countries saying that some should follow Saudi Arabia moon sighting the most authentic opinion is that it is region related and this is theith in Muslim whereb Abbas may Allah be pleased with him and with his father after a whole month of detecting the moon in where the calipat is and that is in Syria he said that we follow our own moon sighting and you guys and the calipat follow your own moon sighting which means that it is re region related and he attributed this to the Sunnah so the Sunnah is that you guys follow your own moon sighting now some folk say that we in Britain could not do this because the vast majority of cases there are clouds that henders are sighting of the Moon and due to the amount of factions and difference of opinion among different sects Cults and masjids and Islamic centers it is difficult to unite the Muslims so some Scholars say that because of this situation in order to preserve the unity and due to the actual difficulty of citing the moon and this is not a one shot in a month that this is throughout the whole year due to clouds and difficulties of detecting and sighting the moon some would say that yes follow Saudi Arabia and I personally believe that if the religious Authority in UK the majority of them say that yes we will follow Saudi Arabia in that that would be fine inshallah and Allah Knows Best"
