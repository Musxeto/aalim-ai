  "transcript": "It's Brother Ammar from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Sheikh how are you doing? Alhamdulillah Rabbil Alameen. Sheikh my question is I was reading Surah Ra'ad in which there was the verse يحمو الله ما يشاء و يثبت و عنده أم الكتاب I was reading the Tafseer in which Sheikh Ibn Uthaymeen said that أم الكتاب is the لواء المحفوظ like the preserved tablet but nothing can be removed or added to the preserved tablet. So how do we understand this verse? JazakAllahu Khair. Wa Jazak. The preserved tablet has all what events going to take place till the end of time in the authentic Hadith. When Allah Azzawajal created the pen Allah said to it write. The pen said Oh my Lord what shall I write? And Allah ordered it saying write everything that's going to happen till the end of time. The Prophet says Alayhis Salaatu Was Salaam. And this was 50,000 years before Allah created the creation, the whole universe. It was before that by 50,000 years. So the preserved tablet has everything that Allah Azzawajal decreed that would happen till the end of time. Nothing is going to be erased from it and nothing can be added to it because this is Allah's knowledge, Allah's ability subhanahu wa ta'ala. Having said that the verse you recited and quoted يَمْحُوا اللَّهُ مَا يَشَاءُ وَيُثْبِتُ وَعِندَهُ أُمُّ الْكِتَابِ Allah Azzawajal has the ability and the power to erase whatever He wishes and confirms whatever He wishes. But whatever is in the preserved tablet this is fixed. So some scholars refer to the fact that at the beginning of the year there is predestiny. At the conception, the conceiving of the mother when she conceives her child in her womb when the child is 120 days there is predestiny or the divine decree that is written at that moment. This may be erased or may be changed but what's in the preserved tablet is fixed. How is this changed? Allah Azzawajal informs the angels that this person's lifespan is 65 years of age. So they write it 65 and they know that he's going to die when he's 65. While in the preserved tablet it is 70 but no one knows what's in the preserved tablet other than Allah. So the angels go business as usual that he's going to live for 65. However it is written down in the preserved tablet that this individual will call his kinship and connect to them and be kind to them. And that would be rewarded by prolonging his lifespan to 70 years of age. So all of a sudden because of his actions the angels are ordered to change it from 65 to 70. And then they know that because of his kinship activities and relationship Allah has blessed his age to be 70 so they change it into 70. But this was also mentioned and divinely decreed 50,000 years before Allah created the universe in the preserved tablet and I hope this answers your question. Thank you for watching!"
