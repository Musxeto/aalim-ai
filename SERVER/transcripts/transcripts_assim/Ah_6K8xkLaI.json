  "transcript": "as a Muslim how should we deal with pension I think he means what people call Social Security the pension is either mandatory that means you have no say in the money being deducted from your salary or it's voluntary like the 401K for example if it is mandatory meaning that I apply for a job whether in the government sector or in the private sector and without even asking me they deduct from my salary 9% 10% and they add on top of that something from their own in a fund whether it's government run or privately run whether it is halal or Haram if I object they say whether you like it or or not this is the ruling and the regulations everyone we must deduct this from him if this is the case in this case whatever you get from the pension after you retired or you um have a disability due to work related uh uh accident or whatever this is purely Halal for you to take no problem at all in the voluntary case this is not permissible why because I am out of my own will paying them money and it's like gambling let's assume I work for five years and I die I get a pension of so much to my uh uh uh heirs and to my family sometimes I may work for 40 years and then I die so they give my family those who are unmarried but if I don't have any remaining family the 40 years that I have invested so so-called investment is gone down the drain sometimes I work for 20 years and I save this much and I retire and I live after this 20 years for another 50 or 60 years and they're paying me every single month like six or seven times more than what I have initially invested this is gambling this is Haram money there's no doubt in that therefore the pension per se if it is mandated by the government Muslim government or cafir uh government regardless and it is a must that I can't have any say in it whether of approval or disapproval this is Halal for you to benefit from and if it is the voluntary type this is Haram and you're not allowed to contribute in it uh Muhammad sent us a question saying why is"
