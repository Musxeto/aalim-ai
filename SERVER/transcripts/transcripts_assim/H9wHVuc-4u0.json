  "title": "What is the reward of fasting the 6 days of shawwal? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "the most prominent ritual that people do in shawol is fasting the six days of Showa why the Prophet said Alice awesome whoever fasts Ramadan the whole month and follows that with six days of shawol Allah would reward him as if he had prayed as if he had fasted the whole year and another hadith because one deed is multiplied to ten so fasting six days of Shawwal is as if you had fasted sixty days to months and fasting Ramadan before that is as if you have fasted ten months and this is a full year now one of the benefits of fasting the six days of Showa is that it compensates whatever shortcomings you had done during fasting Ramadan and this is something well known in Sharia whatever things you miss in a fault whatever voluntary you perform would compensate for that which was missing"
