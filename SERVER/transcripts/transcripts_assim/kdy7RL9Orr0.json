  "transcript": "slark I know him al-hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen sallallahu sallim wa barik alaa Abdi he was early in Ameen nabina muhammad wa ala aalihi wa sahbihi many today we had a host an opportunity in al-madinah I'm a badass aramara alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh we go on to hadith number 15 the hadith of Ana's bin Malik may Allah be pleased with him and who will give us the honor of reading into Charla Rahman narrated an asymptomatic Allah be pleased with him whenever The Messenger of Allah may the peace of Allah be upon him when to answer the call of nature I along with another boy used to carry and Odawa that is a small container made from leather hide full of water and an Inasa that is spearheaded stick and the Prophet would use the water to Queen himself ananza is a short pier that the Prophet used to carry a lot with him it's called anneza and the word when it's written in Arabic is similar to anza the same four letters Naza and answer means a small goat so this word anneza the spear you find the number of hadith for example the Prophet Aslam whenever he used to pray they used to put in front of him another those who do not know fit do not know arabic well they would say they would put in front of him a small goat no it's not answer its high Naza now this is one of the etiquettes of answering the call of nature the Prophet used to go on is full of Salam and before answering the call of nature he would be assisted by and it's aromatic and a small boy and a young boy they would bring him this he Dawa Odawa is a container made of leather where it is full with water and in any container would do and why would honest do that because Ana's was the servant of the prophet alayhi salatu salam how much did he charge for serving the Prophet Isis allama month nothing why because his wise mother and his mother's name is Oh - right no it's not right this is the logical thing but honest mathematics mother is one of the greatest female companions her name is home to lame-o Mu Shu Lane she is the sister of haraam eben mill Han Han even min Han was of the Companions of the Prophet as some who were martyred in Burma Oona when he sent 70 of his companions to somewhere in the middle of Arabia to call people to Islam and one tribes leader he betrayed them and he well Harambee min Han was talking and introducing Islam to him asked and ordered someone from his tribe to come from behind him and stab him from the back like coward what did Haram agreement hand do he took the blood he put it on his face happily saying I have one by Allah the lord of the Kaabah I have one and he died as a martyr the man who killed him was shocked what is he talking about what kind of winning he's dying he's losing his wife his house his children and the man embraced Islam afterwards because he said that this is not from this world and he al hamdulillah embraced Islam after us anyway I'm so lame she gave her son who was 9 years old when the Prophet first came and she said o prophet of Allah ooh nice which is another name of Anna's but in a nice motherly way the profit our Asia for example what he used to call her ash so this is form of playing with the names so that people like it if you have for example two area you call her Judy Aisha you call her ish this form of names to make things a nice so she said o prophet of allah o nice a good servant a learned boy please take him look at this wise woman was she giving away her son no by Allah she wasn't she was investing and what of an investment this is to give your child to the mercy of the world so lala haria will sell them to be with him ten years learn from him go with him enter the house with him exit with him what kind of investment is this cool among the Muslims does not know Anna cinematic everybody knows Aliceville Malik may Allah be pleased with him so Anna's was serving the Prophet and he found great joy of this but from this heady we learned first that it is permissible for youngsters who are not slave to serve others it's permissible and as did it with the Prophet it's permissible and recommended to serve those who have status in Islam collars dignitary because serving them shows respect and our religion is built on respect if any Muslim practicing Muslim mashallah long beard shorts or big miss work and he is disrespectful to the elders even if he was the janitor even if he's the man who's cleaning the floor if you're disrespectful to him then you know that you're not a good Muslim if you are not having mercy to the children because they're younger than you you are not even a good practicing Muslim this is our religion it's built it's based on respect from this hadith we also learn that it is best to use water rather than hard substances you remember to clean yourself after urinating or defecating you have two processes one is called a stage mark and one is called East India is Tish Mar refers to cleaning yourself using hard substances tones pieces of wood toilet paper a piece of cloth all of these are under the category of a stage Mar and the condition is that these substances use can purify what do you mean I'll tell you if you bring a piece of glass and try to purify yourself can it purify no because it does not have a hard surface so it does not wipe no matter what you do it does not wipe it's so soft so clean it cannot help and that is why callers say to clean yourself it has to have a hard surface like a rock like tissues like cloth like would like something that would be able to clean you it's danger only happens with what with water so we know that this mod is there but we also know that East India is better how do we know because by the consensus of scholars it purifies better doesn't it it does definitely and callers say that from this hadith the Prophet Allah saw Sarah could have asked us to bring him three stones as in the hadith of Abdullah miswrote he said I went with the Prophet assuming he wanted to answer the call of nature so he told me to bring him three stones and not to have in them any bones or dung of animals so the Prophet may have asked and could have asked but did not which indicates that purification with water is far better now the question is what will we use the answer or Anitha hi NASA what will we use the aniseh for is going to answer the call of nature scholars say it is used to hide and conceal the figure of the Prophet Alistair Otto Salaam because if you have something Iraq and you hang a piece of cloth on it it will cover you so it will protect you from people not watching you remember we're talking about 15 centuries ago they did not have toilets they did not have public toilets they did not have even private toilets 15 centuries ago this was the case and so many times people come up with you mean say tejas and why do you waste your time speaking about easties mark about stones about hard substances do you think by any chance that life would continue like this as we know it no it will not there will come a time and this might not be so far away that all the fossil fuel that we have will go and will be all consumed then what alternative energy then what people will go back to wood and burning wood no electricity no civilization nothing and this is completely explained thoroughly in the hadith of sahem a Muslim when the Prophet is talking aracely's on about the Dajjal and when he's talking about the great battle al-mal hama al-kubra and when he talks about ya'juj and ma'juj gog and magog and bob whatever they called it the Prophet tells us that the people use their bows and arrows as fuel for fire for seven years meaning that they use this as fire and the Prophet told us about the ten horsemen who go to find fact about the jail when the Shaitaan tells them that the Dajjal is out the prophecies I know their names and their father's names and the color of their horses which means that they're not using any hammers or Humvees or planes or helicopters they're using horse back so we need to know how to clean ourselves in case we are out of civilization in case we run the woods in case we are outdoors or off-roading because life cannot go on as we know it we have a break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back assalam alaikum and welcome back we have the following hadith cream can you read it for us please narrated abu qatada or the loved one who the messenger of allah salallahu alayhi wa sallam said one must not hold his penis with his right hand while urinating nor clean his private parts with his right hand nor breathed in the utensils while drinking from it now this hadith is quite clear so we don't have to spend so much time in explaining it it's crystal clear the prophecies one when you urinate do not hold your private part with your right hand when you clean yourself do not clean yourself with your right hand and when you drink from a utensil or from a cup while drinking some people especially youngsters when they drink they inhale and exhale in that vessel the Prophet says that don't do this sorry salat wa salam so this is it however scholars different is this instruction as a prohibition or not recommended we set the rules before and we said that whenever the Prophet gives us something to be prohibited then it's Haram unless there is another verse another hadith that makes it a degree lesser from harming to not recommend it but the most authentic opinion is that no it is prohibited you may not touch your private part while urinating or clean yourself with your right hand nor breathe in the vessel while drinking from it because if I see you drink from the glass then you breathe in it I will not drink from it it's not hygienic and at the same time its disgusting for me now I was mad even I find may Allah be pleased with him we know that he's a man that the Angels used to be bashful off and he is one of the Companions who is extremely bashful may Allah be pleased with him and he's the son of the Prophet that is Salam twice he married his daughter consume and no idea may Allah be pleased with them both and they all died in his lifetime both and the Prophet said by Allah if I had a third daughter I would have given her to Othman which shows you the status of us man in the prophets heart as man says may Allah be pleased with him by Allah since I gave the pledge of allegiance to the Prophet with my right hand I had never ever touched my private parts with my right hand whether urinating or defecating or cleaning at all I would never touch it why because this hand was honored to touch the prophet's hand is awesome so I would never do this so from this hadith we learn that one should try not to because it is not part of the synonym do you have any questions or should we move on how many questions do we have 1 2 3 ok this is enough with Sharla yes sir this is regarding blowing the water and you said it is not recommended like the blowing the water or exhale in the water some people have habit of blowing in a hot tea like well they drink hot tea they try to cool it about puffing in it this is not permissible yes this is true not only this actually tea is the last thing they would probably blow on you do this with food if you have a morsel and you want to feed your child and it's hot you try to cool it down this is wrong this is part of the things that the Prophet forbade us from doing and that is not to breathe and you're actually doing this so one must avoid this as much as possible second question please Kenny this is about honoring the tabla as you said Shaikh majority of the Muslims here in the Indian subcontinent they take this as a great offense to show the bottom of your feet towards the Qibla so what is the reality this is a good question however in order for us to go back to the Quran until the sooner as we know we do not say that this is mandatory or forbidden unless we have evidence from the Quran Sunnah so if we go and scan the Quran and Sunnah we would not find anything in the Quran stating that I am NOT allowed to give my back to the pillar in the Masjid and put my feet in the direction of the Qibla nothing so I cannot say it is Haram not only that people would come and tell me listen behind you is the rack of Quran you can't give you back to the rack of the Quran ok so I move somewhere else oh no you're now the direction of your feet are to the Quran why should I stay right what do I need to do stand up so there isn't anything in the hadith that states that putting your feet in the direction of Qibla is not permissible third question similar questions so he cheated it out of you okay any more questions well we go on to the following hadith and who will read this hadith for us please hadith number 17 hypno bus may Allah be pleased with him and his father reported The Messenger of Allah may the blessings of Allah and peace be upon him happened to pass by two graves and said they the occupants are being tormented but they are not tormented for a grievous sin one of them did not keep himself safe from being defiled by urine while the other carried tails under Mima between people he then called for a fresh twig and split it into two parts and planted one of them on each grave the Companions asked him o prophet of Allah why did you do this he said perhaps the punishment may be lighten as long as these twigs remain fresh moist ok this hadith is one of the great hadith highlighting to us the importance of purity and its highlighting to us the dangers of an amoeba so first of all let's look into the aspect that deals with impurity the Prophet passed by to Muslims graves and he said that they're being tortured they are being tormented but the things that they're being tormented for is not so big in another narration said by Allah it is big so the first when he said it's not big meaning to protect yourself from it it was an easy task to do but then he clarified that this is a major sin by Allah it's big meaning it's a big sin not something to be taken lightly what the first man sinned whenever he urinated he did not take the necessary measurements to protect himself from the Ricochet or the return of his urine to his body and to his clothes so he would urinate not caring whether it comes back or not what did this mean this meant that if he prayed his prayer is invalid because he's not just he has an impurity on his body or in his clothes so that is why he's being tormented in the grave the other one he used to it says in the translation he used to walk or say or carry tales but this is not the correct translation what is nummy-nummy ma is relaying the things that had happened between two so you would make enmity between them so I hear a friend of mine say something about a third party he says are this guy is so ugly he always crashes my parties and he never pays off his debt and I go and say do you know what he said about you he said this and this is this what is my intention to make them fight this is Namita and the Prophet said that the person who does this would not enter Chen layette hole generator attack in another narration name ma'am the person who does NEMA were not into paradise then the Prophet Elisha Salam ordered them to bring a long leave a quick and he cut it into two and he planted it into their grave so that when they asked him why doing this he said so that may allah azzawajal make it easy on them until they become dry and then it goes all back to what it was before so this shows us how important it is to make ourself clean but not to the extent to go into the whispering of Shaitaan and I don't know if we have time to go on to this but you know and you probably know people that's have this when they go and answer the call of nature they spend ten minutes 15 minutes half an hour urinating why Japan is there controlling them some of them in the toilets in the WC rooms I would be there and I hear people and sending the call of nature coughing Oh what is he doing and then you hear them jumping in the toilet and some of them making strange noise nice I just sit there I'm gonna see the end of this where it's going after some time an exhausted man comes out from the toilet okay what are you doing are you fighting some jinn inside or what and the guy says pray for me Sheikh I have this who's worse off Shaitaan coming to me that there is a drip but there is a drop and if I walk I feel dripping and maybe there's one more or two more so I do all of these aerobics inside and I do all these karate kicks and I cough and I sneeze and I do whatever I can so that I ensure that there's nothing in and I come out and even when he comes out he still has this illness with him and this is a big big problem I think that we need to elaborate a little bit more on this hadith so because we don't have enough time we'll postpone it to the next episode sha Allah and until then tear Manila was Salaam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
