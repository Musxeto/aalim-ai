  "transcript": "the second question is from a sister what is the reward of forgiving people who hurt you i also want to know that but for example one day i i forgive a person who hurt me some days later when i recall the bad incident i got hurt again and i feel sad is this matter called forgiveness why can't i totally remove feelings related to that incident first of all forgiveness is something that is highly recommended in the quran and the verses are so long so many about those who spend in the cause of allah in hardship and at prosperity and they forgive they pardon those who only punish when they are harmed and their punishment is equivalent to the harm without transgression and if they forgive that is better for them those who are patient allah would give them abundantly without account allah even addressed abu bakr may allah be pleased with him by telling him to pardon and overlook the mistake and the sin which his cousin did when he's laundered his own daughter aisha the mother of the believers allah says that he should pardon and overlook and justify that by saying don't you want allah to forgive you don't you want allah to pardon you so whenever you forgive and pardon anticipating what allah has for you you feel ease in your heart you feel tranquility whenever you remember that you are full of flaws and shortcomings and that you've also wronged others and you wish that others as well may forgive you and pardon you then whenever you remember such abuse or such a hurt from people you forgive them so that others would forgive you as well but definitely this feeling will keep on lingering in your heart for some time until you overcome this control of shaytan this is satan he wants to depress you he wants to put you at despair he wants to anger you he wants to intimidate you as mentioned in the quran so don't pay attention to him make your forgiveness for the sake of allah anticipating that allah would erase some of your sins if not all of them and then you will feel better with nila"
