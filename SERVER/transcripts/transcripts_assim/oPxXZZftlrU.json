  "title": "Warning others of someone who is potential threat or deviant preacher come under backbiting? Assim",
  "transcript": "Weston is if a person is a potential threat is warning others permissible like the story of Yahoo peace be upon him or it becomes backbiting I don't know about the story of Yahoo what are you referring to but yes if there is a threat a potential threat from an individual and you know that someone else is going to be visiting or asking or whatever in this case yes you have to avoid you have to warn that person so for example if I know that a friend is learning from someone who's deviant someone who teaches innovation or so I have to warn him and I got a question yesterday about this from a brother here saying that there is this convert who is impressed with a deviant super Sufi in America who has an institute and he has a huge number of followers it goes to Indonesia to Malaysia and the Sufis Loven and he's an American individual but he is auntie salafiyyah auntie to heat that is someone devoted to Sufism so I said yes you have to warn him but the problem is that you shouldn't warn people except if they are susceptible to your advice and would listen but if someone was Sufi to the core and you come and try to give him an advice you say no no no you are someone who's envious you hate him because he's famous you okay what why hey I'm just giving you a word of advice this is the hora and this is a Sunnah this guy is taking you out of the bath path of the way of the Prophet Isis says no no you sure that in this case it's best not to get involved but if someone who trusts you like most of the people that follow me on Twitter or on on my website they trust me they don't care what agenda I have because they know I don't have an agenda so they trust my judgment they trust my teachings so such people and they come and ask me say yeah don't follow this person because he's out of the straight path and the way of the Prophet Isis er they know that I have no beef with them I don't want money from him or from them so they trust what I say because they know I don't have any political agenda any chemical agenda or any other agenda a few months maybe you days when few years left in my timeline and I'll be made there meeting my maker so alhamdulillah they trust me and I trust them but someone who is not like that you have to be careful"
