  "transcript": "how are you alhamdulillah alhamdulillah she my question for today if a woman is in the type of an unlawful relationship with a man which includes intimate talks Frank discussions and phone sex but not physical Zena we know that whatever he gives her is Haram for her to use but what would be the ruling if any sort of sadka and zaka he pays from his earning which was actually obligatory on her or her family and does it either as a debt or gift money either by lending them the money or giving it to pu by himself are these two separate sins or would we say that it's also Haram and invalid because maybe he might not have done it if they were not so close which if anybody having a Haram relationship and he does something righteous and it's accepted by Allah it will be accepted if he's in a Haram relationship with a woman and he he pays off uh some of her needs for zakat as a grant or as a gift the zakat is accepted these are two separate things but it shows how ignorant and negligent people are when they go and descend to such a level where they mix apples with oranges what kind of Islam are these people practicing and why would we give them a way out and make excuses for them it's like those imbeciles who fast the day of Ramadan and mallah the day Ramadan is fine after they break their fast they call their girlfriends and they come over and they spend the night together and in the morning they are fasting Ramadan what is this said well I fasted Ramadan I also know people who used to gamble and play po poker and put the stash in a box this is Haram money and the following night they play poker with their friends with the Haram money okay use it no it's Haram money so don't play poker no I like to play poker so such dual mentality Dr jaal Mr height Muslims are not like this Muslims submit their will to Allah they don't make excuses for people and make up scenarios of this happening this happening and and justify things like that and Allah Knows Best"
