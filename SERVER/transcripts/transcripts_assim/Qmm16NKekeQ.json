  "title": "Who prayed funeral prayer of Prophet ﷺ‎? No funeral prayer of Prophets cuz they were innocent? assim",
  "transcript": "next question is that is it true that funeral prayer was not prayed for the prophets because they were innocent the first question is I don't know about the previous prophets of Allah Because unless we have evidence from the Quran or from the authentic Sunnah we cannot speak out of thin air and say yeah yeah yeah MSA peace be upon him his funeral was attended by 10,000 Jew how do you know she yeah I know I know I know you guys don't know I'm I graduated from prestigious University what do you have no this is not acceptable we have to have evidence from the Quran and from the Sunnah what we know of is our Prophet Muhammad and we know that funeral prayer was Prayed by almost all the companions but they prayed in twos and threes because his house was very small he was buried in his house so they used to come two or three people pray funeral prayer and leave and the other uh uh patch comes afterwards and this went on for about nearly two days then he was buried so the concept of not to pray funeral prayer because they're pure is totally baseless and has no Foundation when we offer uh salutation upon the prophet to raise his status and uh uh to do what Allah has told us to do he's pure why should we offer salutation upon him so this is a form of and likewise praying funeral prayer at the time was also a form of I that was done and it is the consensus of all Scholars of Islam and it is sufficient that all the companions did it and no one had disagreed with it and Allah knows"
