  "title": "Umdatul Ahkaam - Prayer-  Part 62",
  "transcript": "foreign we move on inshaallah today to a new chapter that deals with the different forms of prayers so we finished the chapters that deal with taharah with impunity with the description of the prophet's prayers and with the description of how to pray with congregation with description of when to travel and how to pray a traveler's prayers and when to combine when to shorten and after that usually scholars speak about the different types of prayers such as friday prayer which is the most prominent and most important eight prayers prayers for uh rain praise for funeral prayers for eclipse etc and the scholars usually join all of these prayers in one section and the compiler of um is not a stranger to that and that is why he began by addressing the issue of friday prayer now we know that there is a surah in the quran by the name of suratul jumuah which indicates the importance of that particular prayer not only that we know that the day of jummah is an important day for the muslims and that is why the allah azzawajal has specified this day with a special prayer unlike any other day and why is this day important because it is the holiday that comes once a week it is a celebration a day that calls for celebration or actually it is a day of eid there is no such thing as celebrating it but it is a day of importance the prophet told us that this is the best day the sun has ever risen in it is the day that allah created adam it is the day that allah instructed the angels to prostrate to him it is the day that allah descended adam in it due to his sin it is the day that the day of judgment will take place in the prophet told us every single week all animals are anticipating and listening afraid that the day of judgment will come on friday this is something we do not see but we do believe the day of juma'ah has a number of protocols that the other days don't have in the day of jummah we recite surat every single juma because the prophet told us that whoever maintains this a light shines from underneath his feet till the day of judgment and this is something of great reward the prophet instructed the men also before attending the friday sermon to have russell and whether this russell is mandatory or not it's an issue of dispute among scholars but no one argues that it is highly recommended in islam to offer this russell whether it's mandatory or recommended but they all agree that it is recommended it is part of the sunnah to offer this russell and it has the prayer of jumu'ah which is prayed instead of so those who pray juma do not offer duhr and those who miss jumaa must offer duhr and it is not a replacement of in the sense that it is prayed in different times to the hor it is prayed in a different format is four this is two though is silent this is loud is prayed after the sun leaves the meridian towards the west after the zawal and this is prayed much earlier than that there is a dispute among scholars when to be prayed exactly the does not have a khutba this is mandatory to have for friday to have two khutbas and along with another or a number of different things that differentiate jummah from zohor prayer we have a hadith which is hadith number 133 we would like someone to read it for us yes brother over there on the topic may allah narrated that men debated to what was the material of the prophet's pulpit sal replied it was made of tamarisk wood of the forest i have seen allah's messenger salallahu alaihi wasallam stand on it and said allahu akbar and led the people in prayer he bowed and then raised his head and stepped back got down and prostrated on the ground and then he again ascended the pulpit until he finished his prayer and then faced the people and said o people i have done this so that you may follow me and learn my prayers in another narration and he prayed on it offered takbir on it and raised his head while standing on it and then descended backwards from it very well this hadith is about an issue that some of the muslims discussed and that is what was it made of there is a pulpit of the prophet alaihi salat that he used to stand and deliver the khutbah of the jummah so what do we learn in this regarding the friday speech the friday sermon that it is to be delivered from on top of pulpit which is two or three steps high that the imam stand so that he would be overviewing the followers and the congregation and they would be able to see him even from a distant so the prophet as soon and he is among the last to die from the companions in medina he's the last of the companions to die in medina so the taberain went to him to ask him so he told them that he knows what material was the pulpit made of and he gave them a description of the type of the wood and he also added an extra piece of information and that is that the prophet salallahu sallam prayed once on the pulpit offering recitation and bowing but prostrating by going backwards and prostrating on ground and then going back again so that people would see how he prays and that is why he justified this by saying i did this only so that you can see how i pray now one may argue and say does this go against the issue of sincerity because allah does not accept any deeds unless it is sincere for his sake so was the prophet praying for the sake of allah or for the sake of teaching the people no he was doing both he was praying for allah but with an extra value to teach the people and is this permissible in islam yes what does this mean allah says that there is no hardship there is no problem if you ask for provision from allah azzawajal when while doing hajj and this ayah was revealed because some people felt that it would not be suitable for them to perform hajj and sell and buy and trade at the same time so allah revealed this ayah to say that it is no problem for you to offer hajj and at the same time trade because shaytan came to them said this is not sincerity if you're sincere only go for the sake of allah for hajj no it is no problem for you to offer good deeds and meanwhile do some benefit on the side providing that doing the benefit is not your actual reason so if someone leads a prayer and the government gives him an allowance for for leading the prayer must he say no i don't want it i didn't request it the government volunteered and this is the system that they give all imams money if this is the case it's okay to take it because once the government stops the money will i continue to lead the prayer or not if the answer is no ah then then you're not sincere if the answer is yes you give me money you don't give me money i'm gonna pray i'm doing it for allah then this is a sign of sincerity unless unless the imam does not have any other source of income so in this case once they cut the payment it is permissible for him to go and teach or to go to look for another job elsewhere because at the end of the day he is responsible for his welfare and for the welfare of his family we move on to the second hadith hadith number 134 yes first brother here narrated i heard the messenger of allah saying anyone of you coming for the jummah prayer should take a bath now this is an issue of dispute among scholars whether it is it mandatory to perform whistle before you attend the prayer or not and what is the reason of the difference of opinion for example the hadith we have with us here the prophet says allah whoever comes among you any one of you coming for jummah should take a bath should take a bath this is an order an instruction so is it mandatory or not it is an issue of dispute among scholars those who say it is mandatory they have a number of evidences among them this hadith and another hadith where the prophet is mandatory upon every person who reached the age of puberty and they also use the hadith where uthman afan may allah be pleased with him came late one day for jummah while umar may allah be pleased with him was giving the khutbah and omar did not like this so he said something that uthman replied to by saying by allah khalifa of the prophet or khalifa or amir muhammadin i did not have time except to prefer mudu and i came and umar was shocked and said and you also only performed did you know that the prophet instructed us to make russell we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back assalamu alaikum and welcome back so um pleased with him was outraged because uthman did not offer russell other scholars say that no it is not mandatory it is recommended why there are hadiths that say that if you come with russel to juma prayer this is good and if you come with wudu this is sufficient so this hadith clearly states that it is not mandatory and that it is something that is sunnah and they answered the hadith where the prophet says assalam the friday russel is mandatory upon every person who reached the age of puberty they say that continue the hadith complete the hadith because the prophet said this and then said and the siwak and perfuming so the meaning would be the russell of friday is mandatory upon every person who reached the age of puberty plus accusing siwak and perfuming yourself and by consensus scholars using the siwak and the perfume is not mandatory so being with the first phrase means that mandatory here is recommended and they go on to give a number of reasons and evidences so it's an issue of dispute among scholars i personally believe that it is highly recommended and what adds value to that is the hadith of ibn abbas may allah be pleased with him in the sunnah and i i trust that it's in sunan abidawut where the people were discussing the russell of friday and he said i will tell you about that the origin of this was that the people were farmers and they had only one set of clothes made of wool so they used to work until it was close to midday and then they come to the masjid and when they came to the masjid they sat it was closed it was tight and they started to smell awfully and they complained to the prophet alessa that okay i can smell my own smell but i cannot smell my brother's smell it is so awful the clothes are dirty and we smell a lot because of the work under the sun so the prophet salallahu salem addressed them and told them that it is not permissible for you to come without taking russell for jummah so ibr abbas is explaining what is the origin of this issue he said after a while after the people got a little bit rich and they got well off and they used to offer hustle then it became normal for them whether to come with russell or not as long as they do not smell and that is why ebony may allah have mercy and soul said that it is sunnah yet it is mandatory for on those who are smelling on those who stink that they must perform russell before attending the russell of friday and this is the most authentic opinion of scholars and allah azzawajal knows best among the questions that you may ask and i will ask you you have questions you have questions so among the questions that some of you may ask is this russell mandatory or recommended for everyone or only those who attend the friday the answer is only on those who attend friday so who are those who are exempted from attending friday women children travelers the six and the l are always exempted from attending because they have an excuse but it is not permanent so scholars say that women the children the slaves and travelers these are exempted from attending friday prayer and what do we mean by travelers a person who is on the road so if i'm traveling from one city or one country to the other and on my way i pass by a place where they're calling for juma should i stop no i continue but if i reach my destination and tomorrow is jummah do i have to go and pray yes now i'm not on the road of traveling and scholars say that if those who it is not obliged upon them to attend attend juma do they pray no for them it is accepted and they have no problem for that one would ask when it is time to perform russell can i perform russell before sun the break of dawn or i have to perform russell after the break of dawn the scholars say the friday hustle must be after the break of dawn after because before that it was not the day of jummah it was the night of jummah so if i offer my russell at 3 am this is friday night it's not friday but after fajr this is considered to be the day and i can offer it some scholars say that if you offer the any time even before maghrib prayer then this is okay and scholars say no this is not okay the end of russell of friday ends with what ends with the prayer ending so if you pray after the friday prayer what uses it because this is a ritual designed for the prayer itself praying it afterwards does not do you any good unlike reciting surat al-khaf you don't have to recite surah kaff before friday you can recite it before asar before maghrib a minute or two just before sunset this would be acceptable do we have any questions yes the brother on top my question is regarding the masjid and the imam the question is that you told last time when we met that it is not allowed to decorate the masjids but we know from a hadees or a narration that once usman was your law and who in his caliphate he was arguing with the people and they were telling him that no you cannot decorate the masjid but he quoted something and said that i have heard allah and he used allah evidence and he designed and decorated the masjid with limestone and we know that he bought even oak and also i wanted to ask that if the imam changes for example another imam comes a more knowledgeable person for example in this gathering of ours if shaykh saw the shurim comes and lead us in a prayer will the reward will be more or will it stay the same regarding decorating the masjid i do not know this hadith regarding uthman may allah be pleased with him decorating the masjid we know that he expanded the masjid a bit and maybe maybe he thought that decorating the masjid in a fashion that is unlike definitely what we're doing now it was probably decorating it by instead of putting the trunks of palm trees he made a wall and some of the companions complained to that thinking that this is decoration but this is not decoration and if you put limestone this is to make it stronger and it would prevent things to come inside and dirt and also to prevent it from having rain water spoiling the masjid but this is not decoration the prophet said when he instructed someone to build the masjid to make it a place where rain would not come in and to make it like a harish of arish musa which is something related to musa aisha is like a hut so yes decorating the masjid is not something recommended but we have to differentiate between building a masjid in a fashion that may stay for a long time and decorating it and being extravagant while doing this regarding praying or not praying this is irrelevant we're talking about building the masjid and allah azza knows best yes regarding the issue of jummah is there a minimum amount of people required to initiate the prayer of juma and regarding that also some of the masjids that we visited even though in here in the subcontinent people don't understand arabic the khudba is only in arabic so is it recommended or what the first one is some scholars say that the minimum required for the audience of juma is four zero forty but this is not backed by authentic hadith and the most authentic opinion of scholars is that you have three people one as an imam and two as followers and listening to the imam and the second question which is regarding the khutba which language it would be i believe that we will postpone this until then i'd leave you in allah's safe guarding to"
