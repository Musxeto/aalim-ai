  "transcript": "Oh [Music] oh-oh-oh you worship a lot you don't associate others with Allah you have fulfilled your right Peter laughs man of him at hamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa ABD he water soda hill ameen nabina muhammad in voila Ali he wasabi woman today we had a westerner visionary he al medina a man assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wa barakato our topic for today it's early morning and some of us may not be that awake personally I'm not that awake either I woke up this last night at 2:00 a.m. due to jet lag and I haven't slept since the hamdulillah so if I do make mistakes or if I fall asleep do you Anna give me credit for the Aged and for the long distance I come through our topic is very important see yesterday we spoke about a las right and if we analyze the Muslim world as a whole we will find that due to the fact that we did not give a lot that was ill his right in complying with worshipping as he instructed and avoiding shirk we see what is happening in the world as a result so whenever we tend to neglect the rights of others most importantly alonzo of course we see the consequences in our lives in our presence today we will talk about the rights of those whom Allah had given them authority over us and one in a democratic era as they say we live in an age of democracy masha'allah Tabarrok a law and personal opinion of mine democracy goes against Islam if you vote whether wine is okay to be drunk or not this is good for if you say yes sir this is cool for you cannot participate in implementing other than allows rule you're not a Muslim so with all any the talk about democracy this is not the time but because we live in an era of such deviancy people would think why do we have people of authority controlling us see it's not a matter of control life as set and created by allah azza wajal must have this type of levels you have to have someone in authority and someone following otherwise if we travel by plane for Omaha to Makkah to Saudi Arabia in the middle of the flight you cannot go to the captain sig I'd like to take my responsibility for the rest of the way not even his co-pilot can say that the captain of the ship the captain of the airplane is one in the airplane he is always on the left seat even if they had two or three captain's on board only one can be captain so Allah Azza WA JAL created this world to be as such a wife must obey her husband rule of life a religious commitment and an obligation a son must obey his father he cannot say well you're a man in a moment you don't have the right to order me and I don't have the obligation to obey you and we have people of authority this is how Allah Kjell created as allah subhana allah says in the quran and have raised some of them above others in degree of rank that they may make use of one another for service Allah created rich not me and people Allah created rich and poor Allah created those who need money but have a skill and those who have money and need that skill Allah created people who borrow and people who lend this is the way that Allah created people so that we can use one other imagine if all of us here were millionaires who would fix your card nobody I don't need to fix your car I don't need to slaughter a sheep and sell you the meat I don't need to do this so Allah created us in this fashion now having said that a lot they were just stated in the Orana a you had ladina Amman up to your allah well to your rasul what would is am reaming o you who have believed obey Allah this was our topic yesterday how to worship allah azza wajal and who was allah subhana WA Ta'ala then Allah says and obey the messenger sallallahu alayhi salam and those in authority among you whoa so if Allah mentioned those in authority among us with him and with his messenger alayhi salat wa salam this means that they have a very important role in the community in the society in this life so they have obligations upon us and they have rights so who are they to begin with the Companions of the Prophet Allah so on when they gave the fear of this ayah they were split into two parties some say they are the scholars and others say no they are the rulers and leaders and if not I am may Allah have mercy on his soul when he looked at all of these interpretations he said they are both so the people of authority are divided into two types scholars of religion and the rulers and leaders why the scholars show us what Islam is show us what is halal and what is Haram set the rulings that they've inherited from the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam who himself had said the scholars of religion are the heirs of the prophets the prophets did not leave money behind the left knowledge and the scholars are those heirs of the prophets and messengers of allah azza wajal so the scholars preserve the Deen they convey the message but this is not sufficient there has to be someone who implements it and make sure that this is audited and that this is practiced and this is enforced and this cannot be done except by the rulers and the leaders so the collaboration means the perfection of this religion in our nation in our Ummah as a whole if there is an error then there is a problem these people of authority the masses of Muslims must follow them and if the masses of the Muslims follow these people of authority then they will prosperous the moment there is an error the moment there is a split you will see what you see at the moment if you would like to classify the state of the Muslims worldwide out of ten how much would you give it one to be the os tend to be the highest would it increase three would it go beyond three maybe four to be optimistic but it can't be why is this we have the best book the ultimate and the final revelation that will remain till the end of time the Prophet array is awesome the best of messengers were sent to us so what is wrong what is wrong is that we have seen the split between the people of authority we've seen that the scholars of Islam have been cited they're taking away from the full and big picture so they don't have a say they don't give consultation and if they give consultation no one listens to it and this is a sign of the signs of the Day of Judgment meaning that the day of judgment is approaching wine and now Matt a Bedouin came to the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and said o prophet of allah when is the hour when is the day of judgment so the Prophet said RA his salatu wassalam said when trusts are neglected then await for the hour the trust I trust you I can trust you I give you responsibilities to carry this is trust if there is no trust between a seller and a buyer people would steal one another so the Prophet says that it was if the strut if or when trusts are neglected then await the hour so the man said o prophet of Allah how would they be neglected this trust how can it be neglected the prophet alayhi salatu salam when positions of authority are given to the people who are not qualified for them the wait for the hour what type of management did the Prophet have at a solid wassalam putting the wrong man in the wrong place this is our calamity worldwide always find this in private sector find it in companies in governments in everywhere the wrong man in the wrong place and this is a sign of the day of judgment and therefore when you have this split when the real scholars are being sided and put on the side what will happen false scholars would come like myself and this is unfortunate when you waste your time listening to the likes of me seriously but this is not that important let me finish the lecture and then we can talk is all about this the Muslim nation the omaha-based lamp this is our problem the Prophet said Allison Allah does not extract knowledge by thinking it's from this from the chest of men Allah doesn't take knowledge this way then how does a lot acknowledge Allah takes knowledge by having the real scholars die and when they die the people will take scholars who have no knowledge who would give fatwa go astray and lead people astray this is problematic this is exactly what happened at the beginning of time at the time of North peace be upon him they had five righteous scholars when they died Shaitaan came to them and said why don't we build monuments and statues over the graves so whenever we see them we start to worship Allah and remember them a generation passed what happened the second generation came they did not know of this noble cause as they thought and they looked at these five statues over the graves and said hmm our forefathers why did they build it most likely so that they can get trained through them so they started worshipping them this what happens when you don't have scholars real scholars who would guide the Ummah to know their Lord who would guide the Ummah to know what is halal and what is Haram now in so many Muslim countries I'm talking about mine and others and Hamed Allah here maybe it's different in may Allah preserve this country and the scholars of this country and the rulers of this country in my in countries that I know of scholars are made fun of the media takes the scholars and make them look like clowns like fools so they want to draw a picture of me they make my beard like anything that is funny you know from the Disney character ah maybe you never know they make the scholar look so repulsive so ugly so when you look at this you make fun out of him so in most countries when you talk about scholars the first thing that comes to mind is that Imam who comes and reads Quran in funerals and then we give him whatever is possible in he goes a beggar who knows how to read the Quran this is the scholars they know of the funny thing that all countries of Islam they talk about women's right humans right even animals right but you never find them talking about scholars right and whenever the Ummah does not respect the Scot their scholars of Islam know that they do not respect Islam as a whole so let us look into some of the characteristics of the scholars how would I know a scholar does he wear a tag scholar no because we can buy 10 for a ring it and that that doesn't make us a scholar scholars of Islam must be well-versed strongly founded and established in the sciences of Islam so they won first of all they have to master Arabic you can't be a scholar in Islam when you don't know Arabic few words in Arabic doesn't suffice you have to be fluent in Arabic you have to know the Quran memorizing the Quran is a plus but knowing the Quran understanding that have seer knowing the abrogated from what was not abrogated is essential the sciences of the Quran why was it revealed when was it revealed it is important he has to know the hadith of the prophet alayhi salaatu is it authentic not authentic was it abrogated what's the meaning of it when was it said he has to know the fundamentals of and it's a separate huge science that has so many branches under it then he has to understand the fifth itself which tells him this is halal this is Haram this is the way a body is done a transaction is right or wrong and so on so they have to be like this in order to be real scholars they have to be people of righteousness piety fear of Allah can a scholar be seen in an appropriate place doing an inappropriate act behaving in an inappropriate way this is not a scholar a real scholar is a man of piety he fears allah allah says in the ayaats allah ameen read a d-algorithm verily among allah servants only is the scholars of religion fear Allah the true fear of Allah only is found with those who have knowledge of Allah the Almighty they are recognized by other scholars so if Tom Dick or Harry come and say I'm a scholar of Islam who knows you nobody but I know myself so all of us are scholars of ham didn't know a scholar has to be recognized by other scholars in other countries yes we know this brother we've read his books we've seen his lectures we've talked to him he is a scholar so this is quite important also scholars have great value at the sight of Allah and if you read the Quran and read and read the sooner you will find so high emphasis on the status of scholars in Islam to the degree that the prophet alayhi salaatu wa sallam said the virtue and the level of a scholar over a worshiper is like the difference between my level and yours the liver of the Prophet s RAM and the rest of the Ummah so the scholar is way high and Allah soldier has combined the scholars with him and with his angels when Allah says Allah testifies that there is no God worthy of being worshipped except him and the angel specified and those the scholars or those who possess the knowledge of Islam so it has a great status at the side of Allah scholars are wise and their wisdom benefits the whole Ummah because whenever there is a calamity that is about to fall the Muslim Ummah they can see it ahead of time the scholars know what is right and what is wrong by judging the consequences the masses don't six years ago when there was this Arabian Spring in the middle-east the scholar stood and said don't do this this is wrong you will end up killing your people you will end up causing chaos you will make the Muslims hate Islam do not do this do not rebel call people to Islam call people to the practice of the Quran and the Sunnah but don't go against the ruler this is not the right thing nobody listened and they said that you scholars don't know anything except monthly period menses and postnatal bleeding this is your knowledge speaking this in Pajaro but when it comes to mega issues no no no this is not your piece of cake now after six years we've seen the autumn the Arabian autumn and then the summer and we're entering the in fear new missile wanna have you why because they did not adhere and listen to what the scholars had to say okay there are rights for such scholars what are their rights and mind you the topic is so huge but we have to minimize it and to try and benefit as much as possible because if we cannot cover the whole topic then we will try to cover as much and learn and implement the first right of the scholars is that we have to support them love them and be their allies righteous practicing knowledgeable scholars we have to back them up it is their right to we stand by them because by doing so we're standing by the Quran and the Sunnah that they represents when you fail to do this you fail the Quran and the Sunnah and always remember we are talking about this true scholars who follow the Quran and the Sunnah with understanding of our righteous predecessors not any scholar who wears a coffee or wears a turban or wears a special dress he becomes a scholar that I have to follow no we judge scholars by their compliance by their complete unquestionable following of the Quran and the Sunnah as the way of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam secondly we have to respect them so a scholar has to be respected and what do we mean by respecting them kissing their hands and feet this is not respected respecting them is to give them their due right even Abbas may Allah be pleased with him said I spent two years hesitant to ask Omar may Allah be pleased with him about a hadith because I was fearful of him out of respect this is the respect we want with our scholars not to find a scholar and when you see him share hi5 what is this where are you coming from yeah share is my homey is my buddy share I love you this is not respectful you have to know how to address the share you have to know how to talk to the ship to the scholar let me rephrase that to the alum the man of authority and we see nowadays in worldwide almost the lack of respect to the scholar to the student to the extent that in so many countries there are means of stopping a scholar from giving a lecture or from giving others and who is responsible for this another scholar no a paper-pusher an employee maybe who has done only his fifth grade and knows how to write and sign is it no no no this chair is not allowed to speak this shape is given this is wrong such scholars must be respected at least you want to prevent these lectures and these gurus from taking place it should be from another scholar among the rights of a scholar that you must carry his knowledge and spread it the best thing you can do for a scholar is to take from his knowledge and spread it share it because this is what they thrive for they are the keepers of the knowledge of the Prophet Ellison they are the hare the heirs of the Prophet Allah so solemn so whenever they teach and they see what they had taught spreading all over the world this is the biggest joy that they might have you have to know that disrespecting them harming them slandering them is devastating for the Muslim Ummah you have to defend them whenever they are attacked unjustly if they were attacked fairly make excuses but don't defend them blindly following them blindly is not part of Islam because they are not infallible they are human beings they may have mistakes but you have to defend them wherever someone talks about shares also or Imam so-and-so unjustly unfairly you have to stand and defend because they are the one who conveyed and relay the knowledge of the Quran and Sunnah to us among their rights that you must observe what comes out of your mouth against them I sit with students of knowledge I sit with common people and whenever a topic comes they speak ill about scholars not that they are bad or good this is none of this factor is wrong masha'Allah severac Allah and who are you what knowledge do you have said I don't have to have knowledge I know that this is wrong where is this coming from can you quote an ayah can you go to hadith said no but chef so-and-so said it was wrong oh okay then this is the case so my share against your share whose biceps is bigger this is how we measure knowledge this is how we measure things in Islam yeah but we have like ten scholars with me he has only nine it's not a tug of war this is knowledge this is Quran and Sunnah so you cannot say that this scholar is wrong this color is right out of thin air because you not qualified you not qualified to go to a neurosurgeon and say to him I think that procedure you're going to follow doing my operation in my mind is wrong you should change it okay you don't have a mind to begin with if you go and speak with the doctor like this part of their right of the scholars knowing that they're not masoom they're not infallible they are bound to make mistakes once they make a mistake you should not tarnish their reputation and you should not make them scum of the world because a single mistake they had this is wrong measure the good that came to humanity throughout these past years or decades you will find that immense now if they make a mistake or - this is part of their human nature so you do not accept their mistakes but you do not simply cross them out there are so many people now when you say what do you think of dr. so-and-so oh no he has this mistake and that mistake yeah but a hundred thousand people embraced Islam because of him what do you think of share so-and-so no he doesn't believe that this is the thing is Harlem or he says that you have to do this thing so we don't listen to me at the end of the day you have no one to listen to this is not the right way of doing it the Prophet told the Solis the lazarum win one scholar or a ruler makes HT hat and he is correct Allah rewards him twice and if he makes his effort and strives to do the best but makes an error Allah would reward him once so in both cases they rewarded but you sitting back and criticizing like this this is not the right thing to do and finally not for the lecture for the scholars right Lister we have mashallah more and more finally their biggest right or one of their biggest right is that we have to always cross-check with them you have to surround the scholars and nag them and bug them with questions in your life because my knowledge and yours is not as good in so many times we make mistakes in judgment especially in times of calamities so when there is a calamity when there is tribulation when there is chaos and mishap you don't make your decision on your own go to the scholars ask them what do you think I should do do you think that this is the right course to be followed or not why because Allah ordered you to do this where did Allah ordered me to do this  I don't I've read the Quran twice in my life I've never passed by something like this is it enough to read the Quran twice in your life are it at least the minimum requirement for a real Muslim to recite the Quran is once every month in Ramadan of course it's about 5 times 10 times depending so at least every year you should recite the whole Quran read it not less than 15 times and if you are 40 years of age and you have not completed the Quranic once or twice in your life what are you doing you're wasting your time sitting here seriously read a Las book this is our Constitution this is our salvation the Quran Allah says in the Quran and when there comes to them information about public security or fear they spread it around this is what's happening wherever we hear something we spread it around regardless it's true or not regardless you understand the implication of it or not Allah says but if they had referred it back to the Messenger of Allah or to those of authority listen if they referred it to the messenger or to those of authority among them then the ones who can draw correct conclusion those are the scholars the one who can draw correct conclusions from it would have known about it so you must surround the scholars around you you must consult them you must all the time seek guidance from them because they know what you do not know and they possess the Quran the knowledge of the Quran and the authentic Sunnah of the Prophet erase the autosum now we finish the easy part let's go to the serious one the people of authority who are the rulers who are the leaders the kings the presidents the ministers I wish I had a machine gun to kill the enemies of Islam and protect them so now slip tada mashallah very diplomatic very no no seriously the the large population of the Muslims have mixed feelings in their hearts when it comes to rulers you find some loving them more than the messages on the prophets whatever they say is right and you find others who think that they're hypocrites kafir Jhin chiffon with black magic so I'm a Muslim I need to know I need to understand my religion when Allah tells me to obey those of authority among us how should I perceive them how should I deal with them life cannot go on without a ruler this is a fact of life the scholars of past times of salaf used to say one day under the ruling of an unfair and unjust ruler one day is better than seventy years without a ruler but his unfair he's unjust yes but life does not go does not move without this ruler and this is why Allah ordered us to obey them o you who believe obey Allah and obey the messengers of Messenger of Allah and those of authority among you but why should I obey them this is Allah's law the Prophet said alayhi salat wa salam adhere and obey even if an Abyssinian slave was appointed to rule you the Arabs at the time used to have slaves they may feed them and they may keep them among the best of those who were freed Bilal may Allah be pleased with him rumour used to say this is sayyiduna to Abu Bakr and he afraid say he Donna to a Bilal Romar used to consider Bilal to be his sayyed his master so Islam came to abolish anything about slavery about color there is no preference for color Abyssinian or non Abyssinian he was appointed as a ruler you must obey him but this obedience is restricted to obeying allah azza wajal so if the ruler tells me when the lie it is red you have to stop where is it in the Quran where is it in the Sunnah I don't find it so I will not listen to you I'm going to drive move he dies he kills Mike he goes to jail Allah will punish him Allah ordered you to obey as long as there is no sin in it did he order you to sin no then you have to obey the Prophet say that is valid or Salama obedience and adherence there is listening and obeying is a must upon each and every single Muslim individual whether he loves it or hates it as long as he is not instructed to sin if he is instructed to sin then there is no adherence and there is no obedience if my ruler comes and says you have to skip further prayer I'm not going to skip pursue pray this is a sin if he comes and says don't give the cut I'm not going to obey Him if he says you have to drink a wine or you have to gamble or you have known these things I must not do even if he ordered me to do but this doesn't mean that I have to disobey him and everything else at the time of the Prophet Alex lot Salaam the Prophet dispatched an expedition and he appointed and a meal a ruler a leader and he told him obey Him so the man was with them in the expedition and one night he went to the canteen where they cooked the food and he asked the man for extra food the one who's responsible in spreading the rationing and I said no you took your share took my share huh ok he asked his fellow men to gather fire for the wood for the fire so they did he ordered them to let it so that big flames and light was there he said the Prophet said that I fell off some of you must obey me correct he said yes it is throw yourself in and help the companion started we were confused so ourselves in health we're running away from health by accepting Islam and he wants us to throw ourselves in the fire what is this and the other state but the Prophet ordered us to obey Him hmm they said no no we're not going to do this and they continued in their expedition when they came back the prophet alayhi al-salam told them had you obeyed him you would never had left it you'd never had gone out of it because you disobeyed Allah by obeying him but he did not order them to disobey him and everything else so the Haram you disobey everything else remains as it is the Prophet said RA salatu salam whoever obeys Allah whoever obeys me the messenger has obeyed Allah and whoever disobeys me he has disobeyed Allah because the Prophet is the messenger he doesn't speak from his own it's always relational then he said and whoever obeys the ruler he has obeyed me and whoever disobeys his ruler he has disobeyed me and nowadays people obey the ruler when there is benefit for them so if the ruler gives them money if the taxes are low though taxation in Islam is Haram but let's assume that he makes it low he gives them benefits he gives them things that they are satisfied with they will obey Him but if he doesn't they will find it easy to disobey the Prophet said Alice a lobster on the day of judgement and the hadith is agreed upon by Bukhari and Muslim 3 Allah will not speak to them will not look at them will not purify them and will put them in a torment and punishment of the fire who are they one of them the Prophet Allah salah salem a man gave his pledge of allegiance to his ruler he doesn't do this except for this world he's not doing it for the sake of Allah if the ruler gives him what he wants he will submit and obey but if he doesn't he will not submit and will not obey this person Allah will not talk to him on the day of judgment neither look at him nor purify him and He will give him a strong torment and punishment now when we talk about leaders anyone who's appointed upon you and has control and authority over you is a leader whether he is the great imam long ago inshallah Allah will bring this time back again the Muslim Ummah had one Imam Khalifa but now countries are divided so each country the ruler is the amount that they must obey as long as he is Muslim and those whom he appoints ministers and chief of police and etc there are people of authority there that must be obeyed as well and by saying obeying this doesn't mean that we have to keep our mouth shut when we see something wrong if we see our ruler doing something wrong we have to speak out and give advice with the Islamic etiquette the prophet alayhi salat WA Salam you will have rulers ruling you and you will see things that you recognize and approve of and things that are evil and Haram and you disapprove of so whoever hates it internally he is okay and whoever speaks against it then he is safe but the problem is with those who are in content and do not speak at all they are in great danger so as long as you speak out with the Islamic etiquette to bring the matter to the there's attention then you are safe Ayesha Allah and there's no sin on you so in less than 10 minutes this screen is too big for the time yeah it makes me feel handicapped but alhamdulillah so what are the rights of the rulers and leaders there are so many of them I selected few for you one you have to admit of their authority over you and you have to have the conviction in obeying them whenever it is bill Marouf there is no sin in it and you have to stand by them in defending the truth the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam said in a long hadith he said after me there will come the rulers and leaders who do not follow my Sunnah and they do not rule in my way and there will come men with the hearts of devils and the bodies of humans who say if I said o prophet of Allah this time comes and I'm there what should I do the Prophet said Ali salatu salam said to him you must obey and you must adhere to the ruler even if he flogs your back and takes your money now question marks a lot of the people no I'm not going to do this I'm going to take my guns and cannons and make a rebellion and a hero Muslim this is a lot instruction to you this is the prophet's direction to you now why would I do such a thing my ruler is unfair he is unjust he's taking all the money deposit getting deposit cannulated this please depositing it in Swiss banks so why should I obey him he's causing me trouble because if you don't you're one in a hundred million if you don't obey Him the hundred million will be affected if you obey Him Allah will store it for you in Jannah and we will throw him in hell but life will go on for the rest of the hundred million or the ten million or the 1 million it is for the bigger or for the greater good of the Muslims and this is how things go it's not what you like it is what Allah wants you to do now you have to direct them you have to show them what is right and what is wrong because this is part of their rights upon us and it's an obligation from us to them the Prophet said alayhi salatu wassalam had said at the noon Ecija which translates to religion or the Deen is advice and sincerity so the companion says advice and sincerity to whom the Prophet said alayhi salaatu wa salaam to Allah to his book to His Messenger and to the leaders of the Muslims and their common folk so we must give them advice but maybe they will not listen this is not your responsibility all what you have to do is convey the message and Allah Azza WA JAL when he wills it they will adhere to it among their rights is when they appoint us to do something we have to comply they ordered us they ordered us to do something the Prophet Allah is awesome told us to comply we have to adhere and we have to obey we have to do this with total honesty no cheating no betrayals the Prophet said Alice philosophy give back what you were entrusted with and ask allah for what is yours a man borrows from me ten thousand and he has something deposited with me he comes and claims what he deposited a watch a card so I say to him give me my ten thousand he said you have no proof show me a proof that I took from you ten thousand show me your witnesses so I said in this case I will keep the car the Prophet says no you have to give what you were entrusted with this is an obligation okay what about my money your money you will take it from Allah oh Allah on the day of judgment Allah anatella many demonic well as the hunt man hanok you have to bring it to their attention that this is wrong this is munkar this is haram what rulings you are about to take goes against this lamp but you don't do this on the newspapers or on live TV you don't do this in rallies in public like some countries do they come and make rallies and they curse the ruler they curse the ministers and they make them look like kids and children that they play with publicly via this is fun this is fun sure we like we like this when we hear them talk about our rulers and leaders it's fun no it's not fun it's Haram the Prophet said alayhi salatu was-salam whoever wants to give advice to a ruler he must not do it publicly this is the prophets words a little ofsome his teachings if you're a Muslim do not do it publicly rather he should take his hand and be alone with him of course after they frisk him that he doesn't have any poisons or guns otherwise so he has to take his hands the talk in private with him if he accepts alhamdulillah and if he doesn't then you have done your duty in front of Allah never do it publicly in Buhari and Muslim Osama bin zaid may Allah be pleased with him a group of people came and said to him complaining about Osmani been a fan the third caliph one of the ten heaven-bound yanny the one who married two of the prophet's sister a prophets daughter that is philosopher uncle sumatra payer so they are telling him why don't you go and complain tourist man about the wrong things that we think that he is doing and he wasn't doing any wrong things he's a righteous Khalifa but the masses don't know what's behind the curtains they don't know why he took such judgments so they went to Osama bin is 8 even Haditha to complain and Osama bin is 8 looked at them and said do you think that every time I go and give advice to us man I'm going to come and tell you are you crazy I advised him between him and me and no one else is with us so that I would not open a gate for fitna to come in if some I will say it speaks publicly then all the others would stand up and speak publicly and what will happen chaos what did happen tourist man may Allah be pleased with him he was besieged and surrounded in his home for so many days without food and water he's the third caliph the righteous guided heavy heaven bound and then they executed him and assassinated him in his house while reading the Quran 84 years of age may Allah be pleased with him why because of this chaos miss have a lot of tribulations and calamities you have to try and gather the Ummah to love them even if you don't love them and most likely a lot of the Muslims don't love them unfortunately but nevertheless you have to try your level best to have the hearts to them of the Muslims and to gather around them the Prophet said alayhi salatu was-salam whoever takes his hand away from the allegiance to his Imam he will meet Allah on the day of judgement without any justification or reasoning whoever takes his hand away so I gave my pledge of allegiance to my Imam but then after a while I said I will not obey Him I will not listen to him and whoever dies the Prophet says are Islam without the pledge of allegiance to an imam to a ruler to a leader then he will die the death of jahiliyya of the pre islam era now all of you have a pledge of allegiance I have a pledge of allegiance people of Kuwait have pledge of allegiance to their rulers but there are people who live in a country say we don't have any pledge of allegiance we don't approve of our or our ruler we don't look at him as so on so and this is very problematic because this takes you away from a lesson now l-jamaa into the Huaraz who do not have a ruler of their own and they give tech field and this is an another issue part of their rights is that you should notify them if they have done anything unjust so they would restore justice to its people by advising them in secret by channels that you can reach them also and finally part of that right is that you do not flatter them or praise them or kiss their boots their boots a lot of people kiss their boots in order for some money because this is cheating you have to call a spade a spade when you come to an err and unjust ruler who doesn't feel Allah and you say masha'Allah I know this man he praised my prayer what night prayer you're lying when you praise the ruler or the minister and you say you are among the most righteous you are the most truthful you are the most kind you are the most generous just to score a point with him that may help you if you want to admit your son into university next year this is Haram this is betraying them you have to be fair and just respecting them but not falsely praising them respect is important and essential in Islam the Prophet said Allah salatu salam whoever honors the ruler of allah in this life Allah will honor him on the day of judgement and whoever insults or humiliates the ruler of Allah in this earth Allah will insult him on the day of judgment says time is up but I have a very important last point when is the Muftis lecture what time 11:00 we have happen our issue a lot anyhow all over the Muslim world we have revolutions we have rebellions we have people taking up arms to go against unfair and unjust Muslim ruler is the color or Haram C as Muslims we have to analyze this with our Quran and Sunnah not with our minds or with our feelings because if it were to our feelings we would use that machine gun and cannons and blow everybody else but what is the Islamic rule the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam in the hadith of rabat of muhammad he said sallallahoalyhiwasallam that you have to obey and adhere when you are enthusiastic or not when you are at ease or at hardship and that you must not dispute with whom Allah has appointed them upon you as rulers unless you see blatant cover you have evidence from Allah to support it these are four difficult conditions set by the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam that you cannot fight the rulers and we have a rebellion or to overthrow them unless you have these four conditions to prove that they are disbelievers so if I have a Muslim ruler who is a Muslim but sinful can I do this no you cannot do share he drinks wine you cannot do this Sheikh he steals money from the Treasury you cannot do this share he does this and he does that you cannot do this the Prophet said alayhi salatu was-salam unless they made a blatant show of kufur and you have evidence from Allah that they are doing is indeed covered in another hadith the Prophet is awesome talked to his companions warning them of what to come after his death and that you will find that there are rulers that will change a lot of my Sunnah so the companions were hot blooded Muslims so said o prophet of Allah shouldn't we take up arms against them shouldn't we fight them what did the Prophet ala Sosa know as long as they pray that's all they pray with you in the Masjid you see them in the Juma there Muslims fellows and this means that the majority of rebellions and revolutions and throwing governments in the Muslim world are against Islam and if you look at the consequence of what's happening the devastation that and the suffering that the Muslims are suffering because of that you understand that the teachings of the Prophet is awesome is the best in the world he told this this to us 15 centuries ago and we can see that it fits like a glove now it is not permissible to rebel against the rulers for sinful things this is totally prohibited this doesn't mean that you accept it and turn a blind eye as mentioned earlier you go and talk to him this is wrong this is Haram but in private if all of us the 2,000 in this beautiful hole we're to do this okay maybe the first letter is in okay inshallah throw it in the dustbin second letter third letter template a thousand letter and it does manage it has to bring a bigger one it's not going to be sufficient and this is exactly when you see something evil when you see moon come and you walk by it and said and you move you didn't do anything if you talk to the brother okay Salam alaikum alaikum Salaam okay smoking is bad for you and it's a sin may enlarge they will repent upon you and guide you is a cycle ahead you have a light move on he's mocking you no problem move on the second one comes and says the same thing the third one the tenth one after a while the guy would look Allah this is problematic it's not worthwhile so many people are talking about it no one will stay adamant on such a sin but when we do not speak at all it will increase and there will be - there will be five there will be 10 and then you will go to Singapore and try to pick up smoking there like Mufti said yesterday so we have to try our level best to restore the rights to our scholars to restore the rights to our rulers and to always think positive things can improve if we have a positive look at life if we keep on just criticizing just ridiculing making fun of the rulers making fun of the scholars we will never advance we will never prosperous we have to follow the Quran and the Sunna in the same methodology that the prophet and the companions may allah be pleased with him did and with this inshallah we will prosper as they had done well ah who I am when this is bachelor is me alayhi assalam wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik ala nabina muhammad why he was happy as marine for those who had fallen asleep you may wake up now cinematic [Music] Oh Oh [Music] oh-oh-oh [Music] he homeless vendetta and oil electrical we husband"
