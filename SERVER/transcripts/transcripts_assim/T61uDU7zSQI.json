  "transcript": "first question is is animal blood najis this has to be explained if you're talking about the blood that comes out while slaughtering the animal the answer is yes this is nudges so if you get parts of it on your clothes you must wash it before praying because this gushing blood is nudges as for the blood that remains in the veins after the slaughter has been done so while cooking and the water is boiling i can see a layer of blood on top this is not nudges because this was in the veins if i am eating a piece of steak and it's rare and that is rare i only eat well done so if it's rare and you cut it and you see blood coming out this is pure you can eat it without any problem but the nudges is that the blood which comes while slaughtering or that comes out of a dead animal after being slaughtered this is considered to be nudges you"
