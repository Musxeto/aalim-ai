  "transcript": "okay from Bangladesh alayum I saw in your prayer video that in the first ra after the second suud we need to give a pause which is just uh which is something I forgot one of my friends said that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam used to do it when he was getting older but he didn't used to do it when he was young so I need to you to confirm this no I don't confirm anything it is your friend who is mashallah Einstein who came up with something he has to give us the proof that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam did this only when he got older this pause before standing after the second sujud before standing to the third ra is known as and it was reported by imari narrated by Malik may Allah be pleased with him who performed this to His companion telling them shall I offer the prayer of the Prophet wasam as he used to pray it in front of you so he was demonstrating to them how the prophet used to pray the companions all watched it and he did this and none of them said whoa whoa whoa the prophet did this only when he got old so your Einstein friend who comes up with such thoughts he has to bring us a Hadith not from Tom Dicker Harry stating that oh the prophet did this from their own whims and desires if you don't have evidence you cannot justify this action of a companion through your whims and desires and Allah Knows Best"
