  "transcript": "what are the signs of uh evil eye and what are the treat what are the treatments of it i don't know this has to be asked to someone who knows and who deals and treats such things see an evil eye is not a specific illness that you feel that there is rash on your skin or you have back pain no it differs someone's evil eye could be in falling sick someone evil eye isn't being unable to walk and he has knee problems someone's evil eye could affect his income so he's kicked out of his job someone's evil eye could break up their marriage i get so many people coming to me for counseling and when i listen to them i say that this is evil eye or black magic there's something wrong yesterday i was with one of the sisters who was complaining about her marital life and husband and as she was talking i told her wait this is an evil eye or black magic says no there's nothing wrong with me they're not there are no signs i say i can tell you're saying something is white and a minute later he said no no it's black and when i bring it to your attention you say yeah yeah it's white and then you go again and say it's black so your thought process has been jeopardized by this evil eye and you may not see it or you may not feel it these are there are many signs of it so how to treat it the best thing is that you accuse someone of giving you uh an evil lie if you know that yes my auntie said so and so and since she said that sentence i wasn't feeling good or my friend or my cousin or if you know the person then you should ask them to perform mudu and collect the wood water and among the things they wash their face their arms the feet and the inside of the garments so the inside of the trouser of or of the soap and get the water in a vessel and then from behind you someone comes and washes you and throws it from on top of your head downwards and discus you immediately if this is not possible i don't know which one i have a gazillion people uh probably accused of that in this case you have no other cube but to do it and rukia is an excellent remedy for such um diseases and illnesses and it's guaranteed enough to cure you but it may take some time you"
