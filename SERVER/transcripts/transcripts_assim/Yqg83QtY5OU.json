  "title": "The best 10 days of the year (Dhul hijjah) - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "when we want to talk about these blessed nights before we even think of talking about it it is important for us to understand that allah azzawajal favors things over things so allah azzawajal favored our prophet muhammad ali over all of his creation and he favored the masjid al-haram in mecca may allah grant me and you a visit to pray there to perform umrah and to perform hajj he preferred that spot over all of the whole earth making one prayer there more important and valuable than a hundred thousand prayers elsewhere likewise medina masjid likewise when we speak about different nights for example everybody knows that it is better than a thousand months as mentioned in the quran and we also know that allah azzawajal selected and favored friday from the rest of the days of the week and he favored the four months during the whole year we have four sacred months and he favored those and we have three months of hajj shawwal which the ritual of one of the pillars of islam takes place within so now this is one of the seasons that takes place only once a year and so many of us are regretful because they had missed the beautiful 10 nights of ramadan we were negligent we were weak with the lock down we did not attend prayers in the masjid as we used to alhamdulillah we offered it home but it's not the same taste it's not the same benefit that we usually reap and gain now you have a season that is according to some scholars better than the 10 nights of ramadan whoa this is too much what do you mean we always know that the ten nights of ramadan are the best of all listen to the hadith and you be the judge the prophet alaihis al-assam once said there are no days so this is a negation there are no days he did not said except there are no days on which righteous deeds are more beloved to allah than these ten days one of the companions said okay o prophet of allah even jihad for the sake of allah so the prophet says even jihad for the sake of allah unless a man goes out himself for jihad taking his wealth with him and does not come back with neither one meaning that he was martyred and he lost the money in jihad it's not a loss it's indeed an excellent investment so these days the 10 days of the hija which will probably begin on monday or tuesday in some countries on wednesday these are the most beloved days to allah azza for you to get closer to him to the extent that allah azza mentioned in the quran well fajr by the dawn and the 10 days these are the ten days of the beginning of the hijra these are unique days where nowhere else you could find all these rituals combined in them you have fasting you have prayers you have umrah you have tawaf you have standing in arafa you have the day of eid and throwing the pebbles and the whole nine yards everything is combined in these beautiful 10 days so okay we we we get your point sheikh but when you say that the ten nights of ramadan might be less in value than these 10 days of the hija this is a bold statement well i said some scholars said and even may allah have mercy on his soul took a middle path he said the nights the night time of the ten nights of ramadan are better because they include laylatul while the daytime the morning the daytime of the first 10 days of the hijab are better because there is the day of aid there is arafat there is so many things that included in it now if you look at people during the last 10 nights of ramadan you would find everybody is shifting into high gear everybody's trying their level best to worship allah azzawajal to gain as many rewards as they can which is good which is positive yet it is awkward when you see how the vast majority of muslims neglect the first 10 days of the hija and the reason of their neglect is that by nature as humans when i see everybody working out in the gym and i'm in the gym i get encouraged and get enthusiastic and become more active because everybody's doing it so worship in congregation is always easier than worshipping allah alone during the last 10 nights of ramadan everybody's in the masjid everybody is reciting quran doing dikka trying their level best to make the best they can from this season while in the first 10 days of the hija rarely you will find people doing this though if people had knowledge they would have found out that they are mistaken in neglecting these days that the prophet himself ali susam described to be one not one sorry let me rephrase that the prophet himself described them to be the best days ever where allah azza loves people to do good deeds in them so i will not take much time to emphasize how important these days are because maybe somebody else is gonna be doing this yet my topic is supposed to share with you some of the good deeds that we can get closer to allah azzawajal so when we say that we should do good deeds what do we mean by that it means that there are so many things that we can do and usually our sisters are among those who complain don't be offensive feminist sisters or those say oh is a male sharp and a stick i would have why do i have to open these subjects every now and then i'm just telling you the sisters usually are the most people who complain i have my menses and i can't pray pian and to hajjud and recite the quran during the last 10 nights of ramadan now i'm getting it back again what can i do this is unfair hold your horses with hardship the reward is greater we don't have this at least i think i don't have it i have 13 daughters so i'm maybe beginning to grow a womb i don't know i hope not but uh you guys have more reward than us when you're patient and accepting that this is allah is the key when you complain when you make problems then you have a problem so a lot of the sisters come and say what can we do we can't fast the night the ten days of of the hijab we can't pray this is not fair no i'll tell you some of the things that are a handful and you can insha allah implement it and do it and be among the first to reach jannah with the grace of allah to the highest level may allah make me and you among those so one of the best things to do in these blessed 10 nights or days of the hija without any doubt ramran hajj because this is the season of it now our year is an exceptional year because due to covet 19 hajj has been restricted only to uh this is not an earthquake i just changed the way i sit and it's wiggly so don't don't worry we don't have earthquakes here in saudi alhamdulillah may allah protect us so we have only 1 000 pilgrims performing hajj this year and this is a huge reduction from the 3.5 billion three four four uh 3.5 million but this was called for because of the new uh pandemic that everybody is confused about so this is not our issue but generally speaking yes nothing beats hajj and umrah especially at this season because this is the season of hajjan umrah among the things that you can get closer to because allah loves it when you do good deeds in these 10 days imagine the prophet salallahu says allah the almighty says my servant will not get closer to me with something more beloved to me than what i have mandated upon him so do you mean sheikh that if i pray fajr on time this is more beloved to allah than praying six hours of night prayer the answer is yes it is quality versus quantity so do i understand that the pillars of islam are more important and beloved to allah than voluntary as it is yes and this is one of the biggest issues the biggest problems that we have which this is not the right time to discuss that the muslims have which is priorities so you find a muslim abusing another muslim consuming his wealth cheating him but he is masha'allah excellent in reciting the quran or memorizing it what are you doing said i'm a kaari i am a person who does umrah every couple of months i'm close to allah you are way way wrong in the way you think the first thing your priority is to do what allah has obliged upon you then you gradually go down not the other way around you don't pray six hours of night prayer and you cry and you weep and five minutes before fajr time you're tired you sleep and you wake up at 11 o'clock am to make it up all of what you've done is gone down the drain because you have had your priorities mixed up so first of all ensure that you do your obligations correctly so in these 10 days is it obligatory upon you to obey your father and mother in what is halal and not haram the answer is yes go ahead is it mandatory for you to when this is one of the beautiful good deeds that you do during these 10 days and throughout the year connecting your kinship what do you mean sheikh the prophet said assam he who sivirs his kinship will not enter jannah whoa but i pray five times a day this is a major sin you wanna do good deeds give your uncle paternal maternal give your aunt paternal maternal give your cousins same gender watch out give your brothers sisters give your nieces and nephews a call get make a gathering tell them come and let's have a meal or need so that you connect was with what was severed due to misunderstanding due to misbehaving from their side due to any reason this is time to patch up affairs if you are interested in getting close to allah azzawajal among the most important things to do during these 10 days and this is very easy the sheikh says and the vast majority of muslims says whoa man this is too difficult i'd rather pray i'd rather read quran than do what you're saying that i should do what could that be well the prophet alaihis was said in an authentic hadith stay away from sins and you'll be the most righteous person so most people say oh so all what i have to do is to refrain that's easy man i'm gonna do that no yahi it's not easy refraining can sometimes be the most difficult because shaytan is messing up with our minds and i'll give you a small example i don't see you guys so don't be offended and you say oh sure who's addressing me i don't see you don't be offended if i say if i see you maybe you can't be offended allah azzawajal told us to grow the beard no what i always thought that he told us no allah did not tell us to grow the beat i got you prophet muhammad hasn't told us maybe the shaykh is ahi the prophet said ali leave it honor it leave it so if i it doesn't grow don't bring fertilizers to grow it by force leave it he told you not to shorten it not to shave it so he told you to refrain is there anything difficult in that no but look at the vast majority of muslims the easiest thing is to refrain yet every single morning they get the form they put it they get gillette blade three xyz and they shave and then they put some after shave lotion ah it burns man and they say okay now it took me half an hour now i can go to work imagine if allah said in the quran or in the sunnah you have to shave your beard every morning shaytan works out opposite everybody among the muslim world this is so much man this is a burden that we have to do every single why would we shave why do we have to shave why not leave it natural subhanallah and this is how shaytan works but this is not our topic so come on we don't have all night long i wish we had but so if you avoid sin don't watch haram wow i'm rewarded you've done something that allah loves don't listen to something don't say something that is haram don't act in haram by touching by walking by doing things that allah does not approve of if you manage to refrain from haram you're the excellent man you're the man you're the righteous practicing god-fearing person that allah loves now among the most famous among us muslims to do during these last 10 nights or 10 days is to fast and this was reported by some of the wives of the prophet islam that the prophet used to fast him and every year we get those uh people saying well we don't have an authentic hadith and it's not clear and it's this and it's that and fasting is a bidder what the heck what do you mean said yeah yeah the prophet it was not proven this hadith you guys are referring to are not that authentic yeah to you it's not that authentic to us it's authentic two scholars of hadith they're authentic hypothetically they're not authentic i gotta ask you a question is fasting a good deed or not yeah it is okay didn't the prophet say that there are no days that good deeds are beloved to allah more than them said yes so if i fast and do good deeds you're coming to tell me that this is an innovation that's a difficult question oh well i actually i meant fasting the whole nine days is an innovation so skip a day that why would i skip a day the prophet mentioned the whole nine days the whole 10 days actually of course the day of age you don't fast so we fast the nine days especially the day of alpha you know that day of arafah expiates a sense of two years so this is one season no muslim in his right mind would miss so fasting definitely is one of the good deeds that you can do sisters there with with their men says oh i cannot fast i just mentioned a whole list that you can do so if you have and this is one of the glad tidings i'm going to give you and it's free and this is a bonus i'm not asking you for money if you want you will find inshallah the bank account later on anyhow if you have a tendency sister to fast arafat in the nine days every year or most of it and this year allah azzawajal ordained that you have your menses the god tithing is you get the nine days with arafat accredited to your account because the prophet gave us the glad tidings when he said whoever falls sick or travels allah accredits him whatever he used to do when he was healthy and residing so your type of illness is something that allah preordained upon women upon females so don't have any doubts that allah will give you the reward which you used to do that is fasting good deeds praying if you were prevented due to your menses what else among the best deeds that we can do is charity paying charity to the poor into the needy and with this lockdown we have seen the rise in poverty levels all over the muslim world and i mean really poor and imagine people who earn on daily basis people who work as painters as plumbers as construction workers and laborers when they are prevented from going to work for four months so income is zero they're even prevented from traveling going back home okay let me go home at least i have a house i can eat from my farm i do anything so so no sorry there's no traveling so i'm locked in my home i can't work what do you want me to do to steal this is a predicament that lots of the muslims fell into so now it is time to give a helping hand to look for those around you who are honorable whose dignity prevents them from approaching you and telling you that listen my kids are starving some people would rather die of starvation rather than beg people so look for them around you in your neighborhoods and try to be helpful as much as you can and remember that the prophet said alaihis he said that a sadaqa a charity extinguishes the heat of the graves for its inhabitants so if i pay now tomorrow when i'm in my grave and it's hot my charity would come and make it air conditioned it would extinguish the heat in my graves in my grave and the prophet said allah and a person on the day of judgment he is under the shade of his charity so you hit two birds with one stone 10 first 10 days of tilheja give and give generously what else you can offer night prayer and we all know that and you can read a lot of the quran what do you mean by a lot of the quran us normal muslims usually recite one jesus per day this is throughout the whole year the average i'm talking the average muslims there are people i know i know one of my relatives who recites from memory five a day meaning that every six days he finishes she finishes the quran and she goes on and on doing it so normal people lazy people like us recite the quran once a night or a day one jesus so that every month they finish the quran every month following month they begin again these ten nights continue with reciting one jesus a day but add to it three other more so you would recite four one which is the monthly habit and three so that you would conclude it by ten a quran a separate of the quran in this street when this is very easy if you are among those normal muslims who pray 11 rakah every night so instead of reciting robert now you're going to recite hizb so the first rakah one hazard the second rakah the second hazard this is one juzo so every khatma of every turk has one juzo one juzo one jesus one jesus these are four joseph hamdulillah it doesn't take more than an hour maybe less than an hour and it doesn't feel anything man you have the whole night to sleep afterwards you have the whole day to sleep afterwards but make sure that you try your level best to finish the quran in these ten nights and for the sisters who are suffering from their menses you can do the same i can't touch the quran you can touch it with gloves you can read it from a tafsir which the tafseer is more than the quran you can read it with from your mobile phone from your pda from your computer whenever there's a will the roads always away among the things that you should do during these 10 days is to remember allah and this is a field if we were to talk about it will consume another half an hour remembering allah there's so many valuable things that you can say in very little time with so much huge reward subhan allah 100 times alhamdulillah 100 times allahu akbar 100 times 100 times it doesn't take you more than like 10 to 12 minutes in the hadith of when she came to the prophet sermon asked him i'm old tell me something that is not difficult and that will gain me a lot of rewards the prophet told her to say this so look for the hadith and just imagine how much reward you can do in one day by repeating this or saying it so many other times so vikr is very crucial and important specifically people know this but we usually say it after prayers no you say it after prayers when in the last three or four days so the day of arafat in fajr we say it after every prayer beginning from fajr of allah the day of eid we continue the first and second and third day of the shriek we are ayam to sleep we also say it but the last time we say it is the of the 13th of the hijra after that we stopped saying it because after afterwards it's and it's over however during the first 10 days we do it which is not specifically after the salawat no we do it all time 24 hours so we do it in the morning in the afternoon and the evening and when we're driving our cars when we're sitting with our family in our homes and our shop shops and it's highly recommended to raise your voice so that everybody knows unfortunately now we tend to be a bit you know uh uh shy if i go to the mall and say allahu akbar allahu akbar people look what what is this this great crazy old man what is he shouting so only muslims know that this is a sunnah and maybe other muslims would support me by repeating on their own and raising their voices unfortunately nowadays no people are so reluctant to express their pride in honor of the religion that they would like to keep things concealed and there are so many things but i think i will conclude with this beautiful hadith which i have already uh delivered a a a lecture or a number of lectures that are so uh uh full of beneficial things what are they the hadith is um by ibn umar may allah be pleased with him and he said that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said the most beloved of people to allah is the one who brings most benefit to people so this is a great thing for you to do in the 10 days of the hija bring benefit to the people let me continue and the most beloved deeds to allah is one you can count if you wish you can write it down one making a muslim happy subhanallah try to introduce happiness to those around you especially your wife your children let me be general especially your spouse so if you're a woman make your husband happy it's about time 25 years hard labor living with you and at least do something for him make him happy make him smile for allah's sake once in his lifetime anyhow don't be a male chauvinist again let us go back make a muslim happy sometimes you can make people happy with just a gesture with just asking about them the prophet goes on to say alice islam or relieving him from hardship so i can see someone who's worried who's depressed i can speak to him i can try to help i can put a good word for his to his boss and relieve him from this hardship that he's going through or paying off his debt allahu akbar how many muslims around us who have debts on them not to buy an amg e63 gts4 or whatever not to buy a mansion to live in no rather to pay for the necessities why do you have this i had to take my wife last week to take her chemotherapy because she is a cancer patient and i didn't have money so i had to borrow pay off his debt you want good deeds go ahead this is what the prophet is telling you in salaam or warding of hunger from him how many muslims are suffering from drought famine and starvation look for them try and do something for them for the sake of allah azzawajal the prophet says al-islam and i'll conclude by this the prophet says allah for me to go with my muslim brother to meet his need is dearer to me than observing erticaf in this masjid for a month the message of medina what the prophet is telling you to go with your brother to that department or to that government agency or to that businessman and intercede to facilitate what he needs this is better for the prophet allah to sit for atikaf for seclusion for a whole month in his masjid in medina how many of us can utilize their reputation i need you to speak to my boss because of this and that i don't have time i don't have time you can get a counseling session half an hour for a hundred dollars what is this i don't have time i'm busy man no are you stupid this is the time where you utilize and fill your grave with what you need to find after you are buried so if you can help muslims if you can put a good word this is the time to do and this is why when you read in the quran and he allah made me blessed wherever i am this is a true muslim a true muslim is not a person who is good in his masjid only or he's good in giving speeches everybody can speak everybody can be eloquent a true muslim is the one who's blessed with his wife with his children with his neighborhood with his colleagues and co-workers in his trade with his kinship he is what we say in management has passed the 360 evaluation so we ask everybody around him above him and below him subordinates and superiors everybody and they say thumbs up the guy is perfect so we go to his home his wife his children excellent father excellent husband this is the blessed anyhow i think i talked a lot and if allah wants good for you you will find that doing good deeds in these 10 beautiful coming days of the hija is pretty easy and allah is blessing you and blessing your time and your effort but if allah does not want well for you due to your lagging behind due to your laziness due to your sins then you will nothing would change nothing would change so make dua in your sujud make dua at the times of response and answering that allah would give you the strength to get closer to him and to perform and to offer whatever allah azza loves [Music] allah we thank you for those wonderful words of insight and the wisdom allah bless you and keep you with the ummah for years to come to be a benefit i mean in the few minutes that we do have before you need to leave and there was a question pertaining to perhaps if you could explain the sunnah of rasulullah when it comes to part of the virtues of the days of and the month of hajj is that we engage in the act of uther of sacrificing for the sake of allah subhanahu wa ta'ala so if we could a little bit highlight that and also what the wisdom of rasulullah is as we find with in his uh to make himself of to withhold cutting or trimming your nails during that time if you could please highlight that for us as you all know is the sacrifice and the people from the subcontinent they would uh call it qurbani and this is not a a an islamic terminologist it's what's the ruling on that the prophet stated that it is through his action as for the hadith who ever has the financial means but does not offer must not approach our muslim prayer this the most authentic opinion is that it is a hadith that is not a hadith that was to the prophet which means that the prophet did not say it so what's ruling on is an emphatic sunna that muslims should do some scholars went a bit further and said that if a person is financially capable it becomes mandatory upon him and i personally believe that this is the most authentic opinion and closer to the sunnah but those who are struggling or who are not that um capable of uh finding the means to slaughter it is not mandatory now the prophet said in authentic hadith he said that whenever the crescent of the hija is detected and one of you intends to sacrifice the he must refrain from clipping his nails and taking any of his hair whether it is body hair facial hair or hair in general so this is an order from the prophet haslam once the first day is acknowledged and this happens in the previous month so on a monday afternoon which is the 30th or the 29th of the day we're okay we can clip our nails we can trim our mustaches we can shave our heads um remove the pubic and the um underarm armpit hair this is all totally legit no problem once the sun sets there is no problem we don't know if tomorrow is the thirtieth of the or the first of the hijab you can continue to do that the moment it is announced that okay we've cited the crescent off the hija which means that tonight is the first day of the hija you have to refrain so when i refrain do i become a mushrim what do you mean we know that a person wearing a haram is the one who's prohibited from clipping his nails and shaving or taking some of his hair so i get people asking me so sheikh does this mean that i have to stop having intimacy with my spouse i said no only thing you have to do is not to clip your nails and not to take anything of your hair on your body you want to wear perfume you want to wear normal clothes you want to have intimacy you are totally permitted to do this without any problem then the people say okay what about if i'm sinful i three days after the month started i shaved my beard or i cut i had a haircut or clipped my nails you're sinful full stop does this impact my odhia does it impact my sacrifice no it doesn't but you're sinful for disobey and you can you should continue whatever you're doing um one of the most frequent questions that i know that people usually ask my father slaughters a ram every year and we are 10 of us in the house do we all have to refrain from flipping our nails and taking the hairs no only the one who is slaughtering who's paying so if you live with your mom you die your father died and your mother is the one who is going to slaughter the sacrifice she's paying me her son to offer the sacrifice so who's the one who's to refrain from clipping and taking the hair it's my mom but i'm doing the slaughtering but she's supposed she's financing it so she's the one who's doing it i'm doing it on her behalf so should i refrain no i don't refrain she refrains so i hope this answers some of the questions that you were hoping to be asked we also have a question in relation to continuing with the topic of ut should preference be given if a couple a married couple are parents and a subsequence that during the time of hajj just before the month of dulhajja they had a newborn child do they then give preference to slaughtering for the sake of ut or for completion of the child's based upon their financial needs some of them may not be able to uh afford both and then the person also would like to know if we are able to join the intention in one animal for utrea and of the child the last statement is the correct statement alhamdulillah the scholars uh reported that if a person has an at the same time he can combine both there's no problem so yes the apica would be slaughtered with the intention of africa and would be slaughtered with the intention of here it's the same animal and there's no problem if you're wealthy and you separate and you slaughter two of them that would be much better but alhamdulillah there is room to combine and also to for a lima as well you can combine and there's no problem with that there's another question that i think is a little bit controversial um but a question i would like to know what is your opinion concerning the taking of the moon sighting of saudi arabia should those within other areas or regions or countries around the world take to the sighting of the mumlekka of the kingdom or should they suffice themselves with the local sighting of their country or region if they pray maghrib with saudi arabia there's no problem inshallah so that would then mean yeah and in terms of the matalia that it is the same night because it's the same evening that they are with saudi arabia then they can take the sighting of uh see why do you want to fast ramadan with saudi arabia when your fajr is two hours earlier than ours because the sun comes earlier to you rather than us so this is why this and that's okay if you do not unify the prayer time due to the fact that the sun rises differently and sets differently likewise when it comes to the moon sighting it should be the same concept the prophet is when he told us about the beginning and the end of the month he related this to the sighting of the moon so that we know that the end of shaaban is due and the beginning of ramadan is due and also he said the same with the end of the month of ramadan and seeing the eighth so this is what we should follow regardless of the country so the question that would come and say oh sheikh very smart very smart what about hajj we have only one hajj so how can we have arafa on tuesday in saudi arabia where everybody is in while arafa in india is on wednesday and in the united states it is on monday answer this smart alec answer you anything we have the scholars who say this on arafah it's not the day of arafah in saudi arabia that counts it is the ninth of the hijab depending when did the month start in malaysia or in morocco so it is not this this particular day in uh uh saudi arabia yes this is called araf in saudi arabia this is what the people are following in saudi arabia but the people in kuala lumpur in malaysia they are following their moon sighting so if they saw the moon sighting a day before us or two days before us they have to calculate their arafat according to their moon sighting not according to the moon sighting of saudi arabia and this is what ibn abbas may allah be pleased with him and with his father said to the man who came from a sham and he told him that we and the muslims in syria they started fasting on a friday and even abbas says well we started fasting on a saturday and this is the sunnah every region has its own moon sighting and they can act accordingly um so essentially what we are saying then is that the ibrah the significance is in accordance to the ninth in and of itself and not with the day coinciding when out of our falls within the precincts of makkah and the great uh jazeera the arabian peninsula if that is what we understand from your statement and one last question insha'allah would be in terms of early on you highlighted the importance of the the greatness of these days of and something that stood out was right at the beginning sheikh you said that allah subhanahu wa ta'ala prefers some days some months some years some hours above some days and some evenings as well so if that is the case that these days are great definitely in the site of allah subhanahu wa ta'ala and we are advised and encouraged to exert ourselves to the best that we can then equally should it not be the case that there is a warning and he'd be taken in terms of falling into sin as well during this time of course and this is manifested in chapter nine surah when allah explained to us that the months at the side of allah are twelve these 12 months there are the four sacred months allah stated do not transgress do not wrong yourself in these four favorite sacred months and imagine we have four sacred months and we have three hajj or the the months of hajj and the sacred months are muharram and rajab number seven which is like six or five months apart so three of them are in row no the three months of hajj are shawwal which is not one of the sacred months but are two months that are sacred and at the same time two months of the hajj so definitely if and i mentioned this in the beginning if you are unable to do good deeds if you are unable to complete the quran if you are unable to make vicar if you are unable to give charity if you are unable to help people the least you could do is to refrain from sinning and disobeying allah azzawajal we sincerely thank you this evening for your time that you have given us of your busy schedule and alhamdulillah we have indeed benefited a great deal and we are honored that you have uh presented yourself this evening to convey a message of hope of encouragement and nasiha to the ummah we ask to bless you and your family in abundance that allah subhanahu wa raises your rank in the dunya and in the akhirah that allah grants you an immense amount of wisdom and insight so that you may continue to serve the ummah upon excellence we are indeed honored and thank you for your presence with us this evening may allah protect you may he grant you the best of this life and the next i mean you have honored us for having me and for wasting your time with me listening to creepy creepy man telling you things that you already know and i pray that he blesses the muslims and the people of south africa and it's a beloved country to my heart and uh inshallah your dawah will flourish and with wisdom and with following the quran the sunnah and always count me in whenever you guys have any similarities definitely definitely at least at least we can inshaallah see our brothers and sisters there definitely this is your home inshallah to allah the institution of sunnah as you've said we strive to uphold and implement the teachings of the quran and the sunnah of rasulullah upon the understanding and implementation of the saleh the righteous buddhists of this ummah we definitely look forward to having you again insha'allah in the near future so we accept that humble invitation and request from you barakallahu and i have thank you"
