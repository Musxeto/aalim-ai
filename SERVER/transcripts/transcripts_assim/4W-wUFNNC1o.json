  "transcript": "from the uk says what's the ruling on doing khatm khatm is a tradition in the subcontinent where in whenever they have gatherings or events such as mourning the deceased they usually meet on the third day of his death then on the 40th then after a year and they collectively read the quran so they give one small chapter out of 30 chapters of the quran and they all read it in like 20 minutes or 25 minutes so they consider themselves have recited the whole quran and they devote or dedicate the reward to the disease or to this or to that this is a total innovation the prophet had never done it allah the companions had never done it may i'll be pleased with them the tabi's so with all due respect the deen the religion was completed in the lifetime of the prophet if this was not performed then then this is not part of islam make you may call it part of anything you want an innovation indeed but this is not part of islam"
