  "title": "Is it permissible to kiss our parents feet in Islam? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "says is it permissible in Islam to kiss your parents feet kissing a person's feet is not something usual especially in our times however in order to look into a specific matter to determine whether it is permissible or not we have to go back and cross-examine it with the Quran the Sunnah and we will find that in the Sunnah it was reported as an incident or two where the Jews kissed the feet of the Prophet Allah in one incident and some of the companions may have kissed the feet of the Prophet Allah though he did not recommend it or even liked it that is why Scholars concluded from these evidences that it is permissible to kiss the hands of others and in some cases defeat of others providing that there are a number of conditions fulfilled such as that this person is worthy of kissing his hand and his feet such as in the case of parents Scholars of Islam Etc secondly that the person you're doing this to does not want it some of those dignitaries or rich people or influential people they do this to others to kiss their hands you know you don't do this at all this is not permissible someone who wants it don't give it to him also this should not be a habit meaning that once they've lived every blue moon yeah this is fine the parents kissing their feet massaging their feet Etc this is normal because they have lots of Rights over us and it's a form of showing your humility to them so inshallah there's no problem in that and Allah Knows Best"
