  "transcript": "while watching the new moon sighting it felt like a good day lighting this day is so bright as the first time always the night with family around the nice meal we're making duan i feel how nice it is to be so neat to those i love and welcome to this new program or this new episode of virtues of fasting hadith number 28 is a hadith that was narrated by mother aisha and mother um may allah be pleased with them both they said that the prophet of allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam would rise in the morning when it's already fajr time while he was junob and this means that he was in the state of major ritual impurity due to intercourse and that would be on a day in ramadan he would then perform russell and fast and this hadith was agreed upon now first of all this hadith was narrated by aisha be pleased with them and they are telling us about something that is private that no one else would know about the prophet and as mentioned before so many times this is one of the advantages of having more than one wife that the prophet are sam was a role model and hence whatever happened behind closed doors should be revealed to the ummah so that they would know how to treat their spouses and how they would be in their privacy etc and this hadith mother aisha and mother um may allah be pleased with them tell us that the prophet would be intimate with his wife and hence would be in the state of major ritual impurity also known in arabic as janab and what is the meaning of janab janaba is a state that is it is not something physical you can touch and see like the word and if you recall or purity is defined as uplifting the hadith and removing the najas and what does that mean you have two things in order for you to be pure first you have to be pure physically and this is done by puring your clothes your body and the place where you pray at this is needed for prayer so this is physical if there is an physical impurity you have to wash it and remove it and there is a ritual impurity and this is something that is divided into two minor and major the minor one require you to make wooden so if you pass went if you urinate if you defecate if you sleep if you eat camel's meat in this case your wudu is void and you have to perform moodle to uplift the minor ritual impurity the major ritual impurity are usually referred to two things one the sexual ritual impurity and this is when a person is in the state of jannab and he is described as junob so what is janab arjuna it is a sexual ritual impurity it's a major impurity and how does a person reach such a state by either intercourse with or without ejaculation or ejaculation with or without intercourse what is intercourse this is what happens between a man and a woman a wife and a husband and the actual physical intimacy takes place and the man does his thing so he cannot go a little bit more in detail this is rated pg program but you get my point i hope now even if the man does not ejaculate by the penetration itself this requires russell the prophet says al-islam when the two places of circumcision meet then russell becomes mandatory and if a person does not have intercourse yet he ejaculates and seaman comes out whether from the man or from the female then again he or she is in the state of janaba the sexual ritual impurity the major impurity and this requires that they take a full bath known as rusul so is this related to fasting some people think it is related in the sense that i cannot fast while i'm in this state of impurity but there is another state of impurity as well and it's considered to be a major impurity and that is when a woman is in her menses or in her postnatal bleeding after delivering a baby this period of bleeding is also considered to be hadith or a major in ritual impurity that requires that she refrains from praying and fasting so now we come back to the issue of fasting if a person is in the state of major ritual impurity is he allowed to fast the answer is given to us by isha and um we please with them they said that the prophet allah would be in the state of ritual impurity and the adhan of fajr will be called which means that he has to refrain from things that nullify fasting such as eating drinking and intercourse and yet he is still in the state of major impurity and this would not prevent him from going and having his russell his total bath his mandatory obligatory bath and then go to pray fajr and he is fasting during the day of ramadan which means that it is not a requirement to be in the state of purity from sexual intercourse when the adhan is called what is required is that you do not have intercourse after that is being called because this is one of the things that nullifies your fasting but being in the state that was prior to the then done this does not affect the fasting is it the same with a woman who is in her menses well let us look if a woman for seven days has been having her monthly period and five minutes before the advent of fajr she recognized and she saw the sign of her purity and how does this or how does she know that she has become pure by either the total dryness the blood completely stops and she's dry no colored discharges brownish or yellowish at all or by the white uh thread or the white like thread discharge if she sees that without any colors then she knows that she is pure and immediately after seeing this with her intention to fast the following day the adana fajr is being called so what to do the answer is she should take her hustle and she should pray and fast without any problem because she realized that she was pure before the adhan unlike someone who knows that she will become pure like 10 o'clock in the morning or in the noon so she refrains from eating and drinking and intends to fast that day in this case we tell her when did you see your purity she says at ten o'clock at nine o'clock in the morning we tell her that in this case your fasting is invalid because it is a prerequisite that you see your purity you could recognize and realize your purity before the adhan of fajr before the break of dawn in this hadith the prophet salat wasallam is giving us the lead in the sense that it is okay for a person as mentioned in the quran to enjoy his or her spouse the whole night but the minute the dawn breaks this has to stop the case or the state a person is in due to that intimacy does not affect the fasting and the fasting would be accepted from this hadith we learn that even the things that people may be ashamed of shy or feel bashful of they are entitled to say it to convey it because this is the only way to learn and that is why female companions of the prophet allah used to come and ask him and say allah is not bashful of truth does a woman have to have hustle if she sees the ejaculation fluid and um be pleased with her put her hands on her head and said you you've exposed women you have what are you saying what are you doing you're saying something that we should be ashamed of and the prophet forbade her from saying this ali susam because she had to learn her religion she had to ask even if it was a bit shameful but to know your little religion there is no shame in that not to know to continue to be an ignorant this is the greatest shame on uh um earth that could be possible so i hope this uh clarifies the issue we move on to hadith number 29 and this hadith was also agreed upon mother aisha may allah be pleased with her said the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said whoever dies while he still has some fasts to make up then his heir should fast on his behalf and this was agreed upon now the prophet allah is telling us that whoever dies and he has to fast but he could not so what is intended with whoever dies with days he should have fast but he didn't what is intended scholars say that it is referring to only mandatory fasting so voluntary fasts you cannot make them up on behalf of a deceased only voluntary fasting and what are the voluntary fastings one making up for ramadan two expiations three oaths or uh uh vows that a person mandated upon himself for a reason or without any reason so scholars differed and some of them said no it is totally prohibited to fast on behalf of a deceased person can we pray on behalf of a deceased person no so likewise we cannot fast but of course this is rejected their opinion is rejected because the hadith is agreed upon so bukhari and muslim reported it which gives it the highest ranking and authenticity some scholars say that you may fast but only if the fast is a vow why because there's a hadith that a man came to the prophet israel and said the prophet of allah my mother died and she had a vow to fast a month should i fast it on her behalf and the prophet told him islam if your mother had a debt would you have paid it for her and the message yes so the prophet said that allah's debt is more worthy of being paid off so the prophet ali gave him the green light to fast on behalf of his mother the vow that she could not fast or make up for third group of scholars said no with all due respect the hadith is general and the hadith is referring to a person who dies with days to be fasted but he did not fast them and it would not be logical that the prophet would give such a general hadith and you say whoever dies with days on him to fast and he could not fast it then his heir should fast it on his behalf he could not say this in a general sense and he refers only to vows which are considered to be very few days compared to the missed days of ramadan because usually people when they die they leave a lot of days missed due to their illness due to their old age due to any reason so compare this to the vows you would find that there is no comparison people rarely do vows to fast compared to the days missed in ramadan so what is intended in this is the fast that is mandatory whether it is making up for days of ramadan whether it is a vow or whether it is an expiation now is it a must upon the air and who what is the definition of air some scholars say that only those who inherit would fast on behalf of their deceased so if you're a son you may fast on behalf of your father who died with days not made up others say no his air here refers to anyone that is related to him so even your cousin who would not inherit can also be included in the hadith now when the prophet says allah his heir should fast is this an instruction a recommendation is it an order the most authentic opinion is that this is not an order this is a recommendation why because allah azza would not burden a soul for something it did not do whether it was allah would not burden me for someone's else sins i didn't do anything and hence it is not mandatory upon me to fast on behalf of my father or on behalf of my brother who died likewise if my father died leaving debts and they came to me wanting me to pay my father's debt this is not an obligation upon me i can and may and should give them from whatever my father left behind so i would get the inheritance before distributing anything of it the first thing i do i have to give it to the letters and if it ran out without fulfilling their dues they'd have no right to come and claim it for me and i don't have to i'm not obliged to pay them because this is my father's that not mine and it is not inherited likewise when it comes to fasting this is something that is recommended you should do but it is not mandatory upon you so who do we have to fast on his behalf after his death for example my father fell ill the whole month of ramadan and on the day of eight he died who should fast on his behalf the answer is no one why because it was not mandatory upon him to fast allah azza told us that those who are ill or traveling they may fast on later days now did my father get a chance to fast a single day after his illness the answer is no he died immediately hence allah would not hold him accountable and it is not legitimate for us to fast on his behalf there is no need for that likewise if a person skips the whole of ramadan and he recovers on the day of eight and he dies on the tenth day of eight meaning that he had the chance to make up for nine days of ramadan and he didn't in this case his heirs are requested to fast nine days what about the remaining 21 days of ramadan it's not obligated upon him because he did not have the chance to fast the whole 30 days he had only the chance to fast nine days likewise if he died but had four or five months of health and recovery and could have fasted but didn't and died in this case they are requested to fast the whole month can they fast or divide it between them so if he has 10 children can each child fast three days so the total would be 30 days then says yes there's no problem in that and this does the job for them what about if a person is chronically ill and he's unable to fast ramadan and he dies on the day of eight what to do you should expect meaning that you do not fast on his behalf because he's not obliged to fast he's obliged to feed so you give the expiation by feeding 30 poor people for the missed days that he did not pay for or did not feed on because he's chronically ill he's not obliged to fast he's obliged to feed others what about if a person was chronically ill and he fed the people and then this was his habit for five six years feeding the people every ramadan but this particular year he felt much better and for three months he could have fasted he got his health back so is and he died do we fast on his behalf the answer is no because when he fed for the whole month of ramadan he was entitled for that because he was chronically ill his recovery which was unexpected and the doctor said no you should not have recovered this does not count and what is gone is gone alhamdulillah what about if he is obliged to fast consecutive numbers a number of days and this is for example if a person is ordered to fast two consecutive months as in the case of killing someone by mistake as in the case of vihar as in the case of having intercourse during the day time of ramadan while fasting or as in the case of expedition for breaking an oath you have to fast three days in a row consecutively so can we in this case when someone dies if my father dies and he has to fast two consecutive months can me and my siblings divide these two months by one sibling fasting a month continuously and then i follow that immediately and fast the second month the answer is no whatever requires to be a consecutive to be in a row it has to be performed it has to be done by one particular or one single individual you cannot break it because it was made to be consecutive so giving it to two people would defy the purpose of its obligation and well i think that this is about it and again it is not mandatory upon the heirs it is highly recommended and a lot of the people say okay why then can't we fast mondays and thursdays on behalf of our loved one why can't we fast the white days for them because this would become an innovation had not had it not been for this hadith making up for miss days for a deceased would have been an innovation because we don't have this the things that we can offer to our loved ones who have died are mentioned in hadiths such as dua and this is the best thing you can do secondly charity giving money as in the hadith of s other companions thirdly hajj and umrah so you can do um and you can do hajj badal this is possible by appointing someone even if you are somewhere away and abroad by paying a few dollars few hundred dollars you can get someone appointed to make umrah by paying a little bit more of course you can get someone to make hajj on behalf of your father behalf of your grandfather behalf of your on behalf of your loved ones so these are the things that the prophet assad told us about never ever he told us to recite the quran never ever he told us to fast voluntary fasts but only to fast the mandatory fasts etc um i believe that this is all the time we have for the first segment we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back the forgiveness of your lord and to paradise the width of which is the heavens and the earth prepared for the righteous and pious brothers and

complete discharge it was like that usually happens when you interpose or it's just a discharge in case when you came to come closer to your spouse so has my and his past nullified if yes so what is the punishment or what should i do to uh for uh for this past so there was no uh uh penetration and there was penetration it was penetration but not like in case you will intercourse or a complete discharge you can say but the penetration was there yes penetration was there okay and the second is that my father has gifted his house to one of uh his daughter that is almost half of his property during his life and he wrote it he gave it he gave it to her or wrote it as a will yes no not when he gave it to her as a gift during his life okay so is it lawful i will answer your question thank you you're welcome uh um just listening to you uh previously speaking my father uh died and he had taken some loan from his brother now the grandfather's property is being divided and one of the uncle says because your father took a loan from us therefore we will cut your share of the inheritance so that you pay the loan that the father took now is this correct okay and my second question is a very dear friend of ours married a non-muslim girl and a christian girl and he uh to please her he said okay i'll turn into a christian and then his parents when they got to know that marriage finished and he on his mother's assistance went and did shahada again although he said i didn't do it by heart and everything now when their property's been distributed they have said you cannot get any property because during the lifetime of your father you change your religion could you enlighten us if that's correct whether he is uh able to get some property from his father i will answer your question you're welcome uh um then i will wake up in the night and i pray tahajud is it okay why don't you delay the witcher after tahajjud uh yeah that's what i want to it is compulsory to do that order yeah this is highly recommended as long as you know that you're going to wake up definitely okay okay and my second question is somebody told me that the fire in jaina will not touch the person who recites allah after fajr and maghrib is is this correct and third question is in what circle like islamic messages to our cousins families and friends can we send the islamic messages to all in the group like to all my cousins families and friends also because one of my cousin brother he told me that whatever i am sending the islamic videos are very useful to them and they are learning much they are educated with this so is it correct to do this chatting and whatsapp okay i will answer inshallah okay from saudi uh first my daughter she's six years old and she says she wants to fast but what if she breaks the fast even she has to do the kafara okay and the second is people sit and pray or perform the salah without any reason means simply they are tired or like that so is it allowed to sit and pray in the salah uh if the husband has an ejaculation without intercourse but the liver does not touches the wife's body in that case does the wife also have to take the basu okay i will answer you inshallah allah from saudi arabia to mix with some other water other normal or drinking water with them utilize it for the long period if i have a little quantity and as okay any more questions uh no i'm not saying from tomorrow every day i want to ask you inshallah okay you're welcome sadia says that her husband had intercourse with her but he did not ejaculate the penetration itself without ejaculation requires the general or the major expiation which is to free a slave or if that is not possible to fast two consecutive months if not possible to feed 60 poor people and this is without any dispute among scholars if there is an intercourse this takes place immediately and uh uh this is for both man and women even if there is no ejaculation we have um aisha from emirates i have three questions yes uh first question is my mother is one for hajj and this is her first time so she doesn't know if after islam can she since it's a long duration okay and my second question is during salah at your focus should be on this uh area correct my third question is this was your question yeah my mother uh she she has to give her zakat so can they send the money to uh raza since uh there's the war going on over there okay i will answer your questions inshaallah from saudi arabia i have a couple of questions my first question is about my sister lives in the uk and she doesn't have any moss near her house so she they did not hear azan or they are starting their first now the thing is that she has whole time and prepare time and she woke up at the prayer time and she thought it was the slow time and she started eating and there's a difference of 15 minutes so she just ate for 10 minutes and then assumed that uh that she had the fasting has begun so is her fast uh valid or she has to make up for this one okay my mother-in-law she um she just pays the execution and she cannot pass so does she have to pay the execution every day to a per person or if she pays one for 30 days is it okay or not okay one more question it is like um i've heard that if a person is like dying and they say that people say that we should recite surah yah seen beside them so that it becomes easier for uh for the one uh like that it doesn't make like does it do anything by reciting surya second question that a father gave his his daughter a property which uh is approximately half of his wealth is this permissible if he has only uh two daughters this is permissible if he's going to give the other half to the other daughter but if he's unfair with his offspring this is a major sin and it is not permissible and he will be punished for that on the day of judgment she says that um um sarah her second her first question her father died leaving debt to his brother but their father the grandfather had property which her father her uncles had share in so now after the father is dead his brother wants money from him so they went to look into his wealth and could not find anything to pay off for the debt so the uncle said due to the fact that your father who died has inheritance from his father who is your grandfather in this case we will take your uncle's debt from your father's share in that is this right yes this is totally correct and uh um they are allowed to do this so that your father would rest in peace in sha allah as for her second question her brother committed an act of apostasy and became christian and while he was christian his father died and then afterwards he separated from that woman and he accepted islam back again so is he entitled to inherit his father the answer is no because one of the conditions that a person can inherit another is that they share the same religion when the deceased dies so due to the fact that your father died when he was an apostate he has no right in his inheritance we have um abdullah from saudi arabia i have three questions yes um i live in five and i came to shut that to drop my son and i want to go for umrah now the question is is my meerkat five do i have to go back to five to uh get myself or can i do it from jesus where did you make the intention to make ramra in but i'm not mushram right now i just came from but i you have to go back i didn't know the intention i will i want to go to makkah now you have to go back you have to go back because your intention before you left five is that you make umrah this means you have to make your me your haram from the qatar from so go back again okay my second question is people from thais or jeddah when they go to mecca do they no they don't because we consider this to be as a suburb of mecca so we don't okay um can you tell give some information on youtube in the last 10 days of ramadan also should it be for all the 10 days or should it be for a period of time and what about if the husband and wife want to be together is it allowed during this time okay okay and we have muhammad from the emirates for somebody else if somebody has a in a suffering base suffering from anal fissure problem and plus actually oozes out from that area does it invalidate the vudu so he has a problem with his anus yeah anal fissure is there and then now what has happened recently is a bus starts oozing out from that area suddenly sometime first comes out from the area there's a flow of past or some fluid from there so does it invalidate the water and if this condition remains dnight how does a person read quran okay i would try to answer your question inshaallah thank you so much you're welcome from nigeria what we are doing i mean yeah i have two questions one i want to find that uh is it allowed for for a fraudulent woman any day that she cannot fast is he allowed to feed anybody okay or she needs to to pay back the fasting after the amount of ramadan second question the second question i want to find that is it permissible for someone to perform hajj or umara for his uh for his later father or mother okay i will answer the question okay question she says that is it true that a person would be saved from hell if he seeks allah's refuge from hell three or seven times after maghrib and after fajr there is a hadith that whenever a person says this the hellfire says o allah protect him from me but this does not mean that he would not be punished for what he had done this is up to allah to whether to forgive or not as this is the manhattan unlike the hawari the khawaris say that whoever makes a major sin he is doomed in hell forever and he is like a kafir the uh no those who do major sins they are to be punished but at the end of the day it is allah's decision whether to forgive or to punish them she says that is it permissible to send islamic whatsapp or messages or on facebook on twitter to my nan men relatives cousins etc the answer is no you should refrain from doing that and if there is a need to do that let your brother do it or your father do it because this breaks the ice at the beginning it is masha'allah my cousin this is fun this is nice what about this question what about that and it leads to the traps of shaytan you should refrain from that farhad from saudi arabia she says that her daughter is six years old so if she breaks her fast is there any expiation let me rephrase that you are 35 years old if you break your fast is there an expiation no there's no expiation except for those who have intercourse during the day of ramadan those who intentionally deliberately break their fast they are sinful but they have to make up for that day a day for a day nothing to be paid now for your six years old uh daughter we say jazakill thank you very much it's very good of you to have fasted but if she breaks her fast there's nothing uh for her to do this is yeah and she should be trained but no expedition insha allah she says that i've noticed some people pray sitting down mandatory praise fault prayers without any excuse well their prayer is invalid there are pillars for prayers some say 14 some say 16 some say 15. and the first pillar of the pillars of praying mandatory praying is to stand up when you're able to do so if you don't have any legitimate excuse you do your prayer is invalid so if it's voluntary yes they can pray sitting down they will get half of the reward but if it's a mandatory prayer it is a must for them to stand up and if they don't their prayer is invalid she said that if a husband ejaculates but without any penetration without any uh intercourse and does this require the wife to have an obligatory uh bath a ritual uh bath as well the answer is no as long as she did not ejaculate even if she get in contact with uh the seamen this does not affect her uh status of purity she does not need to perform russell uh allah says what's ruling on mixing them some water with other water this was reported by some of the companions whenever they got water from media from makkah to medina it was a long journey so when it came to any run out they used to add water to it so that the blessing would continue this is permissible especially for those who are living abroad aisha from the emirates says that her mother is going for hajj what's your ruling on changing her clothes no problem if you want to change your clothes every single day there's no problem even a man when he's wearing his iran it is permissible for him to shower and to change his without any problem during prayer should we look at the place of prostration when standing yes when when bowing some say that you look exactly underneath your head which is in the middle area some say you look at the place of prostration some say look between your legs so it seems that there is room for maneuver when you're sitting down you look at your finger as you are moving it into shahoot so you constantly keep on looking at your finger while uh you're moving it uh third question for aisha was can we send zakat money to huzzah the answer is yes they are poor they are needy they are doing jihad fisabilillah so everything fits them as long as you know that the agency or the person delivering the zakah would give it to those who need it and legible for it um says that she lives in the uk and she doesn't have any masjid next to her home and even she she did they don't call the adhan like we are privileged to uh uh do in muslim world so she says that there is a difference of 15 minutes between the prayer time and the whole time and this is something i did not understand if she meant by prayer time meaning when people actually have the akama then yes but if she means that it is a time of adhan the time of the adhan is the time where you should stop eating not 15 minutes before she said both ways that she woke up and she thought that it was still time she ate for 10 minutes and not knowing that it is a time of fajr no problem if a person wakes up in the middle of the night or just before fajr thinking that it is still night and he eats and drinks and feasts thinking that it is still night and then he finds out that the adam was called half an hour ago there's no problem in him his fasting is correct her uh aunt she asks that she's unable to fast because of her age or because of her chronic illness so she says can she feed the same person 30 meals we've addressed this point yesterday and we said that she can feed the same person every day of ramadan so today is like like what wednesday she feeds this person after maghrib tomorrow thursday she feeds him after maghrib again so every day she is feeding the same person no problem but if she collects the 30 days at the end of the month and she buys food sufficient for 30 meals and she gives it to the same person this does not do the job she has to give the food to 30 different poor people she says what's the ruling on reciting yasin for the person who's dying or the for a deceased the answer is the hadith is weak it's not authentic so it is not part of the sunnah aisha from saudi arabia says what's the ruling on wearing perfume if while fasting does it affect fasting no it doesn't but as a female you know that you cannot wear perfume and then pass by or go out of your home where nan maharam would find your scent this is totally prohibited um abdullah from saudi arabia she says can you talk to us about ertikaf the duration and the relationship between a man and his with and uh his wife i believe that we will discuss this inshallah in a couple of days time so i'd rather keep it all and give it to you uh as a package deal if we have any callers we can take their questions now inshaallah muhammad from the emirates says that a person has an illness and he's got pus coming out from his anus uh does this uh voids his fasting if it's coming from inside then it does void his fasting but if it's coming from a wound or from something that is uh around the anus not from the inside deep down inside then it does not affect his uh fasting how what okay we have mali from canada my son just bought a house and it's on mortgage and i was listening to one of your programs and this anything to do with rebar interest is haram so how can um we living abroad how do we help him not to get into this state can we pay his house outright or and he can pay us back an installment is that okay okay i will answer your question thank you very much you're welcome okay so let's assume that um muhammad's question about this person who's got this bus coming frequently how does he perform mudo or recite the quran this is called the continuous uh najasa that is coming out like someone who has a problem with urine and he's dripping all day long in this case the scholars say that when the adhan is called when the time of prayer is due you uh change whatever is tarnished or or has the jason you perform wudu and you go from the time of the prayer to the second time of the prayer you can pray and read the quran regardless of what comes out from you aisha from saudi arabia listen to me from the phone please and mute your television okay should i ask my question yes okay i'm also asked about brushing the teeth during ramadan like you wake up in the afternoon and i also want to ask about the lateral speed okay yes those are my two questions i will okay and muhammad from nigeria he says a pregnant woman can she skip fasting and give expiration or she must skip fasting and uh make up for the missed days later on the answer is if she's capable and strong enough to fast she must fast but if she's afraid for her health or for her child's health in this case she can't skip fasting but she can make it up later on inshallah can we make umrah or hajj on behalf of our deceased father mother uncles cousins loved ones friends neighbors the answer is yes you can do that molly says that her son bought a house a mortgage it's riba based so what can we do if the price is fixed so he's he bought the house for 300 000 dollars and the lump sum is fixed it will never go up or down due to inflation or due to uh the interest rate coming up or down if it's 300 000 and it's he's stuck with it and now he's asking allah for forgiveness and repented but he's paying installments it would never increase not a single penny in this case no let him pay it for the duration for 10 years whatever they have agreed upon because it's fixed but if it it goes up and down meaning that if there is a possibility that it would add fifty thousand dollars more or a hundred thousand dollar more in this case this is a must uh uh getaway uh situation you have to bail him out give him the whole money
