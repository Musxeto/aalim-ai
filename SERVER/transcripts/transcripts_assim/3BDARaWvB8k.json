  "transcript": "Musa from Azerbaijan Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh is holding the shower on your forehead and moving it to right and left enough to make all the face wet in wudu as it flows down but I still think that the water doesn't reach the zone which is uh the lower part of lower jaw and a bit below ears like the corner of lower jaw this is something you have to be certain of how would I know so the easiest thing the easiest thing to do is to wipe your face and that's it the area underneath your jaw is not from your face so you don't have to wash this this is your face and this is what you have to wash and Allah knows best"
