  "transcript": "sain from the Emirates uh she I'm Reber and I saw uh one video on YouTube about um she in Egypt talking about an interview with the jeene I did not finish the whole video is it permissible for us to watch it fully uh interview with what uh there was a shi in Egypt and then uh he said that he interviewed a gin back 20 years ago yes and and and is the Jin speaking and this is a live interview yes they said that the gene went uh to the human body he did not uh show his actual form I did not finish the video cuz I don't feel like watching it no you don't have to watch it it's a merely waste of time and you you've done well by not watching it the concept of Jin possessing humans this is a well-known fact we believe this as Muslims because this is mentioned in the Quran in Surah Bak chapter 2 it is mentioned in the Sunnah it is mentioned by the salaf we have no problem in that but to exaggerate it and inflate it to this extent we have an interview with the Jin and so what's your name this is the my name is jinny so and so so how long you've been in the body of this uh boy said I've been there for 3 years but we have company we have uh Mr Max and Mr uh so and so what is this no this is totally bogus this is not real it's all fiction and made up but we believe in the concept itself watching it is a waste of time and it does not benefit you and it doesn't get you closer to Allah"
