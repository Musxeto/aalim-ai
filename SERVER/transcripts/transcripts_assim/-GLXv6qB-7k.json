  "transcript": "um the next question is that is it true that we can change with Dua and if everything is written how can making Dua change what is written so I'll ask you a question do you know what is your yes or no so how do you know if you make Dua that it change or did not change you don't know so is something that Allah had written 50,000 years before creating the universe it's fixed but also told us the prophet that the Dua can change so I make Dua so how could it change something that was written 50,000 years ago before creating the universe because in what was written the Dua was also written it will change so Allah pred divined that I will have an accident on XY Z day and I make Dua Ya Allah save me Ya Allah protect me and then underneath that it's written because of the Dua that this person did the accident will be avoided this son of his will fall sick and should die but because of his Dua and his mother's Dua Allah cured him and made him live so yes Dua is part of the but you do not know what is written for you so you make Dua and Trust Allah whatever is good for you will happen don't say I made Dua and nothing happened this is because you don't have belief and that's why Allah doesn't respond to your Dua because you don't believe but if you believe Allah will make things happen better than you what you have anticipated"
