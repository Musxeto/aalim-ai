  "transcript": "idris from uganda okay anyways for me what to do on akita if i have my daughter to do when i'm sweating or when when to shake the head okay first of all when a person is blessed with a daughter or a son among the first sunnas is a technique which is to eat a very tiny little piece of date in your mouth until it becomes watery and you take a very tiny tip of it and put it in the ceiling of the child's throat or mouth and this is preferably done by someone who's righteous in the family if not then the father would do if not the mother would do there's no problem in that among the sunnahs is on the seventh day the head would be shaven and scholars differ whether this is only for male newborns or also for female newborns i am inclined to say that it's for both because the hadith states that remove the filth from his head and the filth is due to coming out of the mother's womb with all these uh um discharges on the scalp so shaving it would remove it for both male and female the sun is to weigh this hair with silver and give the amount of silver in charity it's probably like couple of grams so it's negligible but you give it in charity for muslims the poor and the needy the sunnah is to name the child on the seventh day but also there is a sunnah of naming the child before it's born or after it's born immediately so it's up to you you can name the child whenever you want the sunna is to slaughter a ram for a baby female and two rams for a uh uh baby male newborn among other sunnis and allah knows best you"
