  "title": "Ruling on fasting Friday or Saturday (voluntary or mandatory fasts) - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question is what is the ruling on fasting on the day of friday is it prohibited fasting on friday if it's voluntary fasts it is not permissible to fast it alone as per the hadith when the prophet salallahu salaam ask one of his wives may allah be pleased with her who was fasting friday she said i'm fasting so the prophet asked her specific questions alice islam did you fast yesterday she said no then he said do you want to fast tomorrow which is saturday he said no he said breaker fast now voluntary fasts saturdays and sun and and fridays the most authentic opinion is that they must not be done for general voluntary fasts except in one case that is when you fast the fasting of dawood peace be upon him so we know that he used to fast every alternate day which means that if you fast a friday this week next week you will fast a saturday so it will be friday sunday tuesday thursday then you will fast saturday alone then monday wednesday friday and so on so in this case because of fasting of dawood and you're not fasting friday or saturday for friday or saturday this becomes permissible only now in making missed fasts of ramadan which is mandatory or expiations which which are mandatory or fasting a vow in this case again you can sing signal out single out a friday alone and fast it without any problem because this is mandatory and allah azza knows best"
