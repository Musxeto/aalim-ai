  "transcript": "brothers hate is a hanafi but he follows the sunnah whenever he is convinced with it there's nothing wrong in that being a hanafi or being a humbly or being a maliki or shafiri is totally permissible and legitimate and don't believe that there are people who say no i'm i don't follow any school of thought most likely they're liars most likely not all of them why because he would most likely follow his sheikh so he's following the al-bani or he's following meaning whatever says so if he's not a hanafi he is even or an albani and still is following someone so all of us follow a particular school of thought when we don't have a clear directive from the quran and sunnah to follow and i'm one of those so i'm a hambali by madhhab if i don't find in a particular uh problem evidence is from the quran and sunnah that backs it up and clears it for me then i go back to my medha because now it's too ambiguous the way above my pay grade so i have to go back to my reference which is my method until proven otherwise"
