  "title": "Can women wear Anklets? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "zeyneb says is it permissible for women to wear anklets dancer is this is permissible and it is not only permissible it is mentioned in the Quran in surah - Nora where Allah tells women not to strike the ground with their feet so that the sound of the anklets would not draw attention of men this defies the hijab imagine the beauty of hijab Allah Azza JAL prohibited women from striking the ground with their feet when they're walking they hit it a little bit stronger so that it would make a sound and this sound would reach the ears of men and they would know that this is the sound of an anklet just the bare sound would lure them and tempt them even if they don't know whether this woman who's walking with this anklet is an elephant or a gazelle still Shaitaan works like this so Allah prohibited them from making a sound with it in order not to tempt men so the norm is if you are at home among your Muharram with your brothers and father with your husband and children there's no problem at all in wearing it if you're going out if it makes a sound you have to take it off if it doesn't make a sound but it looks nice you have to cover your foot by default and not expose it and show it to the people and Allah soldier knows best"
