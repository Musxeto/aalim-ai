  "title": "Who does Allah guide & who does He leave astray Why worship Allah if all is Pre-destined Assimalhake",
  "transcript": "says whom does allah guide and whom does he lead astray is this something in our hands or is it only allah who can decide this and the servants have no role in this whatsoever so maryam is asking about predestiny she's asking about al qaddar and the belief in al-qaeda is a very important thing in a muslim's belief because without it he's not a muslim there are six pillars of iman to believe in the pre-destiny whether it's good or bad so what maryam is asking do we have a role in whatever is happening or are we just simply like a leaf in the wind tossing us wherever it wants this is something that ahlu sunnati firmly believe in one that allah azzawajal is the creator of everything which includes our own deeds so what i'm doing now what i am acting what i am holding what i am fixing what i am watching all of these are my actions but were created by allah azzawajal as there is no other creator except him so when i make rumrah and go around the kaaba these actions are created by allah and i'm doing them and if someone steals or kills another he could not have done that without allah azzawajal creating that so we believe that allah is the creator of everything we believe that allah azzawajal knows everything so the knowledge of allah azzawajal is unlike anything we can think of allah is not like us there is nothing like unto him subhanahu wa'ta'ala so when you come to think of power when you come to think of his healing and seeing when you come to think of his beautiful attributes nothing is similar to him subhanahu ta'ala including knowledge and as imam ahmad interpreted an an older salaf when they were asked about what is pre-destiny what is khadr they said it is allah's knowledge so allah knows what was in the past what is happening now what will happen in the future and what will not happen how would have it been materialized if it were to be to to take place also we believe in allah azzawajal willing what is happening and there are two types of divine will the things that allah tells us that he loves and he tells us that he doesn't love so he wills and he subhana ta'ala tells us that he loves people to worship him and he hates people when they disbelieve in him yet he gave us the free will to choose so if we choose this then this is what complies with allah's divine legislative will and we believe and we do what allah loves but if we choose otherwise this goes with the universal divine will of allah azza which whatever he loves or does not love may not impact it it's going to happen why he could have changed it yes he could have but he willed not to change it he gave you the free will to choose and you chose that this is what he also wills over you and allah says for whoever wills among you to take a right course which means that allah is giving us the right to choose for whoever wills among you to take the right course and you do not will accept that allah wills lord of the worlds so your will and mine is related to allah's will we cannot make a will unless it complies with allah's will so we have allah's knowledge we have allah's uh um creation of our deeds we have allah's will divine will and we have also the fact that allah has written everything that is going to happen till the day of judgment 50 000 years before allah created the creation so everything was created every everything was written and allah knows exactly what's going to happen nothing going to change so now i can ask okay then why am i doing this why am i worshiping allah if it's already pre determined predestined that i will go to hell the question is how do you know what was or what is predestined for you how do i know that i won't make a million kuwaiti dnr next week in a business transaction because if i think like you do in worldly matters tomorrow there is a business deal i'm not going to wake up to attend it there is a possibility that i may gain a million kuwaiti dinar but because allah predestined everything so probably i will lose true and probably you will win likewise why do you eat the food in front of you if everything is predestined if allah wants you to be full you will you will be full without eating this is insane allah has created this universe and he has put rules and regulations that everything should go through the sun comes from the east every day and it sets in the west every day nothing changes until the day of judgment when the sun rises from the west likewise allah says eat or you'll die of starvation in order to eat you have to go and cook in order to cook you have to work and earn money you may succeed in earning you may not this is not your problem your problem is to do what you're told so pre-destiny everything that is happening is in allah's hands now you don't know what allah has written for you and this is why you'll be held accountable for whatever you do but believe me if you do your level best and you trust allah and you believe in predestiny as part of the six articles of faith you will be in safe hands those who are doubtful those who are dubious or or thinking bad about allah azza all the time they will end up in hell because they do not believe in the qatar of allah azzawajal and at the end of the day between you and me don't share it with people at the end of the day who owns you allah who possesses everything in this universe allah who has control over everything in this universe allah if allah would take the whole universe with the angels with everybody with the prophets with the humans with everybody in this universe and toss them in hell fire can anyone object can anyone do anything about it no but we believe that allah is fair allah is just allah is kind allah is wise and he would never ever do this so trust allah azzawajal have faith in him and at the same time do your due diligence in this life do your best and your best would become fruitful on the day of judgement be it"
