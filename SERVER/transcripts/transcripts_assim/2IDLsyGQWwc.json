  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Canada my question is about \ndelivery when women do give delivery via C-section   and not the normal delivery are they still uh do \nthey still stop praying up until 40 days or can   they pray as usual okay so brother [Questioner] is \nasking about the period of nifas nifas is the post   natal bleeding so if a woman gives birth she's \nobliged to observe herself the period of 40 days   and this is where she is not allowed \nto pray fast or be intimate with her   husband in a sense of intercourse until \nshe sees her Purity performs her Ghusl   this might be a full 40 days it might be less but \nit cannot exceed 40 days so his question is if a   woman does not have natural birth rather she has \na C-section cesarean operation so does the ruling   continues and remains and then says yes the ruling \nis the same she has to observe herself for 40 days   some women May bleed for three or four days and \nthe blood stops and she sees the white thread   like discharge she performs Ghusl and she \nprays fast and if her husband is interested   be my guest but if the bleeding returns within \nthe 40 days of her birth or a delivery she has   to refrain and consider that to be postnatal \nbleeding nifas and it goes on frequently so   she may perform also two three times four times \nwithin this period of 40 days and Allah Knows Best"
