  "title": "How to find khushu, submissiveness, concentration in prayer (Salah)? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um how can I find khushu in Salah means I pray Salah but I am unable to concentrate inshallah okay first of all I think on my YouTube channel there are five or six video clips that may assist you in that so I highly recommend that you go and check them But to answer your question or submissiveness or the ability to concentrate in your prayer is not something that you can adopt immediately it's not a pill you can take or an injection that would secure this state to you rather it is a full life transformation see what bringsure to Salat one knowledge knowledge of what knowledge of whom you are praying to so if your heart is filled with knowledge of Allah of his might of his greatness of his Mercy if you know the beautiful names of Allah and his attributes when you say Allahu Akbar your heart is filled with the love of Allah when you have the knowledge of the meaning of what you're reciting when a a slave or a servant says Allah replies to that and says my servant has praised me my servant has complimented me Etc so when you know that there is a Hadith that talks about the fat as a form of dialogue when you recite it you don't just simply I mean what did you do you'll have to have for sure in that when all what you think about is your work in the kitchen the groceries when you're going to get the children from school your wedding that you're attending at the end of the week the festivals here and there and your in-laws and your relatives you finish and you have not benefit from Salat so it's not something I can give it to you in a few minutes or seconds I myself am struggling with it I've been struggling with it all my life we will reach a time when we will have no struggles and we will enjoy it when we reach this time we will attain Allah's forgiveness the prophet says whoever makes a perfect wudu and praise to rakais two does not whisper in them or speak to himself full concentration and submissiveness he will be forgiven all of his previous sins if you manage to do these turakas you've got it made it can't happen overnight it requires a lot and a lot of hard work but then the sweetness of the results would make you forget everything hard that you had to encounter"
