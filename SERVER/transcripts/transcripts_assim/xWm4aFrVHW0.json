  "title": "Can we use Paid Apps or Discount Cars that have Free Deals, Rewards, Coupons,  & Discounts?",
  "transcript": "robia says there are certain paid apps which provide copons for people to benefit from restaurants spa etc example when one uses any coupon uh of any brand they will buy one and get another one free like if one goes to an open buffet with his spouse they will only pay for one person and the other is free with the app coupon are these types of apps permissible to benefit from because one will buy the app for a package in order to get the free deals for the whole year there are a hundreds of brand in app and each brand has three free coupons vouchers the answer is no this is not permissible because it involves gambling so discount cards and many other things that are similar to it where you buy a specific card for 100 euros and you will avail a lot of discounts in five-star hotels in some restaurants in some spas etc and they have a booklet this big scholars say that this is a lot of ambiguity in this because you may buy the the coupon or the app and not use it so money down the drain and you may buy the app or the coupon and you would benefit thousands and thousands more than the actual value so this ambiguity where this these discounts may come to a fact or not is not permissible i and i'm sharing this with you for the first time in 1982 that was a long time ago they came up with uh a similar scheme here in saudi arabia and i participated in it and i went at that year traveled overseas i think to the us or something like that and i booked a room in the specific hotel hilton hotel where it stated that it would give me 30 when i went there they said we don't have anything like this we don't have any agreement with that uh company so i took all the invoices and when i returned back i filed it to them and required a reimbursement and they never came back to me so most of these companies they have schemes they have um tricks down their sleeves even if they were legit again this transaction is not permissible due to the fact of ambiguity and not being [Music] any legit"
