  "transcript": "uh i think we have a caller for him which is best to pray the sunnah of russia just after the congregation with the imam or to pray after the tarawih hand with them should it be in the order like sunnah fish tarawih and wither no of course the sunnah is to pray the sunnah of it immediately and not to delay it after taraweeh the only way which is acceptable acceptable is when the imam is super fast so immediately after asia he stands up and prays taraweeh which is wrong you should advise him but if he does this and doesn't listen to you no you you uh can delay the sunnah of isha afterwards other than that no you have to pray you should pray it after isha immediately and allah knows best you"
