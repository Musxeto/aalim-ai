  "transcript": "jahin says i've heard that the prophet isaiah had once prayed and assa combined without any reason so yesterday i missed the a lot for some important work but i did not forget i simply combined asar and is that permissible first of all jahin you've mixed between combining in arabic it's called jammer and shortening in arabic is called castle shortening four rakah prayers into two can only be done when traveling out of your city boundaries and limits so the prophet had never done this while he was in medina combining between the nasa as one set and malaria as another set was done by the prophet islam once only in medina and there was no brain or illness abbas may allah be pleased with him indicated that the prophet sallallahu alaihi did this so that he would not burden his ummah how to understand this first because the prophet did not do it except once and there was no rain no fear no illness the scholars the vast majority of them said that such combining is not permissible unless there is a legitimate reason to take a person out of his norm from praying each prayer at its prescribed time there has to be a justifiable legitimate reason for him to combine so even if i'm in my hometown if i have an important thing to do that prevents me from praying on time or causes great hardship on me this becomes okay because it's once in a lifetime once in a blue moon but when i have some work to do at the office and i delay the and then i pray it with asar this is not permissible if i have a class and i have to attend the class but until the time is out and i prayed when i go home with isha this is not permissible why because i can ask for five minutes or seven minutes from the teacher to go to the toilet if i'm at work people get coffee breaks people get smoking breaks so why not go to the toilet and make wudu and pray in seven minutes or six minutes and come back you don't have to go to the masjid you don't have to pray voluntary praise and sunna rather you pray the fault but if a person has once a year an exam that he enters before sunset and they will not allow him out until after the isha prayer is called for and this is an exam this is a hardship that allows you to combine maghrib delay it and pray it with aisha a person who is a surgeon or even a patient goes under the knife sedated before sunset wakes in the middle of the night he prays combined because he has a legitimate reason and so on you"
