  "title": "Is taking literal meaning of Allah is in front of us when we pray Anthropomorphism AssimAlHakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "afifa from america so there is a hadith that implies that allah is in front of us when we pray let me quote it abdullah ibn who reported that the messenger of allah said if one of you is in prayer let him not spit in front of himself for allah is in front of him as he prays and it's narrated in bukhari so if we take the literal interpretation wouldn't it be anthropomorphism because we're implying that allah is literally in front of us okay which is not befitting to his majesty okay i'll answer you in a simple uh um logical explanation now is it logical that we come to this one specific hadith and understanding and understanding it in a way that may indicate that allah has what the terminology you've said i don't know how to say it always says it and i never thought of even writing it down which means that allah has a body and allah is like humans and creatures etc and this is not related to allah azza we don't say that allah has a body and we don't say that allah has does not have a body we say that allah is described as he described himself so if you say that allah has a body in the sense that he has hands and he has a face etc these are attributes are there you cannot say he has a body because this was not mentioned and you cannot deny that allah doesn't have a body because allah did not deny this upon himself unless when you come and say that his body is like our body he has hands like our hands a face like our faces so we have to walk a very thin line here so coming coming again to your question the prophet is telling us allah azza is facing those who pray so those who pray in china and those who pray in the u.s which is almost 12 hours apart they are all facing allah azzawajal and this means that allah is so great subhanahu ta'ala that it does not fit into our imagination we cannot imagine this when the globe is like this and we always say that allah is above us so one says okay australia is down under how is it possible this earth this solar system this galaxy this universe is nothing compared to allah azzawajal you cannot understand because we only think of three dimensions but there are fourth and a five fifth and a sixth and maybe uh god knows how many dimensions out there so this is something that we cannot relate to because our understanding is limited to three dimensions now this hadith has to be understood among the all of the evidence of the quran the sunnah and here you would find that everything falls into place allah is in the height allah is above everything allah is upon his throne and the whole universe is like a ring tossed in a desert a ring in a desert compared to the kursi the place of the feet and the corsi compared to the arch to the throne is like a ring tossed in the desert and allah is greater than all of this so definitely no one dares to interpret the hadith without understanding that the whole concept of uh versus the quran and of uh the sunnah and without glorifying allah the almighty and allah knows better"
