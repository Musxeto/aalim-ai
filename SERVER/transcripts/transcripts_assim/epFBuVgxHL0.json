  "transcript": "I'm not sure of the meaning of chiming clocks but I believe they are the clocks that ring the bell at the hour and to me that it appears that this is permissible because the Bell mentioned in the Hadith when the prophet was traveling once and said he said that do not accompany with us any BTS because these BTS attract Shan uh these bells are similar to The Bells found in churches so the Bells on your telephone or the bells that come from your doorbell these do not uh uh or cannot be part of the Hadith or the things that attract Shan and the clocks the the normal wall clocks that uh sound uh make a sound on the hour they are not part of this and there is nothing wrong in that inshallah"
