  "transcript": "rayann says can a Muslim be vegan or complete vegetarian the answer is up to your preference if you're doing it because you don't like to eat meat no problem but if you're doing it because you think that slaughtering animals cruel or eating meat is unclean or unwise it's no this is totally prohibited meat consumption is part of our religion if you don't want to eat it because you don't want it this is up to you no problem but if you refrain from it thinking that you are doing something better than what the Prophet did or his companions may allah be pleased with him or sallallaahu Selim then you have something wrong and you have to do something about it this is all"
