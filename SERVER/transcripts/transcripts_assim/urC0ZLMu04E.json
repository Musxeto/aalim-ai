  "transcript": "at hamdulillahi rabbil alameen solo salam ala ala nabina muhammad in wada nene was ugly woman instead we had he was send a missionary here a medium mark assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh before I begin my lecture did you mention the title yes I did what was it - ha okay - I was yesterday my bad I was told that it was supposed to be X & Y according to the information I had I didn't read the brochure I acted upon the information that I got so yesterday is scheduled that was sent to me that was vicar and DA so we've done this and you can imagine my surprise when I came last night to prepare for today's lecture and I find that it says vicar Andorra that will be very interesting to repeat myself again so you can watch the video of yesterday inshallah and you have now a full hour free to do whatever you want but then the organizer said no we will give you another topic and it's totally new for me so today's topic is about repentance and seeking forgiveness before I go into my topic I only heard the last bit of your story about the boy speaking from the grave to Roma with all the respect to historians or narrations that comes to us from whether it's al have even kefir or as a hobby or not the balsamic definitely or a of these great scholars we have principles we have foundations so anything that goes against the Quran and the Sunnah we simply do not accept it because if I accept that this boy speaks from his grave to answer Omar I might as well accept that the prophet sallal are selling when I go to his grave he would also speak to me and I know people yeah I mean not in their full same capacity that claim and swear that they went to the grave of the Prophet arrest Allah - Salam and his hand came out of the grave and they give baya they shook hands with him and I keep telling them I hit up why did you pull him out seriously to solve our problems we have a big problem in this world he's the best one to solve them he could not answer back so such stories we have to be careful it's nice it is jaw-dropping sometimes it makes you feel good but Islam is not about emotions Islam is about for an authentic Sunnah with the understanding of our righteous predecessors the companions may allah be pleased with them the tribunal and the character in Allah knows best so our topic for today is about repentance and seeking forgiveness and without a doubt if you want to reach Jenna you cannot do so without repenting to Allah and seeking his forgiveness and the last there was an answers you if you make duaa does he not imagine who can be worse than a belief then Satan he says or Allah host mode me to the day of judgement making drum Allah says you're granted so if Allah answers a shape on a belief what about your drum so why do we go through repentance and asking Allah for forgiveness on and on and on again first of all because these are part of Allah's beautiful names and attributes Allah is known to be at a web this is one of his names and hit one of his names as well is Rafa Rafa Rafa now these three names all stem from the same source there is Allah Farah and in Arabic this gives the idea the notion of protection you know that warriors the soldiers they wear a helmet in Arabic is named it's called al middle formal why is it called milf um because it protects your head from the blows so when you seek Allah forgiveness when you make it till the far this means that you're seeking almost forgiveness you're actually asking Allah Azza WA JAL for two things to conceal your sins and not expose you and to protect you from the consequences of the sin do you think that when you send there won't be any consequences you will be led to do whatever you want nothing comes free without a price you fall into sin there are consequences maybe in this dunya maybe Allah delays it to the day of judgment and this is why a lot of us we thin and we wait where is the following blow is going to come from and we don't see anything so sit huh okay it was overlooked we sin again and we sin for the third time until we until our lives would be full of sins and we would feel safe from being punished this is when the punishment comes when you're least expected and unfortunately in the past the scholars the righteous people when they used to send they used to know exactly what they had done the Imam says I make a sin and I immediately see the effect of my sin on my ride horse or a camel it's become stubborn it doesn't drive well and on my spouse's behavior my wife is a sweetheart but because I've sent a few hours ago when I come home she's nagging she's fighting she's not polite with me so he says I know where I got this from because of my sin nowadays no one of us can do this because we are indulged in an ocean of sins so the car breaks well I don't know was it this or that or number 10 or number hundred or number thousand since the children are sick I lose my job I mean that my health is not as it used to be all of these are due to our sins the Prophet says alayhi salatu wassalam highlighting the beauty of is still far seeking a lot forgiveness he says if almost servants were not to send allah azzawajal would create other creation of his who would send and then seek allah forgiveness and a large the wa jal would forgive them and he most forgiving most merciful this beautiful hadith shows us that Allah the Almighty loved that we sin correct Allah loves that we sin I'll read the hadith again the people are asleep maybe they had a good breakfast the Prophet said that is full of Salaam if you slaves of Allah we're not to sin Allah will take you away and create other people who would sin then seek Allah's forgiveness and Allah will forgive them from this hadith do we learn that Allah loves to be thin no this is impossible allah azza wajal says in the Quran and Allah has made hateful to you disbelief defiance and disobedience this is something that Allah hates and made it hateful to you so what is the meaning of the hadith the meaning of the hadith is that Allah is most forgiving and hence he loves it when people ask him for forgiveness not that he loves them when they sin no this is something that is not possible or is not applicable yet Allah created us sinful as the Prophet said Allah salatu salam all sons of Adam are sinful and the best of this sinful are those who repent so having this in mind we should know that Allah Azza WA JAL is so great so magnificent that he himself who created us and does not need us does Allah need me to pray I need to pray does Allah need me to face a cat I am the one in need to pay charity and zakat and to do good deeds yet Allah the Almighty with all his might will with all his power he he's making himself subhanahu wa'ta'ala lovable to us he is being kind to us so that we love him not the opposite not the other way around Allah says in the hadeeth all my servants you sin day in and day out you still in the day and you sin in the night and I forgive all sins so seek my forgiveness and I will forgive you imagine allah azzawajal is addressing you with this he knows that you sin but he's telling you I forgive sins come to me and I'll forgive your sins allah azza wajal opened his hand to those who sinned in the night so that they would forgive them in the morning he opened his hand in the morning for those who sinned at night allah azza wajal addressed those who worship idols those who killed his loved ones those who've sinned gravely Allah addresses them with what with Hellfire with punishment Subhan Allah Allah says to them say o My servants who have transgressed against themselves by sinning do not despair of the mercy of Allah indeed Allah forgives all sins indeed it is he who is the forgiving the merciful this is one of the most beautiful ayats in the Quran scholars say that it was revealed when was she even helped do you know the name was she even helped he is the one who killed hamza even Abdulmutallab and after he did this he felt remorseful he felt sad his heart was filled with depression he thought of coming into Islam but he thought to himself how can I be forgiven I killed one of the best men in my time and I've worshipped idols and I've done heinous sins how can Allah forgive me look at my sins and yours compared to these since there's nothing and therefore Allah the most merciful revealed this beautiful ayah seeking forgiveness by the way is part of dhikr which we talked about yesterday the Prophet said are a histological Salam o people repent to Allah and seek his forgiveness for I seek Allah's forgiveness and I repent to him per day a hundred times and he also said Baba glad tidings and some scholars say Poobah is a tree in general where the rider travels for five hundred years in its shade how big that is and this tree is for those who the Prophet says it is for those who will find in their record books a lot of seeking forgiveness when you all the times they are so full of stuff for Allah for Allah then this would be for you does seeking Allah forgiveness have benefits in this dunya when I think a lot forgiveness does it have benefits it does have a lot of benefits and some of these benefits are combined in an ayah mentioned in Surat knows a large the result sells for elitist all of Europe become nor is addressing his people and he says and I am he said ask forgiveness of your lord so asking forgiveness is so far what are the benefits out of it he says indeed he is ever a perpetual forgiver he will send rain from the sky upon you in continuing showers so number one you complain of droughts you have problem with rainfall keep on seeking Allah's forgiveness and see what happens then he said and give you when you ask Allah for forgiveness increase in wealth and children so you have debt you have financial problems the whole day or what you think and say is a stuff little law a stuff for a lot and a lot that WA JAL would pay off your debts would improve your financial situation you complain that you don't have us offsprings you don't have children then ask Allah for forgiveness and you will have children of course providing your management and then provide for you garden and provide for you rivers all of these are benefits of what of seeking utmost forgiveness Allah is telling us the fruit but who would listen so one would say what is the easiest way to seek Allah's forgiveness the answer is a special law if you see as for Allah have you fulfilled it yes you have sought a lot forgiveness are there better ways of course say it it is still far the master of seeking Allah's forgiveness this beautiful drug must be in your dwellest in the morning and in the evening we have a long list of Torah that time did not permit us yesterday to mention see in my computer I have an anti-virus program anything anytime I get attacked it says don't worry you are protected likewise Muslims I walk I feel the evil eye due to my charm and my duty there laughing Jack Malaga I feel black magic you know you're going with the sorcerers and the witches and I fear jinn possession every time I look at my wife I fear Envy so what do I do I live in constant fear most Muslims live in constant fear because they're not protected wallahi if you say that a scar of the morning after Thatcher and in the evening weather after a thorough male with an issue of dispute among scholars voila he awake walk with your head tall I'm not afraid of anyone sure he will put a spell on you like hell he would well ah he he can't because I'm protected Allah is protecting me so we have a problem with a scab this vicar takes you straight to general insha'Allah takes me and you treat Yujin listen the Prophet said are the historic was Salaam the best prayer for forgiveness is to say I'll read it in English you all know it in Arabic Allah Aman terrible Allah hands Alexanian Abdul vanara happy Coartem us apart so the translation says o Allah you are my lord and I'm your slave so in gone this is the best etiquette you praise allah azzawajal by complimenting him and exposing your poverty and humility to him you're you're my Lord and I'm your slave you have created me and I am faithful to my covenant and my promise to you as much as I'm able I seek refuge with you from the evil of that which I have done I acknowledge before you all the blessings you have bestowed upon me I confess to you my sin forgive me for there is no one who forgives sins except you the Prophet says our institution whoever says this during the day believing in it with certainty and dies that day before evening comes will be one of the people of paradise the pack to Jenna say this drum and he said Adam salat wa salam and whoever says it at night believing in it with certainty and dies before morning comes will be one of the people of generated by the Imam and Buhari in the so he also imagined who's number one in our Ummah after the prophet alayhi salatu salam abu bakr so imagine when abu bakr comes to you and says teach me something to ask allah in my door in my prayer what would the prophet usually say abu bakr helped me with his money so ask allah for money for wealth because this helps islam he bought bilal and he set him free so money in the hands of abu bakr is beneficial because money most of the times when it's in the wrong hands it would make us arrogant it would make us wrong-doers and sinful because we have much out of it so with abu bakr it's a different story no he did not tell him this maybe he told him to have a big house maybe he told him to have children we know nothing the prophecies say abu bakr in your prayer o allah i have wronged myself greatly and no one forgives sins but you so grant me forgiveness from you have mercy on me for you are the oft-forgiving most-merciful this hadith is said to whom drunk Abu Bakr the Prophet is asking a worker to seek Allah forgiveness and to repent what does Abu Bakr half of the sins we have what did he do he's the one who used to hold his tongue and says o Allah this is what has taken me to the wrong places and we saw me to help had Alethia Aden is no Arab he is fearful of what he says and speaks and this one was given to him by the Prophet a little son to recite in his prayer do we recite this in our prayer do we say it with certainty this is seeking Allah forgiveness but what is the difference between seeking Allah's forgiveness and repenting there is a big and huge difference seeking a lot forgiveness is done mainly by the tongue sometimes the heart is accompanying it and this makes it the best way of seeking forgiveness and sometimes you're just rewarded by saying it and this is very very minimal to the extent that some scholars like Cheryl and Bernie he said that when you make vicar or is still far without contemplating upon it with your heart this is not accepted because it's like singing our song you're not paying any attention to it you just suffer loss of lots of Allah you change your channel ok let's see then your next video clip so for loss suffer loss so definitely you're not seeking a loss forgiveness you just saying something without contemplation now tell bus is far far greater than seeking Allah forgiveness allah azza wajal says and it is he subhana wa ta'ala who accepts repentance from his servants and pardons misdeeds and he knows what you do allah azza wajal beautiful name as the web in an Arabic this is an exaggeration meaning that he's constantly repenting over and upon his services not once he repents and that's it over you know he keeps on doing it day and night and a true believer when he falls into sin his heart is affected by it it's filled with remorse he feels the burn inside his chest fearing allah azza wajal fearing falling into the consequences of his actions or being thrown into hell once he feel that the whole world is so small that it cannot hide him from allah azzawajal when he believes that there is no escape from allah except to him when you see a lion when you see the fire when you see an enemy you run from them but when you fear allah you run to him you never escape a large division once Allah knows that you are sincere in your fear and in your repentance only then Allah would repent upon you and accept you Allah says but indeed I am a potential forgiver of whoever repents and believes and does righteousness and then continues in guidance Allah will keep on forgiving and repenting now why would anyone repent people repent when they know a large devotion so there are many reasons and benefits coming out of repenting first of all we repent in obedience Allah's order Allah ordered us not to send we felt weak and we send what to do next Allah ordered us to repent to him so if we do a lot for gives us if we don't then this is the consequence that we have to bear allah says o you who have believed repent to Allah with sincere repentance perhaps your Lord will remove from you your misdeeds and admit you into Gardens beneath which rivers flow and when perhaps comes in the Quran this is not for being doubtful the either as the people of the fear say as Allah meaning that Allah will do this but when we talk to one another perhaps I will come tomorrow this is probable when Allah says perhaps this is certain and it's going to happen when you repent this is a cause of success for you in this life and in the hereafter because the heart does not find its tranquility it does not find it easy and it would not feel that it is alive without repenting to Allah intelligence Allah Almighty said and turn to Allah in repentance all of you all believers that you might succeed if you repent you may succeed and you will succeed in this life and in the hereafter the issue is and this is extremely important for you to identify because all of this talk will have no benefit until you recognize and identify the core of the problem what is the core of the problem the core of the problem is that you and I do not feel that we are sinning so when someone tells me he repent to Allah as for forgiveness I would say insha'Allah deep down I would say what of other medicines but I have to be modestly assessed or more to belabor spam we fail big time to identify our shortcomings because we don't accept others to advise us if someone comes to me as a shoe I have an advice he fear Allah you've done this and this and this I keep on giving justifications and excuses I know you got it's wrong no you did not see me do this no you have to check your I glasses maybe you have to see a doctor when we fail to accept people's advice and we fail to look in the mirror to identify our own shortcomings we never seek Allah's forgiveness and we never repent a true believer before he goes to bed contemplates why did I say that word it's like fighting it's going to haunt me in my grave then it's going to haunt me in Hellfire why did I abuse that poor person why did I shout at my wife why did I miss treat my children I didn't hug them I didn't kiss them my neighbor invited me I didn't answer his invitation to a wedding or two out there up why and why and why and I'm about to sleep and wallah he I know so many people my own relatives who went to sleep and never woke up and they were healthy as strong as an ox as they say when you die when you sleep this is minor death it's called when you sleep you don't don't and this is why part of the drum bass McCallum a bargain be with Nicola Houma are found in your name or Allah I put my head side to sleep and in your name I wake up oh Allah if you take my soul then have mercy on it and if you return it so that wake up in the morning then preserve it as you preserve the souls of your righteous servants this is our drop part of your protection part of your antivirus but anti shape an anti evil eye and you have to keep on memorizing these before you go from your home before you write in your card while you're in your car before you eat after you eat when you enter the toilet when you come out when you sit in the morning in the evening everything is governed and controlled by these beautiful Ascar who doesn't want a lot to love him I once asked this question and a very innocent brother said I don't want a lot to love me so our villa why are you saying this said because if Allah loves me he's going to test me and if he texts me I'm gonna fail and go to hell so I think of what you say before you say you're going to hell both ways the way you're saying it you're going to help no way anything out of it no one can say I don't want a lot to love me you say oh Allah loves me but make it easy on me o Allah grant me that I fear this beautiful drop so I'm mixing between yesterday's lecture and today's lecture the dua that you see in the morning in the evening so many people come how can I protect my children from the evil eye from the jinn how can I protect my wealth I have a farm I have a company there's the Torah the Prophet says are less awesome in Arabic you look into it in personal muslim allahumma inni as a local theater for dunya and after allah - allah o allah she feeding what uni i were actually Ramadi and the rest of the door you can find these four things I asked you for forgiveness and protection in my religion in my world in my family and in my wealth if you do this in the morning the you're protected but who does and who says this and who says it with contemplation with concentration so every one of us need and want a lot you love him correct if you seek Allah's forgiveness and repent Allah will love you Allah says in the Quran indeed Allah loves those who are constantly repentant and loves those who purify themselves constantly repentant Allah loves you so you repent from throwing a soda can out of the window this is a sin you're harming people this means that all drivers in Nairobi should repent to Allah greatly because the way they drive Marshall I thought Saudis were bad drivers not after seeing mashallah the way you guys ride repentance is one of the great means of entering Jenna a lot the Hodja says except those who repent believe do righteousness for those will enter paradise and will not be wronged at all you repent you go to paradise this is a free ticket if you believe and this beautiful verse at the end of surat al-furqan imagine who can be worse than someone who takes idols and worship them other than Allah and they kill innocent people and they fornicate and commit illegitimate sexual act who can be worse than these people Allah Azza WA JAL said and those who do not invoke with Allah another deity or kill the soul which Allah has forbidden to be killed except by right and do not fornicate or commit unlawful sexual intercourse and whoever should do that will meet a penalty multiplied for him is the punishment on the Day of Resurrection and he will abide therein humilated except through canola listen except for those who repent believe and do righteous work for them Allah will replace their evil deeds with good deeds how is that possible scholars faith this has two meanings replacing bad deeds with good deeds one meaning is that those who associate others with Allah this is called what children Allah would replace it with no heat he will become a believer those who kill people and terrorize them allah azzawajal would turn this bad deed into being safe and secure to all those lives those who fornicate and make illegitimate sexual relationships Allah will make them have halal spouses and they will marry this is one interpretation the other interpretation is that Allah would turn the bad deeds into good deeds so you have 1 million bad deeds because of your ship and three hundred thousand sins because of your killing and 100 thousand things because of your fornication Allah would turn all of this into 1 million four hundred thousand good deeds good has an act and this is from Allah and this is also in an authentic hadith where the Prophet tells us Allah saw some that Allah on the days of judgment when he is holding his servant to account he would place a barrier advisor between his servant and the rest of humanity and he will show and expose to him his bad sins and deeds the small ones and he said did you do this on Thursday did you do this on Friday did you do this on this and that and he shows him his sins and the seven things comics I'm doomed I'm going to help these are all the small cents and yes I can I have to admit confess I have no other way and no other option then Allah says with my grace I concealed it in this life in dunya nobody knows about it and you were not bragging about it I used to listen to music on my own Allah concealed me someone else used to go in his car lower the windows and blast the music he is bragging about sins so Allah says I've concealed these things in this dunya and I can seal them in this life and turn them into good deeds the servant of Allah becomes greedy this is oh Allah there are major things I don't see the list you showed me we're all small since I have major sins that I do not see in Allah laughs and when we have a lord that labs wallah he will not be sorry on the day of judgement when Allah the Almighty laughs and laughter is part of Allah beautiful attributes that we believe in it as we believe in all other attributes nothing is similar to our attributes Allah aza is nothing similar to anything else so we believe that he loves we believe that he loves we believe that he is satisfied Soprano what an unlike his creation now repentance has conditions it doesn't just come like it's still far you say our stuff to Allah and that is it you cannot just say or love I defend to you end of story no there are conditions and the beautiful things about these conditions that they deal with the past with the present and with the future so there are five conditions for repentance and some scholars make them fix the first condition is sincerity you have to repent sincerely to allah azzawajal what do you mean shel I mean that if I were to be a thief and I have my toolkit with all different keys and I'm going to this brother's house to break in and steal his wealth and I'm determined to do this once I reach the hope that the house I parked my car I walk with my toolbox in the middle of the night and as I'm attempting to enter I see a police car chassis a storm or two really I'm defending to alarm going back home this dependence is for a lot no this is for the fear of being caught Allah will not accept your repentance because it is not sincerely for him likewise a person who smokes and gets cancer and he stopped smoking said masha'Allah he stopped smoking may Allah forgive you is it no I didn't stop smoking for forgiveness I stopped smoking for the doctor is it going to die so this guy's repentance is accepted though he quit but he does it is not for the sake of Allah and the Virgin the second condition is that you have to feel remorse the Prophet says early solar system and Amitabha which translates to remorse is repentance meaning that the majority of repentance is focused on being remorseful like when he says al had joke but abhava the Prophet says al Hajj Rafa that this does this mean if I only go to a lava and then go back to Judah I have completed my Hajj know there has to be no awful if although there has to be a harm there has to be so many things part of the pillars but the Prophet is telling us that the most important of all is other than the most important thing in repentance is remorseful remorse is something of the past I sinned in the past and now I'm remorseful Allah will forgive me the third condition is present time remorse in the past presently you have to quit on immediate effect meaning that if I'm smoking and I caught and I say Oh liar smoking is bad I have to quit I will repent okay what are you doing said I still have the packet I have to finish it so hopefully by till tomorrow maybe it will finish I will no this is not acceptable you have to repent on immediate effect you have to quit the sin immediately the first condition is something to do with the future remorse is the past quitting is the present and in the future you must intend not to do it what does that mean so many people fall into sin when they travel and this is why we always try to advise people do not travel unless you have to and when you travel travel with good company and when you travel travel to a Muslim country a lot of the Muslims now take the holidays in June July August when it's summer holiday and they go to Catholic countries what do they do there they visit the message its Islamic centers and they make a lot of a bada you know and I know they don't do this if they go to Dubai if we go to Paris or London they're going to fall into sin so you have to intend when you repent not to do it again our friends come from holiday and they've spent a whole month in the bad countries sinning fornicating drinking partying being wasted they come they make ombres and they say oh allah forgive me colossal hamdulillah yes we have sinned a lot may Allah forgive me and then they call their travel agent he the hotel you put us in is awful listen next August you put us in a better location and we will pay you more is this repentance accepted he is intending to do it next year so then Allah will not accept your forgiveness accept your repentance and will not forgive you because there is no remorse do not remorseful ok you quit it now but you're planning to do it next year and likewise with all other sins and the fifth condition is that your repentance must be at an accepted time because there are two times Allah will not accept your repentance privately individually and generally individually is when you're on your dying bed so when you're dying in your soul is coming out you're in defiance or in you're in denial no no I'm not going to die now I'm young I'm 85 what are you talking I still have like 15 to 16 more years you meet people they are over a hundred shares how are you living living so death is approaching no no no live for 950 years I still have 850 to go people still wish and hope that they're going to live forever even on the dying bed they are not believing until the soul begins to come out then they say okay I repent now still it individually Allah will not accept your repentance when death comes to your call collarbone when your spirit is coming out weary soul is coming out generally speaking when the Sun rises from the West house this is for all humanity Allah will not accept anyone to repent because this is a global phenomenon the Sun is rising from the West it just went there it is coming back again from the same location this is the time where Allah does not accept repentance and finally the sixth condition is when the sin is between me and you there are sins between you and Allah you drink your smoke you watch haram this is between you and Allah is urgent but there are sins between me and you if you steal my money if you back bite me if you physically harm me or attack me your repentance by saying oh Allah forgive me I stole a hundred million shillings from the brothers and the sisters and so on but Allah I seek forgiveness and Allah will forgive me it is not enough you have to return the money back to the people because the Prophet said is also Salam o people in this dunya if you have wronged someone try to make it even before the day of judgment why because on the day of judgment there are no dirham ordina there are no currencies it's only good deeds and bad deeds and he will take his money he will take his right so if you have transgressed wrong someone you have to clear your account with him seriously there's Allah accept repentance some people are hopeless they are hopeless they are in despair they think I have so many sins and other people say no you should give me like 15 minutes reminder before you cannot tell me that the time is over so this is this is for the training session next to conference Charlotte you give 15 minutes ten minutes five minutes so I will assume it's least fifteen minutes okay I'll try to make it short we have so many things I have a lot of brothers come I have a lot of sisters coming to me okay I'm not in a church forgive me Father for I have sinned it doesn't work this way you have a lot so urgent you address him but they come to the ship to the Mawlana Sheikh I have sinned I have done yeah he you are not allowed to tell me your sins may be in the confession box the other guy has a paper yes what did you do where did you go - hmm was it good in Islam it's not like this if I come to you I say a few years today I had a smoke Allah will not forgive me you imagine that if I tell you last week I took someone's money Allah will not forgive me because Allah Azza WA JAL has concealed me concealed my shortcomings and now I am making it public so Allah will not forgive me and there's a hadith nihari exactly saying taking this wherever you sin do not tell a soul not even your mother not even your father and the worst of people are those who tell their spouses I get brothers coming to me with messages Sheikh I got married and I was so happy with my wife for 15 years then I told her that I had an extramarital relationship before we got married and all hell broke loose how can I rectify it you cannot Hollis is gone you expose yourself you crazy what you tell sister is coming to me as a chair I'm feeling remorseful I had an affair and now my husband is asking me and pressurizing me can I tell him that I knew 25 people before him I hung up this is crazy what is in the past is in the past Allah as Earl conceals it allah azza wajal will forgive you the moment you open your mouth is it yeah I did this amazing this good man no you're not Allah will not forgive this particular sense because you've exposed yourself so there's a lot they will truly forgive us yeah he a last name is the most forgiving Allah is the one who repents upon his servant imagine someone killing a hundred souls in cold blood he goes to a scholar I've killed a hundred soul do you think Allah will forgive me before he killed the hundred he killed 99 so after killing 99 he felt remorseful he went to a monk one who worships Allah 24/7 but doesn't have knowledge he said monk I killed 99 people do you think Allah will forgive me the one says forgive you you didn't have you crazy so they say the man said 99 two figures if I kill him he becomes three figures that's good for my record so he killed a hundred people after a while he feels remorse it's burning in his heart no matter how hard or bad the person is he goes to a scholar Oh scholar I killed 100 people do you think Allah will forgive me he said of course Allah forgives everyone seek Allah's forgiveness Allah will forgive you Allah in the Quran told us in Florida Burroughs who do you know horrible gurus the trenches when the king ordered them to dig trenches and fill it with fire and then he threw the whole people of the community in it burning them because they would not associate others with Allah Allah tells us in the Quran in readiness eternal many no immunity from Allah meeya to boo those who have tortured the believers women and men through burning them alive and they did not repent Allah would throw them in hell and we torture them with fire so Allah is opening the door even for those two what to repent those who made a son to Allah the Christians Allah told us in the Quran about the Christians who made Allah one out of three and they made Jesus his son Allah is addressing them in calling them Fri a to abouna illa llah he where stuff you won't they repent to Allah and seek His forgiveness what they made a son to him by this Allah is opening the door for them and I will conclude my 15 minutes to make it into 9 this is a discount for the brother by mentioning to two stories of the Companions you know my diplomatic do you know my man is unknown to us except through this incident he is a companion he comes to the prophet in the message area so he said o prophet of Allah purify me for I have sinned the Prophecy's what did he do he said I committed adultery this is a serious offence if someone comes to me and says this I'm going to take my Glock and shoot him you sinful person you don't feel not know the Prophet Isis Salam turned his face the man stood up and came from the other side and said o prophet of Allah purify me for I have committed adultery the Prophet M looks to the right he doesn't even speak to him four times then the Prophet Allah salatu salam ask the audience is he crazy before executing he asks and ensures that there are no obstacles is he crazy they said no is he intoxicated go and smell his mouth so one comes and no wine no beer nothing so the Prophet action maybe you have stern he said no maybe you have kissed her said no maybe you've hugged her he said no the prophets asks him a straightforward question did you commit intercourse he said yes so the prophet alayhi salat wa salam orders them to stone him to death and this is the penalty for a married man or woman who commits or commits the acts of adultery so whether he's married divorced widowed is the same ruling so they stone him until he dies and some of the companions are talking ill about him look how he exposed himself until he was stoned like a dog the prophet alayhi salatu salam don't say that seek Allah's forgiveness for your brother mani Malik because he has repented a repentance if it were to be distributed and divided by a whole nation it would cover them all what kind of repentance was in my heart due to this heinous crime adultery not only that another woman comes to the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam the following day she's a la media she's from the asked and he comes to the Prophet Allison in public instead of prophet of Allah purify me so the Prophet looks this other side and ignores her she said o prophet of Allah do you want to treat me like you had treated miles by ignoring him by Allah I am pregnant there is nothing that can be concealed what does the prophets they are in solution the Prophet says go and once you give birth come so the woman leaves for how long seven months eight months nine if she knew that too she got pregnant usually she takes a month or two and she comes back with a child in her hand she says all prophet of Allah purifying me the Prophet says go until you breastfeed him and the child can eat so she leaves for another year or so breastfeeding him and she comes with the boy holding a piece of bread in his hand meaning that he can eat now and she is this all prophet of Allah purify me almost two years or more she could have travelled to China on foot if she wanted to escape a lot punishment and no one would look for her the Prophet didn't imprison her the Prophet on her go if she had second thoughts no one would look for her but it is the fire ignited in her heart with repentance from the fear of allah azza wajal from what she had committed fearing the consequences of this crime so she comes with a prophet of alliances all prophets of Allah purify me so the prophet Ali saw some ordered them to dig a hole in the ground and they place her in it and they stoned her until she died one of the companions cursed her while stoning her some of the blood came to his body as according to the narrations of the gushing of the blood so he cursed her and the Prophet said RA salatu salam do not curse her for by Allah she had repented a repentance if it were to be distributed among 70 households of Medina it was it would have covered them and Allah would have forgiven him did you find anything better than she gave up herself in exchange for repentance therefore brothers and sisters the issue of repentance and of seeking Allah's forgiveness is a very vast topic today when you read the Quran every page you read it read it twice and look for the number of times Allah is calling you to repent then to secrecy forgiveness and then you will discover and find out that we have wronged ourselves by not seeking Allah forgiveness and by not repenting to Allah may Allah the Almighty have his immense forgiveness over us all may allah azza wajal erase all our sins may allah azza wajal turned all our bad deeds into good deeds and repent upon us had Allahu Alem when especially me alayhi assalam was allah wa salamu ala ala nabina muhammad alayhi wa sahbihi ajma'in [Music]"
