  "transcript": "the angels have free will what's your uh dispute with it no I don't have any dispute I'm just I'm just trying to like understand like we know that they can't uh disobey Allah so they don't have choice in that matter so how can we say that they have free will no no when they do not disobey Allah not that because Allah forced them to do this there's a big difference the wall can't disobey Allah is it something to be praised over when you say masha'allah the world doesn't disobey my orders there's no praising in it so when Allah praises the angels and says that they like they do not disobey Allah whenever he orders them and they do what they are told to do this is praising them if they were compelled there would not be any Praise on that they would be like animals who do exactly what Allah tells them to do but they have free will yet through their free will they do not dispute or they do not disobey Allah when Allah tells them to prostrate to Adam they comply Satan did not comply because he is not an angel he's from the Jinn has clearly described in the Quran when Allah tells them that I'm replacing or placing a an individual that they will um take turns one after the other on Earth they asked o Allah how do you place someone who would shed blood and cause corruption on Earth so they do have free will they do ask and they do comply with whatever Allah tells them to do out of their own free will and Allah Knows Best"
