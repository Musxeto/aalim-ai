  "transcript": "my question is is it mandated to fast the whole 10 days of the whole first 10 days of course when we say it is Sunnah to fast the first 10 days of the due to the Hadith where the Prophet saidat there are no days of the year better in Good Deeds more than these 10 days and the and the prophet wasam as in the Hadith the other Hadith he used to fast these 10 days of course this is called in Arabic which means that we refer to the vast majority not to the actual 10 days because everybody knows that the 10th day is the day ofid and it is prohibited and even if you fast it it won't be accepted it's invalid so everyone knows that this 10th day is not included in fasting but it's included in every other good deeds so is it mandated is it mandated atory is it obligatory the answer is no of course not the only obligation is to fast the days of Ramadan but it is highly recommended Beyond imagination to do good deeds in these 10 days including fasting with the exception of the day of Eid of course and Allah Knows Best"
