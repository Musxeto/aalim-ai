  "title": "Ruling on making pronunciation mistakes during Salah / Prayer - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "asks about the many mistakes a person does in salat especially in mispronouncing something in the Fatiha this is a very common question and it's a very frequent question and it's a question that causes a lot of confusion and distress to many Muslims because Maria either you're an Arab or not an Arab if you're an Arab it is extremely easy to recite the Fatiha without any problems because you know and understand it if you're an an Arab then you have to memorize it as it is you may and this is very possible make you may make mistakes and this happens so do I have to repeat the prayer this is called mistakes so if you make a mistake and this mistake was unintentional and this mistake did not change the meaning so for example salata latina and I'm telling him the path that you have favored the path of those whom you have favoured and anta is a masculine pronoun used and I'm T is a feminine and we can never use feminine pronouns with a large division so if someone says by mistake and empty I lay him this is totally inappropriate and prohibited and if done intentionally blasphemous if unintentionally this breaks the salaat and one has to repeat it if it was a mistake someone who's a non Arab and did and said this without knowing it and after he finished the prayer he was told he shall die his prayer is valid because he doesn't know yet if he remembered in the salat he must correct it and repeat it without need to break the salat so an anti they untied him he repeats it and that's an move on if the mispronunciation in minor things so I can't say because I'm an Arab I can say alhamdulillah he I can say alhamdulillah he I can't say ha I can say bawd an Arabic is known to be the language of God the letter thought is I think not found except in Arabic so someone who's an an Arab and is unable to say it he would say Ryan McDougle a mother Darlene I would say your prayer is invalid no this is the best he can do so you have to learn what may nullify your recitation of the Fatiha and what may be considered as an accepted error and you can any inshallah go about with it Emma"
