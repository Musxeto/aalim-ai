  "transcript": "Asam alaykum um actually my name is she Rose she Rose yes okay I apologize that's all right uh she I had a a question I'm going I'm a student and I'm in going to start gr grade 12 and my parents are deciding me to send me to a boarding school in India where it's not a Muslim school and I want to take the Quran with me but you know India has a minority for Islam and I'm uh and there you know many cases where the Muslims are victimized for you know because they're Muslims so I don't know if I should take the Quran with me in this case or not okay I'll answer this question inshallah thank you bro the question of the brother is that he's supposed to go to a boarding school and he's going back to India and he's complaining that it's the Muslims are a minority and he's afraid that if he does take the Quran that it might be humilated that it might be attacked or so he's asking can I take the Quran or not first of all I disagree with you I've been to India about a dozen of times and with the grace of Allah I was received quite well very generous people we had no problems none whatsoever there so saying that the Muslims are a minority this is true but they are worshiping Allah freely they have the ability to make da to make conferences to call for Allah and the harmony there is quite nice there are black sheep of the family everywhere there are bad apples everywhere even in Muslim uh uh world but still India remains uh uh tolerant it remains uh mashallah willing to accept the others secondly I believe that there is nothing wrong in taking the Quran with you as long as you're protecting it and you're keeping it with with you and in a safe place you're not going to give it to everyone to take a look at it and touch it and stain it with their impurity no so you it's okay for you to take this thirdly nowadays we have electronic versions of of the Quran that even Can Be Touched by non-muslims so if you have it on your PDA if you have it on your mobile phone if you have it anywhere this can also uh uh give you the same role of having the physical uh book with you and I believe inshallah that there's nothing wrong with that and I pray to Allah that he uh um helps you and guides you and protects you wherever you travel to uh inshallah"
