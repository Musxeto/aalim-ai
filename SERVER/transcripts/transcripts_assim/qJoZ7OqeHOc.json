  "transcript": "senna says if the postmortem bleeding stops if there is no more bleeding after 40 days can i fast in the month of ramadan we know that when a woman gives birth she gets post-mortem bleeding or postnatal bleeding and this the islam has put a max to it so this bleeding can go on for 40 days and she can or she must skip prayer and fasting and not be intimate with her husband for 40 days but if after 15 days of birth or 20 days she sees her purity blood stops all together and she sees the white thread like discharge or complete dryness in this case she's ordered to perform muscle to start praying and fasting if she wants back to fast and she can be intimate with her husband 15 days or 20 days after her birth giving birth couple of weeks later meaning that 30 days after her delivery she sees blood again we say to her stop everything you are now still on your post naval bleeding until the 40 days are over once the 40 days are over even if the blood does not stop she makes rosa and she prays and fast and can be intimate providing this is not her menses and she can tell by the color the pain the back pain the cramps etc so the point is that she is not obliged to wait for 40 days without praying and fasting she can pray and fast before that if she were to see her purity but bearing in mind that if the bleeding comes again within the 40 days she must stop again"
