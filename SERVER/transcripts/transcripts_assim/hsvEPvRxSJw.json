  "transcript": "a sister says is it mandatory for a woman to take the consent of her father or her guardian if she wants to seek or divorce like how it's mandatory when getting married the Hadith of the Prophet Alat wasam indicates that it is a must to seek the consent and approve approval of the Guardian who's usually the Father of the Bride Whenever there is a marriage contract however once she's married she's literally on her own as her guardian becomes her husband so if life becomes difficult and she would opt for divorce or if her husband is not willing to divorce her and and she wants to opt out of this relationship by giving him back his Dy which is known as in this case she does not need the consent of her father or her mother or anyone else because this is her life we cannot dictate upon a woman how to live her life after she's married because that would be unjust and unfair she's the one living with this Beast or with this so-called man and if life cannot go on if he's abusive if he's inconsiderate if he doesn't show any compassion if he claims to be God-fearing and righteous and jealous yet he himself orders her to work and mix with nonaham men on daily basis and then claims that he doesn't want to divorce her because of his jealousy no this is where the Muslim judge or the Muslim ruler comes and draws the line and forces him to divorce and gives this woman her right of Freedom so to answer your question no she's not uh um obliged to seek the approval and consent of her father father when life ceased to be possible to exist with such a man however she has to weigh the consequences because if her father doesn't approve of it and he himself is a narcissist or someone who doesn't fear Allah and she gets the where would she go if she doesn't have any place to turn to or to Harbor her then she would be in great trouble and problems so she should yeah do her due diligence before opting for such a decision and Allah Knows Best"
