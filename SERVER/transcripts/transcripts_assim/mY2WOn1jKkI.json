  "transcript": "Siraj from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh, Assalamu Alaikum I'm a revert to Islam and my parents are non-Muslims. I would like to know if it is mandatory to include the names of the groom's and bride's parents name on the marriage invitation card. Is it mandatory to do what, Siraj? It is mandatory to mention the names of groom's and bride's parents. No, no, if I am inviting a friend and my name is Asim, the son of Komar, the son of Brahma, he knows who I am. He knows I'm a revert. So what's the problem in mentioning my parents' names or my family name? I am a Muslim. I don't care about my lineage. I don't care about my disbelieving father or grandfather or my family. I'm proud of being a Muslim. None of the companions were ashamed to say that, oh yeah I'm a Muslim but my father is a kafir, he's a mushrik. No, this is life. There's nothing to be ashamed of. Allah selected you and chose you to be a revert and to embrace Islam. Be proud of it. Now is it a must to mention Asim is marrying Asimah? No. The son of so-and-so is marrying the daughter of so-and-so? No. You can just mention the first names if you wish, but if you mention the whole name and the full name, there is nothing wrong in that either. you"
