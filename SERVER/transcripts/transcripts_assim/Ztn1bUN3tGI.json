Workshop alhamdulillah this is our first scholar Workshop Divine thread by the grace of Almighty Allah only with Allah's help we are able to do this but before I proceed I'll just make some announcements uh first and foremost it has become something like for in Islamic Gathering whether it's is a mjid or public place please switch off or keep your mobile phone in silent mode if can

seats from the friend please don't sit separately come closer okay now alhamdulillah I just introduce our respected sh aim lman sh aen is from Saudi Arabia from the city of jeda now he has done his graduation in linguistics and he has been teaching English as a foreign language for more than 15 years and he has done his higher diploma in Islamic education from um and he also studied with various scholars in Saudi Arabia alhamdulillah and he has been IM for more than 21 years and used to give durus in the Masjid on various uh subjects of Sciences of Islam like Sahari and S and all other other books of uh esteemed Scholars like Allah be pleased with so before one another important point I would like to highlight is that whatever has been done whatever has been arranged the knowledge which we gain is to seek Allah's pleasure so please I request each and every one of you to work on your intention why you are here we are here to please Allah subhana tala but we here to acquire the knowledge so that we can get closer to Allah subh tala for nothing else everything is arranged to please Allah nothing El please let us rework on your our ni that we are here to benefit from the knowledge so I would like all of you to be very attentive to the class and this is really uh very important and a very serious subject so we need your [Music] attention first of all I'd like to welcome you good morning I hope this would be a beneficial day for us inshallah today's subject is Quran and usually people would introduce this as saying it is part of studying the Quran what does the word mean Quran how would we find it and usually how it is introduced Scholars have started writing this science since the time of the Prophet the origin of it when Allah revealed verses of the Quran that the companions misunderstood and It cast doubt to them so their only means of clarification was the prophet and this is Illustrated in a where the Prophet s was approached by his companions and they told him oh prophet of Allah there is a verse in the Quran that makes us wonder if it comes and fits us we're doom we're in Hell Allah is describing certain people by saying those who do not mix their faith their belief their IM with aggression and they say we are all doing this we're not complete we're not full so this means that we doomed the prophet clarified this issue and he told them that this is not the aggression you think sins that you do are forms of aggression but what is meant in this Ayah is explained in another Ayah where L is telling his son in the famous Surah as you all know it that ass creating others with Allah sh is a form of great aggression so this is the aggression that nullifies your Islam nullifies your belief so the first to interpret the Quran with the Quran was the prophet and if you go to look at this science as a science before you introduce it we have to give a brief introduction as the brother has said this is part of religion part of Islam there has to be a clear intention for studying it as I've said in last night's lecture with those who attended it any form of knowledge if you do not have sincerity you will be punished if you study chemistry physics mathematics engineering medicine and you have good intention for the sake of Allah you are rewarded but if you don't have a good intention Allah will not punish you because this form of Sciences it is permissible to study without good intention unlike the Sciences of Islam if you study it with good intention with to Allah you are rewarded greatly but if you don't if your intention is to boast about it to brag about it to compete with others to be in a higher level in this dun then you are sinful and you are doomed so what should I do now if I have mixed intentions make good intention for Allah make it for the sake of Allah the scholars used to say that we started requiring we started studying knowledge not for Allah in the beginning we just thought that we have an edge over the people and soon afterwards Allah made us forced us to have our intention purely for him so whether you like it or not you have to change your intention Allah would help and this would be solely for Allah the almighty to go into this [Music] people Define and this is an Islamic concept whether you study or you study or you study you have to Define everything in these Islamic sciences and this is an Arab way of doing it and why do we do this because if I would like to have a clear understanding of something I have to Define it and the definition in Arabic usually they call it means that it combines everything and it means it prevents anything else from coming inside so when I say this is a plural word the singular is and what is the meaning of in Arabic is the opposite of and is ignorance so is knowledge and it is not one it is plural it's a number of that governs this it goes on to say that there are different types of there is the of there is the of there is the of inheritance there is the of there is the of history and there are the of Ethics all of this is found inan in the Quran okay it's it's a yeah it it would help if you continue what I say usually so that I can make sure that you're not sleeping and that I would not fall asleep as well so these are found in the Quran are these intended no these are not the we are talking about because these are specific and we're talking about the holistic type of and what type of are we talking about we're talking about the science that is related to the Quran when it was revealed how it was revealed why it was revealed we're talking about the times it was revealed the places in meca and Medina at night or a day in the summer or in the winter when the prophet was traveling or when he was residing when the prophet wasam was in his bed or he was with uh uh the people we're talking about the science that talks about the the different types of recitations we're talking about the science that governs the seven types of dialects of the Arabs that were revealed to the prophet that made the companions wonder is this Quran or not and we will come to talk about this tomorrow insh we talk about abrogation at first Allah tells us to do this then Allah tells us don't do this at first in toxicant were okay permissible to drink and then Allah says drink it but do not pray while you're drunk and then Allah says don't drink it at all all of this is governed in the science ofran and also this science is better known to the old Scholars as the fundamentals of and they say that it's the same science but it is not because it also talks about things that does not need such as compilation of the Quran how it was done the stages and so on so this is what we mean about Quran it has to be holistic what is the meaning of holistic it's not specific what do we mean by not specific when I talk about the causes of Revelation what is the cause of Revelation in this science of Quran I do not take every single Ayah in the Quran from the beginning alhamd to to the end I do not take every single ay and say the cause of revelation of this Ayah is so and so this is specific this does not fall underr I'm talking about the concept the causes of Revelation what are they they are so and so and so but I'm not talking about every single and specific ay of course if you notice that this course should be given over a period of 4 to 6 months if you would like to study it properly and we're making it in 2 days simply because it is based on Arabic so if I would like to give examples I'm going to give the examples in English and this does not illustrate the power of the Quran the Quran cannot be understood except in proper Arabic so whenever we talk about the Quran in English this means that I'm losing 90% of the power the miraculous power of the Quran Quran is a miracle by itself the prophet was not challenging Sorcerers like M peace be upon was he was not challenging um doctors or people of medicine like Isa was he was challenging illiterate people who had this eloquent way of using words and this is the beauty of Arabic therefore I do encourage you to learn Arabic because without it you will not be able to be a proper student of knowledge you will understand Islam in principle and you will be able to make da in principle and you'll be able to understand a lot of the Sciences but if someone comes to you and says your understanding is wrong because Allah says and he cot you an Ayah in Arabic you say no no the meaning of this is this and this and he says no the Arabic meaning is so and so you cannot argue with him therefore you have to try your best to learn the language now this part is we have through of this we go to the meaning of the Quran linguistically it is derived from which means to join and combine and there are two ways of pronouncing this word either you pronounce it as Quran or you put the Hamza and you say and may Allah have mercy on his soul had few words about this and it all revolves about or around the same thing and when we Define Quran what is Quran we know that Quran is the Revelation that Allah has revealed to the prophet Muhammad we believe it is miraculous we believe that Allah has vowed to preserve it there is no single Holy scripture on Earth that has been reserved preserved like the Quran no one no religion on Earth can provide a book and and say this is the book that was revealed there is a very big possibility and excuse me for doing this that I'll do this with the brothers but with the sisters and the sisters may and forgive me for that it's a very big possibility that while I'm talking I may point at someone and ask him what did I say and he has to stand up and repeat the last few sentences because some of the brothers are and when they do this I feel sorry for myself then I I say I wish I was there so watch out I'm not embarrassing anyone but this is what I used to do in my school I taught English for 15 years and when you teach English to Arabs it's it's a challenge so I believe now I'm teaching Arabic too the N Arabs it's the same thing so watch out you will be hunted so uh going back to the Quran we all know that the Quran was never matched by any other book no one can present a book it says this is the original language and it has been reserv preserved nothing nowhere the Arabic used in the Quran is not a dead language we speak it on the streets so we use the Arabic no one can say this Arabic is few people have understand it no we understand 95 98% of it anyone from the streets if you go to Yemen if you go to Syria if you go to Cairo and you recite the Quran they understand they don't say can I have a book of just to understand what's said it's comprehended everybody can understand it but to define the Quran you have to again give definition I think this is restricted area because I have to see as well uh you have to define the Quran as the Arabic speech and this tells us that Quran is Arabic and some Scholars say that there are few words that are not Arabic"
