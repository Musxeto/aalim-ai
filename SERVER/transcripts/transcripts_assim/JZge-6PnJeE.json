  "transcript": "because to go through a Hadith a one Hadith of the Prophet Allah you need volumes the prophet said Allah about himself that he was given the concise of speech and this is this is your course right I don't know this because part one okay so when you go through a Hadith of the Prophet Allah you find so much knowledge squeezed into a single or couple of words and to explain this you need volumes so for example the prophet says there are two words and this is one of the legal maxims in Islam foreign and the scholar spoke extensively about it everybody knows this Hadith it is one third as Imam shafri says it is one third of the entire Islam when the prophet said forwards Hadith Imam shafiri said he went to Imam Ahmed to sleep over and footnote don't think I'm wasting time I am the material we have I don't think I'm going to be able to go through it but as long as I'm not going to finish it might as well waste time Imam shafiri went to sleep over at Imam Ahmed so the maid put water after Russia in front of his room so that he can make wudu and pray night prayer at Fajr time she met Imam Ahmed and said this is Imam shafir you talk about he is not worthy of your praise he didn't even pray night prayer what kind of what kind of a scholar is he he he smiled he did not reply after they prayed Fajr Imam Muhammad was chit-chatting with Imam shafir and he said the mate says so so about you she he said she's right I didn't pray a night prayer I spent the whole night from Maisha till Fajr contemplating on the Hadith of anas when the prophet came to our house and I had this young brother called uh uh about um he's nicknamed he had a small bird Noor so the prophet is jokingly with him because the bird died and the four-year-old child was upset so the prophet said what did the Young bird do he's joking with him he said Imam I spent the whole night contemplating on these words and I got a number and over 80 over 8-0 benefits out of it he collected from this so when we speak about the Hadith of the Prophet this is not a simple thing to go through it's a serious topic"
