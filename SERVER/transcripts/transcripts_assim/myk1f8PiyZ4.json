  "title": "Does touching women nulifies wudu",
  "transcript": "it is asking about an issue only adopted by a shattering meth lab so most likely his wife is following a chef in madhhab and an Amana chef he is the only one who stated that whenever a man touches a woman or the opposite the wood is nullified but this is not correct and the ruling of the majority is the correct because the issue may Allah be pleased with her said that the Prophet is of Salaam used to hear the call for the add-on for the the prayer and he used to leave the house after kissing his wife and praying without renewing his voodoo so touching is much less than kissing so the Prophet was doing this adding in salatu salam this tells us that touching the opposite sex especially if it's your wife your sister your mother does not affect your voodoo at all"
