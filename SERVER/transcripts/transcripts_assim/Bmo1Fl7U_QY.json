  "transcript": "a sister says is it allowed for a woman to play sports well woman like other human beings they are entitled to be entertained they're entitled to have fun girls want to have fun there's no problem in that providing that the conditions are fixed that is it is totally segregated no way a man can come and film it or look at it so it's totally segregated other participants the opponents and the women playing they are wearing proper attire so it's not permissible for a woman to go to a swimming pool that is totally segregated where there are women wearing bikinis this is our uh she's not allowed to look at it and it should not contain any form of harm so MMA boxing this is Harlem hitting the faces Harlem harming your opponent is haram and there shouldn't be anything that is also harm such as music in the case of aerobics or whatever other exercises otherwise this is permissible inshallah"
