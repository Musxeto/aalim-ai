  "transcript": "Umm Amina from the Emirates Assalamu Alaikum Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi So my question is, if I shower, and I'm not making any intention, just a regular shower, We've answered this question a number of times, but I'll answer it again, Umm Amina. Wudu is uplifting a minor ritual impurity, which is usually caused by answering the call of nature, passing of wind, eating camel's meat, or sleeping. Now, ghusl is a ritual purity, where we uplift a major ritual impurity. So when I perform ghusl, this is a ibadah, a form of worship, where I tend to uplift the major ritual impurity caused by nocturnal emission, intercourse, When I perform this major ritual purity act, ghusl, to uplift my janabah, this major ritual impurity that was uplifted, takes with it the minor ritual impurity as well. So my ghusl, for sexual intercourse, nocturnal emission, or for a woman who saw her purity after menses, or after post-natal bleeding, this uplifts her major ritual impurity and her minor ritual impurity. Now, taking this aside, what about if a person just takes a normal shower, and rinses his mouth and nose? We ask, did this person uplift a major ritual impurity? The answer is no. He just took a shower to cool down or to clean his body. In this case, the minor ritual impurity, was it performed according to its conditions? What do you mean? There are six pillars or conditions or factors that must be fulfilled in wudhu, and that is to wash your face and rinse your mouth and nose, to wash your arms to the elbows, to wipe over your head and ears, to wash your feet to the ankles, to have this in the following order, and to have simultaneousness. It has to be simultaneous. You can't break between these four acts by answering the phone or doing something in between. Were these conditions fulfilled in your second type of showering? The answer is no. In this case, no. To answer your question, your wudhu is invalid. It has to be in the sequence, and I hope this clarifies things."
