  "title": "Good women for good men &....then why was Prophet Nuh, Lut married to such women & Asiya to Pharaoh?",
  "transcript": "in Surah an ayat 26 Allah stated that V wom are for V men and V men for V wom good women are for good men and good men for good women but why did Allah match prophets Noam and Lam with disbelieving wife or woman wife who against them and why did AA who is a muslima and believer Asia of Asia who is a muslima and believer and up with and Zula who committed infidelity and was unfaithful to a husband and then up with Prophet youf as for Z this is not authentic that she got married to Yousef peace be upon him nor that she Comm committed infidelity because she didn't Yousef did not budge to her attempts peace be upon him as for the Ayah this is a common mistake in Translation this is translated in many t as being righteous women are for righteous men and righteous men are for righteous women and vice versa this is not the most authentic opinion and Tere of rather this Ayah is related to the slandering of mother and the slandering is done by what by words so the Ayah is referring to good words are for righteous men and righteous men speak good words bad words are for bad uh uh men and the likes and if you go to Islam Q&A you will find this the opinions of of mu and you will find that this is the most authentic opinion that the verse is referring to bad words that come out from bad people because as correctly uh answered mother uh uh uh Prophet n and Prophet L their wives were disbelievers but again even if we say that how could this happen if we were to take the interpretation or the to be righteous men to righteous women we would say that this is called generally speaking they're always can be exceptions so in the Quran there it has to be understood by the language of the Arabs not by the translators and this is why we say learn Arabic when you learn Arabic you can learn the Quran and the Sunnah but when you depend on my interpretation my translation you will suffer because any mistake I make can be uh um conveyed to you accordingly and Allah knows"
