  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] so [Music] uh and welcome back to another episode of life's adornments where we're discussing the significance of child rearing its virtues its benefits its many ups and downs and most importantly how do we return this affair back to the quran and back to the sunnah of the prophet muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam today we are discussing tabiya imaniya how to rear the children in a way that they are conscious of allah and all that they do so that they may grow up to being god conscious righteous human beings insha allahu ta'ala to help us with this endeavor we have sheikh asim luqman and hakeem who is a teacher at zad academy nkiu and a teacher and an imam for over 30 years okay alhamdulillah i remember growing up we used to watch cartoons i know you talked to us about cartoons and this damages and one of the things is that we had superheroes that we would look up to we knew their names we knew their entire stories and they were closer to us in many ways than even our parents so we wanted to be like them we wanted to dress like them to talk like them and mirror our entire lives according to how they were but we didn't know much about the sahaba so how important and crucial is it that children are raised in a way that they not only know the sahaba but they love them and they want to be like them step by step it shows you the importance of the companions may allah be pleased with them that the prophet salallahu said i'm highlighted the fact that the best of generation is his generation so the best of all generations is that the generation of the prophet sallam which includes the companions and indeed allah azzawajal selected the best of the best to accompany his prophet not only to support him but also to convey the religion to us so when you come to a particular hadith pray as if you had seen me pray i didn't see you pray a prophet of allah so how can i comply well the answer is easy it was the companions who saw him and they may allah be pleased with them all conveyed that to us so we know from the hadith of may allah be pleased with him that the prophet alaihis assam used to place the right hand over the left hand on his chest while in the standing position khalas i know now when i pray i do not put my hands next to my side rather that to put it like described by this companion and so on we go on and on and on so knowing the companions gives you an idea how the prophet allah lived talked walked and not only that sadhu may allah be pleased with him he used to say that we used to teach our children the marazzi as we teach them the quran we used to teach them the seerah the biography the battles of the prophet alaihis allah as we teach them of the quran so nowadays any muslim you simply give him a straight forward question when did the battle of uh take place if he was a smart alec he would say oh a long time ago masha allah you're good but you're bad in history you don't know which year it took place if you ask people when did the prophet ali saw some die 99 would not know let alone if you ask them about the names of the companions the name of the ten heaven bound once i ask a brother this question he's not a practicing muslim so he says abu bakr said good he said say come again he said this what is this he these is either were you bringing this name from really i didn't know so if we have a big gap between us and them then we have a problem and i always make this joke in conferences and lectures so if you heard it before don't laugh it's not funny um if one of us were to be taken to jannah we will be introduced this is abu bakr umar uthman ali nice to see them this is just come again what is that he's a companion whoa i never heard of such a name that's really weird and this is ansari come on man where what kind of name is this this is the first time i hear these names i don't know any one of those and and this is fun but jenna is nice but i don't know anyone you're talking about can we take a tour to hell so if they take you to hell and say masha allah all these celebrities i know them all this is the environment i'd like to be in you'd like to go to hell it's unfortunate if your destination is jannah then you should know who lives there that is why it is important to teach our children to know the ten heaven bound so they know abu bakr al rahman ali they know they know so and how he is the cousin of um how he was married to his daughter to his sister and he was the narrator of the hadith we know everything about them and we know everything about the companions so we have this not vivid rather clear idea how they lived how they communicated how they traveled how they married how they surrounded the prophet salaam and how good they were to the prophet and how close they were to the prophet islam we know everything about them now when my children grow up to know this when my daughter and by the way this is one of my daughter's name her name is sophia so when someone asks her what is safiya this is the name of a maid unfortunately it is a popular name among mates but she says proudly my name is after safiya the second one to be the mother of the believers and the wife of the prophet see she stands with her head held up high because she has heritage so we need this so that our children when they grow up they learn okay abdullahi zubair may allah be pleased with him one of the first children to be born into islam and it was narrated that omar the caliph may allah be pleased with him he is who he is was walking and he saw children play and once they saw him they ran away they were intimidated they were afraid and ran away except one boy so he asked the boy why didn't you run away like your peers he said i didn't do anything wrong to fear you and the road is not so narrow so that i would keep it open and wide for you why should i and he was happy to hear such an intelligent answer from a child this child was abdullah zubair his father is his mother you know their heritage you know the lineage you know who the neighbors were when you teach this to the children they grow up with characteristics of courage of generosity of bravery of kindness of loving to protect islam even with your own life and giving dawah and being diplomatic all of this you get when you upbring your children to know their heritage do you know the companions of the prophet but above all before we teach them about the companions we have to teach them how to love the prophet and this is essential we have to teach them how the prophet allah is called people to islam not as some religions do we have to teach them the suffering of the prophet no suffering is one part of his life there were happy times there were good times there were battles there were times of peace there were times of teaching all of the seerah the biography of the prophet alaihis would only draw a person closer to allah azza if we manage to teach them that and i know for a fact that a lot of the women the mothers they give bet side or bedtime stories to their children about cinderella about a snow white about this or that but i know women in my family alhamdulillah who used to every time put their children to sleep with a story from the seerah and some of the benefits of course according to their age not something that is okay from this story we have like 12 points point number one point number two this is academic you have to relate them to the prophet allah how was it when he was in the cave with abu bakr being pursued by the idol worshippers how was it when the prophet alaihis salat was had a guest and he had no food with him or with the nine houses that he had with his wives and he gave that guest to um what they did and things that grow feelings of generosity of chivalry of bravery of being a true practicing believing muslim and one of the things that we see amongst the sahaba is that they were very young and they you know were able to raise men so if you look at some of the examples of even our bad you mentioned abdullah bin zubair they were very young but they played very crucial roles in society so they're even lessons to be learned for parents themselves they're thinking oh abdullah oh muhammad he's too young let him leave him alone he's not you know strong enough or smart enough well an opposite you can see amongst the sahaba they were very young but very influential in their societies see the prophet allah did not ever ignore how small they were and the companions themselves would encourage their children to expose themselves to show themselves so this is a means and a way of being proud of your own son abdullah may allah be pleased with him and with his father he says i was in a gathering with the prophet salallahu and i was one of ten so the prophet asked a question as salaam he said can any one of you tell me a tree that is resembling a believer that does not shake with the wind and the leaves do not fall down so each one of the nine started to give examples from trees in the desert from here and there giving names says immediately it came to me that the prophet was giving an example of a palm tree because it's like a believer it's firm the leaves don't fall and it's this and that he said i wanted to speak out but i looked at the other nine they were all elders and i was the youngest and my father was there so i said no i'm not going to speak so after so many tries the prophet said it's the palm tree when we went home abdullah says i told my father and my father was so upset and he said by allah had you spoken and said that that would have been more precious to me than so and so of these worldly gains and wealth it shows us encouragement nowadays if a child speaks in the presence of elders shh don't speak don't do that they put him off give him a chance he's to be tomorrow's man so even if it's nonsense what he's saying direct him to make sense out of it and also give him a chance to express himself we're going to pause right here for a short break we'll be back to continue inshaallah ta'ala about for our viewers stay tuned and until we come back assalamu alaikum [Music] foreign and welcome back to our second segment of life's adornments where we're discussing today tarabia emania raising the children in a manner that is correct that corrects their understanding of allah and we're talking about a love of the prophet muhammad and a love of his companions now within regards to this is a narration that is mentioned with um where he would gather all the elders of badr and they said that he will always include in his gathering abdullah ibn abbas and many of the sahaba they would get angry and they would say that or agitated and that they were people that fought and bothered they were very you know prestigious and they would say how is this young boy who's the age of our grandchildren permitted to sit with us and he's you know a young boy we are the sahaba of badr and one time may allah be pleased with him he gathered them all and he asked them does anyone know the tafsir of nasr and all of them gave their answers and all of them were incorrect and he asked abdullah and he said that it was to inform the prophet sallam of his passing and he said wallahi i don't know anything about this i accept what you said so this was very beautiful because it empowered abdullah bin abbas and it showed him that he was able to achieve knowledge and to achieve a high status by way of going near to allah and by way of sticking close to the quran so along these lines i want to move forward into instilling within the children a love of memorization and of understanding the quran well islam has two sources primary sources where we get our legislation where we get our info where we get our intel from and that is the quran and the sunnah of the prophet quran is the last scripture that allah revealed to humanity allah will not reveal anything after it and this scripture is valid till the end of time the beauty of quran is that it is miraculous it is challenging in its form in its meaning and in its preservation so we can proudly claim that we are the only religion that their revelation and scripture was preserved unchanged and this began 1500 years ago or 15 centuries ago till date and will continue till the end of time i don't know of any religion on earth that can provide us with the original scripture the quran is not only documented and written it is preserved by memorization not by a handful of priests or monks but rather by not less than a hundred million individuals who range from peasants to farmers to engineers to doctors to professors all shades and types of people the quran is so miraculous that if we were to burn every single copy of it on earth tomorrow we will write an exact replica and duplicate not even a single dot is different because people memorize it by heart there isn't any scripture to my knowledge that the people speak the original language of it whether it is for the east or for the west while we have more than 400 million arabs native speakers who know the language and hundreds of millions of muslims who are not native but they still read it and understand it as it is so quran is the miracle of allah the jews the christians the hindus the buddhists everyone claims that their messengers had miracles okay show me they will not they'll fail they don't have anything to prove when we say that the miracle of islam the miracle of prophet muhammad is the quran here it is it has signs it has science it has miracles beyond count and it's so magnificent that so many people just read and accept islam by reading a page of it because they feel the tranquility this magnificent book part of upbringing our children is to make them memorize as much as possible and again i do not know of any scripture of other religions in this world that people memorize it i've never see i failed to see a christian memorizing the new and old testament by heart i failed to see a hindu memorizing the vedas by heart they have to refer maybe they memorize a verse or two a chapter or two but not the whole thing from cover to cover islam tells us that the quran was made easy to remember so people of seven imam shafi memorized quran when he was seven years of age seven he memorized the whole quran and he became one of the great imams of the four schools of thought and we have tens like him what my nephew alhamdulillah memorized the quran when he was 10 years of age the whole thing ibrahim gave him may may gave him a certificate of of doing that when he was 10 years of age everything was made easy with the grace of allah so when you put this in your children's hearts this would benefit them one way or the other it will be like their compass that brings them back to the straight path whenever they go astray because no one is perfect we all have our shortcomings and sins and inevitably we would fall into sin but when you have the quran in your heart this acts as a deterrent it stops you from so many bad things had you not had the quran in your heart you would have probably fallen into them so from an early age from as early as three or four years of age you teach them you teach them al-fatiha you teach them very small easy to pronounce surahs and encourage them so once they are able to go to circles of memorization of the quran you enlist them in one and focus on monitoring the teacher so that you ensure he does not do things that would make them resent the quran such as resorting to violence or criticizing them try to choose a good teacher and you revise them you reward them you encourage them with all the means you can remember that in islam those who memorize the quran have a priority over others the prophet said allah the leader the imam the one who leads the prayer is the one who memorizes the quran most regardless of his color you're black you're white regardless of your lineage regardless of your citizenship so are you an arab are you from this country or from that it doesn't matter what matter is your knowledge of the quran so the prophet is highlighting the importance of the quran um when he may allah be pleased with him went to mecca he was met by the ruler of mecca so he said you come to meet me midway who is running makkah he said i left one of our freed slaves to assume the government and rule and govern the mecca while in my absence so rama said you appointed a free slave to the people of mecca and the ruler said yes o khalifa he is a master of quran sciences he memorizes the quran he knows the inheritance how to distribute them and he is a student of knowledge so omar said subhan allah allah uplifts people with the quran and turns people down to the ground when they neglect and abandon the quran so this freed slave is now is no one in the standard of today's world so it's not what you know it's who you know at that time no it is what you know that counts so it doesn't matter if you're black or white it doesn't matter which tribe you belong to what counts is your knowledge of the quran so teaching our children how to memorize the quran would benefit them big time in terms of men like methodology and teaching the quran what we see many times is young boys young girls they will memorize the quran however they don't understand they don't have understanding so it's like they're a sponge they take it in but it's hard to find remnants of the quran and the way of being because they don't understand what they're memorizing so what's the the way of doing so well here you have to be realistic someone who does not know arabic you have one of two choices teach them arabic or teach them the quran and hope that arabic comes later on teaching them arabic in non-muslim countries is difficult because as you know learning the language without the ability of practicing it makes you forget things i did french for two and a half years at college and i was an a student after two three months it's all gone down the drain because there's no practice so if you teach your children arabic without practicing then they will forget this but if you teach them quran even if they don't understand it they'll memorize it they'll revise it and somewhere down the line someone will tell them you know this ayah it means so and so and wow it means so so now i know okay i relate this word to that word it's found in this chapter it's they pick up arabic easily but the opposite would not be that easy so you teach them arabic they spend six years five years and then you try to teach them the quran it becomes more difficult because now they're older so it depends on the pros and cons for the children in arabia they already know arabic we have no problem with that but for the children in america if we teach them arabic it would compromise the time and the effort on teaching them quran and other things so they have to balance it and check what is best for the children thank you sheikh for your immense knowledge and wisdom that you're sharing with us today unfortunately we're going to stop the segment here and continue inshaallah in another segment on another episode of life's adornments as always we appreciate you very much for our viewers thank you so much for joining us we pray that you benefited greatly from this program until next time assalamu [Music] [Music]"
