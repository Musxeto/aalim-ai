  "title": "Why do we have only 4 Great Imams, why not more? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "it is important for us to know exactly where these scholars were coming from and why they differed one may ask why then only four well actually if you remember a while ago I mentioned the students of Medina for aha Sabah nur fair Sal him all of these great jurors of Medina great jurors of Mecca of Kufa of Basra but the problem is that there were great scholars other than these four amounts maybe even greater than them in knowledge and else and other things for example Malika bananas was the Imam of Medina but everyone knows that a lathe had Mossad was the judge of Egypt and the contemporary say that he was more knowledgeable than medical we know that there was sofia an aviary know there was sofia an authority there was abdullah even embarked there was an aussie in lebanon there was brahim Inari great great scholars heavy duty but they did not have schools of thought so why were those of these four great imams having such large followers while these other greater amounts were unfortunate not to have scholars say that this was due to the number of students see when you have a great number of students to carry your knowledge and spread it worldwide then you have a name a reputation and a school that is followed but if you're a great scholar one of the greatest yet you are not blessed with students who take care of your knowledge and embrace it as their own and work hard to spread it worldwide you knowledge will die after a few years so if you look at this for four schools of thought let it be known that they were not the only scholars of the times there were far greater scholars than them but allah azzawajal gave their work prominence and made it spread all over the world for a wisdom he only Allah surgeon knows about also it is worth noting that these four Imams were not a one-man show rather if you look at their biography you will find that for example imam abu hanifa had a great number of scholars to learn from and he did not assume the position of teaching until he was like 40 years of age when his shake his scholar teacher died and he assumed his place also if you look at Imam Malik among his teachers were the descendants of companions so the sons of the Companions and their sons he had 900 of them no wonder he did not have to leave medina to seek knowledge like all other scholars yet he was permitted to give fatwa as at a very early age Imam Shafi likewise he was 15 when he started giving fatwa and teaching he was 15 others at this age maybe even older are preoccupied by pub G or playing fortnight now Imam Shafi Imam Shafi stayed in mekka learning Arabic or an and hadith and and then went to Medina where he became the student of him a medic alert in my Maddox and knowledge from him and he said that no one has any right over me more than imam malik as he is my teacher and i'd benefited a lot from him if you look at him I met him in Hamburg a man who traveled all over the world to listen to the hadith to compile the hadith he went from Haddad to the areas near persia and and horus and what's after that ever they call it he went to a yemen he went to Mecca he went to Medina he traveled like crazy but look what was the result being Imam hallucinatee wa l-jama'a so they've learnt from those who came before them and they would not give something that is out of the blue except after implementing this knowledge that they had received from those who were before them"
