  "title": "Lying about her religion on documents for her safety from her family #islam #islamic assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Um so my friend would be beaten up and probably be not safe if her ali family finds out that she has become Muslim. Um she has to do a contract where she would where she should name her religion. Can she say that she's Ali as there would be a family member with her that would see if she would say that she's Muslim. What is this contract about? And for school. No problem inshallah if she fears for her safety and life there's no problem in such a lie but I would highly advise her if it is possible whenever it's possible to uh go to a Muslim uh Sunni relative if she has any or a Sunni Muslim um friend that she could live with until she can get married to a Muslim individual and practice her religion freely."
