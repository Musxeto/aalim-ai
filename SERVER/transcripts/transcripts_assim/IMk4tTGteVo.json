  "transcript": "Talha from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Talha Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh My question is, is Fiqh Al-Akbar and Fiqh Al-Afsad correctly attributed to Abu Hanifa? Because I hear many people call him a jahmi or an innovator for the things he said in Fiqh Al-Akbar and Fiqh Al-Afsad Okay, first of all, these two books are disputed upon whether they were written by Al-Imam Abu Hanifa or not. And these books are in aqeedah. Al-Fiqh Al-Akbar is in issues of aqeedah. I personally believe that they are not attributed correctly to him and that he did not compile them. Nevertheless, those who speak freely about this great imam of the Muslims, Imam Abu Hanifa Al-Nu'man, and they take their time slandering him or belittling him or say that he is a murji, and they speak about him as if he is a pupil in kindergarten, definitely have no knowledge with all due respect to them. I don't know them. And again, this is a problem and an issue with so many people. We have a saying in Arabic, whoever has a bump on his head, he should feel it just to make sure that it is there existing. So many times I'm asked on Twitter or on live TV about issues or things that I don't have a background over or who said it. He could be someone of an influencer, someone of a great number of followers. I don't care. I don't know the individual. I don't know who they're talking about. They're asking me about an issue in Islam, halal or haram, and I give my opinion accordingly. And this backfires and people say, oh, you meant this, you meant that. I did not mean anything, akhi. I would call a spade a spade in his face. I have no problem with that. But when someone comes to me and says that there are people who speak about Abu Hanifa, and I say these are ignorant imbeciles because the imam is renowned for his contribution in Islam and in fiqh. And the great imams of Islam, such as Imam Malik, Imam Abu Hanifa, Abu Shafi and the people of the Salaf, the scholars, have praised him. So for you to come after like 14, 13, 12 centuries later and start to criticize him and speak about his aqeedah as if he's one of your students, this is ignorance. With all due respect, I don't know who you are, but this is a plain hard fact. So take it for what it is worth and try your level best to respect these scholars and these imams and Allah knows best."
