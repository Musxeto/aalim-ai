  "transcript": "muhammad uh for han from the philippines my question is that can almond decide not to get married like he doesn't want to get married and also also goes to a man if he doesn't want to get married is it promising getting married is a sunnah that all prophets and messengers had followed allah mentioned in the quran addressing the prophet that all prophets and messengers before you they used to walk in the streets they used to eat food and they used to get married and the prophet said allah said in an authentic hadith i get married i sleep and pray i fast and break my fast whoever chooses a sunnah a way other than my way is not from me so the prophet got married multiple times and he encouraged the youth when he said o youth whoever has the physical and financial ability must get married and whoever is unable then he must fast so the prophet instructed us allah to get married encouraged us to get married is it mandatory the answer is no it is dependent on the person so if a person knows that he is hot-blooded that he has a lot of desire that may drive him crazy in this case it is mandatory upon him to get married or mandatory upon her to get married how would we know that by the amount of sins this particular individual is falling into so he says sheikh i don't want to get married why is it i don't feel like it it's a lot of responsibility blah blah blah blah said okay we look into his life we find that this brother or this sister he she is engaged in watching pornography and maybe masturbating and totally distracted thinking about what is natural in every single human being in this case we say it's mandatory for you to get married because you are committing a lot of evil a lot of haram a lot of transgression someone who says i don't want to get married and he or she has no desire in being intimate with the opposite gender all they are focused upon is serving their parents or their business or their studies they don't even care about issues of intimacy at all they don't have any desire for it they're normal human beings but it's so low their sex drive they don't think about it and they know themselves that if they were to get married they would maybe fall into more sin being unfair being undutiful to their spouse being this and that in this case if such a person does not want to get married at the moment may postpone it for a couple of years there is no problem in that and allah azza knows best you"
