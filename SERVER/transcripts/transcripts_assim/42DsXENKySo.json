  "transcript": "Noor from Nigeria. He says, 'how do we praise \nAllah before we make dua?' Praising Allah is   an essential thing before making dua. The more you \npraise Allah, the more Allah is happy and pleased.   The Prophet said, 'alayhi salatu wa salam,   Allah, the almighty, loves to be praised. \nWhy does Allah love to be praised? Because   He is the only One worthy of being praised. No \none, no matter what you say, is worthy of that   more than Allah, Azza wa Jal. He's the Creator. \nHe's the Owner. He's the Provider. He's the   Merciful One. He's the One Who Forgives. He's \nthe One Who Gives. He's the One Who Guides. So no   matter what you do to praise Him, that would not \nbe sufficient. And it is an essential part of your   existence to praise Allah, Azza wa Jal, all the \ntime. And praising Him can go without an end.   And this is why the Prophet, 'alayhi salatu wa \nsalam, said that, 'I cannot limit, or calculate,   or specify praising you O' Allah, Azza wa Jal. \nBecause this is countless, I cannot'. So praising   Allah, Azza wa Jal, indicates your poverty to \nHim, your need, your humility to the almighty,   Azza wa Jal. So if you say 'Alhamdulillah. \nAllahumma salli wa sallam 'ala Muhammad. Oh Allah,   give me this, give me that, give me this, give me \nthat.' You've praised Him.But is it like when the   Prophet, 'alayhi salatu wa salam, praises Allah, \nthe almighty, at night time when he says, [...].   If you go through the translation - I think our \ntime will be up - but this one specific hadith,   and I just read the tip of it. There is much more \nafterwards. You'd see how much love and respect   and obedience and submissiveness \nthe Prophet had in his heart.   When he praises Allah , Azza wa Jal, \nby saying, 'O, All praise be to Allah,   the Guardian of the heavens and the earth. The \nLight of the heavens and the earth. The King of   the heavens and the earth.' And he continues \nto praise Allah. This type of praising Allah   is a preparation for making your dua which will \ndefinitely be heard with the grace of Allah."
