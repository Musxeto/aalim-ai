  "transcript": "Abu Yahya from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Sheikh in the UK some restaurant owners have something called bring your own so what that basically means is that they don't sell alcohol on the premises but if you bring your own alcohol then it's okay so is it permissible for a Muslim to have this rule where they allow others to bring their own alcohol onto the premises and consume this with their meals is this allowed first of all it is mentioned clearly in chapter 5 Surah Al Maidah verse number 2 Allah Azza Wa Jal clearly states وَتَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْبِرِّ وَالتَّقْوَى وَلَا تَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْإِثْمِ وَالْعُدْوَانِ and collaborate upon righteousness and piety and do not collaborate upon sins and transgression by advertising, by putting a sign, by publicizing that you bring your own I have no problem if you bring your whiskey, your Guinness, your lager, your wine in my restaurant, you're okay with that this is collaborating upon sins and transgression you're advertising, you're endorsing it and this is totally prohibited in Islam you must not do such a thing at all or you will gain the same sins they are doing in that place"
