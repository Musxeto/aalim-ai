  "title": "Can we combine prayers without any reason even when I'm a resident? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so now we're going to add meet your risk of shoot at approximately okay I have no problem with that listen happy combining prayers was not done by the prophet alayhi salatu salam except once in his life time in medina and you're gonna have best may allah be pleased with him and with his father said what did the prophet combined over NASA mahaganesha though there is no there is no need for it there's no grain and he's not traveling he's staying in medina once in his lifetime the rabbi said he wanted not to burden his ummah Rama this is India Pakistan so time management may Allah grant us the reward of staying in this place for acquiring knowledge so that the Angels would descend upon us and the rahman the Sakina the large surgeon would overwhelm us and allah almighty would call us and and mention our lives in the seventh heaven anyhow yes so the Prophet did this once had a stalker sir the scholars say that whenever there is an essential need a true real need it is permissible for you to combine prayer while you presiding I'm not talking about travelling travelling is it a separate issue when I am traveling I have the option to join between us and for mother in Malaysia this is my option on a traveler but those who are residing they must pray on time unless there is a legitimate real legitimate reason for that for example I am going I'm going to go for a knee surgery and it is a lower time I prayed the heart and the surgery is do act for example 3:30 and I know that under the anaesthesia I would probably go intimidation time sedated so okay in this case Islam tells me it's okay to pray also we'll talk at one o'clock because this is a necessity one the surgeon is the same thing because he's the one operating our excuse me I have to go and pray my that's open so this this is okay this is a necessity now scholars cascade this to real necessities for example I'm in the middle of a test and this test starts at 1:30 p.m. and I am not allowed to leave the room until it is mother at sunset I will miss Russell for example this is hypothetical so what should I do it's conversate because this is a necessity you you are unable don't have the time they will not allow you from you gonna cheat so you have to stay this is a one-timer that it's okay for you to combine but if someone says shake I'm in the middle of a lecture and mother if time passes and Asia time afterwards so miss Mullen so can I combine and see it's a lecture I don't know about the system here in the UK if you're in the lecture can't you go out to the loo if you have to go for one with not number one or number two yeah it will you wait a couple of hours or you will just excuse me I have to go people go you go for our smoke you go for coffee so you're unable to go for three minutes prayer no I don't blush it I have to say I'm going to for prayer sorry we can't do the problem of not finding MSU and this is not a problem at all I have been Allah and Islam we don't have to pray only in a message or in a church or in a synagogue the Prophet says having a salat WA Salam that Allah Almighty has made the whole earth a place of worship and means of purification then I can miss him so whomever gets the prayer time you should pray anywhere this means that if I'm on Oxford Street [Music] I just said it so there's an Oxford Street and people are going and coming it's time for prayer I look around there is no place for message it at corner that is 3 foot by 1/2 foot is enough for me where is the Akbar I pray and I finish I go just but there are people passing by so this is one form of Dharma if you I see I've seen a lot of the Muslims skip two or three prayers on the plane why doesn't look nice you know imagine me in the middle of the pray plane in the first class Oh [Music] well I think we we put the feet in our hearts everybody respects us well by help you would respect us on the plane on none Southie none had a plate I ask that is it possible pray next to the emergency door next to that to the wing sisters and they bring me a blanket in the booty track pray LUN I know I got scared but not to that extent that they were allowing me to do this so it is us who are weak who are not proud about religion you have the player this is a form of terror therefore I hope I answered your question that is you can pray whatever you want you cannot combine the prayers unless you have a true legitimate reason that allah sultan would allow you to do this baba"
