  "transcript": "[Music] is there a minimum and a maximum hours that one has to fast on a day in Ramadan I began fasting while traveling from a country a and within six to seven hours I landed in country B where it was already mother what should I do you as an individual are accountable in front of Allah for your own sunrise but that is break of dawn and sunset regardless of anyone else regardless of your country or the country traveling to so this means that I as an individual my prayer time depends on the position of the Sun at the moment if I'm traveling from Kuala Lumpur to Jeddah Saudi Arabia I'm going westbound which means that the Sun would not move almost I travel takeoff at 12:30 noon I reach at 2:00 o'clock noon I did not pray any prayer or I retreat I pray Lord for raka but if the opposite takes place if I travel from Jeddah to Kuala Lumpur I'm going east which means that I am racing with the Sun so I try takeoff at 4 o'clock a.m half an hour later it's the break of dawn I can see it from the airplane window I professor on the plane though they did not create in Jeddah where I took off after a few hours I pray the her and also and I reach Kuala Lumpur at 5 p.m. so my prayer is dependent on the position of the Sun where I am so by this if I take off at 7 o'clock a.m. in Saudi Arabia I'm fasting 7 or 6 hours later I see the Sun setting though I'm flying still in Jeddah they are still fasting in this case yes I break my fast because I saw the Sun sets not waiting for people of Saudi Arabia or people of this country or that country it depends where I am and the Sun is now regarding the minimum or the maximum there is no minimum or maximum if I'm going east bound yes I'm a fast four five six hours but if I I'm traveling westbound it may take me 20 hours to complete the day because I have to fast according to the position of the Sun [Music] [Applause]"
