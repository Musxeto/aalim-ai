  "title": "Calling someone Shaheed or Martyr & how to bury him who died in the cause of Allah- Assim Alhakeem",
  "transcript": "the prophetess salatu salam ordered those who died from the muslims to be buried as they were and in this LOM a martyr a person who dies in the battlefield in the cause of allah and so gel is not washed and is not wrapped in kevin rat he is wrapped in his own clothes as he is and we do not pray the funeral prayer on him he's just buried as he is but we cannot say that he is a martyr we say that he died at the cause of allah and allah azza wajal alone can determine if he is a martyr or not because if we say someone is a martyr is Shaheed this means that we are granting him paradise it's a blank check of him that he isn't in paradise and this is something no one can guarantee except Alonso gel or the Prophet SAW Salim who is ordered and instructed by Allah what about groups that say that they are martyred for Islam and they are Shaheed for Islam and these causes is that not how do we justify this well this this is a common mistake and amaru hopup has reported in sahih al-bukhari said do not say martyrs because if you say martyrs this mean you're saying that they are in general and Allah social nose alone who's in general so they just say they they died in the cause of Allah and if their martyr or not this is something that only Allah knows and it's a common yes so hope easily it hope is different than labeling so you can say we hope and pray that he's a martyr but you don't say he is a martyr and so many times we hear in the news especially in Arabic and they say that three were killed by Israeli fire gunfire and they were martyred you cannot say this because we don't know if they're martyrs or not and that is why the prophets are solemn when he was approached by one of his companions and he said o prophet of Allah a person among us dies for bravery so that people can say he's a brave warrior and another one dies for glory and honor and another one dies for the lutes and the money where and the bounty we get from the battlefield so which one among them is a martyr look it's it's a very critical question so the Prophet answers whomever dies in the cause of Allah whomever dies to make the word of Allah the highest so the previous three are not that the cause of Allah so they are not Martin and when you see people die in the battlefield they all die the same way but their intention is very different and this is why it's the difference between hypocrites and Muslims are with the intention though the the acts and the actions themselves are similar it could make a sense for me to understand now that it's too hard for human beings or for just creations and end of the day were just slaves to Allah that we can tell about someone so and so he sends good for giving and he's in havens now he's in paradise because I heard that like you know some sorts of groups or like in Christianity basically I hate that they like some people they have the ability as they say who died as they claim that they can give one paradise or can put another in a fire yeah this is this is not the case in Islam no one can say a person is in paradise or is not and that is why we've mentioned this earlier as malleable mother owned the companion of the Prophet and amongst the very first two migrated to Medina he had the lady that he was staying at her house because you remember when the may the people of Mecca migrated to Medina the prophets are Salim associated each member with his brother from Medina from the answer so they became brothers so he stayed with this family I was mad at my mother when he died as he was lying dead the Prophet came Salalah has tell him to visit and to mourn and to bury him she said I testified by Allah that Allah surgeon has honored you and that you have been forgiven so the Prophet says our son how do you know that he objected so she said by Allah if but III seek Allah's forgiveness if RS man is not forgiven who is then if hurt marry mother on the companion your company or your loved one the one who was so close to you is not forgiven who then so the Prophet SAW solemn corrected her by saying I wish and I hope that he is in the clear and that Allah surgeon has forgiven his sins and put him in paradise but it's I myself I don't know what Allah will do of me this is a lesson for us not to be certain that Allah will forgive our sins because if you're certain then you can do whatever you want okay so says what about the people which they use the death sentence basically which that Allah is the most forgiving and Allah has the and allows the most most merciful and they gave themselves excuse to commit sins all the time and they say yeah it was in the end of the day Allah is gonna forgive us well this hadith answers them because the Prophet himself sallallahu Salem says I don't know what all's going to do with me so if the Prophet SAW salem does not guarantee he knows allah allah has forgiven his previous and coming sins but at the same time he is fearful because we are the creations of the creatures of Allah Allah created us and we cannot judge Allah we cannot question Allah so we do our best and hope for the best but this does not mean that we do not fear Allah to the extent that we balance our fear with our hope"
