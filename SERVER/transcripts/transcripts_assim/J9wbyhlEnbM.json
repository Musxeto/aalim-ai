  "transcript": "like in tombok 2 for example Mali it is astonishing how the international criminal court the United Nation the UNESCO are condemning the demolition of tombs they believe that 333 Saints protect Timbuktu and in Islam this is Major shirk this is kufur this is disbelief this nullifies your Islam if you believe that a human being let alone a dead person in a grave can protect you from Harm's Way and they condemned this they were outraged by demolishing few Stones while in Burma the haringas and in arakan in Syria all the atrocities all the killings it's okay it's an issue of dispute among Scholars but when it comes to Stones the things that go against our religion against our tawheed subhanallah they all collaborate to defend these false shrines that go against Islam"
