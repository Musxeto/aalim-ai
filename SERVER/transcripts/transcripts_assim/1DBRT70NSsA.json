  "transcript": "he is asking about keeping my distance from my kinship just to avoid argument and to avoid conflict I'm not sibling my kinship I meet with them I exchange Salam with them I may be it occasionally send them an SMS or call them on the phone but I don't like mixing with them I don't like to go once every week or a couple of weeks and hang out with them or invite them to my home or going to their homes and eat I just tried my level best to maintain a cordial relationships without falling into argument to avoid conflict is there anything wrong with that as long as it is not considered to be severing your kinship there's nothing wrong in that at all sometimes you may talk to them once every month that would be the norm because anything less than that it would be a little bit cold and people would think that okay he is shivering his kinship"
