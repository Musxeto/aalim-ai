  "transcript": "El what what's the ruling on wearing the cap before praying so the question is what's the ruling on wearing the uh toppy or the capup before praying there is nothing in the Quran or in the Sunnah that recommends it or that says it's better or that says if you pray your prayer is less however it's a cultural thing so it depends on the culture on the people if the people 24 hours are wearing a head cover then it is best to wear it because because it's a sign of prestige and dignity and honor but if the people all the time are not wearing anything only when they come to the Masjid they put this kuia or in some countries I saw a very weird phenomena they bring a handkerchief and they place it and they tie the four ends it look like a drone and this is where the Drone came from and it looks it looks funny but they pray and afterwards they put take it off and put it in their pocket this is wrong this is not from the Sunnah and it's not from Islam to wear such a thing unfortunately if you go to their homes they will find that the father and the brothers Force the women folk their mothers and their sisters and their daughters to wear the hair cover why there's no n said no no no you have to do this you can't eat without wearing the hijab you can't go to the toilet without wearing the hijab you crazy so no if you don't do this the the angels will curse you who said this what religion is this Hinduism even the Hindus don't do this so these people are following a different religion than the religion of prophet Muhammad Alat wasam either prove it from Quran or Sunnah or leave us alone don't invent in our religion invent introduce hardship to people's Liv lives without Del proof from the Quran and the Sunnah and Allah Knows Best"
