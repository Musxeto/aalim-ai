  "title": "Hadith Whoever is concerned about Duniya, Allah will scatter his affairs, how to prioritise Akhirah?",
  "transcript": "my questions regarding actually um the Hadith goes whoever um whoever is focused only on this world Allah will make us Affairs uh difficult they can feel probably um we did not get anything of this world except which has been decreed for him and whoever is focused on the Hereafter Allah will tell us for him we can feel content we can uh which is a provision and they will again will come to him even if he doesn't want it so my question is uh how uh as a lady like do we focus on more on the key after making hairstyles because we have to you know do our job and we get a review to others so we do pray part time then with Quran we are very fortunate really but it's better enough to make uh so the Hadith is a well-known Hadith foreign is all that preoccupies him then Allah azzawajal would make all of his Affairs scattered there's no Baraka in time and his poverty was would be right in front of him all what he see is lack of funds and poverty even if he's rich but he doesn't see himself rich and he's always depressed and nothing would come from this Dunya to his sustenance except what Allah has decreed nothing no favors no blessings and the opposite is to the other person so the question of salihin is how do we attain this high level of making the the Hereafter or preoccupation something that preoccupies our minds and lives okay this is very simple what do you prioritize in life those who prioritize worldly Affairs over pleasing Allah how do I know Sheikh by skipping Salah due to attending a football match or a meeting or to go out with the the boys or to play or to watch a movie you have no problem in skipping us Allah yeah I can make it up later on by favoring Haram over what pleases Allah so if there's a bribe wow man I'm gonna get rich if someone asks me to cheat or to steal or to lie or to falsely testify no problem business as usual I'm getting rich what is my focus to get this Dunya to collect as much as I can this is the person that would go quickly down the drain even if he's the richest man on earth he's still unsatisfied he would never be satisfied go to Bangladesh go to Pakistan go to Somalia go to Yemen go to poor countries and look at the Muslims they live below poverty line and you say salaam alaikum how are things what would they say alhamdulillah Everything Is Beautiful over what you don't have a car you don't have a house you live in a tent your kids are scattered all over the country and you barely have food what are you praising Allah for Allah has given me so much you're killing me man these guys care about what Allah is pleased with not of this Dunya this is why they're rich internally yes they don't have a dime but they have satisfaction they have content they go to bed with an easy mind and their pillow is the most comfortable pillow on Earth while the richest man on the world in the world could not sleep without tranquilizers and and downers or whatever they take before going to bed this is the difference so there's nothing wrong and working to gain a good position or money or studying hard to get a degree all of this is totally legal and permissible where is your heart I have to bend the rules a bit I have to cheat I have to lie in order to get things going Allah is forgiving Allah is most merciful you've lost your test but if I always do if I always walk the talk and do what pleases Allah I'm in good hands in sha Allah and I hope this answers your question"
