  "transcript": "may Allah preserve you and you as well uh my question related to marriage actually it's been more than a year I'm looking for a wife I tried to put some filters out to at least try to get the best results but until now fortunately at least here in the salafi commun it's really complicated because I put just some few filters like no music no TV like not no free mixing full hijab and the last one is like not posting yourself and stuff like that but sh been a year I couldn't find until now a possible match up because even now when I want to even the biggest show here they just tell me okay make Dua it's very difficult to find a woman like this even me I don't have some kind of woman like that really complicated I don't know what you can advise for me in that situation A this is totally uh not true I do a lot of counseling sessions and I meet a lot of practicing sisters from Africa who are looking for real practice men who do not want free mixing who do not want music who do not want uh uh them to expose themselves and who do not want their wives to work rather they want to be the providers the men the Guardians and they want a stayhome wife a lot unfortunately I don't involve myself in matchmaking otherwise I would have been more than happy to guide you to but I don't keep records of this but I have seen a lot so maybe you're not looking in the right place and you need to maybe check with the proper Islamic matrimonial sites that have good conditions of not premixing not asking not contacting directly the potential um candidate and you will inshallah be successful in finding uh what you want and Allah Knows Best"
