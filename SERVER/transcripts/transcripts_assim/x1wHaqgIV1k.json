  "transcript": "while watching the new moon sighting it felt like a good day lighting this day is alright as the first time i was the night with family around a nice meal we're making the one i feel how nice it is to be so neat to those i love dear brothers and sisters in islam and welcome to this new episode of virtues of fasting coming to you live from jeddah saudi arabia hadith number 13 we read it yesterday and we explained parts of it and it needs more elaboration so here we go again hadith number 13 huray may allah be pleased with him said that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam forbade us from practicing with all in fasting what is wasall he said fasting continuously without breaking one's fast in the evening or eating before the following dawn this is the commentary so the hadith goes on a man said to him but you practice with al o prophet of allah the prophet said sallallahu alaihi which one of you is like me i'm given food and drink during my sleep by allah and it can be translated as i stay with my allah and he feeds me and nourishes me with water so when people refused to stop with all the prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam fasted day and night continuously along with them for a day and then another day and then they sow the crescent of the new month of shawwal the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said to them if the crescent had not appeared i would have made you fast for a longer period that was a punishment for them because they refused to stop practicing wasal and this hadith was agreed upon now the hadith is clear and we spoke a little bit about it yesterday and we elaborate a little bit more in sha allah what is uh is actually not breaking the fast when the break of the when uh the sun sets usal is actually not breaking your fast when the sun sets but rather you decide to go on to continue and this was done by the prophet israel and he used to not break his fast when the sun sets but rather keep on fasting till the following day and maybe more than that so the companions as usual wanted to follow suit because he's our role model whatever he does we do now the prophet allah forbade them from that and why is that because islam is a religion of simplicity and ease and allah does not want us to kill ourselves allah does not want us to torture ourselves so the prophet alaihistalatus forbade them from doing this as he forbade the companions from doing other things that would be considered not natural for example and we mentioned this i think yesterday three men came to the prophet's houses inquiring about his forms of worship but then they belittled it they thought that the prophet has been forgiven his previous and upcoming sins therefore he doesn't need to do a lot of good deeds so one of them said i pledge that i would never sleep at night i will always continue the whole night praying the second one said i will never break my fast i will fast every single day not skipping a single day the third one said i will deprive myself from halal sexual desires and i will never get married in my life when the prophet allah heard this he was outraged he was angry now no one doubt that these companions had a good intention no one doubt that they were sincere in their belief no one accuses them of hypocrisy but the good intention is not sufficient see in order for your good deeds to be accepted two things much must be present one sincerity and definitely these three companions had sincerity two compliance with the sunnah of the prophet alaihis allah because if you do something that is not in accordance to the sunnah this is an innovation and allah azza will reject it allah would not accept it and there are so many evidences backing this up the hadith mother aisha says may allah be pleased with her the prophet said alaihis whoever innovates in our religion what is not part of it it is rejected so no one can introduce or invent or innovate a new form of worship claiming that this is something that is good and we should practice this because you're accusing the prophet al-islam of not disclosing the deen and delivering it completely or you are accusing the prophet salallahu of not knowing that this is good so you're accusing him of ignorance and both sides whoever does this would be committing an act of kuffer so ardeen is a religion of ease and simplicity it's unlike the difficulties that were put upon the jews and the christians and their religions our religion is a religion of ease and simplicity and leaving wasala is something that is highly recommended because if you continue to do wasall you will be abandoning a sunnah that is recommended which is to hasten in breaking your fast so what is the format of wasala how do people continue to fast well scholars say that you fast from the break of dawn till sunset and you don't break your fast you continue until the second until the night is over and then you fast the second day until sunset so this is approximately 36 maybe 40 hours of total fasting from food and drink and sexual desires this is one way of fasting of doing wasal and had any of the companions done such a thing the answer is yes definitely one of the famous companions of the prophet saw who used to do a lot of wasal was abdullah ibn zubair may allah be pleased with him and with his father is one of the ten heaven bound companions and his mother the mother of zebedee is the the the prophet's aunt safiya bint abdullah the mother of zubair raised him in a very harsh and hard way so that he would become a brave and gallant warrior and so he was he probably raised his son to be the same but abdullah zubair had a wonderful mother as well and she was so she was the sister of aisha the mother of the believers and she was the daughter of abu bakr may allah be pleased with them all az-zubair it was reported in his biography that he used to continue to fast for up to 15 days and this is shocking and probably medical doctors would say that this is impossible but it is possible and we will come to uh discuss this later on in sha allah so when you look at the prohibition of islam you will find that the sharia islam is being merciful to the believers and allah wants ease for them and that is why whatever harms the muslims by default islam prohibits it so whatever is harmful islam's general legal maxim or general rule is that there is no harm to be inflicted and no harm to be initiated so anything that's harmful so smoking how is smoking in islam we ask the doctors is it harmful they say yes definitely and it's a cause of so many major diseases in this case we say that sorry you have a big problem and this is prohibited to consume to smoke or to sell so if you go and look at the hadith the hadith tells us that the prophet used to do it allah he used to continue fasting and technically speaking whatever the prophet did allah whatever the prophet said allah this is a sunnah we should follow unlike what some scholars say and this is a big issue of a dispute whenever the prophet says something and he does something contrary to it so some scholars say we always apply what he did as for uh we always apply let me rephrase that we always apply what he said because his actions might be something specific and special for him not for his ummah so for example when the prophet says that whoever drinks standing up he should throw it out because shaytan has drunk with him and in another hadith we find that the prophet saw exempts them standing up so these scholars say that when he said that you should not drink while standing up this is prohibited his action this is for him this is a special case for the prophet allah but this is not the norm because the norm is that whenever the prophet orders us something then this is what we should apply and we should not say that everything that he does is something specific for him because then we can reject a lot of the hadiths of his own actions by such a claim and whatever the prophet did allah this is specifically for him no we cannot say this unless he tells us for example mother aisha says that the prophet saws prayed night prayer and then he took a nap before fajr and she heard him snore meaning that he was in deep sleep then bilal came announcing to him that it is fajr time so he stood up and went to pray isha brought the matter to his attention o prophet of allah you slept until you snored and by default this needs for you to make a new wudu he said my heart does not sleep while my eyes do meaning that he is alert even when he is asleep whether he had nullified his wudu or not no one can claim that this is the same with him this is a specific thing for the prophet he told us that o people straighten your rose because i see you from the back of my head meaning that allah gives him the vision to see the rose in salat not that he always see those coming behind him behind him no but this is a treat something that allah gives him only in prayer when he is straightening the rose and praying with the congregation so the most authentic opinion is that whatever the prophet does it is a sunnah it is something that is legitimate for the whole ummah unless another evidence another instruction comes and tells us that whoops this is specifically for the prophet salallahu for example the prophet married eight or nine women at the same time he had nine wives at the same time while for us men we only can combine between four wives and this is mentioned in the quran as for the prophet as islam it is also mentioned that this is specifically for him and no one else now the prophet alaihis wasalam told them not to make wasala so one of the companions complained not out of rejecting the prophet's instructional islam but rather because he wanted clarification so he said but you prophet of allah you make wasala you continue fasting so this explains to you the character of the prophet salat being the leader being the number one position in the uh muslim among with the muslims and the teacher and the messenger of allah yet when he heard such a complaint or an objection he would not become angry and curse the man on the contrary he justifies his decision to him and he says i am unlike you i am not like you and he gives the justification which we will come and mention insha allah any in a while and so this shows you how the prophet's chest was expanding and was so big and compassionate to his companions that he would answer them back and explain to them what they were unable to understand also in the hadith we learn and we see how the companions may allah be pleased with them did not leave a thing without inquiring and asking and this shows you why they were the best of generations because they asked about everything that would get them closer to allah so they thought that this is a good form of worship because we will not eat and drink we will continue the hardship ourselves and this might get us closer to allah so they objected o prophet of allah you continue to fast you do wasall so why shouldn't we you are our role model the prophet allah gave them the justification he says i am not like you no one can be like me i stay with allah azzawajal and he nourishes me and he gives me food and drink and scholars differed in interpreting this some of them said that allah azza gives him food and water from jannah from paradise and he eats from that and the other scholar said that no this is not possible because if allah provides him with food whether from jannah or from earth then he would not be fasting he would have broken his fast so this is unacceptable and the other meaning which is the most authentic and the only acceptable is that when he said that allah feeds me and nourishes me with water he meant that allah substitutes me with satisfaction physically that i do not need water and food and this is usually done when you are in a state a mental state that you're so happy with the one you love that you may not require food and drink imagine someone that you really care for or someone you love who comes from a long journey you haven't seen each other for a while and sometimes you sit and talk for six or seven hours opening subject after a subject without paying attention to the time or that you have haven't eaten lunch or even dinner time passes you don't feel hungry so this is a possibility and it is a logical possibility in the authentic hadith the prophet islam when he spoke to us about the and if you recall our viewers on huda tv that two years ago in ramadan on huda tv we allah graced me and favored me to do a series on the signs of the hour the signs of the day of judgment so and i think it's still on the archive of huda tv we spoke about the dajjal extensively and among the things that we've mentioned was the hadith of the prophet when he said that the jal before he comes to the open and in the public there will be three years of drought and famine the first year allah azza instructs the the the the clouds the sky that is not to um that is to hold one third of a train and the earth to hold one third of its crops the second year allah orders the clouds to hold two-thirds of its rain and the earth two-thirds of its crops and the third year allah azza orders the clouds or the heavens to stop completely not a single drop of rain and earth not to grow a single grain or any of the crops nothing and there would not be a single livestock except very little and few that allah wishes and wills so the people asked the prophet alaihis salah to wasallam the companions asked o prophet of allah if there is no water and there is no crops and no livestock how do the people live how do the people manage to survive the prophet salallahu these four phrases allah inspires them to say it continuously and this substitutes for their food and their water is that logical yep it is logical because where do you get the power from where do you get the energy from where do you get the nourishment from you get it from allah azzawajal so if you depend and rely entirely on allah azzawajal by praising him by glorifying him by uh saying this atkar allah would suffice you from even needing food and drink and that is the essence of wisal once you have this full trust in allah azza it would suffice you from looking for physical needs but this is a very very very high level of iman and conviction and reliance on allah the almighty as those therefore this is possible this is applicable and this is probable so the companions may allah be pleased with them insisted on doing wasall despite the prohibition of the prophet alaihista so the prophet salallahu salaam wanted to teach them a lesson so they fasted the first day they did not break their fast they continued to fast the night afterwards of the same day and the following day they continued to fast and they were shattered they were tired and hungry and thirsty and when the sun had set they continued to fast but for their luck they were saved by the bell they cited the crescent which meant that tomorrow is shawwal so they cannot fast so immediately they went and broke their fast and drank water and the prophet said allah had we not seen the crescent i would have continued the third day meaning that he was punishing them so that they would learn to take allah's ease and permission when it is given to them and that is why scholars differed what's the ruling on wasall nowadays some say wasall is totally prohibited why because the prophet hasn't forbade it and he punished them for doing it others say no it is not prohibited because had it been prohibited he would not have approved them to do it even if he punished them he wouldn't have allowed them to continue to fast and he would have ordered them to stop and when you look at the hadith some may think that hmm the companions disobeyed the prophet al-assam is this possible no there is a difference between going against his instruction not as a part of disobedience but rather as a part of going against his instruction for a reason and this is existing in the sunnah of the prophet for example was a slave woman a concubin and she bought herself from her masters she had an agreement with her masses telling them listen i'll give you so and so money i'll work hard for it and then you set me free and they agreed so she went to mother aisha and she requested that she help her and she did she gave her the money and she bought her from her masters now when she became free she had the choice either to stay with her slave husband who was still owned by other people or to set herself free and marrying a free man so like any logical woman would do after obtaining her freedom she said no i don't want this marriage what would i do with a slave who cannot act or behave except with the instruction and order of his master i want to be set free so she got her freedom from slavery and from her husband the slave her husband marieth he loved her so much to the extent that he could not bear separating from her so he went to the prophet alaihista and he requested the prophet al-islam to intercede so the prophet went to baria and said barira how about if you go back to your husband marith and listen to what baria said she said oh prophet of allah are you ordering me now please clarify the situation for me is this an order the prophet said no i'm just an interce i'm not i'm just interceding so i'm just asking for a favor i'm not ordering you no this is not an obligation so immediately bharira said in this case a prophet of allah i have no need for him and this shows you the of the companions whether it is an order or it's in a request likewise may allah please with him he was the writer of the treaty between she was the envoy and the ambassador of the disbelievers and the prophet israel when the prophet in the battle of al-hudaybia or in the expedition of al-hudaybir went with his companions about fourteen hundreds of them to make umrah they were in their haram they were blocked in al hudaybiya nowadays ashmesi and they were prevented from entering the haram so they sent their envoys and tried their level best and then they agreed with the people of mecca to write a treaty and the treaty was unfair and unjust but the prophet alaihis islam did it because allah ordered him to do it so the first thing they wrote was bismillah so he'll said no this is the first thing that you rub off why he said i don't know what is we know allah allah so right bismillah or bismuth so the prophet ordered adi may allah be pleased with him erase it and write bismillah then he started dictating and ali is writing this is the treaty between muhammad the messenger of allah suhail said stop what is it he said if we approve that you are the messenger of allah we would not have any uh uh meat with you no we have we would not have any uh beef as they say no problem so we don't approve we don't agree that you are the prophet of allah so it is this so the prophet said to allah may allah be pleased with him it is the messenger of allah ali was outraged he said by allah you are the messenger of allah i'm not going to erase it so he disobeyed the direct order but his disobedience was not attributed to a sin rather to going against his instruction because of a legitimate reason likewise when the treaty was done the prophet salallahu salaam told the companions to shave their heads and to slaughter their sacrifice they said how do we do this and we did not do our umrah we did not go to makkah how can we shave without doing this so the none of them did it the prophet went to um may allah appears with her and said look at your people they're throwing themselves in hell they are destroying themselves and she said oh prophet of allah they are in a calamity they were expecting to go for umrah and to do this beautiful ritual and they were prevented so go out do not speak to a any person order the barber to come and shave your head and you do your sacrifice so the prophet went out of his tent as advised by um i'll be pleased with her and he ordered the barber who shaved his head and he slaughtered his sheep or his camel the minute the companions saw this may have pleased with them they immediately shaved their heads and slaughtered their sacrifice and they almost killed themselves by hastening to do such a thing and this shows you that they would never disobey the prophet but rather they would hope that something would change this is all what we have on this hadith we have a short break and afterwards we will be receiving your phone calls so stay tuned and welcome back we have fatima from saudi arabia if a menstruating uh lady realizes it is stopped after you heard can she continue fasting after a ghost as she did not eat anything from fajr when did she see her purity sorry when did she realize her purity after the world okay and uh the second one is can you please explain how to do okay okay fatima had two questions and the first question is um if a woman who's menstruating discovers that she had become pure the her time and she did not eat or drink anything can she continue her fasting the answer is no she has to realize and recognize her purity before fajr if she realized her purity five minutes after fajr her fasting would not be considered a valid we have um uh hadi from the emirates i wanted to ask you two questions yes one is that the fourth sunnah before isha prayer okay is what is up should we pray them are supposed to be offered or not okay and another question that i have is that uh usually when we go for paravis and uh imam he is uh he says the flame sooner then we are we are beat and we have not finished our durood or our salah so i want to make sure we say salam without finishing our dua and or should we continue finish it and then say salam okay i will answer you inshallah this question yesterday i had asked you but uh please enlighten me uh any person due to inability to pray standing and bowing and doing sajuda if he's doing praying on a chair so he has to stand for every raka shaykh yes i'm asking because i have seen here some people who are standing only in the first rakah and rest all rakahs they are praying by sitting sir okay i will answer your question yeah one more shake one more shake yes dates early morning to be eaten seven places so these are to be eaten how many days and uh like we do dua while drinking uh zamzam for any ailment or any sort of small sickness like that for rajab eating for that also we must make dua okay i will answer inshallah thank you i will call on every day maybe thank you you're welcome from saudi i've got two questions please yes one uh i want to know uh actually i have not finished my quran yet and i want to do that but is it compulsory to do it in arabic or i can do it in english as well and the second one is regarding the wither is it included in the taravi or is it prayed separately like we pray eight to ten taravi okay so is it included in the tenth one or is it separately performed i will answer you allah thank you you're welcome fatima from saudi arabia asked what is the description of russel and we've mentioned this a number of times there are two types of russell one is the russell that does the job but it is not part of the sunnah so if you go to the sea or to an ocean or to a river and you dip yourself turn the water in your mouth and rinse your nose by pulling uh the water up your nostrils and uh pushing it out if you do this you have with the knee with the intention your russell is complete you can pray the sunna is that first of all you wash your hand three times and then you wash your private parts and then you wash your hands again and then you perform wudu and then you take three scoops of water and you make sure that your scalp is uh wet and the water reaches your head and the roots of your hair you wash your hair and then you wash the right side of your body then the left side of your body then you wash your feet this is a sunnah and by this you have completed your your russell and you are permitted to pray with that also if it is from a major impurity such as sexual uh janaba or from uh cleansing yourself from menses if you uh a sister um from the emirates she says what is the ruling on praying for raka's before isha there isn't a sunnah prescribed of praying for raka's before isha there is a hadith but it's a an issue of dispute among scholars whether it's authentic or not the there isn't any prescribed sunnah or even a normal sunnah before isha except for the hadith of the prophet islam that between every adhan and there are two raka's and this is a general any adhan and we have muhammad from saudi hello i just have a quick question it might be slightly off topic but it's regarding pictures is that okay about what about picture taking pictures okay yes my question is um i mean i follow the opinion that taking pictures i understand his opinions and there's a lot of in-depth um information regard regarding this and it's been covered many times um but i just wanted to ask in regards to i i personally do not take pictures i follow the opinion that it is haram based on the view of many of the ulama i understand obviously there's issues regarding if it's printed out or if it's on the phone or you know something that can be turned off ietv etc um i just wanted to ask for that ruling is it the same for men and women or can women not take pictures without obviously being covered up i.e the nikah etc on a mobile phone okay i will answer you inshallah okay you're welcome and the second question from hadi she says that sometimes the imam of islam concludes his prayer while we're still reciting the uh the salutation to the prophet allah some of the invocations we would like to do so are we obliged to follow him when he concludes his salah some scholars and this is the opinion of shaykh in vasmi allah have mercy on say that no you are not obliged to follow him in this specific uh nation because in everything else before that you are whatever you do you have to follow but when it comes to the conclusion of the prayer when he offers salam then there is no following him up because the salah is over so you can take your time and say whatever you want and afterwards conclude your prayer farida from saudi okay sheikh i want to ask if there's any dua that i can find a righteous man for me what is that dua can you help me okay i will answer the question inshaallah and we have muhammad from saudi arabia i have a question yes yeah if i want to perform umrah and uh i will add this permissible or not or i must first clear the depth and then perform umrah you have a question where are you living yeah where are you living now currently i'm in saudi and uh i want to because i'm close to mata that's why i'm asking this okay i'm working okay okay i will answer your question inshaallah okay and allah from saudi arabia he says that if a person cannot prostrate and bow does he or is he obliged to stand up for every rakah because he heard that the first raka you have to stand up and afterwards the the remaining three rakhas you may sit down on the chair and the answer is no as long as you're capable of standing up the whole four raka's you have to stand up bowing and and prostrating is not applicable then you can sit down for bowing and prostrating but then you have to stand up once again we have um adi from saudi yes first of all uh since after um living here in saudi arabia for 19 years i'm leaving with a very heavy heart i don't feel like going back i would request you to please pray for me and my family for whatever god has got forward for us and i would appreciate that and the second thing is like in canada where i'm going um my children and their friends keep asking that a muslim man can marry kitab and it is forbidden for a muslim girl to marry outside her religion why is this so is there an answer for that okay i would answer i will try much very much and please pray for us from saudi arabia i want to know drawings pictures like doll pictures a picture picture fruits pictures this is haram okay i will answer your question okay um second question was regarding ajwa dates do we eat them every single day or how many how long yes you eat them every day unless then the the thing that the prophet gave you al-islam and uh prophesies and that is that black magic and poison would not harm you would stop so with the minute you stop eating it the the protection stops is there any do i like zamzam water no the answer is there isn't anything as such zoshan from saudi arabia he says do we have to make or finish the quran in ramadan in arabic no you don't have to it is recommended is highly recommended you don't have to finish the quran at all but the sunnah is that you do it once a month in ramadan if you can add more to that that's great if you can balance between it and english so that you can ponder upon what you read this is a win-win situation we have um aisha from the emirates during islam marriage is this a authentic because i never heard it before from anyone okay any more questions and we have fatima from nigeria allah um please i have three questions yes um after praying with your prayer during time with the imam is your question about twitter prayer with the taraweeh yeah with the imam yeah what's wrong with it this is a sunnah yeah is that allowed to pray after is that allowed to pray knife now after that okay second question um as a comprised speech during prayer third question and third question is is it comparing you to losing your hair if you have braids on your hair for women is it comparison to leaving them before you can pray gusu okay i will answer the question and we have shems from sudeen from saudi if a person tries to go for umrah from alexa and he passes through gets together airport and he misses the me court can he take the can he go to mosquito aisha to take his birth requirement or he has an atonement to pay for it where is he coming from he's coming from alihab at the moment airport okay excuse my flight and it passes through the mecca gets to jeddah airport without making the intention and does he have to go to um el aisha or tawhip okay i'll answer the question i will answer the question inshaallah was asking that is whitter part of tarawih or not the answer is yes witcher is part of any night prayer so some people would pray eight raka's of tarawih and then three rakaas of witter sometimes the imam extend it into ten raka's if he reciting something from the quran and offers winter of one rakah so this is all uh part of the taraweeh or part of night prayer amber from saudi amber from saudi arabia questions uh one i asked you about adikov and you told me that uh for a woman they have to do it in the mosque but here there's no availability for women to go and stay there and do at the council does that mean that they don't perform at the cough at all the women okay and second is um it's not like what but for like every muslim man or woman to give herself um as part of their duty you know to their disease your line is breaking your amber hello yes your line is breaking uh russell is duty upon every man and woman yeah okay should we give i'm to the deceased okay okay third question uh what's that say thank you okay you're welcome inshallah uh okay uh ahmad from saudi arabia my question is can i make dua for my grandfather who's already passed away is he muslim yeah okay i will answer you inshallah okay let us try to answer some of the questions muhammad from saudi arabia is asking about um the photographs what's the ruling on taking them it's an issue of dispute as you have mentioned earlier but the most authentic opinion is that it is permissible to take photographs for men for children and it's prohibited to take photographs for women even if she's your wife even if it's digital not to be printed or to keep photographs for uh uh deceased we have uh omar from or um from the emirates it's a contract that a certain amount should be paid to the bride after the marriage so is it a legal islamic point of view is it the mahara yes mahar mahar exactly i want to know the amount exactly which uh our prophet beloved prophet used to give to the daughters or what is the ruling sharia ruling for it okay i will answer your question inshallah thank you so much from nigeria says that what's ruling on reciting the quran while your aura is exposed and the answer is reciting the quran is permissible but why would someone recite the quran while he is nude for example this is a form of disrespecting the quran but is it invalid no it is valid one can memorize the quran revise the quran one can mention allah's name and remember allah even if his aura is exposed but the more you are decently dressed and properly positioned the better it is farida from saudi arabia she says is there any dua for a righteous husband the answer is there isn't any prescribed dua there isn't any specific prescribed i would the prophet said assam whoever doesn't find a good spouse here is the you say nevertheless you can always knock on allah's doors by dua by giving dua in the sense that praise allah offer salutation to the prophet haslam raise your hand and ask allah azza for whatever you want so oh allah grant me a righteous spouse preferably beautiful and and rich uh preferably this or that from a good lineage what you ask allah azza you insist on allah almighty because allah has trillions of creatures other than you but you have only one lord to supplicate and invoke and insha allah allah would grant you a righteous husband that would love you cherish you and care for you muhammad from saudi arabia he says that what's the ruling on taking umrah when you have debts and i asked him where are you he said close by to makkah then no problem go and take as many umrahs as you wish the scholars when they said that when you have debts don't go for umrah for hajj providing that you're going to spend money on umrah or hajj which would handle and which would prevent you from paying the debt on time so someone who's in the u.s and he needs like ten thousand dollars to come for room for hajj no stay and pay your debts from this ten thousand dollars rather than coming for hajj because this is not an obligat obligation upon you but someone who's in makkah and his payroll is coming at the end of the month his family are uh well uh uh in in in good conditions and if he goes or if he doesn't this is not gonna increase his income and it's not gonna hinder him paying the installments or the debt there is no problem in going for umrah um ali from saudi arabia she says that she's been here for 19 years and she has to leave and this saddens her she asks for dua i pray to allah azzawajal that he would grant you a better house and a better environment and that allah would use you in serving his religion and you never know where the best is as a believer 19 year years here in saudi arabia you are within your comfort zone masha'allah everything is islamic everything is halal but when you go to canada maybe allah azza would open doors through you to people to nom islam and you can change people's akida deviant back to the quran and the sunnah you can call non-muslims you never know what is stored for you so her second question was people always complain if a muslim can marry a christian woman why can't a muslim woman marry a christian man well this is allah's laws allah mentioned this in black and white a man a muslim can only marry a muslim a jew or a christian woman while a muslim woman can only be married to a muslim man and probably we have to comply but if we would like to look for justifications probably one would find out many among them is that a man has always the upper hand and the control over his uh offspring his wife so that's why a man is always dominating the house so even if the woman tried to make the children to become christians she wouldn't succeed because it's the man's upper hand while in the case of a muslim woman if she has children and the husband is a christian or a hindu or whatever religion it is he would force his children to follow his religion alya says what's ruling on drawing uh pictures that have life in them this is haram the prophet said i am the most severely punished people on the day of judgement are those who are drawing they make living creatures and they draw drawings off them umasha says that we always thought that was it's an exchange or conversation between allah and the
