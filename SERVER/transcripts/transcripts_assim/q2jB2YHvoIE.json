  "transcript": "he says that kind of woman make Dawa Dawa means to propagate Islamic knowledge so he says can a woman make Dawa to a man on the internet without letting him know that she is a female as she worked under an Islamic organization first of all we have to realize and understand that the issue of Dawa is open to all Muslims it is something that is highly recommended in Islam Allah says woman Asano : MIM and ilaha il-allah Hanwha part in any mineral Muslim mean there is no one better in rhetoric then he who calls other to Islam does righteous deeds and proclaims that he is among the Muslims so we know that this is one of the greatest jobs and occupations a person can do and this is why Allah selected it for his messengers and prophets peace be upon them all however as every action in Islam we have to always Pro where I have to always weigh the pros and the cons and whenever the disadvantages over weigh the advantages it becomes prohibited and if the advantages are far greater then it is permissible as long as the means taken are permissible now let us look at giving Dawa for a female to give dower to other females there is no prohibition none whatsoever for a female to give Dawa to a male let us look if there is a two-way communication then there might be something that is not permissible but if this sister is doing the hour in the form of writing articles Islamic articles publishing it on the web or in a blog or in magazines this is something to be praiseworthy this is something good and there's nothing wrong in that none whatsoever she uses her real name and she puts these articles that benefit the Muslims there is nothing wrong in that at all if she sends that individual messages of Dawa on behalf of the Islamic organization without him knowing who is sending it or even hinting that it is a female again this is permissible because there's no two-way communication the problem is that when there is communication like so many sisters had fallen into illegitimate relationships through such means sending down messages SMS what's up on Facebook and Twitter to people and then getting reply and communicating and then let's encourage one another to wake up professor for Tahajjud how was your day and it goes on to something that Allah does not want or is not pleased with so I hope this gives you an insight of what makes something Haram and what is actually permissible in Islam we have to block the means because there are Haram per se and there are things that may lead to Haram and they take the same ruling as to what they lead to and this is called blocking the means if the means would lead you to Harlem then these means become Haram as well and Allah knows best"
