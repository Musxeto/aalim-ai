  "title": "Those who are Irritated by Tawheed!",
  "transcript": "this is the first topic the most important topic that all prophets and messengers were sent with yet many people are irritated by this and they don't like the concept of their hate they don't feel at ease when we mention to hate and you can see this in their faces whether they are from the deviant sects or from any other cult in islam and many of them say we have to unite the hearts we must avoid every anything that divides the people and subhanallah this is exactly what the idol worshipers used to object to islam they say islam separates a man from his wife a father from his son a brother from his siblings so islam divides and separates we want something that unites and those who uh pose or are irritated by the heat use the same logic"
