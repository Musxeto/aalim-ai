  "transcript": "raised from india um sheikh my question is what does the this verse mean in chapter number 59 verse number 18 oh who you believe fear god and keep your duty there and let every person look to what he has sent forth for tomorrow and fear god so what does this mean shaykh sent forth for tomorrow okay uh fez from india says what is the interpretation what is meant by tomorrow oh you who believe fear allah and anticipate what each one of you has provided for tomorrow what is tomorrow here tomorrow is a hereafter so today is now the tomorrow is the hereafter so allah in this beautiful ayahs at the end of surat al-hashr is telling us to fear him and to anticipate and to visit the memory lane the history that we have left behind to see what we have stored for ourselves in our record books on the day of judgment on tomorrow and why allah refers to it as tomorrow because tomorrow is a monday and it's not tomorrow the day of judgment it's not maybe even next week because there are signs that did not come so why allah is referring to it as tomorrow so that humans would know that it is this close it's coming inevitable and to us our tomorrow is not necessarily the day of judgment which is the tomorrow for all this universe rather our each individual tomorrow is our death date so if i were to die today then tomorrow would be revealed to me because the dunya is over now i am heading towards what is known as tomorrow which is my eternity whether in paradise may allah make all our endings end in paradise for eternity or in hell may allah protect us and save us so i hope this answers your question you"
