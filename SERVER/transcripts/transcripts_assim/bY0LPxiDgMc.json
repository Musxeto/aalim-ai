  "title": "Wasn't sure if I did 1 or 2 sujood, thought 2 but later on inclination changed to 1 Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "sh so sometimes this happens that in first ra I'm doubtful if I did one or two frustrations and my heart is inclined that I did two frustrations so I act on my inclination and move on but later in the prayer like in the fourth ra my inclination changes like I uh did one frustration so what do I do what do I do it seems that again if this is happening in every Salat then you are an OCD patient you have to act upon your gut feeling so if your inclination change in the middle of the Salat we look at the position you are in at the moment so let's assume you think that you missed your s in the first ra at the time you were inclined to think that you have done it rightly so you prayed the second you pray the third raak and while you were in the fourth raak you are now inclined that no I only prostrated one ra one suud what to do this first raak is void because it's missing a pillar the F the second and the third and the fourth act upon as if they were the first second and third which means that continue in this raak you're in to be your third then stand up and do your fourth then sit for tah offer your Salam and then offer two prostrations of forgetfulness and offer another Salam and Allah Knows Best"
