  "transcript": "Misha from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi So Sheikh during Wudu if I wash my hands in between Wudu such as after wiping my head and before washing my feet I wash my hands a bit because of touching the faucet I feel filthy it has turned into a habit so is the Wudu valid or not because the Wudu is valid the Wudu is valid but you cannot help Shaytan fuel your OCD when you follow what he's telling you little by little your OCD grows bigger and you are fueling it with the wood that Shaytan is supplying you with so you have to draw the line and stop and not do anything that is not in accordance of the Sunnah but this has no impact on your Wudu"
