  "transcript": "[Music] for coming so far it means a lot and I love your letteres so my question is is there anything from the Quran and that keeps you personally uh closest to Allah and keeps your intentions pure the whole Quran and theah yeah there isn't anything that stands out to say oh sh this Hadith well this Ayah blows my mind and this is what no no no the whole Quran and Sunnah and you guys know that we as Muslims at least we finish the Quran once a month this is the bare minimum for lazy ones like you and me every single lunar month we accomplish reading the Quran once every night we finish one this is the bare minimum as per theith of abdah when the prophet told himat wasam how many times do you read the Quran he said I finish it once a night night every single night he finishes the Quran from cover to cover the prophet said no this is too much read it once a month so this is the bare minimum and if you have time you can do it in like 20 days 10 days one week 3 days max I know one of my relatives with the grace of Allah she finishes the Quran every 6 days out of memory meaning she revises five ju every day and finishes it six days seventh she starts all over again so it depends on your strength so what keeps you close to Allah the Quran itself the beautiful Sunnah when you recite when you read the biography of the Prophet abdah may Allah may Allah have mercy on him one of the great Scholars of Islam after is he used to go into his home and close the door and his students would say why don't you sit with us why don't you mix with us he said why would I do that I'd rather sit with the prophet and his companions meaning he locks his door he takes his books of and of and he lives with the Prophet this would draw you way closer to Allah"
