  "transcript": "Mossad dick PO says whenever I give something in charity I always intend to give on behalf of everyone by everyone I mean our Muslim brothers my family my friends this is grandparents and at last I also intend for myself is this charity valid or am i extending it beyond limits no it is valid you can join with you in your charity whomever you wish but when you pay a thousand euros to a poor person on your behalf you rewarded a thousand euros if you include your spouse it's 500 for you 500 for her if you include your parents it's 250 for each if you include your grandparents and your siblings and the Muslims and those you know and those you don't know probably you'll end up with pennies and this means that you have to be careful in what you intend yes it is valid but how much would I get out of it is different likewise when someone says I'd like to make a Remora on behalf of deceased good luck Allah he said will I get the same reward no of course not the Umrah is for the deceased and he will get all the reward you will get the reward of praying maybe making vicar that's it so this is not fair no no it is very fair you may come work for yourself you get the full reward you make it on other people's behalf then they get the full reward"
