dear brothers and sisters in islam assalamu alaikum warahmatullahi wa barakato women around the Prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam words can explain things that are unexplained words can describe mountains huge oceans strong fortresses but when words come to describe this lawful trustworthy honest righteous caring loving wife of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam words fail to do her justice how can words describe a woman whom allah azzawajal made her the mistress of women in paradise she's the leader of women of this world and all other worlds the Prophet said alayhi salat WA Salam there were many men who reached human perfection however there were only four among the women that reached that level among them this lawful wife a beloved woman to the heart of our prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam she believed in him when everybody accused him of lying she took him in when people rejected him she gave him her wealth and money when people held to their wealth and refused to share any of it with him whenever he was in distress she would comfort him whenever he was faced by the people of Quraysh accusing him of lying and he was depressed and saddened by that she would bring joy to his heart we are talking about Hadiya the mother of the believers Amal awesome the daughter of Hawaii amino acid mo Abdullah even opposed a blue Caleb Cora she at will acedia she is the mother of all of our prophet's children Ali his salat WA Salam with the exception of the brahim in Mecca they used to describe her as the flower of Mecca she was the mistress of all women of Quraysh married twice and after her second husband died she refused to get married again she was a wealthy woman a woman of Honor known for her intellect and wisdom the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam worked for her and traded in her wealth she was amused with his honesty she was happy with the Prophet he made through trading though everyone acknowledged that he was truthful and honest he didn't cheat he didn't lie she liked him as a person and as a man so when someone said why not marry him she didn't think twice one of her friends talked to the prophet alayhi salatu salam proposed to him the Prophet thought to himself who could be a better wife than this wise woman who's all dignitaries of Quraysh are looking forward to get married to her but she's not accepting any of them so she she was fortunate to get married to the prophet alayhi salatu salam he was 25 years of age and she was 40 years of age 15 years older than him already married twice having children from her previous husbands they did not deter the Prophet Isis Lam from marrying her though he was only 25 years of age and he wasn't wrong this honorable woman had the greatest impact on our prophet's life ra his salat wa salam she furnished life to him to be as suitable as possible where she never bothered him occupied his time she never nagged him she never put any type of responsibility on his shoulders she made him a king in her house having to care for nothing but to rest to have his peace of mind even when he wanted to be in seclusion with Allah she would help him assist him prepare food for him and let him go to the cave of Hira stay there for days and nights sometimes she goes her self to get him food and drink just to make him rest and have the peace of mind and even when he was terrified for the first time of his life when receiving the revelation through gibreel peace be upon him he came to her shaking petrified scared confused she did not shout at him she did not blame him for going for days without end in seclusion rather she comforted him and said by Allah Allah will not turn you down your kind to the needy you help those who are in need of help you feed the poor Allah would never turn you down this great woman lived with the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam for 25 continuous years the longest any woman had lived with our prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam never ever once the books of ceará had mentioned a negative thing about her not even once not a single thing never it was reported that she had a fight with the Prophet al-islam or even a difference of opinion she was like a cold breeze never harm harming anyone and this was her greatest impact in the life of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam she had never ever asked for something for herself never whatever the Prophet wanted or needed that is awesome it was always there even when revelation was given to him she stood by his sight she was the first human being the first soul to believe in him when he was in stress he confide in her he told her what had happened he thought that he was getting mad he had seen and heard things that he had never ever had or encountered in his life she was always there to comfort him no matter how many times people accused him of lying whenever he went back to Khadija Khadija comforted him and brought joy to his soul whenever he was sad she would always give him the glad tidings of what Allah has for him whenever he was abused physically she was always there for him believing in him supporting on him until he or until she met her Lord and died even when the revelation was paused for a number of days and pagans and the idol worshipers of Mecca started ridiculing the prophet sallallaahu asylum by saying that your Lord has left you allah azza wajal revealed the verses what boo ha well lady either Suja your Lord has not taken leave of you O Muhammad nor has he detested you and then Allah Azza WA JAL counts the favours upon His Messenger and among them Allah says and he found you poor and made you self-sufficient even in the Quran Allah is mentioning the favor and the blessing of his upon our Prophet Allah so Sam through mother Khadijah she's the one who gave him her wealth and made him self-sufficient the prophet alayhi salat wa salam loved rhodesia beyond what we can imagine a love that true love stories fall short from coming close to this is true love this is true affection it's not what you write and say while your heart is totally the opposite true love is portrayed in such situations long after her death the Prophet kept on mentioning her name talking about her attributes praising her though she's dead always asking Allah to forgive her sins yeah may Allah be pleased with her the mother of the believers the most beloved wife to the Prophet at his arms heart once got jealous so she said to the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam allah has substituted you from that old woman meaning herself that look at me I'm a virgin wife of yours I'm young and beautiful Allah Azza WA JAL has compensated you from that old woman who's fifteen years older than you the Prophet la Salsa was outraged so angry that Aisha was scared she said I didn't know how to fix this so I started doing my prayers oh Allah if the Prophet erase a lot of sin forgives my mistake and his anger is gone I will never mention hadiza with anything that is negative then the Prophet said to her Alice thought o Sam what did you say by Allah Khadija believed in me when everybody said that you are a liar Khadija took me in when people take me out Khadija gave me the children when Allah deprived me children from you all and the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam stayed for a whole month repeating these words to aisha reminding her of the status of hadisha compared to all other women this is loyalty this is true love when even a statement that is said jokingly cannot pass in peace especially with a caliber such as the caliber of mother Khadijah may Allah be pleased with her and this is why there is no wonder that gibreel comes to the prophet alayhi salatu salam once and said o prophet of allah Khadija is coming a tray with food and drink for you if she comes read the Salam to her from Allah and from me and give her the glad tidings in or of a house in paradise made of a pearl which has no tiresome and there is no loud noise so there is no work for her in Jannah and she will be in a calm environment no noises or loud sounds scholars say that this is in the word for her in exchange of what she had done to the Prophet as Salam in her house where the Prophet never had to work and he had a so Sam was always in a comfortable environment no shouting no nagging no problems the Prophet alakazam always remembered Khadija whenever he slaughtered the sheep he would dedicate parts of it to her friends sent this to so-and-so she was a friend of hadisha send this to so-and-so she was a good friend of hadisha and the love kept on flaming and igniting in his heart though she was long gone and dead her sister halibut waited whenever she knocked the door seeking permission to see the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam she would say as-salam-o-alaikum at home and when the Prophet I some heard her voice it reminded him of khadija and he would say Allahu Mahalo let it be Hal the sister of hadisha she would come in and he would talk to her and give her time and give her what money and gifts because she was the sister of the love of his life she reminded him of Khadija and people did not know that this strong leader muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam had this great affection and love and compassion to that great woman even after her death I will assume the rabbir the cousin of zina the daughter of the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam she's the eldest of the prophets daughters I will ask who's the son of hala married his cousin and they lived happily until the Prophet as Sarah migrated to Medina the people of Quraysh insisted that he divorces his wife because her father was Muhammad our enemy and he refused he was a man of honor he didn't accept Islam but he did not fight the Muslims and he was captured among the prisoners of war on the Battle of better though he did not fight but he was with his people so the prophet alayhi salatu salam sent to the people of Quraysh if you want your prisoners of war sent ransom money so that we can set them free his wife zina she was in Mecca she sent money as a ransom to be given to the Muslims to set her husband free when the money came to the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam with it was a locket necklace this necklace khadijah gave it to Zeynep on her wedding night as a gift Zeynep to pay off the ransom of her husband collected all the money she had and she had this locket this necklace that was the most valuable thing in her life and she included it with the money and sent it as a ransom when the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam saw this locket when he saw this necklace his heart was torn he remembered Khadija he remembered his love to her he addressed the Muslims and he said if you see it fit that you set her prisoner free and sent back what she had paid as ransom this is up to you I am The Messenger of Allah but I cannot force something upon you when the Companions saw how emotional our prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam was just to see that locket that reminded him of that great woman hadiza they said we give it back without any need of any ransom or prophet of allah and they sent I will ask them near appear with the money and the locket back to his wife zeyneb the daughter of Muhammad Ali Saleh - was Salaam mother Khadijah lived with the prophet alayhi salatu salam 15 years before him becoming a prophet and ten years after him becoming a prophet she went into sheer ABI talib when at the end the Idol worshipers surrounded all the Muslims in part of Mecca and they made an embargo so that no one would sell them anything or buy from them anything they were starving and the infants were crying without any possibility of food getting in Khadija chose to be with her husband this rich woman who had always lived in mansions enjoyed the best of food self accepting to be in this isolation for three years with her husband and the rest of the Muslims and after this embargo was lifted and the Muslims went back to their homes in Mecca she stayed for six months only to pass away and died peacefully to go to Allah Jenna leaving the prophet alayhi salatu salam to be heartbroken saddened but accepting that what is awaiting for her at the sight of Allah is better than staying in this life this is the mistress of the women in paradise this is the love of the prophet alayhi salat WA Salam this is my mother and your mother Khadijah been to Hawaii it may allah azzawajal be pleased with her her Allahu Alem when especially ill me leahy Aslam or sal allahu wa sallim wa barik alaa ABD he wore a saudi he nabina muhammad"
