  "title": "Ruling on hanging posters of deceased around city or announcing their death in masjids Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "Hamza from Bosnia in his country and many Muslim countries when a person dies they hang posters all over the city announcing that so and so had died with a photograph with when he was born when he died some of his achievements and some of the words that his loved one may shared with about him so is this part of the Sunnah the answer is no this is an innovation and this is sinful because it is a form of Haram mourning mourning a deceased by publishing it is prohibited Islam and Scholars say that it's not permissible to go and announce it over loudspeakers and masjids and elsewhere that so and so has died this is totally prohibited did and if you add to that putting a photograph of the deceased and if you add to that if she's a woman without a hijab this is definitely sinful"
