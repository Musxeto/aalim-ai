  "title": "Giving Takfeer, Is there a process? Can layman call someone kafir who doesn't pray or calls on dead?",
  "transcript": "is from shiraz if a person abandons salat or asks for the dead and does shirk in general is it permissible for a layman to say he is a kafir or is there a process that needs to be fulfilled to label him as a kafir yes there is a process indeed it is not for us to go around and label people with disbelief because this is a serious offense the prophet salallahu salaam says whoever tells or labels his brother by the title ya kafir o you kafir disbeliever then one of them will pick it up either he is truly a kafir or it will come back to me who said it and i will be labeled as a kafir and we all know that there is a difference between general techfear and individual tak fear so general takfir is anyone who associates others with allah is a mushrik anyone who disbelieves in the ruling of islam is a kafir anyone who does this or that that takes a person out of the fall of islam is a kafir this is okay but when when we come to a particular individual to ahmad to ali to abdullah and we would like to implement this labeling process upon that individual here is where we draw the red line and we say no this is not possible we have to fulfill the conditions that he did it intentionally that he did it knowingly that he was not forced that so and so and so and we have to ensure that there are no obstacles preventing us from giving him tak fear such he was misinterpreting things he was ignorant he was forced he didn't know etc and all of this is usually done by scholars not for laymen it's done by a panel of judges or trustworthy scholars who would investigate interrogate and then give the ruling after talking with that individual but to come and just throw that fear here and there without ensuring that the process has been followed this is totally prohibited and allah azza knows best"
