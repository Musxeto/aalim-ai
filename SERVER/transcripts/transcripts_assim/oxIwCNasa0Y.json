  "transcript": "Asam alaykum it has been previously discussed that a woman has to insert a cotton to check and see if her admens has ended because wiping is not sufficient but some women have less frequent discharge emission compared to other women so it's harder to examine if the discharge is wi or not before the prayer time ends so if a girl is a virgin and fears her highman breaking from cotton assertion how should she check the certainty of the an forensis no she not should not insert it all the way that would impact her hman definitely this is not the right way of doing it see the Hadith is Crystal Clear once she sees the white thread like discharge if she wipes externally then this is an indication of her Purity the issue is if she doesn't have this white thread like discharge and the men's bleeding has stopped this is where we tell such a uh a person to insert a piece of cotton just enough to determine whether there is a colored discharge inside or not but definitely not to insert it all the way where it impacts her hon or harms herself and this is not intended at all"
