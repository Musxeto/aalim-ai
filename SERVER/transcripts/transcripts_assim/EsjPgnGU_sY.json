  "title": "Zakat and Sadaqah to relatives first? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Oh Misha says some people say that we have to give zakat to our relatives first is it obligatory to give them priority over someone who is more deserving the answer is no if we have two choices and these choices are either to give the zakat money to our relatives who are needy or to strangers who are also needy first we have to evaluate the need so if my relatives need is to pay the rent while the other strangers need is a life-or-death situation where they have to be operated upon or on and if I don't give them the money they'll die definitely the needy is more deserving for the zakat but if their need is equivalent so I have my relatives who have to pay for the rent or they will be kicked out and a stranger a neighbor who has the same problem I'll give my relatives first and I'll have to divorce for that for one helping someone in need secondly for helping a relative by connecting my next of kin and allah azza wajal knows best"
