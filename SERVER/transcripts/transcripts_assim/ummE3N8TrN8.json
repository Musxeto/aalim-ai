  "title": "Can't attend Friday due to School, Can we make it at school, how many people required for Jummah?",
  "transcript": "Yussef says we are not allowed to go out for friday prayers during school hours can we make our own Friday prayer at school how many people are essential to form a jew mahatma and salah and how should we go about it a lot of the Muslims living in non-muslim countries where they have their weekends on a Saturday and Sunday face this problem of Friday prayers now some non-muslims are quite tolerant and they're kind they would allow a Muslim employee to go and pray and come back and the matter that the majority of them would ask the employee to compensate this hour or couple of hours to work after working hours or to divide it over the week days and this is totally legit this is their right schools and universities are different because sometimes you have your classes at the time of the salat and your studies and your well-being and your future and career is based on attending such classes so scholars say that if you are unable to go and pray there's no problem for you to pray after your classes with other Muslims in the school and the University in the garden or whatever all what you need you have to be at least three of you one Imam and two in the congregation and the Imam gives two sermons he sits in between and then the prayer is conducted as usual without any problem insha Allah who azza wajal you"
