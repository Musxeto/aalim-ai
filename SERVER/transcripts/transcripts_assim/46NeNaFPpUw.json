  "transcript": "[Questioner] from India when washing body parts \nin wudu is it enough to pour little water over   the limb and rub it to the entire area or should \nwe pour water all over the limb because I take   a long time in with the pouring water over \nmy face arms feet under the feet Etc please   clarify thank you when we wash our hands we just \nput some water here and then I raise my hand and   the water are dripping a little bit and I just do \nthis that's it that's one way when I put water in   my hand and I wash my face thoroughly this does \nthe job so you this is sufficient insha Allah"
