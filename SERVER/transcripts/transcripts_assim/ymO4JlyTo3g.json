  "title": "Is it permissible to offer the Sunnah of Fajr if I overslept? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "so sister Sofia is asking about a person who overslept and woke up after sunrise is it permissible for him or her to offer the two Rakas of suna the answer is yes the evidence is that in the authentic hadith the Prophet Ali salato someone sprayed fire with the congregation after he concluded his prayer he saw one of his companions offering two rakahs at the end of the machine so he came he stood next to the man who was offering prayer and he repeated saying is fair for is fair for is fair for so the man concluded his prayer in a quick fashion in order to be able to speak with the prophet alayhi Salaam and justify his action and after he concluded the prayer is it Oh prophet of Allah the congregation started and I was home and I did not pray my - sunnah prayers so i came quickly and i joined the congregation after concluding the salat with the Gemara with you now i'm praying the - i'm making up the two Rakas of sunnah so the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam did not comment and walked away this means that it is totally acceptable if you miss the Sunnah that you make it up after the fault and by default if you miss the father itself that when you make it up you pray the Sunnah before it as usual because the prophet alayhi assalam had stated that whoever forgets a prayer or oversleeps over it he must pray it as soon as he remembers there is no expiration for it other than that so if a purse oversleeps and we accept like 7 o'clock or 8 o'clock in the morning and the Sun is already in the middle of the sky he prays the two rakahs of Sunnah then he follows that with the two rakahs of for Allah and Allah soldier knows best"
