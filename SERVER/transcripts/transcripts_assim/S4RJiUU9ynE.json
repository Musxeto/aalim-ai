  "transcript": "Aisha from Singapore. Okay, I have a question. I understand that I have to say Bismillah whenever I perform Wudu or Wudhu. But my question is, in my home, the toilet is, we have separate for the shower and also the toilet cubicle, toilet bowl. But, so my question is, where do I, where is the right place to say Bismillah? Is it outside the toilet before I enter or when I am in the shower screen? Okay, first of all, saying Bismillah for Wudu or for Ghusl is not mandatory. It's a recommended act and it's a Sunnah. So if I intentionally go for Wudu without saying Bismillah, my Wudu is valid and likewise my Ghusl. Second of all, we are prohibited from mentioning the name of Allah Azza Wa Jal in the places where we answer the call of nature. So, if I have a shower room that is separated from the toilet seat and the likes, then it's okay for me to enter the shower room and say Bismillah. Thirdly, it is sufficient for a Muslim, if he's in his bedroom and he wants to enter his adjacent toilet, in a master bedroom for example, where the toilet is attached to it. So, before entering the toilet or the bathroom, it's sufficient to say Bismillah. And this suffices for your Wudu and Ghusl, as it also suffices to block the vision of the devils and the jinn from seeing you when you get undressed, as per the Hadith of the Prophet Alayhi Salatu Wasalam, and Allah knows best."
