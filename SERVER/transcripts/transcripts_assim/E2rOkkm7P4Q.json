  "transcript": "alikum allum Salam so sh while on life support sometimes the medical staff declares a patient clinically dead and yet the hospital's internal policy is not to give de certificate or remove life support until all the organs stop functioning they say if the patient is released from life support he will die within a few hours and if he remains on life support he will survive a few more hours and we will issue de certificate then this makes the family members more confused about whether to remove life support or not also life support is extremely expensive so my question is does clinical death mean the departure of the Soul or does the soul depart only when all the organs stop working this is a medical issue that has to be referred to three trustworthy Muslim doctors if they say that the brain is in a vegetative condition and the stems of the brain are dead which is no way it can be revived and he can come back to uh life again then you can take the life support um system off you can take the uh unplug the plug but if the person is in a comma yet he's not in a vegetative condition he's alive sometimes a person is on life support and his conscience he can speak and if you take the plug off he dies no this is killing him so it all boils down to three Muslim trustworthy doctors to say that yes the brain cells are dead and this person is alive only due to um the life support system being plugged in and if it were to be taken off he's dead he's a he's a vegetable he he doesn't have any conscience he's never going back going back to life again yeah meaning being sane and and being able to live like a human being in this case yes it is permissible to take the life support uh uh system off and Allah Knows Best"
