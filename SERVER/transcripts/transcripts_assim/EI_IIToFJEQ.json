  "transcript": "says how is it possible that we reach the level of the companions in paradise this is in allah's hands yes no matter what we do we can never reach their level but this does not mean that we will not see the prophet sallam or that we will not see the companions may allah be presumed we may see them we may be with them but not in their level because what they had done can't be easily wavered away and us coming after centuries doing 0.1 of what they had done and then be with them in the same level in jannah but we will be with them insha allah in a way that befits their sacrifices and what they had done you"
