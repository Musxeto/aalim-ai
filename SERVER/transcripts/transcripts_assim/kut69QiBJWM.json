  "transcript": "Binyamin says; 'Can we boycott our kinship who \ndeal with black magic?' The answer is 'Yes'.   As long as it has been proved, and the proof \nis beyond doubt, the evidences can stand in a   court of law, and you fear for yourself and your \nfamily - you can boycott them physically. But,   if you call them once every blue moon on the \nphone, if you know that they need help and   you send them money but you don't go and meet \nthem face to face, there's no problem in that."
