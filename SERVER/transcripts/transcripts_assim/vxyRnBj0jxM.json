  "title": "Tahiyattul masjid and prayers that have a reason, in Forbidden times - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "he says that if I come to the Masjid after fajar or before mother and we know that this is a restricted time for us to pray the Prophet forbade us from praying so what to do just roam around standing doing nothing or should I pray the answer is yet you must pray you should not sit without praying because the Prophet said whenever salah salem whenever anyone of you and there's a message it he must pray before sitting down and the hadith that forbids us from praying after fajar until sunrise and after us or until sunset this hadith is a general hadith yet there are cases that are specified meaning it's not a general prohibition that one can say no you may not pray anything because I can say okay you say it's not permissible to pray after fajar can I pray Risha prayer if I forgot it that's yes okay if after fajar prayer they brought a funeral can we pray funeral prayer said yes if there was an eclipse of the Moon or the Sun can we pray in these prohibited times yes therefore you can add to that praying to records before sitting down because as Imam Shafi said any prayer that has a legitimate reason can be prayed in the restricted times of prayer and Allah knows best"
