  "title": "Should you place your hands or knees first when you go to sujood? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "this is my standing up from the girl what should I do now I should go for sujood now for sujood there are two ways a different of opinion among scholars should I land first on my knees or should I land first on my hands it's an issue of dispute and the reason of that is the hadith of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam when he said that one should not go down like a camel does when the camel wants to sit rather he should put his hands first before his knees and understanding whether the hands of a camel are their elbows or they're the knees in his feet it's an issue of dispute either way is okay inshallah so however you feel comfortable with you should do it I personally do to age due to praying on marble or stones wherever there are pibbles in the ground if you land from the standing position on your knees would surely injure yourself one way or the other for elders it's difficult to go underneath specially if they have knee problems it's always best to go first on the hand it's like a shock absorber it absorbs the the fall itself it eases the pressure on and the weight underneath"
