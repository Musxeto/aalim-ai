abdulaziz University in jeda Saudi Arabia a role which he had held for nearly two decades he currently delivers weekly Friday sermons and lectures on various Islamic Sciences shik Assam frequents to several National and International Islamic conventions and also participates regularly to spread the True Values of Islam and its message through online radio and television programs he appears regularly on Saudi radio channel Saudi Channel 2 Huda TV ik channel and peace TV besides this he has also held the position of human resources and public relations director at a leading multinational company in Saudi Arabia to know more about the sh please visit his official website www.am al-hakim net please join me to welcome to discuss on the topic Creed to success ald [Music] this is way past my bedtime and I was hoping that they would have prepared a pillow and a mattress but not everything we wish for happens so alhamdulillah I'll try to make it short brief and sweet now the Creed To Success what is it about well this is what I'm here for so wait everyone in this Hall and I guarantee you this every single person in this Hall wants to end up in Paradise those who don't want to go to paradise raise your hands mashallah they're all awake they all want to go to paradise unfortunately Paradise has a key without this key you cannot enter it and this key is the prophet himself sent his cousin alali when the Hajj the first Hajj in Islam took place he sent him to announce to all Muslims who came to Hajj in the ninth year of Hijra to tell them that there won't be anyone who's not a Believer a Muslim admitted to Jah only the Muslims would be admitted to J and I will explain this later on inshallah if you were awake and the time permits me to do so at the end of the lecture so this means that if some of us associate other with Allah in worship that they won't be admitted to jenah now the vast majority of us say I'm a Muslim I am the son of a Muslim family by default I'm in Jenna well this is not entirely true because even if you're a Muslim by identity and it's written in your passport that you're a Muslim if you commit shik you will be deprived from entering jenah Allah says in the Quran and most of them believe in Allah while they are in the state of shik a lot of the Muslims commit shik they worship others with Allah they supplicate to others than Allah they go to the graves they believe in soothsayers and Sorcerers and fortune tellers and they believe them and this takes them out of the fold of Islam therefore you as a Muslim have to today at the moment purify your Iman from anything that tarnishes it you have and you must purify your IM from any form of sh how would we be able to do that if we do not possess the right the right [Music] Creed all Messengers of Allah had a common message and that is oh my people worship Allah you have no deity other than him and Allah says in the Quran and we certainly sent into every nation a messenger saying worship Allah and avoid worshiping Allah is the right that Allah has the prophet saidat to Mu do you know what is Allah's right over his servants and the servants rights over Allah M said Allah and his messenger know best so the prophet said Allah's right over his servants that they worship none other than him and their rights over Allah is to admit them to jenah if they do so or not to punish [Music] them this is the ultimate obligation upon every individual and that is to worship Allah alone and not to associate others with him so whoever wants success which is the topic of today in a sense you have to abide by the of and this is quite ambiguous nowadays because everyone raises the flag of so what is exactly the Creed of what is meant by to begin with is stemmed from the word when you tie a not and you get things together this is the origin of so is the things that people believe in and they find their tranquility and they have certainty in it this is my conviction it's undoubtable this is what I believe in I believe in a particular thing this is my a and therefore you must have the correc AA now why would we have the correct AA aren't we all Muslims can't we all be in the same pot The Melting Pot as long as I say ill isn't this sufficient well I will not answer this question the prophet saidat the Jews have divided into 71 sect this is the Hadith not mine the Christians have divided into 72 sects and the Muslims my umah who claim to be Muslims will be divided into 73 sects or all of them are in Hell except one may Allah make me and you among this one what okay just to make sure that you're awake so the companion said oh prophet of Allah which one is the saved sect so the prophet saidat who are following my footsteps and the footsteps of my companions so this is the Creed of the saved sect now where do we get this Creed of 7-Eleven no you can't find it there so can we ask for it on Amazon we have Suk so this does a job no no no no cannot be learned except through two sources Quran and Sunnah why we have so many scholars we have many schools of thought we have many theologians the reason is that Allah stated in the Quran say I only warn you by Revelation which means that you cannot learn your a from hearsay or from your culture or my forefathers used to say this and that your AA your religion has to be only taken from the Quran and the Sunnah with the understanding of the favorite Generations who are the favorite Generations the prophet saidat the best of gener Generations Are My Generation The Companions and the generations that follow the and the generation that follows the so their understanding of the Quran and the Sunnah far exceeds our understanding due to their closeness to the prophet Alat era wise TimeWise to the perfection in Arabic to the knowledge and the availability of the Companions and the so we understand the Quran and the Sunnah not learn the AA understand the Quran and the Sunnah from or through their understanding so let's go into sort of the surface of AA when we say a so what is your a now when I ask you about your AA not claiming to be like some of the sects and Cults trying [Music] to divide the people try to label them try to classify them what is your a what is your manh they say no it's not this when we want to know that we would like to learn the of so it is check and balance you have your a correct let's just look quickly through it believe in the authority of the Quran and the Sunnah this is why they're called so why do you say this ah I say this because there are are Cults and sects who claim to be Muslim but do not believe in the authority of the Sunnah when you want to solve a crime put yourself in the shoes of the perpetrators of the criminals think like they think if I want to attack if I want to tarnish if I want to undermine the infrastructure of Islam what would I do first attack the Sunnah so when I speak to you only address me with Quran verses why because the Sunnah has weak and authentic has fabricated has all of these so I don't believe in you don't believe in the Sunnah you're not a Muslim I believe in Allah I believe in the Quran the Quran tells you to follow the Sunnah you reject this you reject the Quran exit is there you're not part of us yes but I won't like to listen to the end of the lecture no leave please you don't believe in the Sunnah leave so you must believe in the Sunnah to be part of so yes I cannot reject Sunnah people would Stone me what what to do let us talk ill about alari alari is not authentic there are weak Hadith ah so now you want to discredit alari which the compiler of Al bukari spent his life compiling it which the whole umah accepted it to be the most authentic book after the Quran no one would tarnish the reputation of in of of ma or iMed or no need if you target the head you've done enough so part of our is to believe in the authority of the Quran and also the authority of the Sunnah the prophet sallallahu alaih alhi wasallam said I do not want to see any of you leaning down on his cou saying leave everything except the book of Allah whatever is in the book of Allah we accept whatever is not we reject by Allah I was given the Quran and similar to it referring to the Sunnah so this is part one part two part of believing in the Sunnah is to believe in what is known to the the jurors as and this is a new gimmick it's not new it's old but they are Reviving it nowadays how can I attack the Sunnah there's so many people defending it if I speak ill about the Sunnah they're going to Stone me so what to do ah I I come with an ingenious plan what is it see theth has to be so this is a technical stuff in a nutshell they say any Hadith that was reported by one we reject it because this is it has to have in the layers of the narrators in the levels it has to have 10 or more to accept it otherwise it is doubtful so you come at the end of the day with only 20 or 30 hadiths you accept mut and the rest you reject or you have have the option to reject this is what the are doing this is what the new freethinkers are doing how can I reject women cannot travel without a Maham how can I reject legislations and rulings in Islam you end up with no Sunnah good work I believe in Al bukari but technicality nothing is authentic in it except a handful of hadiths also among the things that part of our is that logic does not contradict Revelation and this is why IB T may Allah have mercy on his soul wrote a big volumes of books that there is no contradiction between logic and and which is Quran and Sunnah why nowadays we have people that come up and say this is not logical I'm telling you Allah says in the Quran so and so or the prophet says wasam so and so he said it's not logical Subhan Allah is Islam based on logic yes raise your hand is Islam based on logic okay only two or three so Islam is illogical raise your hand now I put you in a corner all of you don't have the of leave Islam is a religion of logic but my logic differs with your logic and therefore we cannot subject it to any logic nevertheless it does not go against what is true in nature of logic meaning I can justify 99% of Islam there is 1% that I may fail it doesn't mean that this 1% is wrong it means that my intellect did not reach the level one two it is a test from Allah to be to to to prove whether I follow out of conviction or I follow because it's logical and this is why when someone comes to me a non-muslim he says tell me about Islam I say you pray you fast good good religion When you pray how do you pray we go once to our Temple a week so no we pray five times a day mashallah how do you pray so we make w we wash our hands we wash our faces we wash our feet three times every prayer so this is 15 times a day he says I wash my face once every morning and you wash your feet 15 times a day W your religion is beautiful but um what happens if you don't have water I say we make t we hit the ground and the soil and we wipe our faces I said what just a moment ago you told me that you wash your face 15 times with water it's a religion of cleanliness why do you wipe your face with the soil this doesn't make sense said this is religion if you put your logic into it and contradict it then you have a problem you don't have submissiveness you don't have surrendering your will to Allah Allah tells you to do this say this is part of the test that each and everyone has to go through therefore we believe that Islam does not go against our Logic the correct logic fourthly we have to abide by the Sunnah and not innovate because Innovation would lead us to getting astray and this would lead us eventually to Hellfire so part of the people of that they do not innovate they follow and there isn't anything as as they claim all types of are prohibited because the prophet said every single Innovation takes you astray who said this the prophet and you say no no no no there are some innovations that are good I'm telling you the prophet said all Innovations take you astray and you say no no there is an exception there can't be an exception part of the is and I will not go into details because this requires a workshop the belief in Allah's lordship the belief in Allah's worship the belief in Allah's beautiful names and attributes what do we mean by Allah's lordship that Allah is the creator Allah is the provider Allah is the sustainer of our Affairs Allah is The Giver of Life and Allah is the one who takes life these attributes cannot be done except by him subhanahu theed of worship you do not devote any type of worship except to him so you don't pray except to him you don't B now you don't frustrate you don't swear except by his names you don't Slaughter sacrifice to any saint or peer or Moana you only do that for his sake you do not seek Baraka you do not make ta except by the ETC the whole nine yards and the yesterday's topic was about that I refer you to the video inshallah now why do we list this of because there are people the different 72 sects who denied this and they said no believing in Allah is to believe in the Creator worshiping anyone else no problem so this is why we mention also part of our AA is to believe in the Unseen so we believe that there is a transitional period between this life and the Hereafter which is known as Al in with what all what goes in it so we believe in the torment of the Grave while and part of the say we do not believe in that so there are sects nowadays contemporary who come and say there is nothing as such there is no there is no torment of the Grave there's no blessings and favors of of Allah in the grave our AA is there is and it's based on verses of the Quran and the authentic Sunnah We Believe In The Grave questioning of the two angels we believe in the intercession on the day of judgment judgement given to the Believers so that they would intercede we believe in the scale on the day of judgment and that it is physical where the good deeds and the bad Deeds are weighed we believe in the which is sharper than a blade thinner than a hair and everyone has to walk on it from those who claim to be Muslims we believe in the existence of Heaven and Hell and they are existing today as we speak because there are sects claiming to be Muslims rejecting it we believe in predestiny and in the five in the four pillars of predestiny Al so we believe in Allah's knowledge we believe in Allah's writing we believe in Allah's will and we believe in Allah's creation of everything that we do even our sins are created by Allah and we believe in his knowledge so many sects claiming to be Muslims rejected this they said no Allah doesn't know what we're going to do some said Allah knows what we're going to do but Allah did not write it some say Allah knows and wrote it but he did not will it he did not create it so we created it there are other to create than Allah all of this is out of we believe in these four things in issues related to Iman we believe that Iman is a conviction of the heart is something that we utter with the tongue and something that we act upon with our limbs this is actual Iman there are sects that say Iman is only in the heart even if you go to nightclubs if you even if you party all night long you're still a m a great M your IM and abak is the same so this is our it has to go side by side what you believe what you say and what you act upon it we believe that Iman is increased and decreased increases with good deeds decreases with sin while believe that it does not increase or decrease do not believe that it is increased or decreased and they're opposite sides because they are people of innovation we believe that Sinners are up to Allah's Divine will so even if you commit major sins you're bound to hell but Allah's Divine Will May forgive you while the say no way you commit a major sin you're bound to hell for eternity and you are a disbeliever the M on the other hand and they are a lot today they say you have IM you say do whatever you want this is card blanch you can do whatever you wish and when it comes to the companions of a prophet we love them all and we have clean Hearts towards them all and we do not say any single negative word about any of the companions of the Prophet this is a sign that you are from because the people of deviancy would say otherwise whether about the wives of the Prophet Alat wasam or the companions of the Prophet sallai wasam we believe in their order so Abu Bakr followed by Omar followed byman followed by Ali their ranking is according to their historical Reign this is our a other deviant sects May differ in the order we while loving them do not believe that they are infallible they're human beings they may make mistakes this happens only the prophet wasam is infallible who does not make any mistake when it comes to the middle path believe that we are in the middle path Allah says and thus we have made you a just and fair Nation just and fair which means that we are away from the sides of things we are in the middle so we are just when we judge others and we will witness against the previous Nations when their Messengers come and say oh Allah my people rejected me and the people say no no no we did not reject anyone wrong info and we will testify for that messenger that yes you were sent to your people and they rejected you because this is mentioned in our Quran so Allah made this a um of of fairness and just Justice and this is why we are in the middle path between in the attributes of Allah between the and when it comes to the actions of Allah and the list is long and I won't take much of your time to mention it so in short part of the essence of any student of knowledge is to correct his AA his or her a you have to rectify it you have to purify it you have to preserve it from anything that tarnishes it and never to compromise when it comes to a because nowadays we see a lot of the Muslims are retreating are compromising are loosening up things that were Haram in the past 203 years now it is H debatable we don't have this strong AA in our hearts we tend to compromise and this is why we see a lot of the people deviating from accepting different sects and Cults that go against the dean not something of dispute this is totally out of the Allah says in the Quran ISL indeed the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam and Allah says and whoever desires other than Islam as a religion never will it be accepted so Islam here has two meanings one the religion of Allah from Adam till date this religion of Allah called Islam which is submission to Allah submitting your will to Allah every single newborn is born on the F this is the f Al Islam does it mean that when he grows up he's going to pray by himself and fast Ramadan no it means that if he were to be left alone on an island with no outside effect he will grow up to believe in the existence of Allah and he will grow up worshiping Allah not knowing how but he would know that because this is his nature that Allah has created him with and the second meaning of Islam is the name of our religion So Adam was a Muslim n was a Muslim ibraim was a Muslim Musa was a Muslim Isa was a Muslim may Allah be uh uh uh peace and praise be upon them all but they had different laws different sh different scriptures yet they were called Muslim in the broader sense of submitting their will in our religion we're Muslims because we have the religion of Islam which has its own Shar and it has its own scripture and therefore Creed To Success this is our Creed if you did your check and balance and you found out that alhamdulillah you believe in what I had said good news inshallah you are bound to succeed if you have glitches here and there if you have wrong things that are not in sync with what you have heard Houston we have a problem you have to rectify it now before you end up doomed in Hellfire no one wants to to go to hell take take my word for it no one wants to go to hell but if your and I haven't discussed anything which is an issue of dispute this is the of this is of the Prophet Alat the belief in everything that I've mentioned to you it comes from the Quran and the Sunnah this is what the prophet believed and his companions we did not discuss the issue whether to put your hands on your chest or under your belly or leave it all together this is Trivial it has nothing to do with it has nothing to do with the 73 sects what deals with the 73 sects 72 of them in hell is issues of your belief in your belief in the Hereafter your believe in the messenger of Allah and so on and this is all what I have for you I pray to Allah that he makes my and your in accordance to the of our Prophet I pray to Allah that he makes me and you among those who are blessed by drinking from The Prophet's pool because there will be people who would be rejected the prophet saysat wasam in the mut so the brothers who say that no we follow only this is mut all Muslims agree upon this the prophet says I'm the first one to reach the pool and there will come people no don't don't don't look at them it's not them but this is the direction the brothers inshallah you will be inshallah among the pool inshallah so there will come people from my umah okay there will come people from my umah wanting to drink from my pool and the angels prevent them and they send them back so I object oh Allah umtiti they are from my nation from my followers they're Muslims so Allah says or the Angels say you do do not know what they have invented innovated after you you do not know what they have innovated before I continue the Hadith footnote and then we will have commercial break but footnote you do not know underline between brackets change the color and font into red and put some uh marker yellow preferably you do not know who is it the prophet you do not know what they've innovated after you this means that the prophet does not know what's happening now he does not have knowledge because he is in his grave so no one can come and say no the prophet knows and he controls and he doesn't this so the prophet says you do not know what they have innovated after you so I say the prophet says so I say destruction May Beall upon those who innovate after me so may Allah grant me and you a beautiful sweet drink from the prophet's pool and may Allah does not make us among those who are rejected from it okay we have alhamdulillah two sisters who would like to take their shahada and I think that they would like to remain where they are because if they come here my wife would kill me so let us be safe this is part of the AA of the believer you don't
