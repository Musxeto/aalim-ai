  "transcript": "raheem alhamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa Abdulla yameen nabina muhammad in wala and he was savage marine i'm Bardo assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh we begin a new chapter of the book of the telecom which deals with the prayer in congregation and the rules related to the imama leading the prayer in congregation and hadith number 57 is our first hadith who will do us the honor of reading it yes brother narrated of the lightning Homer The Messenger of Allah said the Salah prayer in congregation is 27 times superior in degrees to the Salah offered by pass it alone Bukhari okay this hadith is highlighting the difference between playing alone and praying in congregation and the prophet alayhi salat WA Salam is telling us that it is more superior 27 times than to pray alone your prayer in congregation is more superior this led a lot of the scholars to differ whether praying in congregation is mandatory or not because they said that the Prophet is salah salem comparing one to the other which means that both are acceptable and if you look in the quran and in the sunnah you would find that this is not correct because allah azzawajal tells us in different locations of the quran that allah is better than what they worship so Allah so Allah is superior to what the worship does this mean that what they worship is also okay definitely not when Allah tells us that when you hear the Adhan of Juma then abandon trade because attending the prayer is better than this trade however is the trade if someone chooses it over the prayer permissible no not only that even the transaction that takes place after the van of Jummah is void is not correct so if the event is being called the actual event which follows the Imam when he comes and says assalamu alaikum quran of allah and then is being called if someone is buying and selling this transaction is void it's not correct and after the prayer they have to renew it again because they've done something that is Haram and something that is not acceptable in Islam therefore what is the ruling on praying in congregation the most authentic opinion is that it is mandatory and we will come to get to that ish Allah in coming a hadith however it is extremely important for us to know that if a person does not pray in JAMA he's not a kafir although some scholars said that it is a condition for your prayer to be accepted that it is prayed with the Gemara we move on to the following hadith hadith number 58 and also hadith number 59 we would like to read them all together though they are quite long cameraman narrated abu huraira or Adela and the messenger of allah allah allah allah wa sallam said the reward of the salah offered by a person in congregation is multiplied 25 times as much as that of the salah offered in one's house or in the market and this is because if he performs ablution and does it perfectly and then proceeds to the masjid with the sole intention of offering Salah then for every step he takes towards the Masjid he is given one degree in reward and one sin is taken off crossed out from his account of deeds when he offers his Salah the angels keep on asking Allah blessings and Allah is forgiveness for him as long as he is staying at his musalla pleas of the prayer they say o Allah bestow your blessings upon him be merciful and kind to him and one is regarded as being in Salah as long as one is waiting for the Salah we will pause shortly now and look at this hadith this hadith differs than the one we've just recited before why this says it is 25 times better the other one says 27 times better and both are authentic hadith so the increase from 25 to 27 does not mean that the 25 is wrong nor the 27 is wrong both are correct now the Prophet at Islam is telling us that praying alone or praying as an individual in your souk in your market in your place of trading is less than praying in the Masjid and he tells us why because if you recognize the reward you would rarely skip a Salah if you perfect your woudl your ablution and you walk to the Masjid only to pray in the masjid the Prophet tells us that with every step Allah will give you a reward and we'll raise a bad deed so if I'm living 200 steps away from the Masjid imagine every prayer this is taking place and happening and that is why the Prophet RSO Salam gave us an example of Prayer as if someone has a running river in front of his house cleaning his body five times a day would that leave any dirt on his body they said no so the Prophet said likewise your prayer it will erase your bad deeds if you maintain to pray it on time and where the Prophet Allah so salaam tells you to do it and not only that the Prophet tells us that if you remain in your masala in the place of Prayer the Angels keep on asking Allah to forgive you and to have mercy on you as long as you are in your place doing that and you do not notify your woudl not only that Allah Azza WA JAL grants us the reward of prayer while you're not praying so for example you pray Maghrib and you sit in the message reading the Quran making Vicker studying if you have exams you have your books you study and Allah would calculate the time from Maghreb tarisha as being prayer for you as well though you're not praying so it's a great reward that a lot of the Muslims are neglecting or ignorant about or they do not care a lot about it so it's a great favor and a great blessing of Allah Azza WA JAL the following idea Herrera yes miss I was really a loved one who reported that the last messenger sallallahu alayhi wa sallam is saying the most burdensome prayers for the hypocrites are the night prayer the asia and the morning prayer the fagio if they were to know the blessings they have installed they would have come to them even through calling and I consider ordering the prayer to be commenced and command someone to lead the people in prayer and then I would go along with some men having with them a bundle of firewood to the people who have not attended the prayer in congregation then I would burn their houses with fire al boy is he a Muslim this hadith is an authentic hadith by far and not only that it gives us a warning a dire warning to the believers the Prophet tells us allah√≠s alot was salam that among the signs of hypocrisy among the characteristics of hypocrites is that they find fajar prayer and Asia prayer burdensome what is the meaning of burdensome they find it heavy upon themselves do they pray or don't they pray they pray they go to the message but they go as mentioned in the Quran worried DiPalma irresolute a cow Moo coos Allah Allah is describing the hypocrites and if they go to pray they go but in the state of laziness they are not up to it but they go and pray they attend the prayer of the Prophet Arizona and if you compare them and their actions to us you will be shocked because they pray in the masjid we don't they pray with laziness we don't pray at all we may skip a salah or two every week some would say shave every week we skip a Salah or two everyday we don't pray in the congregation except once or twice why Oh share the message it is for this I have that I have work I have subhanAllah all these excuses would not help you on the day of judgment prayer is a must and the Prophet is indicating this to us in this hadith the characteristic of the hypocrites that they find it burdensome to pray Fajr and Isha prayer had they known that there is some reward for the materialistic reward if there is a bonus if there is an increase in salary if there is a free gift they would have come crawling on their hands and needs this is what the hypocrites are like and then the Prophet tells us Ali salatu salam about something that crossed his mind he tells us that I was about to instruct someone to give the comma and call for prayer and then appoint someone to lead the prayer and then go with a group of men who have wood fire with them to the houses of people who did not attend Jumeirah who did not attend the congregation to do what the prophesies are a solid serum to burn their houses to the ground with them inside it why didn't he do so the Prophet said in an authentic hadith and had it not been for the children and the women I would have done so if I knew that it was only men I would have burnt their houses on the on their heads but because the houses have women because the houses have children and this is the reason I did not do so we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back assalamualaikum and welcome back what was the reason that the Prophet as son did not burn the houses for because he feared that there might be women and children in their houses and from this hadith and other evidences scholars concluded that praying in congregation is a must because the Prophet ISM never threatened to burn the houses of people who did not pray to her prayer or who did not offer voluntary prayer or who did not offer night prayer and whitter why because these are all voluntary yet this thing burning their houses indicates that it is mandatory for men to attend the prayer in or with the congregation are there any more evidences a lot among them the hadith where a blind man comes to the prophet re salat wa salam and it's in the Sahay and he says o prophet of allah my house is distant it's far away from the Masjid and I'm blind and I don't have a leader or a guide man suitable for me to take me to the Masjid and in some narrations the medina is a place where there are lots of insects and animals and snakes etc so is there any excuse for me not to attend the Gemara not to attend the congregation the Prophet said yes adding his salat wa salam and as the man was leaving he said come back come back come back what did you say so the man repeated his inquiry his request not to attend the Salah then the Prophet I saw I'm asked him one question do you hear the event and then I said yes so the Prophet said answer it you have no excuse so if this is for a man who is what who's blind and the Prophet gave him no excuse then what excuse do we have on the day of judgment what might say I don't hear that then why don't you hear that then says because I live in a concrete house with double glazed windows and air conditioning on and the TV's on so even if my father is shouting outside of the house I would not hear him is this legitimate excuse the answer is no callers say the determining factor in answering the call of the Adhan in answering the Morvan is that the distance is approximately between three to five kilometers what do you mean they say what is the distance that the voice of a strong man on top of a building in an open area at least not with concrete structures in an open area without any exterior noise such as cars and factories and planes etc how much is the distance how long how far is it for his voice to reach so they said that it's approximately the diameter of three to five kilometers maybe less maybe more so the scholars say if you live in an area where the Masjid is this far from you it is mandatory for you to go and answer the call of salat I give you an example in some countries for European countries will not some most well this is an understatement all European countries you cannot call the Adhan using loudspeakers so you might have the message it next door to you but because the margin is inside and because it's a concrete building and you live in a concrete place with all the heating with all the air-conditioning can you hear him if he calls are that so is it mandatory for me to attend yes it because the distance is less than three to five kilometers so the scholars say it depends on the distance not on the sound reaching you and by this we learn that it is mandatory for you to attend the prayer wherever you are in the vicinity of a Masjid and if you do not then this is one of the characteristics of hippocrates that you should fear not to be with also in this hadith we learn that salat al-fajr ii and salat elisha are one of the most important prayers in our day and night the Prophet said that is awesome that whoever prays Asia in congregation Allah would reward him as if he prayed half of the night imagine praying in Russia 10 minutes Allah would give you half of the night which is about four and a half hours as if you prayed Valentini prayers and if you pray Fechter Allah would reward you as if you had prayed the full night and this is every night and with the grace of Allah I know a lot of you masha'Allah praise in the Masjid and this is a blessing of Allah unfortunately I know that also there are people who miss prayers so many times I asked my friends and loved ones and and those whom can he respect me and I say masha'Allah how many times did you miss Roger this month and he said I prayed it twice only and 28 days I slept Japan Allah is this a Muslim and some of them they would say masha'Allah I only missed once or twice Roger and some masha'Allah would say it's been like a year and a half or two years since I last slept it's a blessing those who do not miss any prayer definitely they will be among the favored and blessed ones on the day of judgment of Allah as virgin before moving on to the following hadith do you have any questions Marcia a lot of makalah okay check the place where I stay right now there are two massages and in those massages they usually in Walker hasta la salon and they Seattle ooh la la and they do a lot of be down and maybe  and even wear charms stuff like that so is it better for me to go to that Masjid for the prayers or should I stay at home and offer Salah at home if the person who's leading the prayer is a kafir then you cannot pray behind him and to label someone as a kafir is not an easy thing but if you know for certain that this man says that Allah is everywhere yeah he may this is not permissible Allah so Allah is on his throne on the seventh heaven no no no Allah is everywhere even under the table even in here stock for Allah this is comfortable you cannot pray behind this man if you know someone who says the Prophet Isis Arab controls everything and he has the ability to give you goodness and benefit you and he has the ability to protect you from harm this is kafir because this is only something that Allah is able to do if someone deals in black magic in sorcery and he claims that he knows the future this is qu for blasphemy this is Major go for that takes the person out of the fault of Islam but if a person has innovations they're wrong there major sins but there are innovations that do not notify his prayer you may pray with him if there is no other alternative this is better than praying alone without being with the congregation as the Muslims we have to stick together as long as he's a Muslim praying behind him and also try to advise him every now and then the brother their second row in my vicinity there are two massage it's the master it is addition to my house they are not following the Quran and the Sunnah completely and the other Mazda villages are a bit further from my house they are completely following the Quran and the Hadees so how do I convince a person who lives in my building how do I convince a person in the light of the Quran and the Sunnah to attend the second Masjid that is a bit farther from the house how do I convince him with the proof of the hadees as mentioned before if the first message closest to your house there Muslims but innovative meaning they're a whole Buddha then their prayer behind them is accepted even Omar may Allah be pleased with him used to pray behind who and had judge ben youssef attakathi what did her judge do he killed Abdul on the Sabbath may Allah be pleased with him and with his father he killed Syed even jubail he killed hundreds of the tabi rain yet he prayed behind him so if he prays in that message is permissible as long as the Imam is Muslim but we always add value to enlarging those who follow the Quran and Sunnah those of people who on the right track so we would like to enlarge their number by always praying there and it's better for my heart and it's better for my knowledge as well the Hadees which you mentioned about Abu Huraira when said this Hadees to many people I mean try to explain that namaz Salah is further in Masjid when we try to say that Salah is further than much did you have to go at his mandatory as you explained so many people they refer that this hadith where the Prophet said he'd like to burn the house of people who are not coming to the Muslim it is referring to Juma it is not about the five obligatory prayers it is referring to Juma so I would like you to just clear this this is wrong because there are two separate narrations one that it is intima and the other one we just read is jamar the congregation so their allegation is not correct because the Prophet ISM is strictly indicated this and the hadith of the blind man is clear evidence the hadith of the blind man the Prophet told him do you hear the Adhan said yes then I have no excuse for you or you have no excuse not to attend the prayer is clear as crystal as they say the it's black and white a blind man you must come so what about those who are not blind I'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time via Manila or Salaam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
