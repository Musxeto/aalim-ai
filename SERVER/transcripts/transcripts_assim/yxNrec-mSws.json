  "title": "How to do wudu when you have stuffed nose? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "as how do I make wood oh if my nose is stuffed and water I can't go up it I heard it's sufficient to put wet fingers in your nose and blow how to wash nose in wool with stuffed nose the issue of turning the water in your mouth and pulling the water up your nostrils by pulling your breath and then blowing it out the majority of scholars say that this is recommended and asuna the method above a mom I might say that it is mandatory and the humbly mother have say it is mandatory and because we follow mainly the humble EMF hub in whatever things are not so clear for us we tend to follow this opinion simply because the prophet alayhi salatu salam throughout his life we never heard that he skipped turning water in his mouth and pulling water up his nostrils and blowing it out we never heard this happened a single time so Emma Muhammad said that this is obligatory and also in the hadith of Lapita Mubarak may Allah be pleased with him when the Prophet was teaching him salah salem how to make woudl he told him to exaggerate in turning the water in his mouth and pulling them the water up his nostrils unless he's fasting so by ordering him to overdo it and to do it in a good way and an extreme way this shows us that it is obligatory however when a person is unable to do this due to the fact that he has a stuffed nose there are two situations one if you are unable to get the water close to your nose due to burns due to allergy due to any other reason in this case this part of Woodill cannot be fulfilled cannot be completed so in this case you you assume and you offer all different parts of woudl as usual with the exception of that organ with that area that you cannot wash and you make TM mooned right dry ablution for it for skipping it so this is part 1 the second part is when you are able to wash your nose but you are unable to pull the water up your nostrils because this blocked so this is something that is not within your ability so it is sufficient to get the water as far as possible even if it is to the tip of your nose because this is your ability and allah azza wajal told us to feed him to the best of our ability and this is your ability this is the best thing you can do therefore there is no problem for you none whatsoever to do this and to pull the water even just to the tip of your nose if you can clean it with your fingers or with by blowing your nose as hard as possible then this inshaallah falls under the category"
