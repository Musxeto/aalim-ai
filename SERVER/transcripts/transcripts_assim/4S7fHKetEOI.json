  "title": "My friend has gone astray",
  "transcript": "he is saying that they have a friend of theirs who's originally Muslim but he has lost track and he is sinful and they want to get him back to track and this is extremely strange all Muslims should feel ashamed of themselves this brother is a three and a half year revert and he is giving da to Born Muslims to let them come back to Islam aren't you ashamed of yourself and I Envy brother Khalid to tell you the truth all of the previous years before accepting Islam are all gone he started a full new record so to look at his sins he's been only sinning if and I pray to Allah he's not sinning for the past three and a half uh uh years and that's little compared to someone who's been like sinning for 30 or 40 or 50 years so I advise brother Khaled to keep on doing his good job now how to get the brother back into uh uh back to track again by constantly reminding him of what Allah says in the Quran and what the teachings of the Prophet Alat wasam is by constantly giving him and a good example a role model so when he sees you as a revert praying all the time five times in the first raw in the Masjid and whenever it's time for prayer with a big smile come my friend let's go and pray he rejects once twice 10 20 100 times eventually he will come and pray with you inshallah when he sees you fasting Mondays and Thursdays but at the same time when he sees you doing things that are not related to Islam but you're perfecting it he sees that you're a good Cricket player or you love to uh uh work in the gym or you're excellent and in your work or in your studies then he would feel that he's losing it both ways in this life in the Hereafter and maybe this would be his wake up call"
