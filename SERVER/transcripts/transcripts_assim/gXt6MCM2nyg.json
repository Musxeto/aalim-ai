  "transcript": "he says i don't like the social distancing taking place in masjid and i second that but would i be sinful if i stay home and pray without going to the masjid to me i was reluctant in the beginning and i personally did not pray in the masjid for a couple of months until i reflected upon it and sat and discussed it with some of the brothers and they said that the only loser of the reward of the great steps walking to the masjid is you if you pray home you're gonna be deprived of all of that now if there is a sin if and this is a big iaf underlined quote unquote using bold a font with color red if there is a sin it's not on you the sin for praying with social distancing is on the one who mandated it and if there is no sin in it then why lose all this great reward go and pray and insha allah ask allah azza to uplift this calamity and to restore back upon the muslims their rituals their sunnahs their religious practices that they have been deprived from for the past year and so uh"
