  "transcript": "Peyman meow slamming raheem alhamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa salamu ala muhammad ali l-'alameen nabina muhammad in VAR d he or sahbihi ajma'in the maybach Salam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh we're still pondering upon the beautiful surah number 79 swore to nauseate and last time we met we discussed until I a number 15 when Allah Azza WA JAL entertains if you wish his messenger salallahu alaihe salam with the story of another messenger who came before him yet he was faced and mapped by a lot of trouble Allah says the Almighty he'll attack a hadith o Moosa has there come to you the story of Moses peace be upon him and this is addressing the Prophet Allah so salam and anyone else who reads this story so that he would ponder upon it okay what happened with moosa allah says if nada boohoo below a dilma codicil ha when his Lord Allah Almighty called him in the sacred valley of tuwa and this is an indication without any doubt that Allah spoke to Moses peace be upon him and that is why he's known as Halim Allah the one whom Allah has spoken to and this is not something psychological something that is mental this is the actual speaking of allah azzawajal to his messenger he heard that with his own ears and there is nothing to complain about those deviant sects that manipulate a las beautiful names and attributes so they say no Allah does not speak this is mental way or psychological way of communicating and this is outrageous a lot tells us that he spoke to Moses peace be upon him and you say he didn't why do you say thing said ah we would like to purify a lot so gel from resembling his creatures and who said anything of resembling a lot to his creatures LASIK Emily he she there is nothing like him the almighty allah azzawajal yet or who was Samuel Basset he is the all-hearer all-seer so does Allah here and see they said yes we believe in that okay why wouldn't you purify him and say that this is resembling his creatures well there are deviant sex that said no allah azza wajal is all-hearer what he doesn't hear is all-seeing but he doesn't see I would have Allah these Japanese are the worst of kafirs they are the disbelievers of the Muslims unfortunately there are also deviant cults that are similar to them and would fall in the same category of nullifying there Islam Allah says Allah also they disregard a number of Allah's beautiful names and attributes though it's mentioned in black and white it's in the Quran it's in the Sunnah is a consensus of all I understand that I said no no no we know better we would like to glorify Allah so gel from all of this you can't glorify Allah by falsifying what he had said when you come to a higher you know the ashes they manipulate all of Allah's beautiful attributes except 7 and this is outrageous allah azza wajal attributes are understood they are part of Muhammad they are perfect what Allah tells us say he has a hand when allah tells us he has a leg when allah tells us he has a face when allah tells us he has eyes when allah tells us he has a foot when allah tells us he has fingers all of these attributes are in black and white we understand them as they are we don't divert from their original meaning however we know what a hand is we do not know how it is so when allah tells us he has two hands which he has created adam with we believe in that but do we say that his hand looks like this or that no can we comprehended no it cannot even cross our minds so Allah spoke to musa peace be upon him what did Allah tell Musa to do a lot of almighty said inhabit in a frown in power for whom Holika illa anta zakah go to Pharaoh go to Pharaoh who was from for I was the leader of Egypt at the time he was the king and he used to enslave the people and he used to tell them that I am God I am your Lord so go Musa with my message to Pharaoh and Allah says go to Pharaoh verily he has transgressed all bounds and say to him would you accept Islam and purify yourself so this was the message ask him to submit his will to Allah to worship only Allah and no one else and this would lead him to his soul purification frown was the crowned king and he was so arrogant that he himself believed that he is the lord of all and that he is the god of the people and that is why when Moses came to him and called him to Islam and to worship allah azza wajal he said is there any God other than me how pathetic these thoughts which came to Pharaoh isn't he insane does he believe what he says he's a human being a virus knocks him down he eats and drinks and has to go to the toilet otherwise he would die if he does not discharge these poisonous matters in his stomach he sleeps he needs rest he's weak yet he claims is there any God other than him so allah azza wajal told moosa to go to him and call him to islam because he has transgressed he went way beyond his limit and each one of us has a limit and our limit is that we worship allah azza wajal and not associate others with him allah says o muhammad ali jinnah will in Salaria balloon I have not created the jinn and the humans except for one reason and that is to worship me Allah Azza WA JAL got you out of your mother's womb knowing nothing and he gave you the sight and the healing in the heart to comprehend things with don't you want to be grateful shouldn't you be grateful and thankful to Allah look at you masha'Allah so sophisticated rich strong you weren't like this years ago when you came out of your mother's womb you needed people to take care of you you needed people to feed you Allah Azza WA JAL made all of this happened to you and he made you who you are and how do you pay a la back by associating others with him so you have a limit you should not transgress you should not pass you should not go beyond that limit the round went out all of these boundaries he exceeded by far so Allah sent him Musa and he also sent Harun the brother of Musa so that they would join forces and call him to Islam and Allah Azza WA JAL tells us in the quran the ayah focal hell laka illa anta zakah invite him and ask him should you accept Islam to purify your soul your heart and as the cat which is one of the pillars of Islam is originating from the same root word so it is blessing it is to increase and to grow and Musa is calling him to purify his heart and you cannot purify your heart except with Islam this is the only means of heart purification that is when you accept Islam and he called him to purify his heart and also Allah says what in Arabic of etosha if you accept Islam and your heart is purified and that I guide you to your Lord so you should fear him then this means that you will attain paradise and without fearing allah azza wajal you would never be admitted to paradise the fear of Allah should be accompanied by knowledge without knowledge this is not proper fear with knowledge you will become blessed and you will be rewarded for your fear Allah says in Nemea Shalala having anybody he dilemma verily that among Allah servants only those knowledgable would fear him but what kind of knowledge are we talking about it is the knowledge of Allah it is the knowledge of his beautiful names and attributes so you don't have to be a rocket scientist to be someone who fears Allah because the knowledge that is most important is the knowledge of Allah you could be someone who's a layman you could be a literate yet you are a scholar because of your fear of a large division because of your compliance with his laws doing what Allah tells you to do refraining from what Allah does not want you to do this is the actual fear of Allah so the invitation was Pharaoh you have transgressed you've gone beyond all borders and lines shall I guide you invite you to Islam purify your heart so that you would fear Allah and the conclusion is if you do this you enter Jannah should I do this what was the response of Pharaoh this is what we find after the break so stay tuned salamualikum' and welcome back so now here's the invitation Farrow come back to your senses reconsider look around you don't be foolish don't be arrogant and by the way all this believers have a small Pharaoh in them they're arrogant they're not willing to listen they think that they know everything and they know nothing we call them to Islam come take a day off just think about it be objective and the fair or within would never listen and that is why we present them with evidences proving that what we say is the truth this is exactly what Moosa did with Pharaoh peace be upon him Moosa showed him miracles Allah says in the Quran in ayah number 24 who I tell k√ºbra and Moosa showed him the great sign he showed him the miracles what were the miracles a branch of a tree a staff that he uses to guide his flock herd of sheep and to protect himself so many uses for this staff yet it was a great sign from Allah throw your staff Musa and it turns into a huge snake pick it up and don't be afraid and it becomes as it was a staff so Moosa was even a miracle actually he was given a number of miracles that related to the knowledge and to the sciences of his people because there were magicians they were sorcerers so he came with a miracle that exceeds all expectations no one could come close to that and when Pharaoh saw this the natural reaction would be to believe to submit your will to Allah it's an eye-opener no one can do such a thing except the one who is truly God the one who is truly Allah the creator of the heavens and the earth but did he accept did he curse eat Allah says facas the baba i saw but pharaoh belied and disobeyed there's a small pharaoh in every one of us don't let this control you come back to your senses you can see that I act the signs and the miracles of Allah all over you don't be blinded by the light and come back to your senses so this was the normal thing people don't believe until they see the miracles and the signs Allah gave him the stuff Allah so Jill gave him a sign in a miracle that when he puts his hand into his pocket and he takes it out it is so white that is unbelievable it's not like leprosy no it is not a defect it's a perfection and Allah gave him a number of other miracles but he belied and disobeyed and this is one aspect of rejecting the truth when you become passive I'm not gonna accept ok this is your problem but when you go into high gear and you say not only that I'm gonna attack you and I'm gonna follow you and I'm gonna kill anyone who believes in you then you become truly deviant and a rejecter of the truth Allah says some a dibala essa after he belied and disobeyed then he turned his back striving hard against Allah so now it's not only not accepting the truth but working hard I against it and trying to fight an attack it what did he do Allah says in I 23 and 24 fahara funada he summed up his subjects he gathered his people and cried aloud so it's an announcement a public announcement get everyone here in my kingdom so what is the announcement are you gonna announce your islam abdullah you've gotta become a muslim then he gathered his people and cried aloud saying i am your lord most high taaha Shah a fanatic all and Arabic whom will Allah how stupid of you that was a bad move that was wrong how do you claim that you are the Most High and by the way this is one of Allah's attributes that the deviant sex don't believe in Quran believed in it because it's natural a lot of these deviant sects like the mortise Allah like the jammies like an a shoddy they say that allah azzawajal is not up high they neglect the fact that Allah is high over his throne over the universe there is nothing over a large The Watcher Pharaoh himself told his Minister hey man hey man did you hear what Musa said he says that his Lord is on the heavens on his throne tell you what build me a high structure so that I would climb over it and reach to his Lord and see him and I think he's lying subhanAllah even firown' believes in the Highness of Allah Almighty and these deviant sects neglected so many places in the Quran you hear Allah say you and Zelda who feel a little mobile akka we have descended it and that is the Quran in a blessed night a large ocean has descended the Quran from above downwards in a blessed night and Allah Allah says well I'm a low Sally your furrow Allah says that the good deed Allah Allah would uplift them and Allah Azza WA JAL tells us in so many places in the Quran that he is Allah above us the Prophet is a son asked a slave girl where is Allah she said pointing to the sky to the heavens above the heavens meaning that a lies above everything and above the heavens and whenever the Prophet used to give a speech he would point above and say o Allah be my witness or Allah be my witness the angels are sent to him and the angels descend from him Subhanahu WA Ta'ala and the funniest thing even these deviant sex they are ignorant they are followers of their leaders they don't follow the Quran and the Sunnah when they are in trouble and they want to supplicate to Allah when they are in a plane that is about to crash land or they are in a ship that is about to sink in high waves and high seas when they want to supplicate to Allah to save them from the calamity there in what would they do would they do this or Allah do this or Allah do this for us all I'll do this for us now they would say o Allah relieve us from what we're suffering from because they know that Allah is above yet when they ask them where is Allah who say everywhere a stop for Allah how dare you say Allah is everywhere alas everywhere always under your laptop Allah is under the table lies he a stock for a car appear to be well like they do not appreciate a large they worship they do not exalt Allah Almighty by saying such blasphemous words Allah is everywhere by Allah he's not Allah is over his and he doesn't need his strong there was Allah and there was nothing with him a lies on his throne which is on Paradise which is in the seventh heaven so Allah is above everything and this is what Pharoah acknowledged and he said that I am your Lord the Most High so he gathered all of his subjects announcing this to them and that is why Allah said Fahad aha la una Carol a Fiat even Allah so Allah Almighty seized him with the punishment for his last and the first for his last claiming that there is no God other than me and then he said that I am your Lord the Most High I don't know any other God for you than me this is the first thing he said and the last which he paid heavily for when he said that I am your Lord the most high you should worship me and this is the form of transgression and Allah Azza WA JAL said afterwards in Nephi radically ribbit and amaya verily in this is an instructive example for whosoever fears allah azza wajal so what do we learn we learn that Elijah that entertains his messenger so that he would know that this is not the only thing that's happening to him we believe and learn from this that Allah spoke to prophet musa directly peace be upon him and we know that there is no purification for the soul without applying Islam to it and that fearing Allah Azza WA JAL could happen only when you know Allah and when you know his beautiful names and attributes and this is portrayed in performing what Allah orders you to do and staying away from what Allah forbid you to do and finally the existence of miracles does not necessarily mean that there will be belief and convey afterwards because so many times you see miracles and signs in front of you and this leads you nowhere and this is what happened with Pharaoh who rejected these miraculous signs that came to him and he died as the worst kafir this is all the time we have until we meet next time via Manila assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
