  "title": "Copyright strike trends - not disclosing copyright to trap people when using content assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "question about uh this copywriting trend that's been going on um idea is that someone produces content and when he produces this content he gets a license so that they own it officially and uh this person when they post this content they purposefully avoid adding a copyright disclaimer with the intention that someone uses the content so that they can then approach the person and say hey this is my content either pay me for this or stop using it or I will copyright strike you and they do this all with the attention of hoping that this person falls into using their content and it can be avoided by simply put in a copyright disclaimer but this is how they make money so is this kind of business Haram I believe it's horrible I just wanted clarification holds us accountable to the intention we have in them yet as per the Hadith the prophet says verily Deeds are held accountable by the intentions they are regarded according to the intention so if a person's intention is to deceive people and to trap them into doing something which they did with no ill intent rather with good intention but he purposely dug a hole so that they would fall into it definitely whatever he makes out of it is Haram he's cheating others and Allah would send him someone who would do the same to him or to his family without him knowing it a Muslim cannot be a Muslim properly until he loves to others what other he loves others to do to him and definitely he would not like to be treated like this and Allah Knows Best"
