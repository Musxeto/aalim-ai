  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Bangladesh Sheikh if \na person does something like drinking   tea or chit chatting with someone and as a \nresult he goes to the Masjid a bit late and   he misses the first row but he catches the \nfirst thick beard then would he be sinful   I wouldn't say he would be sinful because he did \nthe obligation which is attending the Salat on   time with the congregation in the Masjid but is he \nmissing a great deal of reward the answer is yes   is he prone to a form of punishment there \nis a possibility if this is habitual of   him it's it's it's a habit it's something \nthat is in his system because in the Hadith please with her there will be people from his ummah who would \ndeliberately delay coming to the Masjid so that   they attain the last Rose until Allah delays \nthem from going out from Hell Fire on the day   of judgment meaning they can't come on time \nin the first row but they simply want to wait   until the roads are complete and they come late \nto join in late so that they can skip as soon as   the Imam offers Salaam or for any other reason \nas a punishment Allah azzawajal if he wills and   torments them and punishes them for their sins \nin Hellfire because we're all sinful so if Allah   puts him in hell and their sentences for a \nhundred years for example instead of giving   them clemency after a day or a month or a year \nAllah keeps them in hell until they finish their   sentence which is a punishment for \nwhat they had done and Allah Knows Best and have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford it \nthat's good for you if you cannot you're entitled   for one free session and this is for everybody \nif they can affirm by Allah that they cannot   afford it because they're poor I'll give them \none free session without a problem a full half   an hour so come to me and let's speak about \nit inshallah within the following two days   or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for All"
