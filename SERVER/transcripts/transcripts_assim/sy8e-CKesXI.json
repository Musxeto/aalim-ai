  "transcript": "after the five prayers there this subh after every five prayers some people just walk away after you see somebody going off the mus when you ask him he tells you that okay ask for the first question what was it thear the Sunnah is that when you read your Salat you say your AAR seated you concluded the Salah but you are still at prayer as long as you're sitting in your prayer position Allah will reward you is it mandatory no so many companions at the time of the Prophet even in theith of ab you know theth of the two long arms when the prophet prayed two in he forgot he prayed two then went to the member crossed his fingers and did like this and he was angry something was bothering him the of says those who are usually at the end immediately left we have a discount prayer is to and they left and the prophet did not comment negatively the companions did not comment negatively which means it is permissible so if someone leaves immediately after the prayer there is no problem in that he's saying Hisar on the way to the car or to the house and he's reading he's doing everything you're doing the only thing missing is that you are in Salat and he's not and again this is a personal preference you do not force me to be like you I have things to do no no no stay do your leave me alone no no do your I have my mother is sick I have to attend her I have to take my child to the hospital I have to go to the toilet no do your now this is too much control now"
