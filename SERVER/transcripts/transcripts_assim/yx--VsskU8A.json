  "transcript": "Mory from Bangladesh So I had a question about fasting. So in 2016 I made a conditional oath to keep the six shawal fasts if my brother got good results but unfortunately he didn't. So I didn't keep the fast and that year I also missed some fasts intentionally. Is there any way I can make up the shawal fast and what can I do about the missed fasts that I missed intentionally? If a person does a vow that is conditional. If Allah saves my son from his illness I will fast. If Allah makes me pass the interview I will give charity. If Allah Azza Wa Jal does this or that for me I will feed people food. This is a conditional vow. If what you wanted happened then it is obligatory upon you to fulfill it. In your case it did not happen to your brother what you ask Allah for so you're not obliged to do anything and there's no sin on you but do not offer such vows in the future because Allah does not love such vows."
