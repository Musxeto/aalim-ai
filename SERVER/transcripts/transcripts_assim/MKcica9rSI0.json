  "transcript": "foreign age we have a lot of tools especially things like Ai and they can do a lot of things including like making images where you write a prompt and like an AI algorithm makes an image for you my question is if asking a AI I guess robot to do this and create an image for you would this also make it around for you because you are creating images that might include things like animals and humans of course it is it is like exactly like me giving someone money and asking him to do halam so what's the difference artificial intelligence is a program or whatever that creates whatever I ask it to do maybe I did not put all the data in the information in it myself but it's there so if I say okay if I press this button it's gonna play me a song I didn't play the song it's the button or if I say hey Siri I hope okay let me stop this because my iPhone would probably respond if I said uh Alexa do this or do that who gave the instruction who gave the order me so whatever is going to play with the Quran or music whatever the AI is going to do for you a nice uh calligraphy of Arabic beautiful words and and poetry or an image of a person a living person I am the one who gave the instructions I'm the one who's going to be sinful for that as if I drew it myself with my own hands"
