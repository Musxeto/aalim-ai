  "transcript": "uh Neda from Saudi Arabia is asking about the will and she says that we know that Muslims have to write their will and this is a Sunnah whether you're young or old whether you're healthy or dying you have to have a will so that when you die all of a sudden your parents your your family your loved ones would know what to do uh and what were your uh requests so she's asking do who do I tell about this will because sometimes maybe if I write a will and I tell my parents they are upset about it well you don't have to tell those who will be upset you can tell your siblings all what you need is two witnesses or to authenticate your will in a court of law for example so you can write a will and you go to a court of law and they authenticate it saying that this is correct and this is the person who wrote the will um you can have two witnesses any Witnesses would do the job inshallah"
