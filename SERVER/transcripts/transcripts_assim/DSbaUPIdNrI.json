  "transcript": "so man says should we say bismillah when we start reciting quran in between a surah if not then how should we start reciting from the middle of the surah scholars differed on this point and the most authentic opinion is that saying bismillah this is a separate ayah and this ayah is recited in the beginning of every surah of the quran with the exception of surah so if you're going to begin a surah from the beginning then you have to say bismillah and it's highly recommended not mandatory but if you're going to recite a surah from the middle then you should not say bismillah it is sufficient only to say a regime"
