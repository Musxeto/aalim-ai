  "transcript": "Talha from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Hi Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Alhamdulillah Sheikh can I have your number before I ask a question to you? What is your question? My question is you know the hadith on the You know the hadith on Umar R.A when the Prophet asked for a family of people to write something I hear from the Quranist they say that the hadith says that the Prophet ﷺ wanted to write something but he's meant to be illiterate according to the verses in the Quran so that means it's false something like that that's what they say Akhi again and again and again I tell the youth and the youngsters to acquire knowledge properly properly from the original sources from the Quran from the Sunnah with the understanding of the three favorite generations this is important because you can't understand the Quran and the Sunnah with your intellect which is impaired so it has to be through the understanding of the three favorite generations and you take this from scholars of Islam trusted scholars from Islam look at you coming and saying that the Quranists those who reject the Sunnah and the hadith what else would you need to refute such people more than their rejection of hadith this is an error and a deficiency in their own intellect they're not totally sane when they reject the hadith which the Quran itself they claim to abide by orders them to follow the hadith to follow the Sunnah that to understand the Quran through the Sunnah because you cannot have Islam without the Sunnah full stop Quran is not sufficient to be understood and practiced to practice Islam without the Sunnah where in the Quran it says Fajr has two rak'ahs Maghrib three and the rest are four and each unit has one ruku' and two sujood you have to have the Sunnah so you can't learn your religion by listening to such doubts and whispers of deviant cults and sects because you will be having a corrupt aqeedah and that would go with you to the grave unfortunately being like them secondly the hadith which you are referring to was at the time when the Prophet was ill on his deathbed he wanted them to bring a paper and a pen not to write himself because he was illiterate as described in the Quran and as described by himself and as described by his companions so who in his right mind would understand that the Prophet at the time of his deathbed wanted to write something he wanted to dictate something write the following x y z who wrote this it was Ali but who actually had it written the Prophet our son he ordered it so when Ali reads it it says so and so and so who wrote this the Prophet he dictated it he did not actually write it so I don't know where these guys are getting these ideas from but it is frustrating or am I getting old it could be both but you guys have to learn your religion properly from Quran and Sunnah with understanding of the three favorite generations from trusted scholars not from tiktok not from instagram or youtube not from tom dick and harry otherwise again it will go with you to your grave"
