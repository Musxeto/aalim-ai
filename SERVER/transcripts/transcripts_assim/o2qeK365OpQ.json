  "title": "Female psychiatrist for someone with mental illness. Choose practicing muslim doctor assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "as for your second question in regards to a female psychiatrist unfortunately I do not know of any personally you have to look around and look for someone who is a practicing muslima see there are so many psychiatrists and so many people dealing in psychology and they have Muslim names but when you come to their treatment you find that it has nothing to do with Islam on the contrary they may ask you to do things that are prohibited according to what they have learned in school which is not necessarily Islamic therefore one has to be really careful when it comes to such professionals that you don't fall in the wrong hands"
