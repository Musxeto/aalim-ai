  "title": "Shaking hands and Giving Salam after Fard Salah in Congregation - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "was what is the ruling on shaking hands after concluding the congregational prayer I'm in the Masjid it's a habit in so many countries that you look at the person to your right andam Alam Alayah how are you everything is fine so what's the ruling on that first of all offering Salam is good and it's something that is positive however if it becomes a habit and it is attached to F prayer and congregational prayers it becomes an innovation so how can you say it's good but it may become an innovation it's very easy if I'm in the prayer I concluded my salot and I look to my right and there is this brother I had not seen in sometime couple of weeks Oham alaykum how are you my friend where you've been chitchatting with him there's nothing wrong with that but if it is a habit that every time after we conclude our prayers we look to whomever randomly is at our sides and shake hands and give Salam this is an innovation why do we say it's an innovation because our Prophet Alat who taught us the religion who taught us the dean did not do anything as such neither did his companions and this is very important issue that all Muslims must adhere to when we want to do something did the prophet Alam ever uh did something that is similar to this or not if he didn't then it is an innovation if he did then go ahead and do it without any problem inshallah"
