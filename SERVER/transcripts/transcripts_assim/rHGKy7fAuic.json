  "transcript": "an anonymous person says a man puts alarm for fetcher but now that but does not get up here's the ad on the salaat while half-asleep wakes up and prays missed fetcher at around 7:00 to 8:00 a.m. every single day and that was for a long number of years is this permissible the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam said that the pen of accountability has been uplifted the pen of accountability has been uplifted from three people one of them a person who's asleep until he wakes up so usually when a person is asleep he's not accountable if he misses a prayer due to sleep he's not accountable he however is accountable while he is awake meaning that if a person knows that fetcher is at 4 o'clock or 5 o'clock a.m. and he goes to bed at 2 o'clock or 1 o'clock a.m. and he knows that he won't be able to wake up is this person sinful for missing the salat some say no he's not sinful for missing the salat he's sinful for staying so late which led 4 to him for him to miss the fire solid so the accountability is for him when he was awake why didn't he go to bed early so that he would be able to wake up for Roger therefore we cannot answer this question because this is something between him and Allah and Allah knows exactly his ability and whether he was truly half asleep or fully sleep or went to back to sleep intentionally and deliberately setting the alarm is a good thing if the alarm goes off and he doesn't wake up we look at the reason if he went to bed late then he's sinful for that if he went to bed early and the alarm went off and he could not wake up he's not sinful for that but if he as he says here's the event and here's the prayer being called for and he's half asleep half asleep it means that he has the will if he wanted to get out of bed and go to pray he has the ability because he is awake he is alert and he knows what's happening around him but I understand maybe once every blue moon you're half awake and half asleep you hear the Adhan you want to get up but there's something pulling you and all of a sudden you wake up and it's 7 o'clock or 8 o'clock in the morning this happens once every blue moon to happen every single day this means that it's your choice and if you go back to sleep with your own will and your own free will deliberately then you cannot pray it when you wake up because you missed it intentionally and it was premeditated that you don't pray further and hence you cannot make it up making up a prayer and miss prayer is limited to two reasons as the Prophet said nodding in salat wa salam if a person over sleeps or forgets a prayer but in your case you're half asleep which means that you were alert and you could have if wanted to leave the bed and go to pray may allah azza wajal have mercy on all of us"
