  "transcript": "what's your advice for the ones that they follow the fatwas they follow the she's opinions and Scholars opinions what is your advice for those people that Allah said twice in the Quran ask the people of knowledge if you do not know so we are instructed in the Quran to ask the people of knowledge now this is different to those who cherry pick those who go and want a solution that fits their desires and whims not that is complied complying with the Quran and Sunnah I'll give you an example a person who loves to listen to music goes to the vast majority of Scholars of Islam the four schools of thought they all say Haram the school of thought of Abu hanifah sha Malik Ahmed they also say music is Haram I still have this in me Tay has a concert in Las Vegas I want to watch that so what should I do I go and look in books of until I find a an old yellow paged book that is like a gazillion years ago and the guy says and it's an issue of dispute and it seems to be Mak that's a one so I take that now later on I have another need to allow my wife to travel without a m whether for Haj or for anything else and I know that the prophet said it is not permissible for a man of a woman who believes in Allah and the day of judgment to travel without a this is in the this is what the prophet said do I need a fatwa if I'm a Muslim Muslim no but still my wife is nagging what's new anyhow so I go and open the books of and I start with the the yellow paged book the old one that said that music is Mak in the first sentence it's Haram I go to all books Haram Haram Haram and then I find a group of Scholars who said I yeah okay it's Mak and I take that okay but these guys said in the beginning that music is Haram why aren't you following them this is cherry picking this is like taking your cart in the aisles of the supermarket and choosing and picking whatever you want this is not Islam because at the end of the day when you start cherry picking you'll end up formulating a religion that has no relationship to Islam it's a new religion your religion something that is custom made and this is not Islam Islam is like Allah said today I have completed your religion Islam is complete it's finished you no one can come and say okay at the time of the Prophet Alam wine was Haram today we have screwdrivers so it's okay no it's not okay well Scot on rocks it's not okay teil Haram it's not wine but it is intoxicating so people who want to cherry pick will find many many ways to go about and this is not for the Layman Layman cannot go through books books of and cherry pick you have to be a student of knowledge who fears Allah not follow his whims and desires you want to find which is the closest to pleas pleasing Allah not the closest to pleasing people and this is why may Allah have mercy upon his soul said that the scholars are free m the scholars are three categories number one a scholar of the state when Simon Says something he just signs and stamps whatever the uh rulers say he does exactly what they want and he manages to do a good job because people trust him category number [Music] two a scholar of the nation in the sense that what do you guys want to listen to I'm I'm here just tell me okay so he caters for the people's needs and what they need and what they want to hear and this this is not a genuine scholar unfortunately a lot of us are like this we want people to have a good time and if we can't break the rules might as well try to bend them a bit the third one is is the scholar of the religion he says what he says could care less about what the people say because he's giving what pleases Allah he's following the footsteps of the prophet of Allah sallallah alaihi wasallam and not looking for likes followers people to praise him or compliment him and Allah knows bested"
