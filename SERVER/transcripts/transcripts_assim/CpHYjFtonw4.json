  "title": "What mistakes done in reciting Fatiha would nullify the prayer? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "nor from nigeria what are the mistakes that nullify al-fatiha scholars say that the mistakes that change the meaning while you know that this changes the meaning so for example this is a form of speech when you talk to someone in front of you so i'm talking to allah so the path of those whom you have blessed oh allah i'm talking to allah if i make a mistake knowingly and i say allah now i'm talking about myself and i'm too meaning i am the one who blessed and i'm you are the one who has blessed so the difference of meaning is obvious this totally breaks the the prayer but if someone uh makes a mistake that does not change the meaning some arabs say that and this is the best they can do the prayer is valid you"
