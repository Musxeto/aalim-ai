  "transcript": "peace of Allah and blessings of Allah Beyond Prophet Beyond mam blesss dear brothers and sisters in Islam yesterday we started to study a beautiful Hadith portraying to us the mercy of the prophet and there were a number of benefits that we can learn and Implement in our lives the Hadith of muaah may Allah be pleased with him and the Hadith started by mua telling us that he was praying in congregation with the prophet Alat wasam when someone sneezed so he said to him may Allah have mercy upon you which we usually say when someone sneezes and Praises Allah Asel by saying alhamdulillah he told us that the people started staring at him while in prayer which indicates that slight staring in the prayer does not nullify it especially if it is or if it was for a reason so when he saw them staring at him during congregational prayer he spoke even more and said wo be upon me why are you staring at me like this so they started hitting their thighs with their hands and he felt that they were trying to make him shut up so he stopped talking he goes on to say the prophet of Allah asael when he had said the prayer for whom I would give my father and mother as Ransom I have never seen neither before him nor after him a teacher who gave better instruction than him I swear by Allah that he did not scold me he did not beat me or swore at me but said talking to others is not fitting during the prayer for it consists that is prayers of glorifying Allah declaring his uh greatness and recitation of the Quran or words to that effect I said oh prophet of Allah I was still recently a pagan but Allah has brought Islam to us among us there are men who resort to cahin and th those are the fortune tellers or soothsayers the prophet saidat do not go to them I said there are men who take Omens so the prophet saidat that there are men that take Omens the prophet said that is something which they find in their chests but let it not turn their way from freedom of action I said among us there are men who draw lines he said there was a prophet who drew lines so if their lines coincide with his lines so be it muaah may Allah be pleased with him went on to say I had a maid servant who shepherded uh Sheep by the side of and one day I happened to pass that way and found that a wolf had carried a sheep from her flock I am after all a man from the posterity of Adam I felt angry as they do that is human beings feel angry so I slapped her I came to the messenger of Allah sallallahu alaih and made and he made me feel how Grievious this act of mine was I said oh prophet of Allah should I not Grant her Freedom the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said bring her to me so I brought her to him he said to her where is Allah she said he is in the heavens he said who am I she said thou are the messenger of Allah the prophet said to muaah Grant her her Freedom she is a believing woman now in this beautiful Hadith we've spoke about the ruling of sneezing and what to say and we spoke about other things yesterday and we stopped at the etiquette of teaching now the thing that muaah noticed most was the way of the Prophet teaching him he said I've never seen a teacher before the prophet Alam nor after him as kind and as good in his preaching and this indicates that you can win more Hearts by being kind by being tolerant by being compassionate and caring and unfortunately nowadays people go to extremes either they become colorblind so they cannot see any distinction or any difference between one group or the other so everybody is alike to them and this is wrong there are those who are under straight path and there are those who are deviant there are those who are knowledgeable and there are those who are ignorant there are those who are truthful in their intention and sincere and there there are those who are hypocrites so you can't deal with all in the same fashion though generally speaking the prophet wasam used to generally be kind and tolerant and on the other hand there are people who must decisively take a stance so you're either with us or against us they don't have any gray areas it's either black or white and these people usually are so offensive rude abusive they have to LA others they cannot rest with the notion of being a Muslim yeah what kind of a Muslim what kind of a Sunni what group of thought do you follow what is your AA and they like interrogate you with everything you say or do once I was coming out of my Masjid and there were two youngsters very enthusiastic trying their level best to follow salaf which is the right thing to do but they went a little bit overboard so every single thing you say they note it down and they interrogate you why did you say this why did you do that and I keep on explaining to them as best to my to the best of my ability as gentle as possible trying my level best to give them as well as knowledge until it reached a limit that they have confronted me and said she we don't know exactly what your AA is I said Subhan Allah did it reach to that level have you ever he heard me say something that is against AA of the salaf said no but we don't know who your shaks are so you're not transparent and these kind of of people would repel others from Islam not only from Sunnah from Islam altogether because they keep on pointing at people say this one you should not listen to that one is a deviant all the scholars the DI that we know of they keep on ridiculing and criticizing okay a at the end of the day who should we follow he said there are four or five or that you only should follow and the rest are so and so and this is wrong a person preaching Islam should walk the talk he should not be criticizing everyone else because at the end of the day what he is really doing is polishing himself and telling everyone else I am the one and all the rest are deviant the prophet Alat wasam was tolerant and the way he gave da was extremely of high level that we must try our level best to raise the bar and reach as close as possible to it mua says he never scolded me nor beat beaten me and he had never cursed me or said bad words to me and this is what we always hear in our masjids and this is shocking and disturbing the people of the masjids are the ones who raise their voices and start to talk against one another in the Masjid before the Salah or after the Salah people don't have any respect for the masjids anymore they don't have respect to the elders anymore the prophet even with the tyrants and the fierce enemies of Islam he would come to them and he would speak to them in a good fashion when he came to him and he tried to to talk him out of Islam and he started giving him proposals you have slandered our Gods you have ridiculed our beliefs you have done things that no one else had done if you want wealth we will give you money as much as you want if you want Reign we will make you our King if you want uh uh uh women we will give you the most beautiful an honorable woman in quray and if you have an illness if you have a mental illness or you have gen possession we will bring someone to get this out of you so he's giving him proposals and intimidating him at the same time the prophet did not even interrupt him though he was a mush he was a cafir until he was through he said are you over father of uh uh Al wied and he's giving him a nickname he's not calling him by his own first name and then he presented his case now such etiquette such high level of communication this is something that we lack all what we hear is abusive words cursing filthy words that are used even with Scholars and with diis and with people of a dignity and this is not befitting the prophet Alam told him what to do in a very gentle way and by the way this was his policy sallallahu alaih wasallam throughout dawa that he usually talks in a very nice fashion to the people he's kind he's tolerant he's compassionate sallallahu alaihi wasallam what we see in the media of these so-called Muslims and who are not representing Islam at all does not relate to Islam a man came to the prophet Alat wasam from behind when the prophet was not looking and the prophet had a cloak made of hard and thick wool and he had nothing underneath it so the man came and an Malik is reporting this Hadith may Allah be pleased with him he narrates that the man who was a nomad a bedwin and we know that Nomads and bedwin don't have the etiquette and the Civilized way of communicating not only that they have immense amount of rudess in them because of the desert and living with the camels Etc the prophet told usam that pride and arrogance is with those who live and raise camels and horses while Tranquility is with those who care and Shepherd sheep and this is obvious so the man came from behind the prophet wasam pulled his cloak in a f fashion that first of all startled the prophet Alat wasam because he was not prepared for such an attack and it affected his skin it scratched his neck and back because he pulled him so hard that it affected his skinat and not only that he said to him oh Muhammad calling him with his bare name without addressing him with Prophet Muhammad messenger of Allah he said oh Muhammad so rude give me from the money you have because this is not your money it is Allah's money and look at the way he is requesting financial help he's coming and saying these rude words to the prophet Alam accompanied by his physical abuse now anyone of us if met with such rudeness what would we do what would our reaction be the prophet Alat wasam did not retaliate on the contrary he smiled and ordered his companions to give that man some money now he did not reprimand him he did not speak back to him or even throw a word he not did not throw a word some of us have this Burning Desire when someone does something bad to us that at least even if we forgive we cannot pardon and what is the difference between forgiving and pardoning forgiveness is that you do do not punish but this does not mean that you have forgotten the sin or that thing that you were wronged with while pardoning is a higher level you do not punish and you do not even remember that a wrong act has been done against you so you totally erase it from your memory and the prophet was like that with so many of his companions it was reported in theah that once a nomad came to the Masjid of Medina and the prophet was there with his companions sitting in the Masjid and we know that one prayer in the Masjid of Medina is better than a thousand prayers elsewhere so the man came into the Masjid and started to urinate the companions went crazy the mid of the Prophet Alam in his present and you're urinating in it so they wanted to go and stop him the prophet Alam told them leave him do not cut him off so they left him until he was through then the prophet Alam ordered them to bring bring a bucket of water and pour it over the urine we know that the ground of the prophet's message at the time sallallahu alhi wasallam was not made of carpets like today it was made of soil and sand of ground so when they poured the water it took all the impurities the njasa and it was clean once again the prophet Alam was very smart and intell intelligent and not only that he is wise because he knows how to put things in the right position and this is hikma putting things in the right position the prophet Alam knew that he should judge the actions by their consequences not by how you feel not by being impulsive not not but by just wanting to react no you have to judge things so that whatever you are doing is in accordance to the Quran and the Sunnah the prophet with his wisdom knew that if his companions went to the man and shouted at him while in the middle of his urination that he would be startled and that he may run away which would would cause the whole Masjid to be uh polluted with his urine let alone his his clothes and his body while if he were to be left alone until he finishes the area of damage which was infected in the very beginning is the same area it's contained and the damage can be removed so the prophet Alat wasam told them not to started him let him finish once he finished usually it is time to implement the punishment but the prophet Alam always differentiated between those who were knowledgeable and those who were ignorant those who were ignorant cannot be punished how can you punish someone who does not know this would would not be fair you punish people once they know yet they still continue to do the wrong Acts or their sins so the prophet Alam brought that man and the man was sort of scared because everybody was looking at him and he saw what they did to the spot that he was urinating in so he figured out that I've done something wrong but why are these people so hostile against me so the prophet Alam brought the man and said to him my friend these masjids were not made for such filth for answering the call of nature they were built for prayers for remembering Allah and for reciting the Quran so the prophet Alam indicated to him his mistake in a very eloquent and beautiful way to the extent that this man when he joined prayer with the prophet Alat wasam he raised his hands and everyone heard this he said oh Allah have mercy and forgiveness over me and over Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam and do not have mercy on anyone else he went really overboard he was touched by the way of the teaching of the Prophet Alam and his tolerance and mercy so he asked Allah for forgiveness and his Mercy only to be included him and the prophet Alam and the other hostile companions he does not want them to be included the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam smiled and said to him my friend you had made something that is really vast and huge to be limited and that is the mercy of Allah the mercy of Allah is not yours and mine so don't deprive it from others share it with others as long as this is permissible now this was the way of the Prophet Alat wasam in teaching people there are so many stories however if a person is not knowledgeable then the prophet Alam in some cases would be a little bit rough so that they can learn Abu alari once had a feud with bil Rah they had an argument it was heated then Abu lost it so he pointed at Bilal and said you are a son of a black woman B did not reply he went to the prophet alaih and told him Abu said so and so bearing in mind that Abu was one of the first to embrace Islam and when he migrated and came to Mecca before the migration to Medina he asked about the prophet Alat wasam and the people of Mecca knew that he wanted to accept Islam so they beated him like crazy until they left him for dead and he was covered with blood and it's a long story so he was among the first to accept Islam when the prophet heard what he had said to bil he called him and when he came he said to him Abu you are a man of ignorance and bil and and Abu was not young man he was quite old and he had his president in Islam so he said oh prophet of Allah after all these years I'm a man of ignorance he said yes you said this and this and this and he taught him but in a a way that can be graded as a little bit rough because he was a close companion and what he had done was unjust and unfair and he had knowledge Abu darar went to Bilal and by the way Bilal bilal's mother was not blonde with blue eyes B mother's was black so he didn't say a lie but the way it was said to him was to degrade him or to look down at him so he went to bil put his face on the ground and said oh son of a black woman put your foot on my cheek so he's is humiliating himself as a form of asking for forgiveness from his brother Bal but this time he's telling him that you are a a son of a black woman not as a form of humiliation but rather as a form of showing that you are more proud and more honorable than me put your foot on my cheek while my face is on the ground and B said may Allah forgive you my brother stand up may Allah forgive you in another instance and this was reported in Muslim or two incidents if there is time the prophet Alam saw a man wearing a golden ring so he came to the man he did not ask him to give him the ring as usual he immediately went to the ring and took it off and tossed it on the ground and said angerly why would someone take a stone of fire and put it in his hand and he left now this was really rough and tough for the companions to hear so they told his companion go and pick your ring and sell it or give it to your wife and the companion said by Allah I would not take something that the prophet Alam had tossed away and finally just before the break and if you have any questions the lines will be open inshallah after the break finally a man and this is in s Muslim was eating with his left hand and the prophet Alam saw that so he told him eat with your right because we know that eating and drinking is prohibited using the left hand the man out of arrogance he's knowledgeable he said I can't meaning that my right hand I cannot use it the prophet Alam was giving Revelation from from Allah that this man is a liar and most likely he's a hypocrite he can use his right hand but this is arrogance so the prophet Alam prayed to Allah and said to him may you not be able to use your hand and the Hadith says that the man right hand was paralyzed because he was lying and he was defiant so generally speaking the prophet Alam would always use tolerant ways and kind ways of advising and teaching his companions but there are incidents when they're knowledgeable or arrogant or uh trying to do something that he would deal with them in a different way we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back alayum and welcome back we have um Alia from Saudi uh uham alikum sh uh Sheik I have two questions yes uh my husband uh brother he working with a less pay in India but still he cannot fulfill his house needs example like uh his school his Children's School pay and Etc so my husband he sent every month 5,000 rupees in his account and he informed him that this is zakat amount also actually we are giving more it includes zaka amount also so my husband want to know is this permissible or not okay is this the money from this year's zaka or from next year's zaka this year this uh this year okay I will every month we are giving to him okay question number two question number two is if a glass if a glass of a Zam zum uh water pour in a big pot with a plain water as the full pot uh so this full water will be known as a zum water okay I will answer you inshallah okay Salah from qar yeah hello she yes sir yes I want to know what's your opinion about those who destroyed the graves of baki and what is the difference between them and the Isis who are now destroying the the graves and destroying the holy places what's your opinion about that about them what holy places holy Place Serge Graves what Graves where where are the graves graves in h holy shines graves in Iraq graves in Syria such as pal City so it's holy uh places for Muslims or for non-muslims for Muslims in in my opinion for Muslims okay I've I've never heard anything like this but I will try inshallah to comment on it thank you sh thank is from Saudi asalam alikum this is Sister AIA yes sh um there is a in WhatsApp in uddu speaking uh group uh this is circulating for a long time there is a DI in Saudi Arabia and jeda Dr M bux maybe you must be knowing him and he and his followers they are saying uh Dr Bal Phillips brother Nan Al Khan Sheik M she Yu Estes and they all not on the right AA and so not to listen to their lectures and not to follow them I mean it is so confusing and whenever we hear this lectures and wherever hear nothing wrong AA we hear it and alhamdulillah the lectures come on Huda TV and we have trust in Huda TV but this I just wanted a word from you so that I can give this word this word spreads to those who are listening in this whole world they are blaming is right or wrong okay I will answer you inshallah sister Asia okay before we asked uh answer the questions from yesterday nura from the Emirates says that her husband died um recently may Allah have mercy on him and she is in of um post her um husband's death which is four months and 10 days so can she go to the Masjid for and the answer is no a woman in is not allowed to leave the home except for necessities and going to pray in the Masjid or is not a necessity and she has to stay home and cannot be done except in a Masjid so if she has the intention to do and she knows that she cannot go Allah would reward reward her accordingly for her intention and she says that she has a 2-year-old uh child in in a son in the house this has nothing to do with her she can take care of him and uh um do the usual Abdullah from Saudi Arabia says that we know that we have to feed our slaves of what we eat and clothe them from what we wear does this apply for someone who is working for us like a driver like um a maid for example the answer is no the difference is that a slave you own him so he's part of you and if he dies you inherit him likewise you you own everything that he owns so you should take care of him the one who works for you you give him his wage you give him his salary so he's independent of you but if you are kind to him and you give him something this would be for your good deeds inshallah am me from bahin Hello I have two questions yes uh one question is that my sister-in-law She's suffering from diabetes and the doctor has advised her not to fast so she's asking what fidia is to be given for not fasting and uh secondly will she be when she becomes okay will she have to make up for the Mist fast or she can just forgo those F okay second question she yes uh some people in India when we go to India they come and they tell that we are very poor and we you can give us zakat but we don't know actually whether their financial status is good or bad can we trust their wordss and give them zakat money okay okay I will answer you inshallah brother abdullah's second question was that he lives in jida and he wants to study uh Quran so where to go you have to contact the offices of jalat and they have classes for Quran and for Arabic and also for and they have a number of offices in J alhamdulillah so you will be able to do that inshallah Karim from Saudi Arabia yes sir yes what's your question Karim yes sir sir I want to ask about praying I went to pray at home because outside is very hot especially in D time so is this for me to pray at home sir okay I will answer you inshallah omia from Saudi Arabia she says that her husband sends his brother monthly uh money and he tells him that this is from zakat and her uh uh brother-in-law is truly needy he's poor and he cannot uh uh make ends meat so he needs money to send his children to um school and Etc so he's needy now the problem is that once zakat is due you cannot postpone it what your husband is doing is sending it on installments for 11 months and this is wrong because he's postponing giving the zakat uh on the spot so this year's zaka he should disperse it to the needy immediately with you know 5 days 10 days max difference but to postpone most of it or some of it to until the following Ramadan this is not permissible if he wants to help his brother in such payments he should calculate and anticipate what or estimate what would his zaka be next year of Ramadan so I gave my 10,000 or let's say I give my 60,000 Rupees uh uh zakat today now next Ramadan I anticipate that my zaka would be also 60,000 so every month I give 5,000 to my brother and when Ramadan The Following comes I calculate my assets and my zable money if it is more than 6 I pay the difference if it is less then I consider what was given before as to be a charity inshallah uh we have Hussein from blistan hello yes Hussein hello and to you as well yeah Hussein first of all I wanted to point out about the people who always make calls asking some yeah mute your television and listen to me through the phone questions that doesn't benefit us so we always want we always keep wasting almost five minutes as we all know time is very important what is your question hassin could have benefit people learning in Islam yeah Hussein what is your question tell them that HUD TV we have a okay I think Hussein um did not have a question uh says that zamzam mixing it up with other water would this still be considered Zam Zam it's an issue of dispute I personally think that without the need to do such a thing this is not considered to be zamzam because if here in Jed alhamdulillah even inide Arabia even in the Arab countries you can get bottles of zamzam easily so many people coming for om and taking with them two or three bottles of 20 L each alhamdulillah so this is sufficient and you can get regular supply of that without any problem however it was reported and I'm not sure of the authenticity of such a report that the people of Medina used to get zamzam water to Medina and it was like 3 days journey or so and not only that that when it came to be very little and they could not afford to bring Zam Zam on uh uh off all the time so they used to mix it with normal water and that would be considered to be Z so this is inshallah permissible in case of necessity Salah from is saying that what is the ruling on destroying uh religious sites or uh um sort of antique sites or places of Heritage I asked him are these Islamic sites he said in his opinion they are but to my knowledge there isn't any such sites that are Islamic properly so we have mecah we have Medina we have these are the shrines of Islam sort of to speak we have Mas Kuba for example but if you go to Iraq if you go to Syria and you find places built on tombs this is shik this is not something related to Islam we are ordered to uh uh Dem demolish such places however this is not to be done by any Tom Dick or Harry this has only to be done by the Islamic ruler who was chosen by the vast majority of the Muslims not by self-appointed ruler who lives in a cave and people don't know his origin or where he's about or what are his motives this is not a ruler this is any person could come today and say I am the new khif and he has no Authority no power and no uh uh voting of people and and and a large number of Scholars said had not had not the companions of the Prophet all of them in Medina accepted the nomination of Abu Bakr he would not be chose chosen as a Khalifa If only five or 10 of them chose him he would not be chosen but they all gave him the Pledge of Allegiance and this is what made him an Imam so destroying these places especially if it is filled with gods or uh Buddhist uh um uh statues like the Taliban did in uh B bman I think it's called This is legitimate this is permissible because they had the Reign they had the power they controlled the country and these are Idols that are worshiped so this is permissible and Allah knows best uh Mrs Assam from Pakistan asalamu alikum sheah uh Sheik I would like to ask the first question on behalf of my parents okay um they have monthly saving in an account they have in the bank and this monthly saving is above the nisab level but uh they are giving zakat every Ramadan so what about this money that is being saved in this uh Mony saers account which is above the nisab level do they have to give zakat for it separately other other than the one that they give in Ramadan okay okay and the second question is that what are the names of Allah that we can name a child after without putting up to them ABD like Abdul Rahman and like this okay I will answer you inshallah okay uh Salah from Nigeria uh hello shik uh thanks so much for this very opportunity uh after been reading uh Muhammad Abdul wahab uh text very recently and I'm I have this question but before that I want to say that he has had literal interpretations of the religion because if our Creed is the Creed ofah Salah Salah do you know Arabic yeah I know I been reading it you know he says that if our Creed is a Creed of those good people who preceded us and which came in the book book of God as well as that of his messenger why do you say that inia or ABD wab you know is uh you know are are pure I don't think they're pure enough to represent the pure people and the Salah in the very beginning of this religion and I think on the other hand there's AIA okay sism and GRE philosophy and I think this is what wahab Affiliated groups do and he spoke out too against visiting the grave of the prophet and the celebration for his birthday okay okay Salah I got your your message if it's a message uh send from Saudi and to you as well yes um there my I have two questions um number one um I want a little history about Mida like the year it was built and then who built it okay and then uh number two um I went to theid um when I got to the the IM has finished and he's playing T and then I join inside the T but I made a mistake um I used my is to follow him for the up to four that is when he didum after two I did not doam and then I continue up to four and then I made it as I made my intention that is my what is the your position on this when you joined him did you have the intention of is or of yes yes I I had the intention of so you finished four on your own the two the third and I I follow him all for four but he did you know after I did not do I understand you I will answer okay okay um Asia from Saudi Arabia she says that there is a in jeda and others with him who speak ill about Dr belal Phillips Alan mu is mink YF Estus Etc and they say bad things about them and she says that what is this these people come on Huda TV and are they saying the truth or they're lying and just tarnishing their reputation first of all no one is above the law no one is infallible all these great beautiful diis or students of knowledge or Scholars they're human beings so it is totally unacceptable to be with them 100% whether they're right or whether they're wrong this is UN Islamic we do not take sides so these are you know with the good people and these are the bad people and those you've mentioned were the ugly ones no these are students of knowledge or diis who have a lot of good to present for the ummah and this does not mean they don't have any shortcomings or any things that is not considered to be um correct however we have to be fair and we have to balance things so not everything these people who criticize the DI and the students of knowledge is wrong definitely but the way they use their uh form of advice is totally unacceptable they have to find tune it and at the same time there is a whole bunch of chunk of what they say which is not fair it's just something in their mind but there are things that are correct there are wrong things in what sheh bil Philips says or aim says or Al says or M they're human Yousef Estus is not a god he's not a companion he's human so we have to be fair and judge things as the Quran and the sunah order us to judge them not to turn a blind eye on the things that these people uh uh say or do just because they're famous or known and at the same time not to believe anything that these people say about them because we know that they have their agendas and may Allah guide them they have a lot of good they have a lot of knowledge with them but they have Twisted ways and unfortunately I cannot judge their attentions in intentions this is only for Allah but no matter how many times you advise them you try to clarify to them they can't they can only listen to four or five Al or samah and the rest are all deviant so be fair and do not think that these people are infallible or have no problems at all no they we all do have I mean from bahin says if a patient of diabetes uh cannot fast we have to look into this illness if the doctors say this type of diabetes is ongoing she has to continuously take medication every two or three hours or she has to eat every two or three hours that is insulin is is okay it does not Avid your fasting but if the type of diabetes is that you must eat you cannot fast we ask the doctor doctors is there a chance of recovery after three or four four or five years if they say no this is uh uh terminal this is chronic it will go on until she dies in this case she has to feed a poor person for every day she misses and she can do this after every sunset or she can delay the whole thing until the last day of Ramadan in inid for example and she invites 30 poor people and give food uh to them um but if the doctors say inshallah within four or five years she will be totally recovered and she can fast in this case she must not feed she must wait until she recovers and then she makes up for these days um am me says that when we go back to India a lot of the people come to us and claim to be poor and they want us to give them their our zakat money is it permissible to give us to give them them the answer is that you have to verify because you will get like a gazillion uh uh impostor coming to you claiming to be that uh uh he's needy and this is not logical usually we take people for their face value but unfortunately when you are in a society that is all corrupt and people would claim that they are poor and needy of zakat and you cannot verify no you should not give it to anyone who asks until you check uh uh as much as possible and if he's needy then you should give them Karim says that it is hot and uh is it okay for him to pray in the Masjid as a man who hears the aan the prophet said to the blind man you have to respond I cannot find any excuse for you so if you hear the aan even if it's hot you have to go and pray in the Masjid and to reduce the heat I would not tell you to turn on the AC of of your car but rather I would tell you to remember the heat of Hellfire which is prepared for those who do not fulfill Allah's commands so whenever you remember how hot hell is inshallah you will not find it difficult Mrs Assam from Pakistan says that uh her relatives have a saving account but they don't give zakat on it and this is not permissible any money you own you have to give zakat whether it is a loan you gave to someone or it is stocks you've invested in or it is money saved under the mattress or uh uh it is in your saving account all of this is yours so you have to give zakat every year on it she says what are the names that we can use of Allah asael without using AB there are names that only Allah can be called with such as asman such as uh such as Al such as Allah but there are names that can be used by humans as well for example aliz and we know that in Surah yusu that the woman or actually the house that Yousef was brought up in was owned by and they used to address him by so likewise my name Al this can be given to humans as well without and there are so many such as Kim Etc so there are so many of them Salah from Nigeria um he did not sayam alayum most likely because to him I'm not a Muslim because I'm a ABI and he started bombarding wahabism as if there's something called wahhabism but then he went to IB Tam and I could not actually hear his full statement and the brothers in the control room turned uh um um hang the phone up and because this is not a program for debate it's a question so ask me a quick question and I give you a quick answer what T and and Muhammad Abdul wahab follow is exactly the teaching of the Quran and the Sunnah and those who oppose them cannot be anyone except those who are ra from the Shia or those who are super sufis who believe Allah asael is everywhere uh and they believe in shrines and and Grave worshiping or those who are liberal and do not want Islam to uh uh begin with with so uh may Allah guide him um sendow or I think his name is sendow my handwriting is awful from Saudi Arabia says what's the history of Al Masid I cannot give you such a detailed question and you have I don't even have the information needed for that you have to go into encyclopedias to learn from about it and he says that the Imam uh went into uh finished Isa and went into I missed so I joined him and this is totally legit in the first two raas now your mistake was that when he offered Salam and stood for his first ra of the third so now he's starting a new prayer you stood up with him and you finish your third and fourth following him and this is wrong and this makes your Salat invalid so you have to pray is now again what you had what you should have done was when he offered Salam to stand alone and pray the third and fourth raak on your own not following anyone and then join him in his prayer this is all the time we have until we meet together inshallah on Saturday and blessings of Allah beond a prophet"
