  "transcript": "oh today we have the chapter that deals with adhan and today's hadith has the number of of 154 uh brother fatih will read this hadith for us insha'allah narrated by uthman ibn abi lahaus may allah be pleased with him he said o messenger of allah appoint me as the imam meaning leader of my people and prayers he sallallahu alaihi sallam said you are the imam but you should follow meaning observe the strength of the weakest among them and appoint a mu'even who does not charge for the call of adam in this hadith we have a number of issues that we would like to talk about and explain if possible the first issue was that uthman even belas came to the prophet salaam from which is a tribe of taiv the city of the mountainous city of taif which is approximately an hour or less than an hour drive from uh taif to mecca and mecca as you know is about 404 hours plus a drive from makkah to medina so they came all the way which meant that they've traveled probably for a day and a half until they reached medina they reverted and accepted islam and they wanted to learn and study knowledge uthman even was the youngest of all yet the prophet salallahu instructed his companions to build a small tent in the masjid for them to stay in so that he would see them frequently and they would learn from the prayers now after a while the prophet salla sallam allowed them to go back to their to their families because he felt that they had the need to see their families they felt homesick so he allowed them to go back though he was the youngest yet he was the most of them with knowledge he was quick to learn he was quick to uh keep the quran by heart so he requested the prophet alaihis salatu to appoint him as an imam because of the knowledge that he has and usually this is something that is not preferred in islam it is not preferred in islam to stand out and ask for authority or ask to rule it's not preferred in islam to bring attention to yourself and show off except if you sincerely believe that you are the best of them all and you have others saying and supporting you in this thought that you are the best so you should come forward and lead the prayer or lead the group or be their instructor or guide of course our example in this is prophet joseph may allah peace and blessing be upon him where he says set me over the storehouses of the land i'll indeed guard them as one that knows their importance and this of course when he requested that from the ruler of egypt as you know he was thrown in jail for ten almost about seven to ten years and then when he explained and interpreted the dream that the ruler of egypt saw he took him out of prison because he was imprisoned without any right he was uh unjustly imprisoned simply because he did not accept the call for fornication and to commit adultery with uh the woman of the house that he used to be a slave in so he after he was freed he asked the ruler to put him in charge over the stores or the storehouses of the land because he is worthy of this trust he know he knows what he what he does now this cannot be applied to us generally speaking because there are other hadith where the prophet is salatu says that this ruling position to be a ruler to be a governor to be a prince this is something of a responsibility and it needs our honesty and whoever asks it for himself we do not give it to him and whoever it comes to him without him asking it then allah will support him and allah will give him a help in this regard so in this case uthman is he requested to be the imam because he had more knowledge than his companions what did the prophet saw say no um he agreed maybe he agreed he said you are their imam so he appointed him sallallahu to be their imam and then he told him that you should follow or observe the strength of the weakest among them what does that mean mustafa means that you should look at the person those who you read in prayer and look at the uh strongest among the weak little the strongest one of them around the week what does that mean you should not even get prayer so much so as to burden the people well you should observe the strength of the weakest not the stronger you should observe the strength of the weakest which means that when an imam leads prayer he should not go and join prayer thinking that he is healthy he is strong he is capable of praying for 20 or 30 minutes at one shot he should not do this he should not look at those behind him who are strong and capable who are young and willing to pray as long as it takes he should look at the weakest one of them so if there is a 60 or 70 years old man that is diabetic and has to visit the bathroom every five or ten minutes this tells you that you should keep your prayer as short as possible and this is the sunnah of the prophet now again this is a relative issue because it depends some people would would consider reciting in one rakah to be very long and he will tell you why don't you split these four four ayah and make two in the very beginning at two at the second rakah and of course this is unacceptable one of the shortest surahs in the quran and again some people would say well if you recite a four page surah that would be nice it should be okay with us is average it's not long we consider long to be as 10 or 12 pages now you have to balance things up in the sense of in fajr of friday prayer of of the day friday every fajr on friday what does the prophet allah recite he is used to reciting two well-known surahs every single fajr during the whole week so every fajr he prays every that is every friday he prays he prays two surahs in that prayer abu malik yes he prays okay he's used to praying surat is and how many pages in total approximately these are approximately five and a half pages almost five and a half pages so this is his habit salam this is his sunna so is it possible that we ask people nowadays in mosques not to follow the sunnah and tell them well there are weak people so you should observe the weakest the weakest one of them is this possible or not what do you think muhammad i didn't know it know what that because if we go like that because most of people their faith are like we see um not powerful so like this they will leave the the prayer what do you think fadic i think the damage will be greater if we do not stop or if we continue eating those two surahs because some people might be ill or have a heart disease or cannot stand up that much and plus that the prophet didn't actually always pray them sometimes he left them and sometimes he committed to them what do you think mustafa yes i think that as long as it's not obligatory to pray with those two surahs then if there are people now especially nowadays uh with people who are very old with very difficult diseases then what do you think uh mustafa i think it's more important to apply the sunnah sometimes i mean like we can go for a friday we can apply it and then another friday we cannot apply it and we can make we can mix between both but not leave it completely what do you think about malik i think it's you know everything is from the sun and the people on friday should be prepared for that even if they're going to sit down you know the older people other people have sickness they can sit down during the prayer but this is sunday i believe it should be done on friday and this is the right and correct answer see the same person that told us not to prolong the prayer to the extent that sick people or old people would find it difficult to follow is the same person that used to recite every single friday fadi the prophet sallam it wasn't his habit to go on and off in friday's praying with with different surahs it is it has been reported that all fridays that the prophet sallam used to pray used to always continue to recite alif now this is his so we should comply we should follow the sunnah as far as those who are tired or cannot stand to to pray that long they have the option of sitting down and if they have to answer the call of nature then they may go and answer the call of nature but we cannot jeopardize the sunnah for their sake now this is only in what in future prayer only on fridays now the other the whole week the all the the the rest of the prayers and yes you may observe uh uh the strength of the weakest of them all and try your best to to act accordingly yes isn't it also a sunnah to read every fajr from almost 60 to 100 verses it is the sunnah but again this sunnah can be abandoned as the it was reported in different uh occasions that the prophet sallam recited which is like six or seven uh uh ayat verses in both raqqa so i'll get back to this point inshaallah just right after the break closing the gap why closing the gap in this programme sheikh yusuf estes and omar dunlup are going to discuss how to bridge the gap between peoples of different cultures and orientations the gap between males and females muslims and non-muslims the east and the west human beings feel like that they're being slighted one way or the other the gap between the youth and the elders the gap between various status in working the work field and education and then trying to provide solutions for these particular problems and welcome back just before the break brother mustafa had a question if you be kind enough to repeat it again yes i was wondering since it's also sunnah to recite from 6200 versus every fudge so so does this actually come does jeopardizing this sunnah is it better than um making having short pairs or well actually you see it's it's a relative issue because what's short in in in maghrib was short and fajr can be long in maghrib so it depends now bearing in mind that reciting from 60 to 100 verses not necessarily that these verses are from al-baqarah or from where you have long verses because if you look at for example you'll find that it's approximately like what 79 80 verses so if you recite it in in fajr this is enough and it's acceptable to all those who pray the the length is is acceptable but you may not jeopardize the sunnah if you can by saying that i'm doing this for the weak people that praying behind me because again you'll find out that there are still people thinking that your prayer is long so you shorten the surah and there are people that say your prayer is long and no matter how you shorten it it's going to be long for someone so you have to have you have to draw the line and say well i'll follow the sunnah in fajr prayer of friday i'll follow the sunnah in all other uh prayers that the prophet sallam was reported to us that he used to pray so and so sure as in in these prayers other than that it's it's flexible you can change that for example what did the prophet saw used to recite during friday prayer and itself sometimes hear it he used to recite this in the first car and the second rakah used to recite russia is there another sunnah or that's all there is another sunnah the prophet saw sallam used to recite on friday also sometimes he used to uh in the first record i used to pray with al-jumaa so he either does this or does that so this is the sunnah of the prophet one should maintain it and and try to uh preserve it by doing it and applying it now if we go back to uh the hadith of uthman ibn abilis so he told him that you should observe the the strength of the weakest among those who are praying behind you and then he asked him or instructed him to appoint muadvin who does not charge for the call of adan and this is an issue that's a a place of controversy because does this mean that if a then calls for the event he may not charge money for that the hadith says you shouldn't appoint someone who takes money who charges for calling the adhan and this could go a little bit bigger so what about appointing an imam and paying him a salary and then again what about appointing a person that teaches the quran and he takes money for that and what about this and that and that and it all depends on few factors first of all is it okay for ramu advent to take charge for it for what's what he's doing uh mustafa i think he can take charge but not for the event he can take charge for the time that he spends because it's like it's like in economics time uh is what creates money time for his time but not for that okay this this rule of economy of economics you know one-on-one uh i just i disagree with it because on the surface yes it's it sounds good as a islamic point of view time does not create money it's allah azza that creates money so i do not associate risk with time or effort though there are means to reach for this risk for this money but it is allah that creates it nevertheless going back to what you have said this is what the scholars say that for the event itself it's a form of worship so you may not charge for that for that because you're supposed to be doing it for allah azzawajal but if a person does not have anything to do except then because to stick and stay in a mosque five times a day a night this requires that you do not have any other job otherwise it would conflict with your working hours with your own interest so they say that if a person solely gives all his of his time to the masjid then there's nothing wrong in him charging money so that he wouldn't have to go out and work and this becomes his occupation this comes becomes his job but the money he's taking is not for the advan meaning that well if you give me 2 000 i'll i'll make that then for five prayers you give me 1800 i'll skip one prayer now it doesn't go this way and likewise for the imam the imam may charge money depending that he has no other income now if an imam has an income or other has an income but someone volunteers like the government or the owner of the mosque and telling him that listen i'm giving you 2 000 3 000 for what you're doing and he did not request it there's nothing wrong in that but the wrong thing is when you start bargaining to bargain about the owner of the mosque because you know he is a rich person he tells you i'm going to give you three thousand and you say well i know this mosque they offered me five thousand it becomes an issue of bargaining this is not recommendable does anybody know where a hadith that allows us to take money for teaching the quran or for doing something that is for the quran there's a very famous hadith yes no i have read that uh rasulullah said the best salaries that somebody take is when he teach al-quran that's true do you know the origin of this hadith the origin of this hadith that a group of companions were traveling and they visited a non-muslim village and they requested food because they didn't have any food so they obeyed they refused them food they kicked them out say go away we have no we don't have any food and this is bad for arabs you know arabs are known to be generous so whenever anyone comes to them they feed them because this is type of their customs it doesn't have to do with religion so they left away they went away and minutes later the tri their tribesmen the the leader of the tribe one of the tribesmen was uh uh bit or was stung by a scorpion so they came to the muslims and said well our leader now is ill from this poison so does any one of you know how to make rupiah does anyone know how to recite special words that cure cure him so one of them said yes i i know how to do this but i will not do it free of charge because you've requested food from you and you didn't refused us food so you want me to recite something that would cure this sick person you have to give us uh money so they agreed to give them a number of sheep let's say 10 15 heads of sheep so the guy went in and started to recite al-fatiha chapter number one and he started reciting it over and over and blowing not spitting blowing at the the man and subhanallah in minutes he was standing as if nothing happened to him so the companions went back and wanted to take from this food from this sheep and eat so their leader said we should not touch anything until we go back to medina and ask for permission so they went to medina and told the prophet sallam that what happened with them so the prophet told him told him how did you know that it is that's great it's good news it is rakia and they told him what about the food we had taken what about the money that they have given us for what we have recited so the prophet said the best thing to take money for is the quran because you taught the quran it's the most valuable thing to so and he approved it and and they gave him a share of it so it's okay to take a money or charge for teaching the quran uh the last thing or was this the last thing yeah this was the last thing uh in uh the hadith of uthman even the following hadith hadith number 156 55 narrated by malik the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said to us when the time of prayer comes one of you should announce the event okay now malik a companion of the prophet allah was accompanied by some of his companions and they were traveling so again the prophet gives the usual instructions and the usual advice so i told him that when time comes when the time for prayer comes one of you should make the evan and again you recall uh fadi what is the ruling on adhan it is mandatory we have to do we have to do it is that true mustafa only a group of people have to do it so it's not mandatory on all because otherwise every one of us when it's time for prayer would go and make a van no it's mandatory on a group of people if they do it then it's okay for the whole community but if they all refrain from doing it then they are all sinful and this is the case with the prophet alaihis allah that whenever he visited or actually whenever he went to wage war on a tribe or on a village he asked his companions not to wage war until after fajr prayer and he ordered them that wait until you hear the adhan if you hear that then refrain they are muslims but if you don't hear that then go ahead and attack because they are not muslims and again it is not permissible for the adhan to be called by a non-muslim because it's a form of worship and this is ridiculing our religion if you allow a non-muslim no matter how beautiful his voice is he may not call the evan it's it's a ritual it's a form of worship and again the then has to be on time which means that if a person calls for the event before the before it's time then the prayer is unacceptable you may not pray if you didn't know and you prayed then the burden falls on the person who called the adhan i'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program so until we meet next time wassalamualaikum warahmatullahi"
