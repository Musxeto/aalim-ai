  "transcript": "I'm entertained with all of your answers, even the question is so random and absurd. I'm sure we all agree that your question is so fast but funny. My question is simple. How could you find a funny answer so fast? So, maybe if there is one of us in the future become a lecturer, I think we could be a lecturer that funny. So, the jamanah would mix up when we lecture, they find it so easy to remember. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu. I don't know. This is not something I train or work for. You know, comedians, stand-up comedians and rappers, they will sit and write scenarios and write scripts. Okay, someone asked me like this. I don't do this. It is all from what Allah opens. And I don't do this purposely. And I'm getting really agitated when people come and say, Oh Sheikh, we like your humor, we like your funny jokes. And I say, SubhanAllah, one hour program of AskZad. Serious questions and halal, haram, divorce, whispers of shirk and go to hell. You leave all of this and you say, Sheikh, I'm your biggest fan. May Allah promote you to be an air conditioner. And you take this and you make one million, two million views. What about the ilm? What about the Quran? What about the sunnah? No, no, no, Sheikh, this is good, good. But this one, wallahi. I don't do this. Now, some shuyukh came to me. And they were very angry. They said, Sheikh, you're disrespecting knowledge. Because this is, you're in the masjid, everybody's laughing. Sometimes, even in lectures, there are women. And women's laughter is not appreciated in Islam. So, Sheikh, you should stop. What do I say to them? Tough bananas. Tough luck. I'm not going to stop. This is who I am. You want me to give you da'wah? I give you da'wah, the full package. I will not pretend to be an honorable, dignified Sheikh. Astaghfirullah, astaghfirullah. I cannot do this. This is not me. You like me as I am? Alhamdulillah. You don't like me? I have no problem. So, again, these answers come from Allah, azza wa jal. Maybe because I'm from Sumatra. I don't know. I don't know. Nothing, I don't know. They tell me I'm from Sumatra. I don't know if Sumatra or Java. It's all the same. Inshallah, azza wa jal, you try your level best to have sincerity, to have ikhlas, and whatever Allah, azza wa jal, opens for you, for your da'wah, for your work, for your teaching, Allah will make it stay, inshallah, and people will benefit."
