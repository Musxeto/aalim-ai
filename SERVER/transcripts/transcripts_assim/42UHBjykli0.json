  "title": "Must I BLOW nose or spit water from mouth in Ghusl or Wudu for it to be valid? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Qul Hathihi Sabeeli Adu'oo Ila Allah You're going to suffocate and drown. This is not natural. When you pull the water up your nostrils, what are you going to do? Can you breathe from your mouth and keep the water there? This is not logical. If you were to say to me, if I rinse my mouth and I don't spit the water, rather I swallow it, would that be valid or not? This is an issue of dispute. But to pull the water up your nostrils, and then what? You have to blow your nose, you have to get it out, or you're going to probably suffocate or drown or something bad is going to happen to you. So yes, you have to blow it out because this is the way of the Prophet ﷺ. The Prophet ﷺ used to do this. He never rinsed his mouth and nose and kept the water there. He never rinsed his mouth and did not spit it. And people say, okay, we're rinsing our mouths and we're swallowing it. This is called drinking, not rinsing your mouth. You have to rinse your mouth and spit it out, and Allah knows best. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days. And bi-idhnillah, azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
