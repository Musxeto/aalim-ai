  "transcript": "in her locality there are people who claim that they have bits and pieces of the hair of the prophet alayhi salatu salam and they claim that they have inherited it from their forefathers etc unfortunately we don't have any evidence of such authentic hair of the Prophet as I'm reaching them so as far as we know any Tom Dick or Harry can come bring the piece of hair from any barber shop and claim that this is the Prophet sorry sauce cinnamon and due to this and due to the enormous amount of lying among the Muslims nowadays therefore we cannot count or rely on the credibility of this being related to the prophet sallallaahu Selim and Allah knows best"
