  "title": "Is agreeing to Late Payments make me sinful of Riba? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Majid from Saudi. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. Sheikh I have a question and a request. May I start with the question first? Yes sir. So sir there are finance companies that pay on behalf of the consumer to the supplier to the trader at full price okay so they get their payments on installments from the consumer you know like three or four times and they charge a late fee payment they say that this is no this is not interest this is just a late fee payment so I believe this is the river okay but if this is the river the person who agrees on the terms even if he has a lot of money agreeing on the terms itself even if he can assure them that he'll pay is he even sinful or not this is my question as for your question Akhi these financial institutions they have no right in what they're doing because who are you buying from are you buying it from the dealer or from the financial institution the financial institution does not own this product I bought this mug because I want to buy it so who sold it to me if you say the dealer then I should deal with the dealer and give him the money if you say no you bought it from the financial institution or the bank or the company that is like a loan shark and in this case they do not possess this merchandise so how can I buy something from them that they do not possess beside the fact that if I'm giving them their payment in installments and we've agreed upon a hundred euros and they say if you are late then you have to pay us an extra euro and this is late payment fee agreeing on it is agreeing on riba it's like saying if you're one month late and you know that you're not going to be late you allow us to rape your sister and he said okay I have lots of money I know I'm not going to be late can you sign something like that approving and endorsing a major sin of course not so definitely this is not permissible now some companies may try to find a loophole by saying okay the late payment we're not going to take it for ourselves we're going to give it for charity still it is considered to be riba"
