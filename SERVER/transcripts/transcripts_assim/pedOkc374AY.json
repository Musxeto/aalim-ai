  "transcript": "all right time for a lot uh is it mandatory for me to say uh if I'm praising someone uh as a monthly for me today uh well let's see how Allah people and if I still try if one feels shy of saying this uh is he a couple okay first of all is it mandatory the answer is no but it is highly recommended because this would prevent you from saying something without knowledge and that's why you're relating this knowledge to Allah azzawajal Allah is more knowledgeable of him when I praise someone I say brother so-and-so he's an excellent brother he's a trustworthy brother I wouldn't give such a testimony without saying Allah is his witness and I don't praise him over Allah's in the sense that without relating this to Allah's knowledge but if I did not say that I wouldn't be sinful in sha Allah but I would be doing something macro now if I'm shy of saying it would that take me out of the fold of Islam of course not over and over again we say that Islam is not an easy thing that you can come in and come out of as simple as that so many people are intimidated are frightened by the concept that they might leave the fold of Islam so whatever happens they think oh did I say something that I became a kaffir is this shirk is this kuffer and shaytan works them really bad such overthinking is one of the ways of shaytan of derailing us and diverting us from the straight path which we have to avoid and Allah Knows Best"
