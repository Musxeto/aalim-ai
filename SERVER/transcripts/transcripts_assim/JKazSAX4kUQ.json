  "transcript": "We have Ibrahim on the line from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu. Sheikh recently I heard something like calamities only happen to a person because of sins and they only leave through repentance. I was under the assumption sometimes it happens for sins sometimes it's like a test. Can you like explain? This is true. Calamities can be attributed to one of the two. Either they are a form of cleaning and cleansing a person from his sins. Allah says no calamity befalls upon you except due to what your hands have earned and Allah Azza Wa Jal forgives a lot. So this is one of the reasons. The other is it's a form of test and elevating the servant's level at the side of Allah Azza Wa Jal. As per the hadith of Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud, may Allah be pleased with him, when he visited the Prophet Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam and placing his hand over his chest when the Prophet was ill and he said, oh Prophet of Allah we speak that you get sick as two of us would get sick. It's doubled and the Prophet said yes. The most tested through calamities are the Prophets, then the righteous, then those below them depending on the strength of their Iman. The more a person is strong in his belief, the more the calamity and the test is upon him. So this is how it is in Islam. Whatever happens to me, I attribute this to my sins. Hypothetically if I was sinless, I would still not argue or complain, rather say Alhamdulillah it's a test from Allah and I pray to Allah that He grants me and you Al-Afiyah and that He protects us from such tests. But we have no other choice but to be patient and tolerant and Allah Azza Wa Jal knows best."
