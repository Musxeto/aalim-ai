  "title": "A True Hypocrite",
  "transcript": "Knowledge, because if you speak to them by saying, oh Sheikh, Islam said so and so, Ibn Qayyim said so and so, they shrug their shoulders and say, we have half a dozen of other scholars who say differently and they come cheaper by the dozen. So your scholars against or versus our scholars. Let's see who wins. This wouldn't work. Rather go back to the Qur'an, to Allah's word. This is something no one can argue, though there are some hypocrites who would argue when you show them a verse from the Qur'an or an authentic hadith or hadiths, overwhelming proofs and evidences. They would have the audacity to say, yes, but is it possible that our scholars did not know about this or do not know about this? So they blind follow their scholars and reject the Qur'an and the Sunnah. This is true hypocrisy, total hypocrisy. Deep down inside they're not Muslims. When you show them what Allah said and the Prophet Muhammad said and they acknowledge but they reject on the basis that their scholars know better, where is Islam? It's nowhere to be found with them. you"
