  "transcript": "Muhammad from India Shake is music a minor SC or a major SC don't look at the size of the sin see people when they ask such questions why are they asking this question to fear Allah more of course not they are following Shan's traps in diluting the Sin so one says to me she uh is doing heroin worse or drinking a pint of beer or a pint of loger I said of course drinking a logger is much less than uh uh doing heroin okay thank you and he gets a Guinness what is this someone says what is worse she fornicating or committing sodomy what kind of mentality is this so this is why people ask which is bigger is it a major sin or a minor sin if you tell them it's a minor sin much obliged why so minor sin is easy Allah May forgive may we do this we it's all forgiven so this is not the right way of looking at things the right way is to ask it's not the size of the sin the sin that matters it is who you're disobeying and sinning against that what counts"
