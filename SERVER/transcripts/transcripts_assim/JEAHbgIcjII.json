  "transcript": "Sidi from Germany. Sheikh, if someone is making da'wah to some \nof his family or his friends or someone else,   and he is advising them, reminding them, warn \nthem from the punishment of Allah Azza wa Jal, but   these people they respond that it is none of \nhis business, or they respond that it is between   them and Allah. How should we respond to their \nresponse? By simply saying okay and stopping.   See you are not obliged in Islam to \nshove things down people's throats.   You can always lead a horse to the river. You can \nnever force the horse to drink. Allah says in the   Quran [ ]. It is not up to you Muhammad, peace be \nupon him, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, to guide   people, rather guidance is in the hands of Allah. \nSo all what you can do is present your case.   Give them advice, remind them of Allah, show them \nan ayah, show them a hadith. If they are defiant,   if they are not inclined to listen, \nand they don't want to listen,   quote unquote, the hell with them! I \ndid my duty and I tried my level best to   bring them closer to Allah and they don't want \nto. I would utilize my time and effort with other   people who would listen. So if I did this with \nall of my family and they don't want to listen,   I'll go somewhere else. I go to the neighbors, I \ngo to the masjid next door, I go to the community,   I go online, I'd utilize my time with people who \nare thirsty for truth and knowledge, rather than   these ignorant imbeciles who are so indulged in \nthese swamps of worldly matters, all what they   care about is their desires and lusts and gaining \nmoney. Let them be! I did my due diligence, I did   my level best to call them with fair preaching \nand wisdom. They don't want to listen. So should I   force them under gunpoint? Of course \nnot. So let them be and move on."
