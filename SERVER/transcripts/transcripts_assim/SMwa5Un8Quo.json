  "transcript": "I know that most Scholars are of the opinion that if you are on and off with prayer you are still a Muslim yesterday I missed prayers and I got so panicked and scared because I didn't pray them I'm convinced of my faith and I'm a practicing muslima alhamdulillah I'm not a cafir but I'm afraid that I have left Islam and my marriage is invalid because of the other opinion what should I do you should slap your yourself once or twice to wake up from your delusions and abandon Shan's Whispering if you are of this sound mentality knowing how to present your case and knowing the majority of Scholars say that you're not cafir and you're still insisting on being a cafir only to destroy your marriage you have a problem you're a whacko and this is not the first time you keep on asking the same time privately on the phone on Twitter on uh a live tv as if you just have a death wish if you want to divorce your husband go ahead so no no no she I don't want to I love him you're either lying or you're a wacko look what Shan is doing to you take a good look in the mirror just stand in the mirror and look and see how Shan is in the background laughing in his head off because no one in his right mind would do such things and keep on asking is my marriage valid oh when I got married I didn't actually know the meaning of so am I Muslim one of the witnesses was this and that so is my marriage valid I don't know about my guardian my father he was not praying at the time or he said a joke that may have nullified his Islam is my marriage valid and you keep on asking these questions you need someone to give you a good whipping so that these demons would go away and you would concentrate on what gets you closer to Allah because you're diverting way off track and Allah is angry with you if you don't want ask for let your husband get a second new wife younger more beautiful more righteous and more sane that would fill his life with comfort and he instead of asking these questions every now and then may Allah Asel purify your head from such Whispers of demons and return you back to your sanity"
