  "transcript": "Kahn says we are two sisters with one elder brother parents want to distribute the property property as per Sharia my parents wish to sell all the property and distribute the cash but my brother wants a piece of the land that is a farm and not the cash parents don't want to change their mind are my parents right if they don't give that piece of land but sell and give cash instead I am shocked by the audacity of not necessarily your question yes me but of the position of your brother whose wealth is it whose property is it it's your parents does anyone have any control over what they decide to do with their own cash or own property of course not so if they decide to sell everything they have and give it to hooda TV or build an institution for Dawa a school MSU or buy a big building and make it an endowment what whatever comes every year from the rent is given to Islamic conferences worldwide can any one of your daughters or your brother object to that of course not this is my hard-earned money you have no right in it after I die if I leave something you may inherit it but while I'm alive you insist on in hurting me I would Allah what kind of children are these so the answer is your brother has no right in objecting on the contrary he should be grateful that his parents are giving him something now rather than late wait until they die and Allah knows when that would be why does he insist on having the property because he knows that he'll get it off them cheap so if they sell it they're gonna sell it for X amount of money and then distribute the money but if they give it away they will not give it away as if it is a hundred thousand they would give it away as if it is eighty thousand or seventy thousand worth and he makes more he should be ashamed of himself take the money they give you without any questions and then you want to buy another property up by a farm it's up to you but you cannot object to them when they're doing something out of their own goodwill as if this is your god-given right"
