  "title": "Can a woman pray with her feet uncovered? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "muhammad from bangladesh he says is there any hadith stating that a woman can uncover her foot or her feet and i think he's referring to salat this is an issue of dispute the hanafi school of thought say that it's okay to pray while exposing a woman's foot up to the ankles and some scholars agree to that and we follow the safest opinion which was given to us by the prophet sasam when he told us that a woman's body in salat is all our except her face and her hands and all the schools of thought agree on this when it comes to the technicality of her praying in home some like the hanafi school of thought and also others say that this is exempted this is permissible because their attire at homes was not always covering their feet but this is a logical explanation not a technical backed up with evidence explanation and therefore to be safe is far better than being shori and and the problem is that these people who permit her to pray with her feet uncovered they even go an extra mile and say okay she can also go out with her feet uncovered and mahrez can look at her feet and this has no limits until where exactly only the ankles what about if it's like a couple of inches above what if it's half of the leg and we end up in what we see and this is not the right thing to do awesome you"
