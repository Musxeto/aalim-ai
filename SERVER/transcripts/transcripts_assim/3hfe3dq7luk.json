  "transcript": "his third question was some people say listening to music is not haram unless you are enjoying it so unless you're tapping on the steering wheel while driving or you're beating with your foot uh when you're listening to music or you're dancing and enjoying it this is haram but if you listen to beethoven while having dinner then this is okay subhanallah who said it's okay so because you're not being influenced to it okay then why not have during having dinner a glass of red wine 1986 for example a good year why not i'm not going to get intoxicated i'm just going to drink a little bit oh no wine is haram why irrespective it's haram and likewise music irrespective whether it touches your heart it makes you this or that it is totally prohibited and giving such justifications is playing around with islam something that is haram end of story don't give justifications to it that are not mentioned in the quran"
