  "title": "She secretly wears Niqab & hides from her parents, people ask if she is OPPRESSED? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Medina from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Walaikumussalam So my friend wears niqab secretly because her parents probably wouldn't allow it. But like yesterday the mother informed my friend that someone asked the mother if my friend is oppressed. So the mother probably knows, kind of, that she's probably wearing the niqab or something weird is going on. And now my friend is a little bit confused. She doesn't know if she should continue to wear the niqab the way she does it. Or should she just wear a mask? Or if she should tell her parents? And, you know, I don't know. This person who asked your friend's mother, what is he? She was like a bit like, I don't know how you say, in the library, like a woman. Yeah, but she's not a social worker. She's not the police. So it doesn't matter. Let your friend continue to wear the niqab. And if someone asks her, are you oppressed? She says, no, I'm doing it by my own free will. My parents don't want me to wear it and I'm wearing it on my own will. What is it to you? It's none of your business. So, subhanAllah, why would people interfere and poke their nose in other people's business? If I wear the niqab, it's my own, not me. If a woman wears a niqab, it's her own choice. Who has the right to say that this is oppression? She's doing it by her own self. She wears a bikini. Nobody's going to complain. Nobody says that this is oppression. So I don't know how these people think. They have some mental illness in their heads. So, yes, she should continue to wear the niqab. And if she's asked, she says, no, I'm not oppressed. I'm doing it with my own free will. And no one could do anything to her, inshaAllah."
