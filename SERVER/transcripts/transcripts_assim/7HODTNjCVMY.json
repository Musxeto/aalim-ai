  "transcript": "says is the biological father of an illegitimate girl mahram for her must she cover herself in front of him not travel with him and not be alone with him as if he's a stranger what about an uh illegitimate son and his biological biological mother as for your question sarah the whole incident is summarized by the hadith of the prophet allah in a long story where he said the born child belongs to the owner of the bed which means that if the woman was married then the owner of the bed is the husband so the illegitimate child belongs by default to her husband this is the default and to the fornicator the man who is allegedly the biological father gets nothing except a stone meaning nothing he has nothing to do with the illegitimate child even if he claims the child and says it's mine so from this hadith and other evidences scholars said that if a man fornicated with a woman and she does not have a husband so she's a single lady and she conceived and she gave birth to a child and assuming that the child was a girl the man is not the father of the girl because it was born out of wedlock which means that he does not have any responsibilities towards her she has no responsibilities towards him his siblings are not her uncles and aunts his children from a legitimate marriage are not her siblings because there is no relationship there is no bond between him and her you may make a dna test this doesn't change a thing because this is related to an islamic ruling which is whether the marriage was legitimately islamic or not hence there was no marriage then there is no relationship between them now having said that this does not mean that his legitimate son can marry her because of this incident is in a gray area and in the story that i told you about which is long i could not say it here the prophet salallahu salaam said to abd ibn zema who was claiming his brother against who said to the prophet isaiah may i be pleased with him that his brother fornicated and claimed to be the father of that child who abd claims is my brother he was born in my house and my father was alive and all of the the the evidences show that he is my brother when the prophet alaihis al-assam said the hadith he deprived sad's brother from his right in that child he says no you have nothing to do with the child and he called the child he is his brother but when the prophet saw the resemblance of the child to sad's brother the one who fornicated the fornicator he said to his wife sauda bin zema who this child is now legally her brother his name is exactly like her name the same father zema so the prophet said to his wife sauda wear the hijab from him though he's your brother technically speaking but you should not display yourself to him as you do to your brothers and to your mahrams so from this hadith we understand that the biological father has no rights over his daughter that was born out of wedlike a wedlock no responsibilities but at the same time this doesn't mean he can marry her now having said that it is highly recommended that he's kind to her that he supports her that he provides for her but this is out of kindness not out of islamic ruling as for her second part of the question what about if an illegitimate son and his biological mother i need i think that this is a no-brainer because she is his mother she's the one who gave birth to him whether he was conceived out of wedlock or a legitimate marriage doesn't make any difference because she is the one who gave birth to him so he is her son"
