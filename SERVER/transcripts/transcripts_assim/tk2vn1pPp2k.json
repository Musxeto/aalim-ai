  "title": "Can the Imam Pray at Home & then Go and Lead Salah in the Masjid?",
  "transcript": "arik and he says if the authority of the mosque sets the time for prayer late that is after 50 of the prayer time has gone can the imam pray at home in the beginning of the time and go and lead prayer in the masjid now this request of the imam is very awkward and weird he is appointed to lead the prayer and the prayer is established at its prescribed time so if there is a beginning and there is an end and the authority of the masjid decided to put the ikarma to be in the middle so it's not at the beginning of the time why would the imam pray alone defying the obligation of praying in congregation in the masjid and then come out to lead the congregation who is doing it as a fart prayer and he is doing it for himself as voluntary there is no justification for that and the action of such an imam would indicate that his knowledge is not sufficient to be an imam we know that it is best to pray the prayers at the beginning of their time and this goes for fajr prayer asar prayer and maghrib prayer as for lord prayer it is recommended when it is in the middle of the heat of the summer to delay it so that the weather is colder and it would be easier for people to attend the prayer nowadays with air conditioning and cars etc this may not be the case and praying at the beginning of the time would be similar if not better than praying at the end of the time due to air conditioning as for isha prayer the sunnah is to delay it until the first third of the night is gone and we can pray it until the middle of the night not be after that but this depends on the convenience of the congregation and in 99.9 of the cases people would like to pray asia at the beginning of the time so the authorities of the masjid should look into the welfare of the worshippers they may decide to set the time of prayer for luhr for example at the middle of the time because it's convenient for their working hours so if the prayer time is at 12 15 and they make the akama at one o'clock 1 30 due to lunch hour where the people come and get to their homes and have lunch and have time to pray and go back to work that is convenient there is nothing wrong in that in sha allahu azza you"
