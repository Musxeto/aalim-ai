  "transcript": "foreign as i said before we have to remember allah 24 7. and every muslim knows that part of remembering allah azzawajal is to say your eth car before you leave the house because you need protection so what are the car to be said before leaving the house there are many of them the most famous one bismillah in the name of allah again bismillah i depend and rely on allah azzawajal and there is no might nor power except with allah what do you think a person who says such vikar before leaving with full conviction that allah is his protector what is he going to do how is he going to perform is he going to sin do i say this dua before going to the bar or to the nightclub or to the pub this is a vicar that is said by a person who is in total compliance with islam what else the following is you seek refuge in allah from going astray from slipping from having any injustice upon others from being ignorant to others and from others reciprocating setting you astray from uh uh oppressing you or making you slip or making others slip or having people oppressing you or having people being ignorant to you when you say this with conviction in you driving and someone does something inappropriate to you you would never gesture them you would never shout or curse them you would never retaliate and try to cross uh in front of them maybe causing an accident you always remember ah i said this dua and this vikar and allah is guiding me and protecting me this is what we say when we leave our homes trusting only allah depending only on allah having total reliance only on allah azzawajal when we come back what do we say this is a dua that is one of the duas or diker in the fortress of muslim which is not authentic why would the shaykh may allah have mercy on his soul included in his book if it's not authentic simply because sheikh al-bani authenticated it in the very beginning then came to find out that it was not authentic so he graded it as weak while sheikh bin bas who is the sheikh of may allah have mercy and soul used to grade it as hassan which is accepted so either way if you follow the authentication of sheikh al-bani then you should not say this the scholars say uh is not authentic and if you accept sheikh bimbas authentication there's no problem in accepting it and in saying it as well so i came into my house i left my house saying the duas what about if i go to the masjid there are a number of beautiful du'as that the prophet used to say alaihis salat was upon going to the masjid among them is this long dua allah [Music] it revolves upon light asking allah to put in my heart light my tongue in my hearing in my sight above me underneath me to my right and left and in front of me and behind me to have this light in everything in my life in my body in my hair everywhere even in my grave in my bones and asking allah to increase in this light over and over and over again what light are we talking about this is not something that we're asking allah to illuminate us in darkness rather it's the light of guidance it's the light of worship the light in my eyes so that i would not see except what pleases allah the light in my hearing is that i would not hear except what pleases allah so in a sense i'm asking allah azzawajal to protect me and to give me guidance and to guide me to worshiping him as pleases him subhanahu wa this is on my way going to the masjid if i were to enter the masjid i would say [Music] bismillah the the the evil of satan but i seek refuge in allah azzawajal and in in his honorable face and in his authority from satan all of these things i'm seeking refugee from satan then what do i do i say bismillah before entering the message with my right foot and i offer salutation upon the prophet allah and i invoke allah o allah open the gates of your mercy for me what gates of mercy i'm entering the masjid so i am asking allah azzawajal to facilitate the mercies of allah subhanahu ta'ala through my entering the masjid and once i'm in the masjid the clock is ticking and i'm getting all the good deeds coming to me with the grace of allah because i've requested allah to open the gates of mercy what about if i'm leaving the masjid well there's another dua bismillah wasallam prophet allah and then i say oh allah i ask you from your favors i'm asking you from your favor oh allah guard me from the accursed devil in the entrance i said open the gates of mercy coming out i'm asking allah for his favor and to guard me from satan why because now i'm leaving behind me the masjid a garden of heaven and i'm entering to this dunya with all its temptations and sins and things that may distance me from allah azzawajal and from the hereafter so i'm seeking refuge in allah subhanahu wa tahala this is all the time we have until we meet next time i leave you for allah [Music] foreign"
