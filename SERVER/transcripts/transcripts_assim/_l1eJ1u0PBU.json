  "transcript": "now I think we will conclude Hashanah in this session I don't think we will go to session three the material is almost we are almost there but we will see what happens in Shaba now in yesterday's sessions and today we reached a conclusion how folk had developed since the very beginning of the revelation of the Prophet to the prophet alaihi salatu salam till the last fourth man happened which is the multiple Imam I met him in Hamburg where do we stand today when we talk about FIP when we talk about jurisprudence and this is a vast area of knowledge where as Muslims do we stand today Feb at the present time is looked upon as follows first of all what differentiates our time from their times is the ease of access to knowledge compared to theirs Imam Ahmed in Hamburg great Imam had to travel the whole Islamic world in order to build up his knowledge and to compile his book Muslim Imam Ahmed well-known reference of hadith nowadays the youngest of us could have not the most not all of the books of hadith that have ever been compiled in his hard drive the access to knowledge is so easy because all the books of folk are published are printed you find with any student of knowledge home or house many bookshelves filled with took of Abu Hanifah over matchup of Imam Shafi Malik the explanation of their detailed books as we have referenced in earlier sessions so this is where we stand today also one of the biggest differences is that we have the establishment of fill assemblies nowadays the problems arising are way different than the problems of the previous Imams we have the rulings of things that did not exist on their times we have IVF people who are unable to have children we have organ donations we have DNA mutilations we have things to do with transactions selling gold simultaneously nowadays people say ok we aren't banks we have money transfers we have credit cards you have debit cards we have different form of transactions when we get into a group to buy an investment or to do this is it a one-man show no so you have to have these assemblies and in these assemblies you don't only get scholars of em you get specialists so when the question comes to me someone says share what is the ruling on cryptocurrency hold on cryptic answer I know Krypton where Superman came from but I don't know their currency so none other sure it's a different character altogether so okay I need experts please so this man comes from with the concept of chain blocks this man comes with the concept of digging for crypto digging and I don't underst the explain explain explain it okay now I can find out halal Haram concept I give you the verdict likewise when someone comes to me talking about d-n-r is it in no no in medical term when you take to the emergency they have the DNR do-not-resuscitate so it's people say 'what's the ruling on that I am over 90 I have health problems and I know that I'm gonna die and it already in 50 years over time I have bonus because the ages of myoma between 60 and 70 so I'm 90 I have heart problems kidney problems everything problems so they request when admitted to hospital to emergency DNR do-not-resuscitate meaning that if you need to plug me in just to keep me alive I don't want this so what's the ruling on this can't see ya take the plug off save electricity save money is too much expenses it's not that easy I have to sit with physicians doctors trustworthy and sick I listen chief he's not a vegetative state he still is conscious he can pray he can live so if we take it we will be killing him I didn't know that or someone who said no this guy no matter what you do he's in a coma he would never wake up his brain is dead so yes the liver the heart kidneys are working but he's a he's like a vegetable so the chef needs to acquire knowledge from experts these assemblies act like this and we are in need of such assemblies because they are not scholars from Saudi Arabia they're not only from Egypt they're from all over the world and the toolbag a biggest assembly nowadays there are so many the biggest is one Organization of Islamic Cooperation known as monothematic Townley slamming usually this is political usually so Yandy would don't take their verdicts as always slams number sometimes they even have Chris since to monitor yeah I mean but it's political then you have the world Muslim that the muslim world league this is Islamic and it was established long ago in Makkah and it's trying its level best to keep politics away though it nowadays is very difficult everything is politicized everything unfortunately and if you're not with this anyhow so we go on to other things that are present nowadays in our film we have felt inside cube encyclopedias and Subhan Allah if Allah Azza WA JAL wants good for you Allah would give you something that he deprives others from the biggest and most influential and most accepted and authentic encyclopedia is the Kuwaiti feck encyclopedia imagine kuwait is how how big no-no is how small what you say how old are you no matter how young yeah but when it comes to Kuwait how big know is how small very small tiny men youth state has a lot of oil very rich but they've utilize their wealth in a number of good things one of them is this encyclopedia that not a single student of knowledge does not use it now it's printed and it's huge but alhamdulillah we have it on soft copy so we have it we can don't even think about different languages again we come to the issue of stabbed map Ron we remember yesterday so don't even come close to languages now Arabic is essential social we are in the Diploma stage what do you advise focus on Arabica this is what fixes your relationship with allah azza wajal meaning if i don't speak Arabic I can't be good Muslim yeah you can but it would be different a lot different when you know the Arabic that comes out of your mouth chef but my accent is not good salman al-farisi was persian his accent was so funny when he speaks though he was among the one who gives fatwa at the time but his accent is funny yet this did not spare and he stopped him from being close to allah azza wajal and one of the greatest scholar companions of the professor so you have to learn Arabic so we have the Kuwaiti flip encyclopedia and we have a soft copy which is not as jam and fill all of these are contemporary 20 not even 20 maybe 15 years or less they find people collecting it putting in a soft copy and giving it for free now imagine that award these people have and the one who came up with the idea of the encyclopedia of course they took like seven eight years to compile and hard work but at the end of the day how much is it cost the cost of one football match inviting Manchester United to over to come yes yet the reward stays from here till the day of judgment if you look at Islam Q&A of shechem alleged it started in the late 90s 90s no here almost in the 90s and 97 to be exact I remember and look at the website number do you know how many people visit this website a year ninety million nine zero million people go to consultation to this website where is the Sheikh sleeping but his meter is working yeah if you never look down at good deeds something that you teach will harvest will grow well Yanni give you so much reward wallow without you knowing it your child five years of age the father and the mother fight who teaches him the Fatiha first why because they know whoever teaches in the Fatiha will continue to reap the reward of fatiha until the child dies maybe it is just 7080 years of age so if I teach my child how to pray if I teach my child how to do the--can if I do now cascade this if I teach my students how to understand how to behave how to learn and I get reward so always keep it in the back of your mind how to get closer to Allah so Jay and not to let anyone compete me to Allah and reach there before me so these are the encyclopedias what else we have the FIP periodicals now a lot in Arabic again huh a lot of the institutions in the Arab world give every three months some every six months a periodical a paper made of like 2030 subjects that have not been discussed before and they explain it to the scholars at the Sunnah sir these are references now if I'd like to speak about space travel astronauts when it's time for salah where do they face timbala where would scribbler they will have only the earth so that it does this count on what timings should we apply because the sun is there then they're orbiting the earth so when is mother if when is fetcher we don't know you need such researchers you need such people with experts to collaborate these periodicals come every three months six months with full-fledged research among the very well-known is the one published in Saudi Arabia by Darren IFTA and the minister of information they have a big very nice printed but very well-informed articles in it research that you read and you just keep on getting knowledge more and more and more by researches that are well accredited we have websites so there are dedicated websites for I'm not talking about fatwa I'm not talking about Hadid I'm talking about only v issues when it comes to issues of marriage because when you look at the contemporary folk issues you'll find a lot of difference of opinion especially in the West there are American Islam they have european islam they don't have reference point of references to these scholars and share any real scholars only in saudi arabia no but the vast majority of these cards are a bit excuse me i am not gonna defend myself because i'm from south asia no no no they're not there are real scholars people who are well-established in all branches of sciences now this regard in a political orientation we're talking about islamic knowledge so if you have people in america who claim to be scholars PhD holders and they come and give you effect words they say yeah fatwa in saudi is different than in america so in america if a woman accepts Islam and her husband is Christian it's okay to stayed live with you mmm this is a this is found in their fat wash what do you do what are you doing say no no no it's different where would she go what would you see do Islam Gru's not the other way around they say it's okay to take home mortgages it's interspace its River say yeah yeah but this is America oh because it's America Hollis Helen so they give this fatwas which is totally unacceptable but they claim to be scholars when they are not and the people underneath them consider them to be scholars because they don't know anyone better there and this is a catastrophe when people who do not possess the right knowledge to be mujtahid Mortlock not even muster had no pay yet but at the moment they are the best around and they start giving fatwas left right and center this is when you find Islam being undermined this is when you find a message it with a woman Imam and the men what are you praying praying that machine y ou their mom has a beautiful voice and a good body and I'd like to I like to pray them what is this you say okay there's no segregation we have equality with imam is like okay how much do you have equality next series allah you get pregnant instead of your wife what what they do you mean equality so you have strange fatwa strange ids because they are acquiring knowledge from people who are not qualified and this is a big problem now part of what we have in today's time is the call for modernization and development and this is how you undermine islam okay that the the title is beautiful does anyone oppose modernization no do you oppose development at all this is all accepted but what is your intention my intention of modernization is instead of having women stand at the back row notice you know sit let us stand in the same row shoulder to shoulder foot to foot hip to hip what is this this is modernization development what do you mean by development okay why use water all the time we can use wiping paper you know tissues now the work that they use for the children the wipes Alice have delayed development do this do that why for rocket or a car for a car and three make the three for development now this goes against Islam and this call is usually coming readily from people with good intention but the vast majority of those coordinates are hypocrites they want to undermine Islam what categorizes fit nowadays compared to the old times is the amount of new issues every single day you have new issues now we have driverless cars ax what happens if a driverless car hit someone and kills him who will pay the deer who will fast the two months so Who am I to blame these are new things I cannot ask Google to fast two months it has to be an individual doing this you have new things in mobiles so my post paid prepaid posting what is it if I'm out of credit and I call the company and they give me credit but with a higher price is this RIBA meaning it is post paid pre-painted my life I don't know you said this we don't care about these things post paid now different opinion of field of scholars we have to go to this epic assembly yeah no but I'm talking about the usual a shaggy berola bad mm prepaid so let's assume I pre paid a hundred Ringgits and for a month 20 days I consume 100 so they do not allow me to make calls so I call them and I say I need credit for next month they say ok we'll give you a hundred and twenty because I'm in need of it now I don't have money to pay so it's ok they will give it to you for a hundred and twenty so 20 bring it more than the usual price is this rib or not no it's not sure check they're letting me 100 ring it and they're taking 20 profit no they're not lending you they're sending you airtime so they have the right to sell you the airtime for 500 you buy or you don't but up to you they're not lending me money for money this is the eel of harvest you don't need Islamic assemblies for this sign I can do it the factor for you but meaning that there are new things coming up new things coming up you need to have people knowledgeable of the way it's done so in order for you to know whether it's Haram or its Hallett and among the characteristics of our time that was that is lots a lot different than before is that we have the Sharia colleges and v departments this is one of the greatest blessings of Allah our channel so many Islamic colleges Sharia colleges and the students in order to get a master's degree or in order to get a PhD they have to write a research paper and it's not only a page or two you're talking about 300 to 500 pages and this is scrutinized by three professors so you have someone appointed to help you a professor telling you yeah put this put that he has a roadmap for you you fulfill it you finish it now you give copies to three professors they scrutinized every single word of it and then you have a session of four hours they sit with you and you say that you have done this mistake or you done something good you have to elaborate a little bit more and then you come with a good piece of work this is something new it wasn't found 200 or 300 years ago which means that the filters to continue to be developing and modernized through the classical and traditional way which is good insha'Allah who as well okay now if we would like to talk about the scores and the jurist trends so in a helicopter view when we look at fib what do we see we see three prominent schools first school is the school of hadith second school the school of opinion third school is the school of Allah area the fourth school is not a school it's a trend and we will talk about this inshallah later on so what is the school of hadith the school of hadith is illustrated in the school of mmm Malik the school of Imam Shafi the school of Imam Ahmed bin Hamad they had a lot of focus and emphasis over hadith some are more than others so when you come to a mam I'm at school of thought it is prominent in abiding adhering calling people to the sooner this is the priority yet they do not neglect an analogy which is a PS so they have great emphasis on a thong what do you mean by I thought hadith of the Prophet Salaam I thought of the Companions of the tabi reign of Tibet Tiberi and okay why do they have so much strong emphasis on this because the Prophet said alayhi salatu salam hi you rule rule the best of generations is my generation the generation that follows and the generation that follows the prophets generation is the companions those who follow are that happening who saw the companions but did not see the professor those who follow our tabi Octavian who saw that appearing but did not see the companions so when the Prophet tells us they are the best of generations what does he want to tell us he wants to tell us that you have to abide by their understanding or you mean blind following them so no no no don't go to extreme when you follow them in their understanding of the Quran and of the Sunnah you do this for a number of reasons one they are closer to the Prophet Allah salatu salams timing to their more fluent in Arabic and they understand the context that it came through three they are closer to the Companions to the tapping so the whole area is not corrupt by vida by innovation by wrong ideology no they were so close nowadays can we say this we have so many sects and cults and religions and schools and ideologies that sometimes people come and say well like I don't know if I'm on the right track or not do you believe I get so many Muslims coming to me practicing who pray in the masjid and say share I'm embarrassed but they have to ask you I say no I'm married sir not decision no this is what not was not my question my question is how do I know that I am on the right path how do I know that Islam is the right religion so what I don't know I know I'm right are you gay is it no so how do you know that you're not gay what kind of question is this a Muslim is a Muslim by birth we born Muslims we pray because everybody's pray but if we I go to Australia nobody prays there nobody knows me but I pray yes of course okay in this case you're a good Muslim you're doing it out of fear of a lot so Jay now why do you doubt said yeah because maybe who's bringing these IDs to you so I don't know but if you're convinced of your religion why doubt it because you don't have a conviction you don't leave the Koran and you read to believe you need it because I just want to read it you don't know what Fatiha is when you say alhamdulillah a bill that mean the lord of the worlds and he is a merciful most beneficial and he is manikyam Adeem so why does Allah say that he is the owner of the day of judgment okay who's the order of this world why didn't he say that the owner of this world and the world of judgment because this world so many people claim to be the owners I'm the king I'm the president I am a millionaire I'm a billionaire I own this world on the day of judgment not a single person would claim that he owns it so Allah is saying if I own the day of judgment and I own everything else when you contemplate and recite with conviction belief there is no room for doubt but when you get this doubt then you have a problem so the first school the school of if they believe in quran and sunnah with the understanding of the favorite three generations because of what we have mentioned then we have the school of opinion madalasa to alia ye now ah hello right is not something that is condemned because all your using your logic you're using your opinion Mahad the mini Japan himself was approved by the Prophet Ali Sabbah to serve when he sent him to Yemen we mentioned this yesterday what will you judge with is it Quran if you don't find it in the Quran and this one if you don't find in the siRNA is it I will use my opinion to the best of my knowledge said may allah azzawajal grant you success because praise be to allah who guided the messenger of the messenger of allah to the right path so it is not condemned where is it condemned but you do not look at the Quran and the Sunnah and decide that I'm going to use my logic and the vast majority of us need to be spanked and hit and punished because of that we all use the same methodology so if a problem comes he what is the ruling on this or sister what is the ruling on this the sister comes said I think it's like this yeah it's most likely like this how do you know do you have a scale you know weighing potatoes and tomatoes how do you know so know it it looks a lot no I think this is Harvey it doesn't it doesn't sound good and that's why when I ask you about topping your mobile everybody hello i favor huh it's easy if i tell you i have a stomachache i need to take medication what should i say what should i take nobody's fix this is he's gonna die he's going to source so they don't speak they don't but when it comes to religion everybody even the guy who fixes your huh in the mechanic no problem they have no problem therefore it is essential that we know the school of Hawaii is not condemned when they do their level best and tuff seal also we have two prominent schools tafseer bill ethel and the followed hadith and tuff shear the right like a man pool to be like a show Connie all of these great interpreters of the Quran not every single time they coat a hadith there are a lot of times there are no hadith so they tell you in Arabic this means so and so and in real life we know this in that and they compare Apple to Apple and they give you their opinion so they study the hadith but it's not as strong while analogy plays a great role an analogy is it accepted in Islam or not now sisters the same know what pieces do you say no this is ok yes so what buddy says do you say yes so like the Indians it's up to you didn't know yes or no no analogy in Islam is well-established the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam was approached by a man and he said my mother died and i think she would have wanted to perform Hajj shall i perform Hajj on her behalf the Prophet said if your mother had the debt would you pay it yes then the Prophet said then Alma's debt is more worthy Yani perform Hajj technology yes Apple to Apple so there's no issue in that but the Prophet is always directing as to Quran and to soon so the third school is known as a Veria and what is the other area school they only accept a hadith and they reject Anala gee and even the actions of the Companions Valyria only take what is on the surface what appears from the hadith so there is when you go deep down in a sullen you will find that there is something called buffoon something that is understood but it is not in black and white you understand it from the hadith and for example the Prophet said I serve either better Alma opened a teeny little cupboard if the water reaches the amount of two jars it will not carry impurity in ajasa so what is them of whom but whom if it is less than two jars it will okay but the Prophet did not say that so some schools of thought said them of whom is accepted others say no no I must not accept it the Hadiya says it is not accepted you do not make assumptions the Prophet did not say if it's less he said to and above does not carry than a Jessa okay what about two and less but still we don't have knowledge in that so we do not say it does or it must so it's an issue of dispute according to the methodology of the math hub how it directs you to understand because those who go by them of whom some of them say if it is less than two jars if then adjusts have falls into it it becomes automatically nurtures other score said we agree with them of whom with the understanding not of the text itself but the understanding of it yet we do not agree with you why he said if it's less than two jars and an ijazah I can see it fell into it a drop of urine it is still pure unless the three characteristics or one of them is changed so if there is no color and if there is no taste I don't know how it tastes don't ask me and if there is no smell of majestic it's pure so even if it's this small I saw a little drop coming but it did not change the water still water is still pure so them of whom concept this is what I'm trying to highlight some schools apply it some schools apply it but do not apply it in all cases some schools like law area completely rejected at all it's not piranha Sunnah I will not accept it this type of rigidness is applicable and praised in some aspects when it comes to different schools of thought where they went overboard and rejected the hadith and the Sun and the Quran but in some cases it is totally unacceptable and for example the mother half of the helium the well-known Imam of mass above our area is even handsome Allah he even has a mother his father was a ruler in al-andalus and it stated that he was in his youth maybe mid-twenties he was you know well-dressed an aristocrat he came to the Masjid once and he sat down and then l didn'r man told him why did you sit down stand up and pray 2 rakaats the heated machine so he prayed to hey tonight's interceptor the following day he came after Assam so he wanted to pray the hater message another one said what are you doing this is time of restriction sit down shut one place with me says pray one says don't pray I will study Islam until I know how to take my own decisions and he studied Islam until he became an imam imam of must have a vibe and he has many books among them is al mahalla in 8 volumes i think big book which has a lot of knowledge yet 70% of what he says is 100% correct 30% is totally overboard yeah for example he says that the prophet sallallaahu Salim said in the hadith do not urinate in stagnant water and then perform a loop so he says if you urinate in a plate and then put it down in the stagnant water it's okay because you did not directly do it this is waha meaning he takes the face value not only that he says if you difficut in water stagnant water it's okay because a prophet only said your thesis this is not logical so this school of thought is well known but not everything and he used to speak very ill of the four schools of thought he used and this is why in era and the Arabs say his sword is sharper than L had judged one of the tyrant rulers of Mahamaya and his tongue is sharper than the tongue of a pen has him why if it has him in his books he says a chef area said so-and-so and this is rubbish he says and said these people are imbeciles they're ignorant how dare they say such a thing when the prophets say that is awesome when the poor acid okay he say it but in a nice way say they said so-and-so and this is incorrect if you read the books if you learn from the lectures of Chef Mombasa and share happen if a mean wallah he you will not hear a single word I've studied their books and literature and heard almost all of their lectures when people ask me about so on so slow his imbecile he doesn't understand it if I see him I'm gonna punch him because I'm not brought up on the attempt like they were if you ask them about something and people ask chef bimba's this scholar so-and-so said that you do not understand that that you're blind that you do this is it may Allah forgive me for you yes what else that's it now I forgive him you will see share even earth a means speak about sects and cults and salsa without naming them and without abusing them or cursing them he just tells you that they say so so and this is wrong this is ship this is against Islam but he would not go into their Imams and and this is what we need to learn even with our enemies so when we mentioned trump allah killed him a lot crucify him i will step on him with my shoe i would spit on him why are you so angry yeni chill you don't have to do this see I have so much hatred in my heart and this is why when my son that's something I don't have sons they're all daughters if my daughter does something and I would like to any reprimand her I would curse I would yell are you a donkey a girl I said why are you so many parents make drop may Allah destroy you me Oliver you may Allah not make you grow up so why are you doing this said because he did something wrong by one of two will you make drama with Allah except this is a possibility type why not make dua may Allah guide you may Allah make your righteous person says chef this doesn't work I will die with a heart attack if I say this I need to curse I need to say something bad something evil so that I would try to vent my anger is something wrong with us we have to fix ourselves and this is why when you befriend with you accompany when you associate yourself with some point who's wiser who is better in moral conduct and Allah you will learn from him this is why will you surround yourself 24/7 with righteous practicing people your life changes and even you see the youth when they play football together when they practicing said he passed the ball just like a Louisville Hayden and with this score ago this is masha'Allah how did they lie lie they make prostration yeah everything is transformed completely into being practicing and you find people they have jazakallah here without even knowing it well I I know I used to know people in my youth when we started practicing jazakallah he was 24/7 when we used to go to non practicing people and this is a physical his it don't say that say sugar yeah I'm saying may Allah reward you just now come bajo highnesses no no we don't know this word she say sugar people they need to vent so if you know that making drunk will be accepted then make it in something that is beneficial so aim and even hasn't had a very sharp tongue nevertheless he was a great scholar of Islam logic when we talk about the school of logic we don't praise them by saying logic is a good thing right logic is a good thing but here it is condemned because this school originated from el martes illa ala mortis illa they do not accept the hadith of a hat what is the hadith of Mahad it's not one it is one narrator in the chain of narrators because we have a hat we have much food we have already we have motivator so the matter water that each layer of the chain of narrators there are more than 10 so this is almost yeah need not almost this is definitely authentic without any doubt but the motivator among the 10,000 of hadiths are not more than 100 very little percentage and the rest are either a hat or wash hope you have two or three in each line but when you come to a hat such as in name and our motto vignette only Roman hapa narrated it no one no other companion this school of logic says no no we don't decided we'd rather apply our logic we rather ignore the hadith but this is not a school of thought this is not considered a school of thought because this is something that is weird abnormal fluke that came unfortunately they are prominent they are dominating the scene nowadays if you open the TV local or international if you read their literature if you read magazines you will find always them coming in top why they are close to the authorities in most countries Muslim countries because they have the audacity to change the for understand without any problem they will undermine Islam without any problem so you get prominent scholars who compiled books I'm not going to give names who come and say listen if you make that way in Korea to Islam don't tell them that eating dogs meat is haram why because there is nothing mentioned in the Quran is women like you minutes Allah see it can be so let it be this is the school of logic that is sick because it goes against the Quran and Sunnah yes if it goes in line with the Quran and Sunnah you have no problem but when someone comes to me and says the hadith of the Prophet had a lobster it is best for a man to be stabbed in his head with a needle of steel rather than to touch a woman that is not permissible for him he says ah this is not motivator so it's okay to shake hands with women nun Muharram the hadith is there is it yeah but I don't accept it who are you to not accept it is it you see that's automatic so they start to build a foundation of a new religion where it is okay for you whatever you think that this is not practical scrap it out no problem a woman travelling without the muharram now today it's difficult she has to go to Surabaya to like how we or whatever you call it no she has to travel with without a Muharram Palace this hadith I do not accept and you change the religion and you change the foundation that was established by the prophet sallallaahu are they you are he was seldom"
