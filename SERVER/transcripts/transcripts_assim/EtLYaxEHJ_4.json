  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] [Music] alhamdulillah dear brothers and sisters in Islam today with the grace of Allah we'll try to conclude the tips that we started eight days ago in introducing the guidelines of how to correct mistakes errors and sins of others in the shade of the methodology of our Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam as guided to us in the Shar and afterwards we will start by mentioning samples and examples of incidents where the Prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam sets the ground rules of mistakes and how to rectify them and rebuke them the last tip or one of the last is that when we rebuke a youngster who makes a mistake this should be done with wisdom and in a manner appropriate to the child's age we have a big problem when it comes to admonishing reprimanding rebuking and correcting the mistakes of children we tend to make them grow faster than their actual age and we expect from them more than should be expected from such children and this is wrong we are depriving them depriving them from their childhood we are causing them psychological problems and not helping them grow up naturally if you see a Child 3 or four years old sit sitting next to his father or to his mom for an hour or two and not moving and not playing around don't be astonished and say mashallah what a nice boy what a nice child well brought up rather say there's something wrong with this child this is not natural a child this age should be jumping around breaking things shouting fighting crying this is the norm this is why they are children the pen of accountability has been lifted has been uplifted so that they're not accountable for what they do therefore we have to understand how these children are in order to be able to bring them up to be effective responsible and beneficial to their community and to their religion Abu Hur tells us that once the grandchild the grandson of the Prophet Alat alass may Allah be pleased with him and with his father and with his mother the son of Ali and Fatima alhassan was a little young child he saw a date on the ground so he took it and put it placed it in his mouth attempting to eat it this was a mistake but it was a child who could not differentiate between what's right and what's wrong nevertheless the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam corrected this mistake and he took it out of his mouth saying and this is a Persian word and we use it also in Arabic a lot meaning that this is not appropriate take it out and he said to him don't you know that we the descendants of the prophet and the household of the Prophet Alat wasam do not consume charity s is not permissible for the prophet nor for his descendants as per the Hadith of Salman Al farari the Seeker of Truth who came to Medina and when he recognized that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam is the prophet and messenger of Allah he wanted to verify this through what he had read about him in the scriptures and that is he eats a gift but does not eat or consume charity so one day he brought some food and the prophet was with his companions and he presented it to the prophet Alat and the prophet asked what is this so Salman said this is Charity this is sod so the prophet Sall Al wasallam refrained from eating from it and ordered his companions to eat the following day Salman may Allah be pleased with him brought another plate of food and gifted it to the prophet and the prophet said what is this Salman said this is a gift it's not a charity it's a gift so the prophet said bismah and started to eat from it and ask his companions to share in so the prophet teaching this young child tells us that children though they're not accountable yet they are susceptible to be taught and they are supposed to be prevented from doing what is Haram even if they're children so for example we know that children children are not accountable sometimes people give our children gold lockets or ornaments jewelry so you see some mothers allow their children to wear a necklace or a bracelet made of gold though he's a male he's a son and we know that men or males are not allowed in Islam to wear gold gold so when you speak to the mother she says he's a child yes he is a child and not accountable what you are you're a mother you're a parent you're the one who who will be held accountable when they start to draw living things a human being an animal we should tell them that this is not permissible you can draw anything else you can draw landscape moons Suns mountains trees oceans anything but not living creatures and this is why it is wrong for us to bring them coloring books that has living creatures let alone cartoon figures or action figures and the likes which which may corrupt and brainwash them from an early age so yes we rebuke children but in an appropriate way and listen to this beautiful story of Omar Sal may Allah be pleased with him and with his father Abu Sal one of the first to migrate to Medina and his mother um Sal who when she became a widow the prophet married her and she became the mother of the Believers may Allah be pleased with her was was the stepson of the Prophet Alat and he was of a young age like four five maybe six years of age and once the prophet was eating sallallahu alaihi wasallam and Omar joined in as a youngster he was picking food from all over the place and the prophet sallallahu alaih alh wasallam corrected this mistake and again notice nothing goes unchecked under the radar the prophet when he sees something wrong he corrects it but with the appropriate strategy and diplomacy and approach as he is the perfect teacher Sall wasam so he said to the boy oh young boy say bismah eat with your right hand and eat from what is in front of you three short phrases direct to the point but very informative something that would resonate in his mind forever Omar may Allah be pleased with him said this remained my way of eating from that time on these three phrases never left my subconscious never left my memory Say bah before you start to eat and this is how we should deal with our children when they're one or two years of age this is how we bring them up you are astonished how Muslim kids behave in such a fashion we teach him from an early age how to say how to say bah before eating or drinking how to always eat with their right hand and not with their Lefty even if they're lefties they don't eat with their left hand ever some of my children are lefties but when it comes to eating and drinking never they would raise their left hand to their mouth because this is how they were brought up out of conviction and belief in Allah and following the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad sallahu alai wasallam so Omar said this remained my way of eating from that time on say bismah eat with your right hand and fortunately nowadays we see Elders in restaurants holding the fork with the left the knife with the right cutting the food eating with their left drinking with the left and if you bring it up to their attention would they concede would they agree would they say for correcting us and reminding us they feel up tight their arrogance kicks in and some may reject the ruling altogether and say if Allah created two hands for us what's the point of not using one the same analogy the same way of thinking that Satan did when he rejected to prostrate to Adam peace be upon Him Define the straight command and order from Allah for him to prostrate these arrogant people still exist today and you can sense their Defiance and resentment to some of the Sharia laws in their rhetoric this exposes what's in their hearts yes they look Muslims they look normal like us but when you look a little bit closer you'll find that they're not like us they have something wrong with their hands they are aliens it's the rhetoric that exposes them these little words that Express their resentment to the Sharia their Defiance their arrogance may Allah protect us may Allah protect all of us and I hope you're not one of those when addressed with something from the Shar you would reject it and feel uptight about it this is a a clear sign of hypocrisy and alongside the points that we should learn before correcting other people's mistakes we should not exaggerate some of us tends to inflate things way of proportion exaggerate so a trivial small thing he would make an issue out of it yes that was a mistake but measure the mistake as it's supposed to be and not exaggerate it's like someone killing a mosquito with a cannon yes the the the the the mosquito will die alongside everyone in the room or the house you have caused more damage than what was supposed to so do not exaggerate mistakes and deal with them as they supposed to be dealt with in the same SI in the right course of action also some people tend to make it personal what do you mean I've noticed this in WhatsApp group in social media in some family discussions when you find that there this this urge of extracting a confession out of the person who made a mistake why are you doing this this is not personal no he has to confess I have to prove to him that he was wrong okay he acknowledged that he was wrong move on no he has to confess stop rubbing it it hurts and sometimes it backfires you're causing the person who made the mistake to become defiant to become defensive and maybe to reject the truth because of your approach not every time you see a mistake you are required to extract a confession acknowledge it's a mistake show the other party show the sin or the person who made that error that it was an error and move on don't require and demand a confession and to state that he was wrong this is not your job this is not something that is helpful or healthy also if someone was [Music] so indulged in that mistake or sin for a long time sometimes it's almost impossible to quit immediately though this is what is expected from a true real Muslim however a person may try and attempt and most likely would relapse this is not the end of the world so give them some time give them some space while continually advising them and trying with them and and being helpful and supportive don't jump to conclusions don't start pointing fingers and accusing others and maybe blaming them for being a failure you'll never make it someone who was on The Habit could not kick the habit who used to smoke for 30 years sometimes it's impossible to ask him to stop and quit immediately they need time to win off so instead of meeting them next week and saying you still smoke don't you fear Allah I showed you last week all the evidence and the proofs that this is Haram this is and you're still smoking instead be supportive oh mallah I see that instead of going for a smoke every five or 10 minutes now you're taking like an hour so you've reduced the amount that's good that's good I hope inshallah in couple of weeks you'll be able to get to kick the habit for good there's a difference in these two approaches and the most likely to attain results is the latter one when you're being supportive when you're encouraging people when you're being positive instead of rushing things up when you rush things up you may end up with a lot of disappointment because you rush things up it's like cooking if you're preparing a meal if you rush things up it's not it's not going to be cooked people will not be able to consume it and eat it because you rush things up let it marinate give it some time especially if that sin took a long time in a person's life and finally not making the one who makes the mistake feel like an opponent because the aim is to win people over not to score points against them so many times we discuss with other Muslims who make mistakes and you say to them a the clip or the video you sent has music in it has inappropriate material in it has free mixing has women has bad content these people may be divided into two types one would accept and say it's a very good remark I accept your opinion and I'll look into it or I beg to differ but for the advice the other part or the other type of people who are argumentive if you tell them that this is the sun in midday they would argue how do you know it's not another solar system or it's another planet or it's a spotlight or this or that it's a mirror such people don't even put the effort to argue with them just say you're right move on why this is what Shan tries to do to corrupt your heart that individual it's his habit if you go and check with his wife his children his colleagues his friends his relatives you'll find that they all avoid engaging in discussion with him because it's fruitless the moment you engage in discussion you become an opponent you're not having a healthy discussion he just wants to win not the battle rather the whole War he wants to score a point he has a hidden agenda he wants to prove that he knows he does this he does that if you go down to his level you're like him don't waste time don't tarnish your heart's Purity don't engage your head with such fights that has no value to Islam or to you personally or to that individual who's not going to accept the truth let it be just say you're right move on what you had done initially was to say a comment for the sake of Allah you did that you remember the first episode in our Ramadan series we said that tip number one the most important tip in correcting people's mistakes is sincerity don't ever make it personal it was reported that Ali AB Talib was once fighting and he's a fierce Soldier was once fighting with an idol worshipper at war in the battlefield and while he was fighting with him and was about to kill him the idol worshipper spat in his face Ali refrained from fighting him and went to fight someone else so his companions told him what are you doing you were just about to kill this cfir he said I was doing it for the sake of Allah and when he span on my face I wanted to avenge myself and I said nope this is not for Allah anymore so I refrained don't make people who do mistakes your opponents don't make it personal always accept cell always be on top do it for the sake of Allah if you feel that the discussion is going out of hand leave them be they're not going to change they're not here to know the truth people are not here to know the truth and learn they're here to argue they're here to score a point to fulfill their hidden agendas you don't have time for this life is too short move on another one bites the dust who cares about them there are so many eager to hear your advice and take it in and embrace it and implement it because they know you're sincere and they themselves are sincere focus on them leave those to be and to find other venues for them to prac practice whatever they want to practice and life will certainly go on we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back"
