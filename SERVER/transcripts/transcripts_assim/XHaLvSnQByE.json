  "transcript": "When we read the Quran, the Quran tells us that Allah subhanana wa ta'ala, he is our creator. He's our sustainer. He is our cherisher. Allah subhanana wa ta'ala. How many times have we thanked Allah for the clothes he has given us? Everything is because of Allah. The clothes he has given us, the food that we eat. How many times have we thanked him for that? The house that he's given, how many thanks have we thanked him for that? All the wealthy he has given us. The water we drink, the water we drink, how many time we thank Allah for the water we drink, the air we breathe, if we do not get the air for half an hour, one hour, you will die. How many of us have thanked Allah for the air? The air that we breathe because of which we survive. I want to know in this auditorium. Can you raise your hand? How many of us have thanked Allah for the air? Only for the air. Please raise your hand. 1 2 3 Okay, maybe 5%. Okay, 5% have thanked Allah. Imagine if we don't get the air. Some may after few minutes, some after 10 minutes, some after half an hour. No one can hold the breath. No one can hold the breath for more than 1 hour. The world record is not 1 hour. So imagine if we don't get the air, we will die. That reminds me of a saying and we keep on cribbing. We don't have this, we don't have that, we don't have this, we don't have that. You know, there was a man who used to complain because he has no shoes. He used to complain to God because he has no shoes until he saw a man who had no feet. A person used to complain to God because he had no shoes until he saw a man who had no feet. Therefore, the Islamic concept is in terms of wealth, look at the people below you and thank Allah, I'm better than him. As far as wealth is concerned, the worldly things are concerned, the Islamic Sharia says look at the people below you and thank Allah. And when knowledge is concerned, dean is concerned, virtue is concerned, look at the people above you and try and lead that level. But as far as the wealth and the dunya is concerned, look at the people below you. And Allah says in surah fat chapter number 35 verse number 15 that Allah is free of all wants, worthy of all praise. Allah says in surah chapter number 100 verse number six that man is verily ungrateful. Allah is giving us all this nyama and we are ungrateful. Even though you're ungrateful you ask for forgiveness, Allah forgives you. Allah is raman or rahim. However mistakes we do, however ungrateful you are, whatever sins we do, when we ask for forgiveness, Allah forgives you. Allah says that for verily Allah is most forgiving. In surah Nisa chapter 4 verse number 25, in surah Maida chapter number 5 verse number 74, in surah hijar chapter number 15 verse number 49, in surah nah chapter number 16 verse number 119 and in surah bur chapter number 85 verse number 14 that verily Allah is most forgiving and merciful. And Allah says in surah nisa chapter number four verse number 48 and in surah nisa chapter 4 verse number 116 that if Allah pleases he may forgive any sin but anyone who joins partners with gods he has done the most hinous sin he has gone far way. That means Allah is saying in chapter 4:48 and in chapter 416, you do anything sin and Allah if he pleases will forgive you but the sin of shik he'll never forgive. So if you die as a mushik if you die doing shik Allah will never forgive you if you do shik and you ask for forgiveness before dying Allah will forgive that also but if you die as a mushik without asking for forgiveness that sin Allah will never forgive. So shik is the biggest sin in Islam. It is the most hinous sin in Islam."
