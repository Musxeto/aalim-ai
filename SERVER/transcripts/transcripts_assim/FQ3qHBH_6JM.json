  "transcript": "Abu Yussef from Saudi Arabia he is telling about an issue that is reassuring so many times and unfortunately I get tens let me rephrase that I get hundreds of questions a week on such issues the boy loves a girl or he doesn't love a girl the boy is 25 years of age he's young he's fit he's healthy there's so many temptations out there and he goes to mom and dad please help me I have to get married and they said no no no no not it's not yet time for you your elder sister is not married yet give it a couple of years more or three years maybe until we when you finish 30 and the boy says this is too much I will fall into sin I will fall into Haram and they could care less so he speaks to his mom mom I'd like to marry such a someone so girl she's the sister of my friend and she says no and she curses him he goes to his father and he only finds the same treatment and he curses him and they all say we have nothing to do with your marriage not only that if you get married we will not talk to you will this communicate with you we will boycott you we will not look at you or at your wife or at your children and will curse you day and night well sad news is most of the boys could care less because the father and the mother are transgressing against their son they're committing a major sin when they stop him from marrying they should know we paid for his education yes but you did not enslave him he must marry the woman we choose for him wrong he does he's not obliged to marry whomever you choose for him if the father says no he has to marry the woman I choose for him he you wanna him to marry such a girl you go ahead and marry her let him shoot he's the one who's gonna live with her for the rest of his life you don't get to choose for him and it's none of your business as a father or as a mother to control your son's life like this then I will curse him he curse him from here till the day of judgment it would not even reach the lower heaven because you are valium you are committing an act of transgression it's like saying I don't like him to drink soft drinks that has Cola in it only a Fanta or 7up it's none of your business this is his preference he drinks whatever he wants he marries whomever he wants he's a man he doesn't need your approval or consent but out of respect and being dutiful he is trying to put some sense into your heads usually such parents would not bend they would continue to be stiff and not willing to compromise till their death sad news but unfortunately there are parents who are so abusive like this and even worse such parents have horrible life the mother was treated by her husband in a similar way when she was young she was enslaved by her in-laws and now she wants to do the same to her daughter-in-law she wants someone to be her slave and to cook and clean this is why she refuses the boy to marry someone of his own choice and all of this solemn is reoccurring and we born over and over again well these people will be punished on the day of judgment as for you my friend you see someone you like she's righteous practicing from a good family your parents don't want or don't accept you marrying anyone unless they choose for you in this case you are not a renegade you are not a rebel you are a human being choosing your spouse that you will live with for the rest of your life let them curse let them say whatever they want Allah would not hear them I'm not Allah would not look at them for their transgression now you be diplomatic don't confront them don't go head-on try to be diplomatic dutiful keep on calling them even after years and years of boycotting you but you have to remember that they are your parents in your gateway to paradise they're wrong they're transgressing their sinful without any question but again this does not give you the justification or the reason to boycott them in exchange and not to talk to them no keep trying your level best maybe you are in your sujood at a loss often is very hard but at the end of the day you go and get married and don't look back we have a short"
