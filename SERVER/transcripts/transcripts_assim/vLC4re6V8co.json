  "transcript": "cd from germany i saw some people in the graveyard in the desert region um for example one person sits before a grave and they make these lines on the ground and every time they make one line they receive some super from the air a yani one sewer from the air and i asked about that and one person said to me that is a type of dua for the debt and he said that one sit or stand before the grave and he cites some surah and ayat from the quran and he also said that the most preferable surah when i has to recite uh other and he said that these lines are types of spf for example if the person wants to know how many times he recites so i want to know if this type of act where is this done in mauritania okay sidi from germany he says in mauritania they sit around the grave a group of people and they write lines and each one recites a verse of the quran usually fatiha ayat al-qurasi the last three calls or whatever and they dedicate this to the deceased and makes them vikir this is something that is not related to islam regardless of the country now you ask yourself one did the prophet ever do such a thing allah the answer is no did his companions ever do such a thing the answer is no on the contrary the prophet used to teach his companions when they were burying one of the muslims ask seek forgiveness for your brother and ask allah to make him steadfast because now he's being questioned no fatiha no nothing no writing lines to remember who said what and who said this or that so all of these are innovations because they're doing it as part of the religion it's not a microphone in a masjid to enhance the sound it's not a conditioner's to fix the temperature they're doing it to get closer to allah and to benefit the deceased and all of this is not part of islam"
