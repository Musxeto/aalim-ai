  "transcript": "Our first caller for today is Mackenzie from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi. So sometimes women opt for a lighter weight or breathable fabric to help against the heat. So while wearing the abaya, they generally do not reveal her body underneath. However, sometimes when a woman walks, the bottom of the abaya may appear a bit transparent by the ankles, which creates a dark shadow-like appearance of the ankles underneath. So is this haram to wear? If the abaya itself is oblique and the fabric is normal and dark, whatever shows underneath that does not or is not considered to be exposing the body figure is forgiven. Because you can't expect a lady to wear a tent fabric, for example, just to ensure that nothing is revealed. There is a limit for what humans can bear. So the normal abayas, yes, they might be under real strong light, a bit transparent in the sense that it may show something beneath it, but one cannot tell or define exactly what it is. This is inshallah forgiven. And it's not like when someone's wearing transparent dress and you can see the body color or the shape of the body itself. That would not be halal. And Allah knows best."
