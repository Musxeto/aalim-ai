  "transcript": "as for the second question she is asking about her children 11 and 8 girls they are marshal abiding by the hijab they're doing what they must do they recite the Koran they do their learning but they keep it to the basic and they want to indulge themselves in worldly matters in listening to maybe music watching TV instead of watch learning Arabic and doing this and she's frustrated and she's always angry with them well this is a very critical phase of their lives you have to be very careful children at this age they are changing lanes as they say so they're young they're Restless they don't know what's good for them if it works for them they would eat junk food 24/7 even it kills them they couldn't care it tastes good it looks nice there the Tison is overwhelming and it is so attractive they don't know what's good for them there for you being the doctor being the one who is bringing them up with Allah on an Islamic way you should be more tolerant you were at the moment like a dentist when a patient comes and he opens his mouth and you tried to touch the tooth and he screams instead of being tolerant you punch him in the nose for screaming nobody would come to you nobody will accept you now your children have so many people outside anticipating and waiting for the right moment to jump and take over not physically but mentally to try and make them come to them so you will lose because there's so many of them and you're only on your own that is why there has to be some form of tolerance nothing Haram but you have to tolerate things you have to give them a lot of love and you have to try as much as possible to reduce your anger to reduce your critique not every time they do something why did you do this you should have done this no always give them positive talk encourage them you may be the role model for them and Shahla things would progress in a positive way and always remember love brings remarkable results"
