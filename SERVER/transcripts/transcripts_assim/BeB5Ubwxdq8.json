  "transcript": "Amina From the Emirates so um the morning and evening as um there are like 25 du do we have to say all the uh 24 I think 24 sorry do we have to say all the 24 or can we just choose for it to be effective first of all the morning and evening is it mandatory for us to say or a highly recommended Sunnah if you say it's a highly recommended Sunnah which is the correct answer then you're have answered yourself do we have to read all the 24 AAR no you don't have to read them all you don't have to read even some of them because it's a highly recommended Sunnah however it's like someone telling you you would you like me to give you a th000 Dirham as a gift or 100,000 Dirhams no one in his right mind would say 100,000 Dirham no that's a lot no no give me 1,000 of course you would go for the glory you would go for the highest level possible likewise with the more you recite the authentic AAR which the prophet used to spend time reciting them the closer you get to Allah the higher your level in Jenna the greater your protection from shatan would be and Allah Knows Best"
