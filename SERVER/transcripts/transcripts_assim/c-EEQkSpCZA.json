  "title": "Prophet ﷺ‎ didn't have shadow, flies never sat on him, had a cloud above him, true? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "is it true that the prophet Allah did not have a shadow no fly ever sat on him there was a cloud always covering him when wherever he went Etc Sanya the prophet Allah was described in suratul kaf at the last verse of it that say to them Muhammad that merely I am a human being that Allah azzawajal reveals Revelations to so this Ayah proves along with so many verses of the Quran that the prophet Assam is a human being he's just like us born like a human being lived like a human being died like a human being he was asked and he replied the Angels were created from light the Gin were created from fire and the humans were created from what was described to you that is clay so to come in do and say about the prophet I somewhat he did not ever claim this is exaggeration and extremism the prophet said warning his ummah do not flatter me as the Christians flattered their Prophet Jesus peace be upon him so the prophet is telling us do not exaggerate do not go to extreme flattering me praising me saying things about me that are not true now why would anyone claim that the prophet had no shadow when he was a normal human being if he had no shadow he would not have had his companions shade him as in a Hajj when Bilal and usaid used to hold something like a tent over his head to shade him from the Sun if he had a cloud following him all the time this was not necessary but the problem is with the Deviant sects those who claim that the prophet salaam was created from light and this is by itself an blatant lie the prophet tells us that he was created from clay they said no no no he was created from light and not only any light he was created from Allah's light and this is blasphemous because they're making Allah's attributes in such a fashion as if it is created so those who claim that when they when we say to them that the prophet Assam was created from clay like all humans they say no he was created from light and evidence is he had no shade because he was light all over so do you mean to tell me that he when he went to bed with Madara Isha the house was lit and we have numerous hadiths that prove that their houses were dark and they could not see at night when you come to these people how can you debate with them how can you talk to them if your references are invalid to them they don't believe in the Quran or in the authentic Sunnah they believe only in what their whims and desires dictate to them and hence this is why they always tend to follow such deviations may Allah azzawajal protect us the prophet had never had a fly on him and he was this and that all of these things are baseless and not true"
