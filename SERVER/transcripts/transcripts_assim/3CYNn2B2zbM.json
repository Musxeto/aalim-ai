  "transcript": "muhammad from india chef my question is how major does a problem need to be for a man to skip congregational prayers in the mosque so for example does he is a simple problems like uh sickness or ten floors to um climb uh applicable or does it have to be a life and death situation okay i will answer inshallah ahmed from india what are the excuses that allow us to leave the prayer in the masjid it is not there's no checklist that says that okay number one number two number three you can skip for example among the things that it's not a life and death situations as well the hadith tells us that there is no prayer while a person is fighting the urge to answer the call of nature or when the food is served so the prophet tells us delay your prayer if you have to answer the call of nature go ahead and answer it and delay the prayer if the food is served and you're hungry and you want to eat eat whatever is sufficient and go catch up with the remaining of the prayer also eating garlic and onions the smell is offensive and the prophet told us not to enter the masjid so this allows you to skip and this is a legitimate reason if done randomly not like our friend here uh from iraq shad's friend not chad when he eats it deliberately to skip the uh prayer with the congregation this is the act of hypocrites no i'm talking about some someone who randomly ate it and skipped prayer accordingly this is totally legitimate among the reasons that are reasons that happen once every blue moon so you have a doctor visiting your mom and it's time for prayer and there's no one to stay with your mother you have to be with her and this male doctor who's visiting her this is a legitimate excuse you your wife is gone to bring the kids from school and your little child who's three years of age is having a fever and no one to stay with him in the home so you have to stay with him until somebody attends the child this is a legitimate reason and so on this is something between you and allah nobody is holding a stick waiting for you outside your home if you don't show up for salat and he beats the heck out of you so you try your level best to do what pleases allah knows you"
