  "title": "Fortress Of The Muslim 14 Dua before the night prayers (2) Prophet  ﷺ‎ used to say - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign used to say when offering night prayer now remember we offer night prayer like in a minute or two and then we hit the sack and we go back to sleep listen to the length of the dua that the prophet alaihis salatu salam used to say when he prays night prayer him then he used to say o to you belongs all praise now i'm going to read exactly what is in fortress of the muslim though the dua is a little bit different but he has compiled a number of different duas in one o allah to you belongs all praise you are the light of the heavens and the earth and all that is within them so antanuru samawati al-arim to you belongs all praise you are the sustainer of the heavens and the earth and all that is within them to you belongs all praise you are the lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is within them to you belongs all praise and the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is within them to you belong all praise look at how beautiful this supplication is and we're just warming up what is this praising allah so many people say that part of the etiquette of dua is to praise of all to praise allah then after salutation of upon the prophet hassan they say how do we praise allah listen this is one way of doing it so the prophet says goes on to say alaihis allah to you belongs all praise you are the king of the heavens and the earth and to you belong all praise you are the truth until hap your promise is truth your word is true and the day in which we will encounter you is true the garden of paradise is true the hell fire is true the prophets are true muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam is true and the final hour is true all of this you say as an inauguration of your prayer what does it contain it contains the pillars of iman it contains all what you believe in and imagine when you say it every single night this is what you live upon this is the code you live upon which most muslims don't even know then he says oh allah unto you i have submitted allah i declare i submit everything in my life all my decisions are by your instruction oh allah unto you i have submitted and upon you i've relied i trust no one i rely on no one i have no confidence except in you real tawakkul and in you i have believed wabika and to you i have turned in repentance and over you i have disputed so my dispute is not over worldly matters or for dominance or to gain power when i dispute it's for your sake and to you i have turned for judgment i don't go to the security council i don't go to the labor court i go to the sharia court quran sunnah this is your law that i go for arbitration so forgive me after mentioning all of this i say so forgive me this is a conclusion forgive me for what has come to pass of my sins and what will come to pass and that is in the future and what i have hidden in what i have done publicly you are all muqaddim and and these are two of allah's beautiful names none has the right to be worshipped except you you are my deity none [Music] has the right to be worshipped except you whoa if we were to take like five or six episode to highlight the meaning in this dua wallahi it would not be sufficient the concept of praising allah azzawajal like this it shows you how much love the heart of the prophet islam contains for allah and by the way this can comes only from knowledge if someone were to tell you have you ever been to paris said no what do you know about paris was the evil tower [Music] i don't know but if you were to be asked about makkah have you been to mecca yes many times for umrah what is in the masjid of mecca oh there is a kaaba there is mukam ibrahim there is hedgers there is tawaf there is sari there is this these are the different gates the you explain it because you've been there and you love the place now when you pray to allah azzawajal what do you know of him unfortunately nothing we know about the best footballers we know about those who won the uh oscars and the uh latest movies the latest songs the artists the singers the actors but when it comes to knowing allah azza these beautiful names when it comes to praising allah azza oh sorry i'm out of word i don't know what to say what does this indicate it indicates that we have zero knowledge of who allah is and this is why we have big failure in tasting our prayers in contemplating on the thicker that comes out of our mouths watch this episode again and again and again and memorize this dua in arabic and learn the meanings of it and when you stand in prayer and you come and say allah yet then you will find a different taste for your prayer especially your night prayer may allah make me and you among those who stand in the middle of the night seeking his forgiveness wanting his favors and blessing this is all the time we have until we meet next time i leave [Music] love"
