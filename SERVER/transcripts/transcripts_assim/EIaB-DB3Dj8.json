  "transcript": "this is an attempt to spread the knowledge from the Quran and the Sunnah and any Muslim without any doubt if you ask him about the purpose of creation he would say to worship Allah the almighty the problem is that in the Muslim world we find that there is a certain amount of sensitivity whenever you mention the word or you mention the word you get so many people defensive and whenever you speak about the topic they take it personally whether they know it or not and this is a very serious issue the reason is that you and I are not definitely better than the prophets of Allah especially the prophet of Allah Muhammad sallallahu alaih alh was can anyone claim that can you claim that you're better than them definitely not however Allah has revealed the Ayah in the Quran which is so clear that anyone on the streets would understand it and it has been revealed to you oh Muhammad of the prophet of Allah and to The Messengers and prophets of Allah before you that if you were to associate others with Allah if you were to commit shik then all of your Deeds would be nullified and you would be among the losers Subhan Allah this is addressing the prophet Alat and of of course it is for the umah as well so when you come to such an understanding you know that the issue of shik is the major the most major sin any person could do it is so severe that Allah does not forgive those who die in such a state it is so severe that it is greater than murder than adultery fornication stealing uh uh looting slandering people you you name it shik is far greater so in order to avoid shik which is your Prime Duty in Islam you have to know what is shik and what is the opposite of shik which leads you to worshiping Allah the almighty so this is an attempt to go through one of the Great books of contemporary times known as which was compiled by IM Muhammad Abdul wahab don't be deceived by the names or by the author don't have any prejudgment over the topic just because you heard the word Abdul wahab oh so this is a wahhabi stuff this is a salafi stuff this is so and so stuff no one fights no one finds any hard feelings against or except someone who's deviant because he's not following the prophet as simple as that and we will come to discuss this from the Quran and the Sunnah who fights definitely those who are committing shik now one of us would say that I'm a Muslim I pray I fast I do all the nine the whole nine yards so you cannot accusing accuse me of shik Subhan Allah Allah says in the Quran and most of them believe not in Allah except that they are in the state of sh so their belief in Allah is tarnished by associating others with Allah now if someone prays and fasts and does everything that is mentioned in the Quran and the Sunnah yet every Friday he goes to a temple and he prostrates to Buddha is he a Muslim definitely not if if someone thinks and believes that that other than Allah controls the universe if someone believes that it is permissible to call De people oh husin oh Ali oh Fatima oh Tani oh bada oh Baba so and so do this for me grant me a child pay off my debts do that and do this definitely this is shik you're associating others with Allah they claim and say no we're just taking them as intercede means of intercession they are interceding for us at the sight of Allah this is exactly what shik is and you will find inshallah the answer to all these confusing problems to some while you go through these uh um short episodes inshallah it will be uploaded to the internet and with the grace of Allah asael we will try our level best to make it as simple as possible hoping that it does not exceed 7even to 8 minutes I may cheat somewhere here or there minus or plus but hopefully it would be within the range or of s to 8 minutes and I pray to Allah asael that he benefits me first of all from it and benefits you from it as well and also benefits those who may Allah reward them greatly who contributed in making these uh short series and with this I conclude our first segment so I Leave You"
