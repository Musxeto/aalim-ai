  "transcript": "a brother sent us an email saying that my father yells at me a lot he curses me a lot most of the time for no reason at all he used to hit me when I was a child I'm suffering from PS or from PTSD because of him if I try to avoid him he gets very angry is it permissible to leave such a father this is problematic and unfortunately it is reoccurring in a lot of the Muslims homes not only with their father but also with their mother and some would be having problems with their in-laws whether a father-in-law or a mother-in-law the answer to this query is dividing the two types one and advice to the parents you have to fear allah azza wajal it is true that Allah has given you powers over your children it is true that Allah has instructed your children to be dutiful obedient and respectful nevertheless do not think for a second that Allah Azza WA JAL will not hold you accountable for your abuse for your unfairness for not being just with the children for yelling at them without any reason for mistreating them for no apparent reason do not think for a second that Allah so gel would not hold you accountable Allah will so do not force your children to be disobedient it's Haram this is unfair because you're pushing them to sin fear allah azzawajal be fair with them be just with them and try to put yourself in their shoes with your parents and how you were acting at that time the second part of the advice would be for the children themselves first of all people are tested with different types of tests one would ask why did allah azza wajal put us in the first place on earth the answer is to worship Him and part of worshipping allah azza wajal is that we are tested do people think that they will will be let alone without being tested no there will be tested so it would be a parent who is dutiful obedient and who is not now having said that there are people you and I know about that are tested by various types of tests if you look at our brothers and sisters all over the world they are displaced kicked out of their own homes some of them are tested by losing a loved one to murders genocide rapes some of them even go further to try and find an honest and honorable way of life and they cross the sea and drown some of them are tested by famine and droughts some are tested by cancer different types of diseases and epidemics some suffer greatly through hunger and illnesses and suffer even greater when they see their loved ones dying in front of them because of such calamities your tests that Allah has chosen for you is your father whose abusive who hits you who curses you would you like to take any of the previously mentioned calamities to be your own testing set would you like to take it instead of what's your suffering at the moment definitely not therefore you have no choice other than being tolerant being patient being respectful to your father not arguing with him not provoking him to do or say things that may result in you answering him back and him becoming a furious furious and angry with you so try to avoid what triggers him try to always give him respect no matter what he says never defend yourself when your father accuses you of something just apologize never argue and say yes but this and that no do not do this and always anticipate the reward from allah azzawajal and things insha'Allah will go through"
