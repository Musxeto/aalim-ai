  "title": "Can Jinn harm humans on their own, without black magic etc? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "so his third question was do the gin can the gin harm us without being called for he says we know that there is black magic sorcery and someone may put a spell on you and the gin act upon such a spell and they may harm you and they may Envy you and they may do something bad for you but would the gym do this on their own the answer is yes this is possible there are stories of gin harming people because they poured hot water without saying bismillah and it's scalded it scalded one of their children and they retaliated by harming that individual people urinating in holes in the ground without saying I will learn in a ship on the regime etc there are many reasons however we must not inflate this in exaggerated in the sense that people would be fearful of gin no human fears gin except if he does not have Eman any believer strongly believes he's got the firm conviction that Allah is our protector and the jinn cannot harm us idea bin Abi Talib in the hadith may Allah be pleased with him the Prophet said assume that the visor the partition between our our our private parts and the eyes of the jinn so that they cannot see us is to say bismillah when you recite you're at car in the morning in the evening before you go to bed after the five fourths a lot before you go out before you enter the lavatories and the toilets you are fully protected the jinn cannot even come close to you so do not make a big issue out of it thinking that whoa if they can harm us if they can if they can kill us without anyone telling them to do so then I'm in deep trouble no you're not keep your earth car and allah azzawajal would protect you and we'll keep you safe now what kind of harm can they bring us we are told that the plague is part of the effect of our Brethren's from the jinn so they may have some hand or influence in spreading epidemics we know that for the plague itself but why not other illnesses and diseases this is all possible so as I said keep tight with your wrath Karan inshallah you will be safe"
