  "transcript": "why do women need to go for or why do men need to make W to pray answer Allah said why do women need M to travel because Allah said so the prophet said it is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah and the day of judgment to travel without a a man stood from the crowd and said oh prophet of Allah my name was registered in an expedition for Jihad for battle we have to go with an expedition but my wife went for H the prophet did not ask is she beautiful or ugly is she young or old is she alone or with a trustworthy companionship of women he did not ask any this of these questions he simply said leave the Expedition and go and accompany your wife to emphasize that a woman traveling on her own is totally prohibited why women by Nature are are vulnerable if you see a woman walking on her own she is a prey to Predators even if you're flying for a 6 hours fight and you choose or you do not choose your seat is next to me so the first half an hour we are straight fa and then the second half an hour you you drop this oh thank you thank you thank you and after one or 2 hours mashallah this is Shan in the making you don't see this I see it on PLS I travel a lot oh  you sit next to women no I don't I don't I see what is potentially happening not that I doubt every woman that travels alone that she will fall into wrong hands no but as long as the possibility is there Islam protects the Predators and the victims and the Comm not don't get offended so this is a fact Islam protects the community it's not for some a single person to say no I can drink a bottle of Scotch without being wasted so it's Hal not even a drop is Hal so yeah but it does not toxicate me it intoxicate the general public so it becomes har now so it's become problem so this is totally prohibited and and Haram and it illustrates whether you are a proper Muslim or not what do you mean Islam is submission so you have to submit your will and part of submitting your will that not everything is logical true or wrong for example a CF comes to me and said I've watched your videos and it was shocked they're very nice they're very eloquent and Mah you are very knowledgeable thank you I know so I fixed my Minds I'm much more than that but okay he said tell me about Islam Islam is a beautiful religion saying the Shah praying fasting praying I love praying how do I pray oh we pray five times a day Mall every single day we pray only on Sunday so know we pray every day five times and in Friday it's the major prayers what to do when you want to pray said we wash our hands three times we rinse our mouth three times we sniff water and take it out blow it out three times we wash our faces and arms and wipe overhead and wash our feet you do this three times I say yes every prayer so this is 15 times a day minimum Subhan Allah I wash my face once every day and you wash your feet 15 times a day your religion is a religion of Purity I love your religion this is Islam my friend she what happens if you don't have water so nothing you just hit the floor and the sand with your hand and WIP your face excuse me so yes you hit the soil and you wipe your face in your hand this is not excuse me this can't be you just telling me about purity and cleanliness and washing and now you're telling me to dust my face this is not logical [Music] said what do I say to him this is religion this is Islam this is an illustration and a proof whether you are submitting your will to Allah or you a pH baloney you to you take and choose what you want that is why we call people the Quran and Sunnah 99% of whatever is in Islam is logical but it is not a determining factor that you are convinced in order to implement because in you're not a Muslim and that is why the prophet in meccah was ordered to face Jerusalem in prayer when they went into med they were ordered to Face the People 180Â° the people started talking what is this he doesn't know where to face face left face right Allah revealed an ay in we have not made the which was changed except a test so that we would know who would comply and follow and who would return on his back on his heels and not comply so I hope this in in a way gives you a road map to all Allah's instructions when he says to you Haram you say I comply why maybe this adds value but I will not wait for your response why to implement I will Implement and on the way can you give me examples and justifications I may come up with some I may not but at the end of the day I am submitting my will to Allah did you want to ask a question yeah you have please uh thank you very much for sharing to us imparting to us these gems of advice and jewels of information I ask Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala to accept this humble Gathering of ours from all of us a mean uh she my question relates to this um particular thing at at least as I have found it uh as I find it uh part particular thing particular matter in marriage I know you have prev previously referred as to your half of De but Che I really want this to hear from you in person does the right of woman to her choice her en her entitlement to her choice for marriage entails entail that she can say know to a righteous woman known of his righteousness or at least it appears so she canot marry a woman she can say no to sorry can she can a woman say no without any weight of guilt or consigns to a righteous man none of his righteousness or at least it appears so okay that's all that's okay yes okay first of all the question is clearly a man proposes to my daughter he's righteous he is well known good uh ethics good uh uh conduct scenario number one I want my daughter to marry him and when you are in my shoes you want your daughters to get married as soon as possible before you die because of my old age I have 13 daughters with the grace of Allah no boys I think I'm growing a uterus I don't know I'm I'm finding it but I've been living around women all of my life so I know exactly how they think uh S one I want her to marry scenario two she comes to me and says Daddy I met a man and I fell in love with him and we would like to get married so kindly approve of that so in these two scenarios you understand that it takes two to tango Islamic Tang no music has to be but this is not our meaning a woman cannot marry against her will and she cannot marry against the will of her guardian her wedding you have to have two to get the marriage done so if I want to force my wife my daughter to marry the marriage is void whether I hit her I beat her and smack her she has all the right to say no she is righteous he's practicing if he's righteous and practicing you marry him she is the one who's getting married she has all the right to block and say I don't want he's Rich my is Rich he is uh righteous his General uh conduct and and and and and ethics are on the highest yes but I don't find any chemistry I don't like him I hate his guts I don't like his looks I don't like his name she's the one who's getting married she has all the right to refuse is she sinful no because you cannot cheat you can lead a horse to water he goes to the water you cannot force the horse to drink this is something that the horse has to do of his own choice second scenario she comes to me and I met this boy I fell in love and with M Rome and Juliet I want to marry him the father has the right to block said no he is not from your country is this a valid reason yes I'm the guarden she's my daughter tomorrow when she's divorced I have to bring her back to my home and bear the consequences children wise Financial wise Etc so he is not from your country he is not religious he has been a Playboy for so long and you know and he's still existing he has this he has that I as a guardian have a A choer or a a helicopter view that the girl doesn't see to know I love him I love him I love him no marriage I say no it's no so I hope this clarifies it a little bit we find problems in people falling in love Yeah but he loves her and she loves him and you block him I judge according to what I see as well as I see that this man is good for you and you're refusing I respect that this is your god [Music] right what does one have to do with the Salah that he has missed that's one the word Sal second question from playing tricks with your friends and telling them that it is Magic is it allow in Islam now the first question the prophet said in an authentic Hadith whoever over sleeps a prayer or forgets it must pray it immediately as soon as he remembers it there is no quote unquote experation other than that so praying it as soon as you remember or as soon as you walk there this is the what experation come on I was asleep I didn't do any sin why is it called experation two I forgot I was busy working I didn't even hear the aan and all of a sudden the Sun is setting I didn't pray a I I wasn't intentional so the prophet says there is no expiation other than praying it immediately as as you remember from this Hadith Scholars said whoever intentionally misses a prayer until the time is done there is no explation for that because it was in Allah says in [Music] the that prayer was prescribed upon the Believers at specific times so someone coming to perform ha books a ticket books the hotel books the count and reaches J on the eth of when is when is on the nth the following day he's held for a mistake in his Visa so they take him into custody for 3 or 4 days and then they release him and he's in his so he goes to on the 14th of where everybody has gone back to their homes from Min and he stands in with his umbrella until sunset is his H valid why because Allah prescribed Haj to be on the day of not before not after it's prescribed likewise the five daily prayers Allah prescribed them at specific time in the Hadith of J he led the prayer of the Prophet for two days in the beginning of the time and the second day at the end of the time he told oh Muhammad the time of prayers is between these two and this is where when when we where we learn that time is essential for the prayer therefore the previous prayers are gone they're over can I make them up no what is prayer AA prayer is if you wake up and you missed it you pray if you forgot it so many times not so many times sometimes I go with the family off-roading camping for few hours so we go from we pray M there and after M we drive home by the time we reach home it's an hour and a half after so we go I shower and I do things I get the stuff into the home because I'm used to praying is every single day in the Masid I assumed that I was I pray that this is human nature I forget I remember a week later I said oh look what have I done I didn't pray that day one week later I pray because my justification my reason is yes someone who does not pray intentionally go and pray I'm watching TV go pray I don't feel like it maybe later some people when they travel they at the end of the day so they pray 17 at before going to bed is invalid Allah will not accept it it's void it's the only prayer that is prayed online so I hope this answers your question second one is the other one is people play tricks with their friends and telling them it's magic this is an issue of dispute among Scholars is the slight of hand considered to be magic which is Haram because we know that one of the seven major sins is Magic and we know that inak magic leads to kuur and an act of apostasy like har and they said that we are if you learn from us you will become a c so Scholars looked the majority of them looked at the slightest hand to be magic and they consider it to be prohibited and this is the safest opinion others said no magic is divided into two types A type that may kill and they consider medication part of this magic so potions that you add into someone's food and cause their illness and death is considered to be black magic magic that you use chin so I can use the Gin to steal things and I can use the Gin to know things about you like hypnosis when I use hypnosis I'm using gin though you don't see me on America talent using any gin but you see me doing it so this is part of the black magic which is Haram and Jin do not come to you and serve you because you're a righteous person you have to commit kufur you have to Pro to them you have to write the Quran in men's blood or step on the Quran so that you show your kuur that they can help you they will insulate you become a mush so Scholars said that this is one part which is clearly har but the other part which is not clearly Haram because I am using my slight of hand so a rope that looks one piece I can make it into two pieces and I put something in my sleeve and I get a rabbit from here and I do this and that this is obvious the most authentic opinion is that to be safe this is something that deals with Haram in major sense that all is not [Music] perable okay uh is there anybody asking question please give the mic ABD Asam as you have mentioned before about the woman traveling so I got dogs can she work also or can she do job or it's about traveling to only umra or what if she have to buy grocery can she go alone or not in Arabic the world the word that travel which is prohibited for them sit down uh the word travel is translated into suffer unfortunately English is an inferior language that it is a weak language so also travel means going from here toas you travel but in Arabic it's not called s it's commuting so commuting within the vicinity of the city you do not require a not you do not require she does not require a she can drive if it's safe though I have my doubts I'm not going to go into this I'm from Saudi Arab but nothing got nothing personal again so she can drive to this you call it we call strange names um Supermarket to the mall to whatever to go visit people on her own she's within the vicinity of Kuwait if she said I want to go toah or to the m which is 4 hours stride it's very close it is prohibited because this is called traveling where she shortens prayer combines prayer she can skip fasting Ramadan all the whole nine yards now can she work she can't work she's working in her home can she work in an office if the environment in the office is Islamic yes she can if it's an old girl school not a single person say that this is har it's all girls no men she can work if she's working in a company with a department totally isolated for women with their own bathrooms there's no mixing between men and women totally but if she's sitting next to me in the office for 8 hours single day she sits with her colleague more than she sits with her husband she sits sits with her colleague more than she sees her parents and siblings and whenever she goes to work she spends half an hour putting the makeup ey Foundation this and that and Mah SPO products all over the place and perfect perfect perect perfect perfect and Mah the locals here put this hump H and some hair coming out and the eyelashes Mah you can skate on them what is this and she never does this to her husband M she never ever in her home when there's no work she's like a gorilla her head is so untiy her teeth are crooked and her eyes have no makeup nothing but she completely transforms like the transformer in the morning because he's going to work and me because I'm going to work as well I have to be clean shaving I have to put uh Old Spice it hurts I have to wear my nice suit my ti I have to be very diplomatic and delicate and yes oh thank you when I am with my wife at home whenever I command her to do something or ask her to do something it's with a baseball bat she knows she understands two strikes or none so this shows you that mixing is's plan such job definitely are not perers in Islam and Allah"
