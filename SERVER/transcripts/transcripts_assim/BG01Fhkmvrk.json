  "transcript": "Muhammad from the US Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam My question is, would it be haram for me to address the disbelievers with honorific titles such as Sir and Ma'am regardless of whether or not I'm in the workplace and just with the intention of being polite and civil? Thank you Jazak Allah Khairan Wa Jazak There is no problem, none whatsoever in showing respect to the disbelievers with something that is normal and does not give them superiority or an edge. Saying Sir to a disbeliever or Ma'am to a non-Muslim is totally permissible, there is nothing wrong in that. In the Hadith, the Prophet Alayhis Salatu Wassalam addressed one of the dignitary of the disbelievers, the idol worshippers by his nickname. And he said, have you finished Abul Waleed? And he did not call him by his name directly, rather he nicknamed him by Abul Waleed, which is a sign of respect. There is no problem in respecting people by addressing them. You don't go to the president of a country who is a disbeliever and say, hey, Tom, John, Dick or Harry. No, you say Sir, your, I don't know what they call them. But there is no problem addressing the Queen or the King by saying Your Majesty, addressing the judge by Your Lord, the Lord or whatever they call them. These are signs or titles given to them that does not show supremacy or superiority to a person. In Islam, it is not permissible to call a disbeliever or a hypocrite, a Sayyid. And the Prophet said Alayhis Salatu Wassalam that there is a prohibition that to call him a Sayyid, the master, because this indicates that if he's your master, then you've angered your Lord. And Allah Azza wa Jall knows best. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah Azza wa Jall, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
