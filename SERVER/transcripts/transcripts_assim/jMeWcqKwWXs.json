  "title": "Cutting nails, removing pubic & armpit hair before Friday prayer or before ihram? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "clipping ones nails and removing any hair that is recommended to be removed such as shaving the pubic hair or plucking the air armpit hair or trimming one's mustache they say that all of these things are also recommended these things are part of the fitrah so it's recommended without limiting it to a particular Amada so in the books of sometimes you find these things mentioned when getting prepared for a harem before wearing the hump yet scholars in their authentic opinion said that this is not part of preparing for June 1 and it is not part of preparing for Haram simply because though these things are good to remove and to perform as characteristics of the filtra yet it was never directed to us by the prophet alayhi salatu salam and hence one should not relate it to it so if you do it on regular basis every friday before friday Juwanna thinking that it is part of the job and this is wrong you should not do it do it any other day do it Thursday morning do it after the gym wanna whatever you want but if you do it because it's more convenient not that you ever thought in a blue moon that this might be something recommended then there is no problem in that insha'Allah"
