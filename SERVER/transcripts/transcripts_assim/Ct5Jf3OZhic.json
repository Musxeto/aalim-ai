  "transcript": "Oma says what's the ruling on boys and girls having platonic relationship they're just friends without any Haram feelings simply hanging out and being buddies you have to ask yourself what do I want to follow Shar or to follow my whims and desires it's a very simple question when you want to follow your whims and desires as many people do and they say clearly we don't want Quran and Sunnah we want logic we want what the people are doing we want this and that in this case this is not our territory and we cannot speak with such people but when people as real Muslim Muslims say no we want to follow Shar of course what do you think do you see a cross hanging on my chest I'm I'm a Muslim I'm I'm what do you think I want to follow of course Shar when we follow Shar and we go and check what Islam says about the issue of platonic relationship we found that this does not exist we find that free mixing is totally prohibited in Islam we find that the prophet saidat no man would be alone with a woman in seclusion except the third one with them would be Shan we find that Allah Asel orders women to lower their gaze and not to soften their voices when speaking to the opposite gender so that the one with illness in his heart would not be tempted we find that Islam prohibits a woman from wearing perfume where there is a possibility for a nonaham to find the scent of her perfume it's prohibited and if she doesn't abide by this ruling and she wears it then the prophet described her as a fornicator and the list goes on and on which means that there is no such thing as platonic relationship I saw a clip the other day for a celebrity he's American a non-muslim his name is Steve Harvey I think he hosts a program called Family Feud or something like that and he's a comedian he used to be and he was asked do you have friends among the females he said no I don't have any any female friends so the interviewer was asking him why is that he was reluctant but then he spilled it all out he said don't believe that there is a friendship between a man and a woman and all the men that are your friends he's talking to the interviewer who's a female all the men who are your friends are your friends because you're blocking them the moment they see a crack in the door the moment they see an opening or a chance they will definitely take it as he says and you will see fireworks he says no man on Earth would hesitate to seize the moment and this guy is not a Muslim but he speaks from F Subhan Allah he speaks from Human Nature and he's the logical person and Subhan Allah I wish I could meet him and discuss a few things with him because he seems like a very reasonable and logical man that you may easily present Islam to him and he may become a Muslim because he's a logical person but Subhan Allah anyhow so there's not a such a thing as platonic relationship the moment a man can find a way he would take this chance as he said as Steve Harvey says you will see fireworks so definitely according to Shar this is prohibited and Haram"
