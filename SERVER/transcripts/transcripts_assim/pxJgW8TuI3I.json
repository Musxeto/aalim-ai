  "transcript": "Sheikh, how to handle unstable feeling after waqt ta'arif? Handle? How to handle unstable feeling? Unstable feeling? After waqt ta'arif. So maybe he already done ta'arif, but maybe he got rejected, we don't know. And he has upside down and roll over feeling. Ta'arif? How to make it settle? Ta'arif with the same gender? No, no, no. What kind of ta'arif is it with the opposite gender? I go and make ta'arif with khutbah. If it's a khutbah and you go and propose to a woman and she rejects you, this is from Allah. This is a gift from Allah. Imagine if you were to get married and maybe have two or three children and then discover that she has anger issues and that she is a professional MMA and she beats you every day or she knows good silat and she beats you every single day. What will happen? You will say, I wish no ta'arif. Alhamdulillah, this is it. Always see in whatever happens to you that this is gift and ni'mah from Allah. And this is what Allah mentions in the Quran. May you hate something and then Allah puts goodness in it. Sometimes you marry someone and you think that this is bad marriage for you. And you think of divorce, maybe this, maybe that. Two or three years later, I come and say, how are things? He said, mashallah, everything is beautiful, we are so in love, we love one another, we have children. What about three years ago? You were fighting. He said, no, no, no, this is shaitan. Alhamdulillah, it's all gone. So you never know how things change by the grace of Allah. Alhamdulillah."
