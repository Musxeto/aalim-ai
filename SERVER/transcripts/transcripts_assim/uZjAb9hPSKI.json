  "transcript": "Xena says a friend of mine claims that we should not say that Allah is on the throne because it will mean that Allah holds physical space but if Allah does not have physical existence then it means he is just in imagination but that he is just an imagination and how can someone see an imagination whereas Allah has promised to show himself to the people of Jannah Xena these issues are very sensitive as I love Sunnah wal Jamaa as believers of the Quran and the Sunnah with the understanding of the three favored generations we do not use our logic when it comes to allah azza wajal so when it comes to a lot beautiful names and our attributes we do not say that this is logical this is not logical how can we say this how can this happen this is unacceptable we did not see allah azza wajal and Allah cannot be imagined so how dare someone ask a question or deny something from the Quran and the Sunnah this is exactly your friend what he's doing this is exactly what the jamia did when they made all the names and attributes of allah azza wajal without any value so allah azzawajal is all hearing but he doesn't hear how is that allah they made a lot exactly as they define vacuum so when they wanted to describe allah they said Allah is not up as law is not down Allah is not in front Allah is not back Allah is not on the right Allah is not in the left Allah does if you want to describe something that does not exist would fit as a glove and this is wrong now as Alison devil Gemara we only believe in the names and attributes that Allah had told us about them in the Quran or that the Prophet himself sallallahu alaihi wa sallam told us about in the Sunnah that's it no one can come from out of the blue and say that well Allah's beautiful Nami name is so-and-so where do you get this name from Quran Sunnah said no sin then this is unacceptable likewise when you come to talk about allah azza wajal does not hold a physical space the issue of holding a physical space was not told to us neither in the Quran and the Sunnah so when you say such a statement we have to know exactly what do you mean if you mean that Allah Azza WA JAL does not exist like the jamia has explained and that he is nowhere nothing and and the likes all negative attributes in this case no this is wrong we know that allah azzawajal exists we know that allah is above his throne and his throne is the ceiling of the of paradise and that allah is above all and Allah is in the height in Arabic we say this is Emma Fatima does not mean in the heavens because nothing can surround Allah Azza WA JAL but it means Allah is in the height Allah is above and high over everything likewise to say that Allah has no image Allah has no body the issue of body was not mentioned to us in the coronation so we do not affirm it no negated we say it's an innovation to come to attribute it to allah azza wajal we don't say Allah is not and we don't say that Allah is so the are things that philosophers came up with to confuse Muslims Muslims belief in a larger beautiful names and attributes now to say that allah azza wajal does not or does hold the physical space this is not correct generally this is too generic if one means that Allah does not exist in in in any form this is wrong if someone says no Allah exists and we know that he's above his throne above all creation we say that this is true and correct and Allah Azza WA JAL knows best"
