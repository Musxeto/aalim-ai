  "title": "Making up missed fasts for deceased mother | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "her third question was that she got well but she did not fast hoping to be postponed until December and she died so would it be recommended that we fast for her the answer depends on her situation if her illness was chronic and the doctors say that she will never ever be able to fast in the future in this case she is exempted and she should pay the fee dia for every day missed so this is case one if you agree then you do not have to fast anything the doctors told her you may never fast after today until you die and she felt a little bit better yet the warning was there and the prohibition a restriction of the doctors was there in this case you don't have to do anything if not if the doctors say that this is a phase but inshallah she'll be able to fast in the future in this case yes you must make up for these days you and your siblings and her relatives you can divide the days each one of you fast one days until these days are made up insha Allah"
