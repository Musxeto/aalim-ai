  "transcript": "Muhammad says what's the ruling on leasing a house because people tell me it's Reba and I don't understand how it can be Reba since we're not paying or giving any Reba to anyone I need some clarification first of all Muhammad Reba is different categories Tribble fuddled ribbon SE era bell curve etc I'm not gonna go through this usually the most well-known type of Reba is the Reba that is related to the debt so the more time span is added the higher that that is time of payment is 1st of March give me my money it says I can't okay I'll delay you couple of months but you will have to pay me 5% extra this is Reba so is asking about leasing houses leasing houses leasing property is nothing wrong in that if it is true leasing meaning I get your apartment for 800 or $1000 a month a deal a deal done so this is no problem every month I give you $1,000 there's no problem in that none whatsoever there is nothing hidden meaning that after 20 years I will possess this apartment no it's simple renting like renting a car in there's not nothing wrong in that when does it become a Reba when people flip it and twist it so that it fits their whims and desires so you have a flat an apartment a house and I'm interested on in living in it so I come to you and I say listen I'd like to get your apartment for the next five years is that okay with you said yes I'm leasing said okay how much is the rent and he says $1,000 a month so that makes it twelve thousand dollars that's make like $60,000 for the five years period so I come to you and I say listen I have another proposal I'll give you $200,000 as a deposit so that I can live in this apartment for five years monthly basis I'll give you like $50 or $100 noting peanuts but at the end of the period when I am moving out you return the two hundred thousand dollars back to me and the Landlord said that's a good deal you're on this is RIBA why because actually as a tenant I am lending two hundred thousand dollars to the land Lord and he's benefiting from it he's using whatever he wants to do with it so that he would return it after five years meanwhile me occupying his apartment for five years paying nothing this is the interest over the loan so this is RIBA I don't know that if this is fits what you're doing or you're asking about or not general leasing or renting is halal and there's nothing wrong with it but if it's like I had just described this is totally prohibited but"
