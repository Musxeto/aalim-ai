  "transcript": "what is with warrants question ones question is about the issue of he prayed his fault the then after that car he went to pray the sunnah prayers a late comer came into the masjid saw him praying alone so he tapped him on the shoulder stood to his right and said allahu akbar what should I do I'm praying Cinda should I give him a legal shoulder or an elbow telling him that I'm not right no keep on praying as you are and change your intention from pray praying alone in to praying in a Jamaa in congregation but continue to pray as usual so you praying two rakahs he joined you in the second raka pray as usual when you go for record raise your voice saying Allahu Akbar so that he can follow you as if you are a regular imam in the tashahud offer your salaam and he continues his raka as usual is this possible sure can I change my intention in the middle of the salat yes it is proven in the authentic Sunnah from the hadith of a bath of the allahu anhu ma may allah be pleased with him an with his father he said i slept and spent the night in my aunt's house my moon a mental hadith may allah be pleased with her and i pretended to be sleeping so that i can witness how the prophet has performed so the prophet went into sleep then he woke up he said the doha he made Woodill and then he started to pray a night prayer so the prophet started to pray thinking that he was alone so he was an individual maybe our bass says I joined the Prophet a son but I stood to his left so the Prophet held my ear and made me stand to his right and continued to pray with me so the Prophet change his intention from being an individual into a yes but Jeff I'm praying soon and he's praying for no problem the hadith of my Ottoman jebel may Allah be pleased with them and everyone knows this hadith by heart I hope where he used to spray Asia pray with the Prophet and then goes to his tribe at the outskirts of Medina to lead them in Asia he prays nephal voluntary because he recites the Quran better than anyone else and they pray as followers he's praying Sunnah is bring voluntary and they're praying for prayer there's no problem in that so even if you wear a late comer yourself you join the Imam in the last two Rakas the Imam offers Salam you stand up for your third and fourth raka of war or a sword or whatever and a late comer comes in taps you on the shoulder and joins you no problem after being a follower now you're becoming an imam this happens and there's no problem in that insha Allah and I hope this answers your question"
