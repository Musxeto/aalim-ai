  "transcript": "okay the brother Asif says what's the ruling on downloading or uploading videos on YouTube uploading means that I make videos and I upload them on YouTube and subscribers come and I get revenue from that if the content is halal there is nothing haram committed this is totally legit no problem assume that I make a lecture for an hour and I put it on YouTube and I ask subscribers to pay in order to watch or YouTube has an agreement with me to put halal adds nothing Haram no music no women and they gave me a revenue because of the viewers no problem now downloading is different because there is an agreement between you and YouTube not to download and you may violate copyrights because what you're downloading is a lecture of professor so-and-so who spent so much time money and knowledge to prepare this video and he wanted to make money out of it but now you're coming and downloading it illegally and making money out of it without his consent this is Haram so I hope this makes some sense and you know the difference between uploading your own videos and making money out of it this is your own work and downloading others"
