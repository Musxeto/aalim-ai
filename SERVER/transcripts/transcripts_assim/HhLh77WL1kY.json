  "title": "Why call oneself Salafi Ahle Hadees Sunni when Prophet Sahaba called themselves Muslim assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "listening to you and asking questions since long time I have one questions and I am sincerely seeking knowledge and no bad intentions why is it necessary to call ourselves while the prophet and sahaba called themselves only Muslim I have heard from many that this calling name is done to distinguish us from but my question is at the time of profit there will the Hypocrites at the time of sahaba they were hariji but yet they sticks to calling themselves Muslims please clarify my daughter Akbar bye do you call yourself Sunni or Shiri Akbar bye yes sir do you call yourself Sunni or Shiri right now I am seeking knowledge and I call myself only Muslim so if someone says are you Sunni or Shiri what do you say I say I follow the prophet Sunnah you did not answer me are you Sunni or Siri okay Carlos was the prophet Sunni or Shiri for me was he he did not have this label so to answer your question you are 100 correct that the prophet is Assam and the Companions and the sahab and then and that that's happening they did not label themselves as such simply because these deviant forces or sex or Cults had no weight and had no presence so you don't look at them except as you look and regard them as insects you don't pay attention to them after these favorite Generations when they started to mount up and have momentum when the people of logic the people of innovation the people of ahuah and whims and desires started to rise and be backed up by some of the authorities the Deviant authorities like in the times of moon uh um when we have when we had Al martezilla and those who came afterwards and you have the Asha Iran maturity and all of these sects who had the backing of some governments then we started to think of the need of labeling ourselves to identify ourselves now do I call myself salafi no I don't go around say I'm a salafi although technically speaking to everyone when they identify my Akida when they identify my men Hajj when they identify my methodology of thinking they would say oh he is ETC so I don't go around and brag about it because I don't have to I don't have to prove myself to others but as I've answered I've asked you when you come to a fork of the road and someone says are you this or that you wouldn't say no I would identify myself as a Muslim someone asks you a blatant a straightforward question are you salafi or maturity what would you say of course I'm a salafi I follow the methodology of the Prophet Sam his companions the tabirino tabirin now you on the other hand who are you following he dares not to say the Prophet The Companions and the taberi because he knows that he's a liar he says I'm following even collab I'm following [Music] I'm following this I'm following that then with all due respect there is a difference so you don't go around carrying a label or a flag saying that I'm this I'm that I'm a Muslim full stop but when the need arises then you have to identify yourself and tell people your belief without any shame or without being embarrassed because we're proud of being the followers of the Prophet Allah"
