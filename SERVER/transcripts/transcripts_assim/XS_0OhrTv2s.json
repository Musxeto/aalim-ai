  "transcript": "and he was happy he remain dear brothers and sisters in Islam Salaam alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh the fifth hadith in alberene and Noah we in the book that lMNO he compiled is narrated by Aisha may Allah be pleased with her and she says that the prophet of allah salallahu alaihe wasalam said he who innovates something in the nature of ours that is Islam which is not of it will have it rejected and this was reported by Bukhari and Muslim in another version reported by Muslim she said that the Prophet said arrazolo Salam he who does an act which we have not commanded will have it rejected now this hadith is one of the two or three Hadees that Islam revolves around if you remember the first hadith is the hadith that deals with the intention so your deeds will never be accepted unless your intention is solely for allah azzawajal so you have to have sincerity the hadith of a monopod in Nam and I'm a Lavinia verily that deeds are judged by their intentions the second hadith is the hadith of mother Aisha which deals with the compatibility with the Sunnah of the Prophet irresolution in our forms of worship and these two virgins relate two different things the first hadeeth deals with the innovator and the second hadith deals with the one who follows an innovator so by this we believe that those who innovate their deeds are rejected and those who follow innovative things their days as well are rejected the scale as scholars say between the visible forms of worship and the concealed forms of worship are judged by these two head the concealed forms of worship are judged by the hadith of Roma the deeds are judged by their intention my intention no one knows about it except a lot of it and the visible forms of worship are judged by hadith of Aisha melodies with her because whatever you do it has to have the compatibility with the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salaatu Astana as mentioned in the Quran in the last ayah of surah al-kahf the chapter that deals with the cave Allah tells us that who ever wants to meet Allah Allah on the day of judgement he has to have these two conditions he should not associate others with Allah and he should offer righteous and good deeds and the deeds are never righteous and they're never good unless they are in fellowship of the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and if you do not follow the Prophet as I am then your deeds are rejected the hadith is talking about innovations and there are so many innovations in the world there are innovations that nullify a person system so who innovates in Islam something that is considered to be cover or shake this nullifies your Deen there are innovations that do not nullify your Islam but it affects it it decreases these levels of a man of yours to the lowest levels such as people innovating forms of worship celebrations Mawlid for example celebrating the birthday of the Prophet assemble this is an innovation people innovating forms of worship instead of doing this they do that and Allah does not accept deeds unless they are following the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam sometimes people do things originally they can be accepted in the sense that it is part of Islam but they add things to it and this is not accepted at all remember two conditions for Allah two forms of worship sincerity and following the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam allah says in the second eye of Sirte bark allah - a local motor will hired it is Allah who created death and life to test you who among you is the most perfect in deeds party had said the most perfect indeed he did not say the most in quantity he said the most perfect of you indeed and you cannot have a deed perfect unless it is following the Sunnah of the Prophet lessor and you have sincerity in it now what is an innovation innovation is inventing something in the region so that you would compare it to the Shariah so you can follow it and this is something fabricated this is something elevated it is extremely dangerous to innovate in Islam why if you ask people they say the elevators we did this only to get closer to allah azzawajal and this is very dangerous so many people when the enovate they say that our intention is to get closer to Allah Azza WA JAL not knowing that they are getting further and further from Allah subhana WA Ta'ala how do you know hadith is crystal clear whoever innovates in our religion what's not part of it this is rejected abdullah al masud may allah be pleased with him was informed once while he was in allah that there is a group of people joining in the masjid circling one of them they're having a circle and one sits in the middle and he has a pile of stones and he tells them say Allahu Akbar thirty times so they count on these stones Allah for Allah for Allah for Allah and then say save subhanAllah thirty times and they do the same so he immediately went with his companions to that Masjid and when he looked at them he addressed them and he said Subhan Allah glory be to Allah soldier either you know more than the companions of the prophet alayhi salatu salam or you have brought a deviant innovation and they said to him we're remembering allah he said the companions of the prophet as some are around you the Prophet recently died his clothes are not worn out yet his plates are not broken how do you do what you're doing they said oh even my suit by Allah our intention is sincere for him we only intended well he told them there are so many people who intend well and do wrong and so many who intend well would not attain it would not reach it and by Allah this what you're doing is an innovation the narrator of the hadith says I looked on the day where the Huaraz were killed by ali and the majority of Huaraz were from that masjid which indicates that innovation is an evil thing Allah does not accept these innovations from the people not only that Allah Azza WA JAL punishes those who innovate in the religion of Allah why their intention was good didn't you say yourself that Rama hopup said that the Prophet said Allison I'm deeds are judged by their intention the answer is yes but you have to have with the intention as mentioned earlier the second condition for Allah to accept your deeds and that is that you have to comply you have to follow the Sunnah of the Prophet area so if one of these two conditions is not fulfilled then Allah does not accept your form of worship and those who innovate they are one of the two and both are in hell may Allah protect us from Hellfire when you innovate in Allah's religion you are either saying that my innovation which the Prophet did not do Alice awesome which the companions did not do may Allah be pleased with them my innovation is invented and innovated because the Prophet Allah system and his companions did not know that it was a good thing to do now you're accusing the Prophet there is a sum of ignorance and who does this is a kafir how dare you say that I'm introducing something the Prophet as Sam and his companions did not know that it was a good thing the Prophet himself eraser and said there is nothing that is good for you that gets you closer to Allah that I did not teach you anything that is good for you I taught you and I brought it to you so if you accuse the Prophet as some of ignorance then you're a kafir and the man says no no no no don't get me wrong no the Prophet has none knew about my innovation the thing I'm doing the Prophet knew that it was good but he did not tell us and this is even worse because you're accusing the Prophet Allah the Sun of treason you're accusing him that he did not tell us what draws us closer to allah azza wajal and whoever does this is a kafir as well we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back [Music] and as easy they all might not always [Music] and we do the our luggage at the word the acceptor of your return I was Apple the

alaikum and welcome back I know this is hard and it's a bit harsh but so many times truth hurts yet reality has to be known to all if you innovate in the religion of Allah you are a Muslim follow the Quran and Sunnah and follow your scholars if they're following the Quran Sunnah but if they bring something that is not in the Quran and Sunnah you cannot follow them blindly it has to be in the Quran and Sunnah if you have the ability to research it it's a must that you cross-reference from the Quran from the sooner so that you know that you are not innovating because if you do innovate if you are doing what so many people do in prayers for example you find people after concluding their prayer there blowing something in their shirts and so many times I look try to peep and see what are they blowing what they're doing so many people after they conclude their prayer they put their hands on their heads as if they're going to fly okay what are you doing they said no this is this this is that I said okay I'm fine with that did the Prophet do otário Sarah this is know that the Companions do it said no so why are you doing it because Mawlana so-and-so does it Subhan Allah this is an innovation if the Prophet hasn't did not do it the Companions did not do it this is a clear innovation this is bid ah you should stay away from and you don't want to accuse the Prophet as some of not knowing where the goodness is and that is why he did not teach us this because this is covered and you don't want to accuse the profit as sum of betraying his Ummah by knowing that this is good and he is not teaching it to us because this is covered as well so you have no other option but to follow the profit alleys of Salaam and I call all the brothers and sisters watching this don't listen to me listen to what the Quran and the Sunnah say so if you are worshiping Allah scrutinize and filter all what you do does it fall in line with the Quran and Sunna if yes keep on doing it if not then know that you are in great danger because ia tells us may Allah be pleased with her that the Prophet tells us some understanding that this is rejected now whatever things we do they have to have six conditions so that they are accepted and these conditions are the reason the type the quantity how it's done when it's done and where it's done and I'll give you example the reason whatever you do that isn't behind doing it has to comply with the Sunnah of the Prophet Elisha Lobster I'll give you an example now pray 2 rakaats voluntary rokkes is it a good deed all muslims say excellent do it but if a person makes it as a habit whenever he enters his house he prays two Rakas the reason is not justifiable because the Prophet did not do it I saw some companions did not do it you got this reason from where from your own whims and desires this is an innovation so the reason has to be in accordance to the Sunnah of the Prophet Allah so sir another example we have Adel Fatah we have written out how to feasts and needs in Islam someone comes and says listen re the occasion of the Battle of butter where Allah granted victory to the Muslims this is a beautiful occasion said yes is true said ok every single year in Ramadan we will have a day of celebration to commemorate this great battle of butter and we will give candies to the children and we will slaughter a sheep and we will gather our loved ones and eat it how is that said nope this is an innovation since why because the reason you're doing this was at the time of the Prophet is awesome and he did not do it secondly it has to be in compliance of the type meaning we know that in the read of al-adha the read of Hajj we slaughter a sheep as a sacrifice and a form of gratitude to Allah Azza WA JAL we call it up here it can be sheep cow or a camel now in some countries there are so-called scholars and they are people of ignorance they told their countrymen they told their citizens that it's permissible to slaughter chicken instead so each sheep is equivalent to like 40 or 50 chickens slaughtered those and this is acceptable sacrifice what do we say to them this is ignorance this is an innovation since why it's meat this is meat but Allah only permitted us to slaughter three times as sacrifices over here or as heady camel house and sheep you cannot go and fish a whale and say this is out here for a lot so it said though the meat is more you cannot slaughter chicken you cannot slaughter a horse a horse is more valuable than a camel or a sheep or a cow and we are permitted to eat horse meat but can you sacrifice this on read there's no why because the type was not permitted for us by the Sunnah of Prophet alayhi salatu salam so this person is doing an innovation the third is the quantity so when you do something it has to be in compliance to the sooner the that is so if someone wanted to pray for records of Maghrib we say this is rejected why one more rock is good say no it's not good because the quantity is reformatted to forfeiture you cannot add and you cannot subtract if someone wants to perform Wooten and instead of washing his limbs three times he said I'm going to add one more so I will wash my arms four times I say this is not acceptable and it will not be permitted for you to do this and if you do it it's rejected like the hadith of Aisha that we're discussing fourthly it has to be in compliance with the way that the Prophet did that is not to say for example if someone comes and he wants to pray and instead of doing rock or then standing up then doing sujood he said no the first rock art I'm going to do sujood first and then I'll send up and do a cool afterwards this is not the way that the Prophet as Islam prayed and he did not tell us to pray in this format likewise once a person wants to perform woudl he says I'm going to first wash my feet then wash my face then wash my arms then wipe over my head we say this is void it's rejected that's why it says because the format the way of doing it is not in accordance to the Sunnah of the Prophet erased Allah - sir the fifth condition that is deeply needed is the timing allah azza wajal prescribed forms of worship and specific times if you do these forms of worship before the time it's not accepted if you do it after the time it's not accepted Allah says in no salata can eternal many negative and makuta verily that prayer was prescribed on specific timings meaning if someone wants to pray Maghrib before sunset and he prays money what do we say to him your prayer is invalid it's void he says I started saying Allahu Akbar and three seconds later the Sun completely set and the van was called I say you prayer is invalid because you cannot initiate and begin your prayer until the Sun sets if a person comes and does not pray Lord until author was called for what is his prayer you see your prayer is invalid why I'm gonna pray it now we asked him why didn't you pray it before Islam I was busy I was lazy did you forget about traitors no no I knew that the time was due but I said let me pray it later on the answer is your prayer is void and you cannot make up for your book or prayer so it is extremely essential that you pray it on time imagine someone coming from Europe to perform Hajj and he reaches the airport and it is a problem with his visa and they postpone him for two or three days and he is admitted the second day of Eid we know that alpha is on the 9th the 8th is on the 10th so the man was admitted to Saudi Arabia or to the holy shrines on the 11th he goes straight to alpha and he stands in out of on his own what are you doing he says I was late due to this and that so now I'm performing my Hajj is it acceptable no he's standing in a lava instead of the knife he's standing on the 11th so his hatch is rejected the sixth and last one is the location so he has to perform the form of worship where allah azzawajal instructed us to do it so if someone wants to make arity calf which is known as seclusion wants to do at the calf we know that we have to do at the calf in the message he says no I'm gonna do it in my office I have a lot of work or a woman says I'm going to do it in my home is this acceptable the answer is no and it's rejected you cannot have attic except in a masjid as the prophet as indicated and as was mentioned in the quran before that so to conclude this the hadith we are prohibited to innovate in the religion of Allah Allah says in the Quran Allah Muhammad will become Dina come today I have completed your religion what mental aleikum near Matty and I perfected my favor and blessing upon you and I have accepted Islam to be your religion so at the time of the Prophet I saw some it was all over and their story the religion is complete you cannot add anything to it and it stays and remains complete until the day of judgement whoever innovates whoever adds something to the religion of Allah Allah would reject this and this is what is known to the scholars as an equitable facade mean yet prohibition and saying do not do this means or is equivalent to the thing is not being accepted so allah azza wajal tells us to be sincere and to follow the prophet Isaiah the prophet tells us whoever innovates is rejected so if someone wanted to get closer to Allah with something that is not from the religion Allah would not accept this like if someone wants to fast voluntary fasting on the day of Eid his fasting is void and he is sinful and his deed is rejected this is all the time we have until we meet an exam via Manila was salam aliekum wa rahamtullah he over a cat"
