  "transcript": "Stephen says if our socks have a hole in them and our big toe comes out of it can we still wipe over such socks as part of our foot got exposed Scholars the majority of them say if the skin is apparent is visible they say you cannot wipe off on it so if the socks are so thin and transparent you can see the foot underneath a lot of the scholars say no you can't wipe over that the most authentic opinion is that you can but just to show you that there is a huge chunk of Scholars who say it's not possible let alone to your toe coming out of it so the most authentic opinion is that if your socks have a small hole or one of the lining is torn and you can see a little of the skin but not all of it they say that this is negligible and is permissible but if a huge amount of the foot is exposed as in some socks you might find that a quarter of the bottom of it is worn out and the skin is visible and Untouchable or in the case of Stephen the whole big toe is out no you cannot wipe over that and Allah Knows Best"
