  "title": "ðŸ†• Can Muslims from India migrate to Non-Muslim counties due to discrimination & brutality?",
  "transcript": "a brother sent a an email he says can an indian muslim along with his family migrate to the west due to the severe discrimination and atrocities against us where it's becoming very dangerous to live anymore the answer is that basically a muslim must not live in a non-muslim country so a rule of thumb muslims are obliged are instructed are ordered to live under the sharia law in a country that governs by sharia law in a country that predominantly is ruled and inhabited by muslims now this is the rule of thumb however when it comes to minorities living in a cafe country such as india if they are unable to practice their religion freely if they are being harassed abused or bullied if we can see them suffering due to how the disbelievers and the kafirs treat them who are the majority so they are unfairly treated inhumanely uh uh dealt with and the atrocities we see the killings the lynching and lately the hijab issue that they have banned muslim girls from wearing in schools and public areas this all indicates that this country is not safe anymore for muslims and alhamdulillah if a muslim is capable of migrating to another muslim country or to live in a muslim country that would be a win-win but unfortunately most if not all muslim countries do not provide the facilities for muslims to migrate to them and therefore such privileged muslims who can travel find a safe haven only in countries that are not muslims in the west so disbelievers in europe in america and canada unfortunately give such professionals not any muslim of course it's all about demand and supply so they give only professionals that would benefit their country citizenship so if this is possible for the muslims to travel to such a non-muslim country where they can practice their religion and their islam freely and most likely they would also be uh able to obtain the citizenship of such countries this is permissible inshallah especially if a person of such nature can utilize his new nationality to relocate to a muslim country for an indian to settle in a muslim country that might be a bit difficult but if he has a canadian passport or a british passport that would be much easier unfortunately as the muslims have this inferiority complex when it comes to western passports and allah mustang you"
