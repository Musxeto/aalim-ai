  "title": "My feet tilt away from qiblah while suppressing wind in sujood, is my prayer valid? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign so my question is sometimes um what if a person suppresses wind inside the solar but then in the process of doing so um they try to keep their feet apart the you know the upper part of the legs just kind of touch each other but then and then the feet kind of tilt and um sometimes they go out of the Qibla and sometimes they don't but that's the process of trying to keep the voodoo so will this affect us Allah no the the Salat is still valid whether the feet are tilted or as long as and I I believe you're referring to the state of sujud as long as they are still on the ground whether they're close or far away apart as long as they're touching the ground and a person is trying to suppress wind from uh exiting the prayer is still valid without a problem"
