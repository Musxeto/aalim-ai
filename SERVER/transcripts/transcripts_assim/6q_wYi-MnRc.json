  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Good morning, welcome to our special public talk on the topic of how does a believer balance between fear and hope featuring of course the eminent scholar Sheikh Asim Al-Hakim It is an honor to have with us a distinguished scholar which is of course Sheikh Asim Al-Hakim We sincerely thank you for gracing us In Sha Allah with your wisdom, experience and knowledge this morning Sheikh Asim Al-Hakim was born in Egypt in 1793 in the city of Jerusalem Ladies and gentlemen, today's guest is the prestigious Amir Surah Al-Nisi in Saudi Arabia He has been a teacher of knowledge in guidance for the past two decades Not many know about Sheikh He has influenced the world of the masjid as he has come up with millions of ways to socialize and also he has created websites using his own teachings accessible to diverse communities What Sheikh Asim Al-Hakim has achieved in his approachable and also relatable teaching style has driven the world to teach that wisdom in contemporary times making Islamic teachings applicable to all communities Sheikh Asim Al-Hakim profound insights into contemporary history Sheikh Asim Al-Hakim has struck a chord with many of them achieved in the study of Islam and the principles and the concept of Islam Ladies and gentlemen, today's subject of conversation between Amir Surah Al-Nisi Sheikh Asim Al-Hakim will share with us all on guarantee between fear and hope in a spiritual path Sheikh Asim Al-Hakim will share with us all on guarantee between fear and hope in a spiritual path It is a pleasure for me Alhamdulillah to be here in Perlis for the first time I hope not the last time but we will happen and see inshallah depending on the results, no clapping please, no takbir, everything will be fine inshallah So the topic is not a topic of let's say entertainment It's a topic related to aqeedah which is the most important thing in life which most of us may not realize that what makes it or breaks it is your aqeedah This is what the messengers of Allah Azza wa Jal fought their people for Not for wealth, not for property, not for peace of land, only for aqeedah And this is what people are fighting us for, for our beliefs, for our aqeedah And a huge part of our aqeedah is Al-Khawfu Wa Al-Raja' The fear of Allah Azza wa Jal and the hope in Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala And this is mentioned in the Quran in black and white clearly Anyone who reads the Quran or claims to be a Muslim and contemplates about the Quran Finds this clearly mentioned in the Quran, let alone the sunnah But the Quran is the thing that nobody disputes upon, even the people of bid'ah So what does Allah Azza wa Jal say about this topic? Allah describes the messengers and prophets of Allah by saying So Allah says indeed these messengers and prophets of Allah They used to hasten to good deeds and supplicate us In hope and fear So this is how the messengers of Allah used to supplicate to Allah Azza wa Jal In hope, but also in fear So in order to know how to balance between these two, we have to understand what is meant by them So what is fear? Fear of Allah is to expect something bad to happen In general, fear is when you expect something bad Or to miss something that you love and want Because there is speculation about it There is a sign that may direct to that intuition And it is the trembling of the heart And being unable to be steady And this is what fear usually means It's the opposite of to be secure So when you are secure, you're safe, you're not afraid When you're afraid, you're not safe And the fear of Allah Azza wa Jal is the sign of believers It is the way those of knowledge have towards Allah As Allah mentioned Verily, only those among Allah's servants that fear Him most are the scholars So Allah limited the actual knowledge in those who fear Him the most And the fear of Allah is an indication of the purity of the heart And the sincerity of the soul It has an importance, great importance in Islam Because it pushes people to doing good deeds and protecting them from sins It is one of the most important obligations in our religion Because it has consequences when you have fear from Allah Azza wa Jal Ibn Al-Qayyim says, the stage or manzilah of fear is the highest and most important in Islam And it's the most beneficial to your heart It is a fard upon every single individual And it was ordained and instructed in the Quran Allah says, Do not fear them and fear me if you are believers Which means that a sign of you being a mu'min is that you fear Allah If you don't fear Allah, you're not And Allah Azza wa Jal described the messengers of Allah as warners مُنذِرِين They warn you and when you are warned, you're afraid They warn you from Allah so you fear Allah They warn you from the torment of hell so you fear hell They warn you from the day of judgment where you are accountable So you must be afraid And Allah Azza wa Jal complimented and praised the people of fear in the Quran Allah says, Indeed, they who are apprehensive from fear of their Lord And they who believe in the signs of their Lord And they who do not associate anything with their Lord And they who give what they give while their hearts are fearful Because they will be returning to their Lord It is those who hasten to good deeds and they outstrip others therein All these beautiful signs and descriptions of this ayah Mother Aisha came to the Prophet and said, O Prophet of Allah, these people who are afraid and they do this Are they those who fornicate and steal and do sins? The Prophet said, No, O daughter of As-Siddiq They are those who fast, pray and give charity They are afraid that Allah would not accept from them It is those who hasten to good deeds and they outstrip others therein These ayahs describe those who are fearful Yet they do a lot of good deeds Are we like that? Seriously? Do we do what they do and we are afraid? One of us may finish the Quran once every 3-4 years And feel boastful about it and tell everybody about it Maybe do a party and invite people Yet when we make sins, we are not afraid People go to Hajj and come back They should be on the straight path No, they keep on doing sins They go for Umrah and come back And they indulge in sins What are you doing? He said, I have credit What do you mean? I did good deeds, I did Hajj, I did Umrah I have credit This is not a mobile phone you top up This is between you and Allah You have to be fearful You pray Tahajjud? Before Fajr? 5-10 minutes before Fajr? What do the righteous do? They pray 2-3 hours Tahajjud Just before Fajr, Adhan By 10-15 minutes They ask Allah for forgiveness For what? For our shortcomings You just prayed 3 hours Tahajjud You don't know if Allah is going to accept it We do what we do and we boast I'm a renowned scholar I'm an international speaker I have credit I can do whatever I want This is wrong You should feel very small of yourself You should feel that Allah will not accept your deeds This would make you reach safety But the moment you do something good I gave 100 ringgit to a poor person I feel good about it Feeling good is not bad Is it accepted? Of course it's accepted I did it for Allah, Allah will accept it No, now you have to be fearful That Allah may not accept it And this is the difference Between righteous people and hypocrites Al-Hasan Al-Basri says They, that is the righteous people Did good deeds And did their best In these good deeds While being afraid That Allah would reject it The believer Combines between good deeds And the fear of Allah While the hypocrite Combines between sins And being safe and secure From Allah's torment and punishment This is how we are Unfortunately today Fear That is genuine And praised Is what prevents you from doing sin This is what is Allah wanting from you To have this fear That stops you Why don't you pray Fajr in Masjid Masjid is next door The bed is cozy The air condition is cold And I feel good sleeping You don't have fear Then you have problems Your fear takes you out of your bed To go and pray in the Masjid Your fear makes you Turn off the music when it's playing In the car Nobody is with me in the car Why that dance Your fear makes you cancel Your Netflix and Showtime Subscription and all the haram Because I fear Allah I don't want to go to hell This is the true Genuine fear When you say genuine fear Does this mean that there are types of fears Yes There are types of fears There is the mandatory fear What is that This is the fear that obligates you to do Mandatory things And prevents you from falling in haram You have this fear You go to Jannah That's cool This is the bare minimum fear Bare minimum It prevents me from going to hell Yes but it is bare minimum Because a better form of fear Is the recommended fear And what is that It is the fear that makes you do more Yes you did the obligations Did you pray the Sunnah No Allah made 5 prayers mandatory Per day Yeah but the Sunnah is a higher level I never knew that It builds your house in Jannah 12 rakahs a day That's easy I'll do it Do you fast Mondays and Thursdays Why would I do that I fast every Ramadan Yeah but if you fast Mondays and Thursdays Allah azza wa jal Would look at your deeds Every Monday and Thursday and approve it And the prophet a.s. said About Monday It's a day I was born in And it's a day I was revealed to in So I love to fast it Okay It gives you an edge Okay This is number 2 Number 3 The fear of the incompetent The fear of the lazy ones This is your fear and mine What fear is that This is the fear we get When we listen to reminders Reminders are like a whip When someone flogs you You feel the pain And you're hurting After a day or two The pain is gone And you forget So you need another whip And a third and a tenth These reminders These gatherings we come to attend To soften our hearts And to know our religion more These are whips In them We have this incompetent fear When we fear Allah azza wa jal We feel remorseful We try our level best And as soon as we go Light a cigarette And enjoy life This fear is good Because it's temporary And it might work It might extend a little bit Maybe sometimes It extends for a whole week Khutbatul Jumu'ah Is a beautiful occasion To attend every week And you benefit the whole week So it's like recharging So you are fully charged The full week And once the battery goes down Before the red You attend the following Jumu'ah And you recharge again The fourth type of Fear Is the prohibited fear Oof There is a prohibited fear Yes This is the fear Of Al Khawarij When you feel that Allah is not going to forgive me When you feel no matter what I do Allah will put me in hell This causes And I do this In my counseling sessions I have counseling sessions every day With people, of course paid Not free Let's things be clear I don't waste half an hour of my time For free, except sometimes You want to sit with me for half an hour You have to pay So they come to me, Shaykh I have this fear of Allah And they speak, and they vent But I don't let them vent for more than 4 minutes Because time has value And I don't want to waste your time I could listen to you for half an hour And say, get another session And pay me more What is the problem? Look how Shaytan works Shaytan comes to you With a good door The door of the fear of Allah Who hates fearing Allah? It's a good door But then he opens it To an extent you cannot close it And what happens? He says to you, there is no hope for you But I'm afraid of Allah I say Shahada 50 times a day, why? Someone said something, I smiled So I committed shirk Someone said something I saw a prophet in a negative way So I committed kufr So he says shahada 50 times a day He takes a shower 5-10 times a day To embrace Islam After 2-3 weeks He gets despaired Of Allah's mercy Allah is not going to forgive me Shaytan says, yes Allah is not going to forgive you What to do? Leave Salat Wallahi they come to me in the hundreds They don't pray, they don't fast They don't believe in Islam They cry like babies In the session I don't want to go Don't cry, you are in hell This is called shock therapy You smash them on the face And then smash them again on the face They wake up They need this by the way So I said, you're in hell You don't pray? Yes I'm afraid of Allah No you're not afraid of Allah You're afraid of Allah and you pray Afraid of death This is another negative fear I had a brother from the gulf He came to me in a session We have time Before lunch, no problem So he came to me And he was terrified He looked like a pale chicken I don't know how a pale chicken looks But you understand So what's the problem? He said, I have this fear of death 3 years I've been Restless My wife divorced me because of it I lost my job I lost half of my weight And for the past 4 weeks I cannot take a shower I do not pray And I said How long have you had this? He said 3 years And I said, did you die? Of course not He said, you stupid Moron Why? He said, if you did not die in 3 years What will happen in 15 years And you don't die? I said You're going to live like this for 15 years? Is, and this is a sign Of weak aqeedah Come on sheikh What does aqeedah have to do with this? If you know the 6 pillars of iman Which the vast majority of muslims you meet On the street You talk to them and you say to them The 6 pillars of iman Shahada, salat, zakat No you stupid It's 5 I'm talking about the 6 He said, oh New version 2.1 He said, no this is iman And this is islam So you say to them Until you come to the qadar Do you believe in predestiny? He said yes Do you die on a specific day? He said yes Can you be 1 minute early or 1 minute late? He said no He said, why are you afraid? Look at you 3 years you've lost everything If you had iman You would go and work So this kind of iman The 4th type The 4th type of fear Is the prohibited fear Some people are so scared Of things that move A tree that moves I can't go there, there is jinn Come on This fear is very negative It shows that you don't have iman Shaykh I don't want to get married Why? I don't want to become pregnant Not you of course Yeah Some of the men are pregnant 4 months pregnant Anyhow, let's go back to the topic Excuse me So they say I get sisters like this I don't want to get married Why? Because I'm afraid Of what? Of becoming pregnant So, everybody has been becoming pregnant since Hawa Peace be upon her She said yeah, yeah But I'm afraid that my child Will grow in this environment And he cannot live He would not be Around them So, these are types of The fears that people Have You can divide fear into another division Which is also Part of Those who have OCD People come to me Shaykh, I have committed shirk Why? I'm afraid of this, I'm afraid of my boss I'm afraid of the dark, I'm afraid of the jinn I'm afraid of my wife Aren't we all? So, this is happening everywhere Why? This is natural fear Some people ask me Shaykh, I was praying And a lion came To attack me Should I continue prayer? So, I said Keep and preserve your wudu Continue If a lion comes It will break So, run This is natural fear This has nothing to do with shirk People do not differentiate Between the fear of Allah And the fear of the creatures Even Musa In the Quran Allah described him in two or three places That he feared them I fear Pharaoh And he feared When they put Staffs on the ground And it became snakes He feared This is a natural fear But the fear we're talking about Is the fear of Allah If you fear someone Like you fear Allah While exonerating them While praising them If you fear the jinn If you fear Mawlana If you fear the deceased I did not steal this by Allah I swear by Mawlana That you did not steal No, I'm afraid Because if I swear By Al-Badawi or Al-Tijani Or Al-Shadili or Al-Jilani He may strike me with lightning Or yesterday it rained I can't do this This is fear of shirk This is the type of shirk So, we have to Understand what fear is And to see which one Or which stage we are in How did the companions Deal with fear of Allah Of course the Prophet's fear It will take us Hours to mention How he spent nights Weeping Tears, wetting his beard And wetting the floor Come on, this is the Prophet of Allah The best of Allah's creation Someone who has a carte blanche Whatever you did in the past Whatever you are doing in the future Is forgiven Yet he fears Allah like this And we have nothing Yet we are so happy and joyful We never shed a tear Except when we watch the Titanic Maybe, I don't know Why? There are no tears No fear of Allah Except over Issues of dunya Oh, I remember my uncle I remember this, I remember that But from the fear of Allah This is a problem Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him And he is who he is He used to hold his tongue And says this is What will take me to bad places Fearing The consequences of what he says Umar says By Allah If a camel or a mule Were to trip In Iraq Thousands of miles away from Medina I would be afraid That Allah would ask me about it And this is Frightening for everyone who has responsibility Whether you are a king You are a president You are a manager If you have responsibility Allah would ask you about every single thing Under your responsibility And Umar used to also say If someone were to call And say All of you are in Jannah Except one I would have feared That I would be that one Subhanallah Umar He fears that everyone will go to Jannah Except himself What kind of fear do we have In our hearts And if you look at Abu Hurairah May Allah be pleased with him He was narrating a hadith And this hadith Was In Sahih ul Imam Muslim Where the Prophet said The first three To be thrown in hell Are He reaches this stage The first three to be thrown into hell He weeps and faints And he wakes up again And he said the Prophet The Prophet said the first three To be thrown in hell are He weeps he could not continue the hadith And he faints Is he making it up Is he acting I seek refuge with Allah Abu Hurairah used to divide The night into three parts Him and his brother and his mother One third he prays And they sleep Then he sleeps One of them stands and pray While the other two sleep And the third prays This is Abu Hurairah So look at his fear Of the three To be thrown into hell And it does not apply to him But he feared that it may have applied to him So What are the things That we would benefit From fear of Allah A number of things Time does not allow us to Expand on them but in a nutshell Number one Fear equals sincerity When you fear Allah You don't go around people Every Monday and Thursday to the office If you are a worker I used to have people like this coming to my office On Monday and sitting at 10 o'clock In the morning And the guy says I don't ask My nature is Don't interfere in people's business Don't interfere in mine I will interfere in yours After 20 minutes 15 minutes of sitting without me asking He says Last night I prayed night prayer For some quiet time I feel tired Good for you I don't talk And then after a while I said would you like something to drink He said no I am fasting So some people Like to show off I once sat with An editor in one of the biggest Newspapers in Saudi Arabia who used to put The pictures of females At the end of the Page of the newspaper And this was a taboo So I went to speak to him and give him advice He happens to know me because Of so many reasons But I went And I said look this is haram He said sheikh I know this is haram But you know how many people Accepted Islam on my hands 37 What is he saying He is justifying his sin By saying that I have credit 37 people Accepted Islam on my hands Therefore if he had Fear in Allah Allah will accept So he would keep it to himself Therefore Sincerity and fear go side by side The fear of Allah Pushes you to do more good deeds So I prayed Five Fard Not enough, why I am afraid I have too many sins Let me pray 12 rakat sunnah I prayed 12 rakat sunnah Not enough This is very important I have to pay Charity for 360 joints In my body every day The prophet said 2 rakat of Doha does this So if you don't pray Doha every day Start doing it I started doing it 25 years ago I was a big sheikh then But I did not pray Doha In my school I found a teacher who barely had a beard Every day In his spare class At 11 o'clock Without saying anything He goes and puts his prayer mat In the teacher's room One day, two days, one week Then I said to myself You are a sheikh You teach people Since then he is getting credit Every time I pray Doha And he did not even open his mouth And this is the beauty of dawah I am telling you now Pray Doha If you pray Doha I will be in my grave Getting credit Whenever you pray Doha Beautiful prayer Fear of Allah pushes you To do good deeds Fear of Allah makes you Hasten to Jannah The prophet said Whoever is afraid He travels in the beginning of the night When they traveled They did not travel in the morning Because of the heat of the sun So they used to travel at night Because it is quicker for your travel And at the same time it is safer So the prophet says Whoever is afraid Travels at the beginning of the night This is a metaphor If you are afraid of hellfire Then you will travel at the beginning of the night Meaning do a lot of good deeds And whoever travels At the beginning of the night Will reach quickly Meaning to Jannah The merchandise Of Allah is expensive The merchandise is Jannah And also One of the benefits Of fearing Allah You will be under the shade of Allah As in the hadith 7 Are in the shade of Allah on the day of judgment Where there is no shade except his shade One of them is a man Seduced by a woman Who is beautiful And influential And he says I fear Allah Subhanallah The vast majority of the youth today Where is this woman I am here, I am available Unfortunately They look for it This man was lured And seduced But he said and proclaimed I fear Allah And those who Fear Allah In this dunya They will not fear Allah on the day of judgment And those who are safe From Allah's torment In this dunya Allah will torment them as per the hadith By my grace And my honor I shall not Combine two fears And two Security upon my servant If he fears me in this dunya I will give him security On the day of judgment But if he feels secure in this dunya I will torment him And make him afraid On the day of judgment This is fear What about hope sheikh Give us some hope And this is why I did not begin with hope I thought of scaring you a little bit Now Inshallah I will give you hope What is hope in Islam Arraja Arraja is when your heart is connected To Allah Feeling happy And optimistic Of Allah's favors and blessings Coming over you Feeling the peace and tranquility Feeling your heart Because you know who Allah is Which is totally the opposite of The fear Here you are safe You feel safe And I always give an example And Allah has the highest of all examples When you hold your one year old child And you toss him in the air What does the child do Put me down Does he do this No he laughs And he enjoys it If I were to throw you in the air What would you do You would hang to the chandelier You are crazy Come down I am going to pick you up You are out of your mind Because you don't trust me So those who have hope in Allah Feel like a child being tossed in the air They know Allah will catch them They know Allah will forgive them They know Allah will give them Jannah Allah made the Jannah to whom To you and me All what you have to do is Think positively of Allah So what is the difference between Hope And being wishful Wishful is when you sit on your back side And you don't do anything And you say I will open the door for the Prophet From the inside Meaning I will enter first And open the door for him This is stupid This is wishful While being hopeful Is when you pray night prayer For 2-3 hours And you do good deeds And you read the Quran once every month at least And you give charity And You are hopeful that Allah will accept This is So how can we Attain this level Of Hopefulness in Allah By looking at Allah's previous favours and blessings Upon you Did Allah send you favours and blessings In the past Of course I am standing I can see I can speak I can eat I can move around These are all favours from Allah So This makes me Hopeful in Allah's Continuous gift and blessing And Allah does not Let us down Allah continues to give us blessings From means you do not anticipate Also You remember When you read the Quran and the Sunnah What Allah has promised you Whenever you pass by Verses of Jannah And you see what is in Jannah Your heart flies And says I will be there I am one of the inhabitants of Jannah I know that And you wish and you ask Allah And you make dua Also you remember Allah's current favours and blessings Upon you The houses, the children The wives, the wealth That Allah gives to you And most of what you are being given Is without asking Is everything you have You ask Allah for? No, all what we ask Allah for is A 2024 model new car Alhamdulillah I don't want anything But everything else Allah gives you Without asking And we never appreciative Of that Among the things that help you in being hopeful Is remembering Allah's forgiveness Subhanallah Allah's forgiveness Is beyond Imagination And this is why The more you study Allah's beautiful names The more you love Allah And you are hopeful Allah's beautiful name Al Karim He is the most generous Allah's beautiful name Al Rahim The most merciful Allah's beautiful name Al Ghaffar Al Ghafoor The one who forgives Allah's beautiful name As Al Jawad He is the one that Gives Al Tawwab The one who repents over Whomever asks him Who is this? Allah So if you believe in him If you have hope in him You will find him as you believe As mentioned in the hadith And listen to this hadith The prophet says Four Are gotten out of hell fire For accountability And then Allah Orders them back to go to hell So they came out Because Allah wanted to hold them accountable For some of their deeds And then they are sent back to hell One of them looks And says I had hoped That you had gotten me out That you would not put me in back again This was my hope The hope is where? On the day of judgment The hope of whom? Of someone who was in hell And was exited and will come back again So he is saying, objecting Ya Allah I was hoping that Once I am out of it You will not put me back Then I will fulfill your hope Don't put him back Subhanallah Imagine After getting out of hell Just because he had hopes in Allah Allah azawajal says Because of your hope You will not go back The other hadith The prophet says And this hadith Qudsi When a servant makes a sin And he says May Allah forgive my sin Allah says My servant has sinned And he knows that he has a lord That forgives sins And holds accountable of the sin Then He makes a sin again And Allah says the same thing And he makes a sin for the third time And Allah says The same thing And when he does it for the fourth time Allah says My servant do whatever he wants I have forgiven him La ilaha illallah Does this mean we should go and sin Of course not It means that as long as you sin Because of your human nature Because of your weakness And you repent and ask Allah for forgiveness And you feel remorseful In your heart, Allah will forgive you Regardless of how big your sin is Regardless how many times you do it As long as you fulfill The conditions of repentance Allah will forgive you So How much time do we have? 15 more minutes With the questions and answers? With questions and answers That makes 30 minutes I will finish in 10 inshallah So What are the benefits Of having hope In Allah It's the main reason For finding the sweetness of Iman And forms of worship Why when we pray We're so Grumpy And thinking about worldly matters And not being able to find The sweetness of Salat Because we don't have hope in Allah We're spectacle of Allah We are Pessimistic So we pray and we don't know Allah will accept or not We just want to get it off our chest Off our backs No, when you have Great hope in Allah Your Ibadah Has a sweetness to it One of the benefits of Hope is that You express Your Ubudiyah Your Being a slave of Allah And a servant to him When you have hope One of the benefits is that you Make dua If you hope in something You will not attain it without dua So you make a lot of dua And it will help you escape The wrath of Allah azza wa jal Now The one million Kuwaiti dinar The one million Kuwaiti dinar Question I wouldn't say ring it because ring it is Kuwaiti dinar is about 15-16 ringgit I don't know a lot So the one million Kuwaiti dinar Question How can we balance It is extremely important To balance between The fear of Allah and the hope of Allah Why? To us We believe That we are different than The deviant sects The 72 that are in hell Because one will be in paradise As the Prophet said And those are Who follow the footsteps of the Prophet And his companions So our belief is iman Is increased And decreased Increases with good deeds Decreases with sins Al khawarij and al murji'ah They believe iman To be a bulk Either goes all of it Or stays all of it Khawarij said If you do a major sin The whole iman is gone You are a kafir So they went to the far extreme Of fear So even if you lie, you are a kafir You steal, you are a kafir You make backbiting, you are a kafir Immediately The murji'ah Who are the majority of the muslims nowadays Unfortunately It doesn't matter what you do You have iman, you have taqwa You can party all night long You can booze, you can do drugs You can lie, you can cheat You deal in riba, take mortgage Alhamdulillah You say la ilaha illallah, you are in jannah So they say Your iman can never be decreased Ahlus sunnah wal jama'ah says No, no, no, it's not like this Fear And hope are like the wings Of a bird They have to be balanced If one wing is stronger The bird will Be tilted and fall And if they're all Flapping well The bird will fly In a good way And this is what Is mentioned all over the Quran The day their faces will be white And some's faces will turn black So fear and hope And Allah says Your lord is prompt and fast In torment And in punishment And penalty As he is azza wa jal Most forgiving, most merciful And so on So how to balance Let it be known That every fear of Allah Must have hope And every hope in Allah Must have fear Oh, how is that If your fear Does not have any hope It will be despair And qunoot From rahmatullah, from Allah's mercy And this will take you to hell And if your hope Is 100% Without fear This means that you will indulge in doing sins Because you have Huge and great hope in Allah And that will also Take you to hell So when To have hope Overwhelming My condition And when to have fear Overwhelming my condition Hope and fear Though they have to be balanced Sometimes one must A little bit exceed the other For example At the time of death When you are dying The doctor says Five minutes, seven minutes What is the best for you to do Fear Allah or be hopeful Whoever says hopeful Raise your hands Make sure you are awake Because after breakfast Everybody is asleep Whoever says the fear of Allah Raise your hands Only one child No, the majority It's not democracy This is not voting But yes At the time of death You have to have the hope exceeding Because the fear Pushes you to do what In this state of death You can't do anything So the only thing you have is this straw That you have to hang on In this ocean You are dying So think positive of Allah And this is why people at the time of death They used to tell their students Remind me of my good deeds Oh sheikh you have been living for 70 years You fasted for 60 years Not break one day I feel good about this I just remembered Yes I did not skip any day of Ramadan Wow that's good Sheikh you prayed this much You made khatmah of the Quran this much This gives you hope in Allah At the time of your bed Also The prophet said No one of you should die Except thinking well of Allah This is an instruction When it's your death bed Think well of Allah Also When someone is in despair Of Allah's mercy Someone who has OCD I'm going to hell Remind him of hope And the beauty of hope in Islam So that you get him out of this OCD And mental illness And the cases we should Make The fear more prevalent For example When the people are in security When you go to their lavish homes And they feel fine Everything is fine My job is secured My children are healthy I have a huge bank account My business is doing well This is when Shaytan is preparing you Watch out Shaytan is marinating you Like a good chef This is what he is doing He is waiting for the right moment Be fearful of Allah Azza Wa Jal And watch out By remembering I have to fear Allah Like the prophets and the messengers And you should also have fear Exceeding and prevailing When you are doing a sin So you don't listen to music Or watch haram movies And say Astaghfirullah Astaghfirullah Some people do this And they think that They are making fun of Allah Is Astaghfirullah haram? No, but in this location Turn off the haram So that you would have fear of Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala And finally Whenever you feel safe And secure And that you are in Jannah This is when you have to make fear prevailing Imam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal And with this I would conclude my talk Was asked a question When Does the servant of Allah Find the taste Of comfort In this dunya, is there comfort? Yes, at the end of the day When you go to sleep You crash, you are comfortable So a man is asking When does the servant find The real taste of comfort Ahmad Ibn Hanbal May Allah have mercy on his soul When he puts his first foot in paradise Before you put your foot in paradise You will never be safe You will never be comfortable It's always agony And torment And trials from Allah The moment you put your first foot in Jannah Nobody is going to take you out You are there to stay This is when Internal comfort and safety Would be achieved I pray to Allah Azza wa Jal That He makes me and you Among the inhabitants of Jannah And that Allah puts in our hearts The fear of Him and the hope In what He has for us And to make us balanced From Ahl as-Sunnah wal-Jamaah"
