  "transcript": "um when we make intention for woodo for example to pray for and time comes and we don't intend to make W for Salah can we pray um with the same W even if we did not attend it the prophet was reported in an authentic Hadith that he performed f and with one single W and when he was asked or the companions were asked why did he do such a thing they replied so that he would not burden his um so that he would give them the permission to perform multiple prayers with the same wo without any problem in that nowhere do we have in Islam that a particular woodo must be performed with the intention of which prayers one is going to pray so if I perform W I don't have to intend that I want to pray maybe with that W all what I have to intend is to uplift the minor ritual impurity which is done through W once I perform wo I am not in the state of minor ritual impurity I'm in the state of wo which qualifies me to pray as many prayers as I wish to perform um ta to read or touch the Quran to do whatever I need to do while in the state of woodo with this single Evolution or woodo I performed regardless of what I intended at the time as long as I intended to uplift my minor ritual impurity"
