  "transcript": "what are the rules to be follow followed by a couple who have had their nikah but no girl is still living with parents until a later date and they go out together without mams if the marriage contract has been made she is his wife and can go out with her he can touch her hand he can speak to her freely within the limits of course because as long as she is in her parents' house it is immoral it is unethical for him to for example have intercourse with her though she is his wife and it's Halal to have such intercourse she's his wife but because she is still in her parents' house he would need the permission of the father simply because a lot of similar cases took place a man makes a contract marriage contract with a woman and the girl is still staying with her parents they decide to officially have the wedding after 3 4 months in in in in Saudi we call this milka so the man he he is her husband she is his wife but they agree to postpone the wedding until she gets the wedding dress until he finishes school until she and and the house is finished and furnished and through these three or four months he frequently visits his wife in her parents' house they sit together they dine together sometime they go out together this is all permissible but after some time they get so close to each other they have intercourse and everybody knows that she's married but they know that she's still a virgin and after after a week or two he divorces her so he leaves and people think oh it's okay divorce took place before uh uh the wedding so she's still a virgin will she's not and sometimes she conceives his child and this is an embarrassment to both of them because they were not supposed to do this until they the wedding and they until they mov together so uh it is halal to do everything that a man does with his wife but it is is unethical and Allah knows rest"
