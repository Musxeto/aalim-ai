  "transcript": "[Music] All [Music] Allah. Alhamdulillah. [Music] after hearing this introduction. I almost believed it Allah mashallah. Who's he talking about? All of this is in vain unless allahel gives you sincerity and makes it solely for his sake. And that is why I always tell the brothers don't exaggerate in introducing so much about the speaker because this doesn't add value and it takes about five minutes of your time. Welcoming Ramadan is a topic that most of what you are going to hear is well known to you. But likewise all what we hear from the Quran and all what we hear from the Sunnah then why do we often repeat it over and over again? because it's a reminder and reminding benefits only those who believe which means that those who do not believe those whom Allah does not intend them to go to where it pleases him and he does not want good for them they will not remember. Now an introduction. Why did Allah create us to get married to have a good job and to have children? Definitely not. Allahel did not create the jin and the ins except for one purpose and one purpose alone and that is to worship him. And it is the grace of allahel that he gave us seasons that we gain a lot of reward get closer to Allahawel and elevate our status in paradise through these seasons. Usually in Europe and America they have the Christmas season. This is when everyone goes to the market and buy discounted products. And you can see people queuing for a day or two or three under the sun under the rain just trying to get the best deal. We Muslims have many seasons. We have we have we have Hajj and one of the greatest season is the season of Ramadan. And this is why Allah says to his prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam so worship Allah till you die. There is no break for us. We have holidays for the summer. We have spring break. We have uh school vacations, annual leave in for a Muslim. We don't have this. Five times a day, you have to pray. Do we have a break? Some says, \"Yes, when I'm fainting and I'm dying out of cancer and I'm not uh conscious, I have a break.\" You are not having break. You're having a breakdown. You're dying. No. Alhamdulillah. and and and we do not see this is one of the greatest blessings of Allah that we do not see these rituals and forms of worship as a burden do we come on don't lie the majority of Muslims think of it as burden tomorrow's Ramadan what's wrong thirst and hunger and not only that I cannot listen to music in my car I cannot watch movies what is this I'm I'm I'm suffocating I'm dying So it is difficult. You have to wake up at fud is 4:15 and I just slept 3 hours ago and I I have work at 7:30. It's it's not logical. You have to refrain from haram. You have to all of these are burdens to those who are not blessed by allahel. Those whom Allah blesses they will find everything easygoing. And that is why the prophet saidatam from this duny it was made beloved to me perfume and women and my satisfaction and tranquility is only allocated and found in in salah in prayer. And if you have worries, if you have debts, if you have problem with your wife, what to do? She Allah, I listen to rock and roll music. I forget. Other one, what do you do? I go to the gym and I start boxing and hitting the the punching bag until I'm torn out. Others, the prophet, what did he used to do? He used to pray. Once you pray, everything off your shoulders, it's at Allah's disposal. and he does what he wills subhanah. So when we want to achieve the best in this season in this blessed month how do we do that we have to first of all acknowledge the beauty of this month what beauty she the temperature is 50Â° here alhamdulillah it is hot it is humid you praying the masjid people next to you smell mashallah I haven't showered for six weeks maybe or it's very bad not only that They had eaten bake for sahur. So in fud said a mean and the garlic is out. The imam is even fainting from the smell. What is this? No, it is a blessed month. Always look at the positive side. Don't be so sarcastic and thinking that everything is the end of the world. Life is beautiful depending on how you look at it. This beautiful month of Ramadan is known as the month of the Quran. Why? because the Quran was initially revealed in it. So it's a month of the Quran. Not only that, it is the month of all scriptures. Imagine that the prophet says the scriptures of Ibraim were revealed. What is it called in Quran? The scriptures of Ibraim. What's his name? Huh? Sufi and it was revealed on the first day of Ramadan. The prophet saysam the Torah which is revealed to MS peace be upon him was revealed on the sixth day of Ramadan which is the seventh night. So it's all even uh uh odd numbers. The Injil known as the New Testament nowadays they call it was revealed to the third on the 13th and the Zabur which was given to Doud peace be upon him was revealed on the 18th day of Ramadan and the Quran was revealed on the 24th of Ramadan. So this sacred month is not only for the Muslims. It's been there since Allah created the heavens and the earth and it is favored and blessed by allahel. The Quran was revealed in Ramadan. The prophetam used to revise the Quran with jirel every single Ramadan once except in the last year before he died. He revised it twice. The prophet said, \"The people of the Quran, those who read it, ponder upon it, study it, are the people of Allah and his private and personal people, the closest to allahel and it's an honor and a privilege to claim that I am among the people of allahel. But if you don't know the difference between an ayah and a hadith, I was speaking with a gentleman Saudi, a liberal, secular, everything you want to say bad about him. She don't backbite or Ramadan is tomorrow. Yeah, I'm not backbiting. You don't know him. So I can say whatever I want. Huh? If he sees it, he's going to be angry. But I definitely know and he would not see it unless it's on NBC. But alhamdulillah, I don't think this is going to be on BBC. Okay, very good. Uh so I was talking with him and discussing few things and he said Allah the almighty says verly deeds are by intention and I said excuse me Allah said that said yes in the Quran to my knowledge this wasn't revealed in the Quran he said wasn't it I remember studying it in the Quran said the hadith is hadith of the prophet's oh I'm sorry yeah where were we after that and you want us to continue. You don't know your heads from your toes and you want to speak in Allah's religion without knowledge. This is a manifestation of the Muslims nowadays. You tell them and talk to them about the Quran. How many suras do you memorize? Three big [Music] suras. What is the meaning of I didn't reach that ay yet? And I've been trying since six years and studying it. But in I'm coming to this ayat, they don't know the Quran. So we have a big problem. Allahel says in the Quran and the messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam will say will complain to Allah, oh my lord, verily my people deserted this Quran. Have we deserted the Quran? Yes. How do we desert the Quran? Either we desert it that we do not listen to it or believe in it. This is kufur. if you don't believe in it but we believe in it but I don't want to listen I don't want to read it and the majority of Muslims have this in them there are a better category and that is those who recite it and read it but they do not act upon it you always see them in the masid mashallah reading it and then kissing it and putting it in one eye and putting it in another eye and putting it on their head and then I don't know what else they can do on it subhan Allah and this is one of the weirdest thing around. People hold the Quran, they kiss it, and it's not part of the sunnah. The only thing that can be kissed is the black stone. Some scholars say you can kiss it. Kiss it. Don't no problem. The problem is that they prostrate on it. So, so what is this prostration? They say this is a minor's prostration. Mashallah, this is new in I've been studying for so long. What is the minor frustration? So this is you do if you find food or a piece of bread on the floor, you do it and preferably do it three times. Yeah. Where are you getting this new religion from? This is 19 90 mah or something like that. This is all fabrication. But this is their relationship with the Quran. We read it, we listen to it, but we do not apply it. I'm working in a bank and I'm using ribba. I'm working in a media and I broadcast movies and so on. I I'm a DJ but I listen to the Quran. Shah Rukhan is a very mashallah good listener to the Quran but no problem. He can do Bollywood movies. This shows you that they have deserted the Quran. There are people who read it know what it means and implement it but they do not ponder upon it. This is a high level to ponder upon the verses of Allah. What does Allah want from us? So you try your level best to dig and deep into the meanings of the beautiful Quran and the more you dig in the more you get closer to Allahel and that is why you find people reading the Quran and it has an impact on them and some people has no impact but they're blessed as well. The fourth level which is a high level is to read it, ponder upon it and to apply it but also to seek its cure. Allahel describe the Quran to be cure for our chests. Is it? If your son is sick, what is the first thing you do? Give him tempera antibiotics. Take him to the doctor and afterwards then do maybe it works. No, a proper Muslim has trust in allahel. The first thing I do, I give to my child seven times of fat. Likewise, make some dua then take him to the hospital. But believing that Allahawel is the one who provides the cure and the Quran is the best cure on earth for your physical for physical. Yes. And also for your mental illnesses. And finally, part of deserting the Quran is when you apply it, but you do not refute to it. You do not go to it. If I have a dispute, let the Quran judge. Said, \"No, no, no. I'd like to go to the labor office.\" They give me more. We have the Quran. No, no, no, no. I I need some a little bit extra. This is a big pro problem. Therefore, if you want to attain Allah's love in this blessed month, would you like Allah to love you? Would you want the prophetam to love you? The prophet said in the authentic hadith, whoever wants Allahawel to love him and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam to love him, he must read the Quran. Simple hadith, authentic hadith. Maybe the first time you hear it. Usually I try to my level best to bring you, you know, the the things that you have not heard so that it would energize you a little bit. Read the Quran. It is a shame that when you go 5 days like today, go to the masid, look into the books, the Qurans, and you find a lot of dust on them. Come the first week of Ramadan, they're sparkling, mashallah, everybody's reading it. After Ramadan is over, kalas and you ask the people, \"H, how many of the Quran do you read per day?\" He said, \"Allah, only in Ramadan.\" And have you finished it in Ramadan? He said, \"I started three years ago, but I could not complete it. This year, inshallah, I will complete it after 3 years of I know where I stopped.\" Is is he a proper Muslim who does not have a connection, who does not have a relationship with the Quran? He is going astray. He would watch the news. He would read the newspaper. He would read everything about everything but not read the Quran. Among the things of welcoming Ramadan is to learn about the virtues of fasting because what is Ramadan is fasting. So we all know fasting and the the problem is Muslims are divided. Some of them have already a habit of fasting. Some of us are blessed to fast Mondays and Thursdays and the white days and mashallah they have a connection with fasting. So it's it's easy for them. They have a connection with night prayer. They have a connection with all those good deeds. When Ramadan comes, if what they have been doing was not for the sake of Allah, but rather for the sake of habit, they would not feel any difference. So they will continue to fast and pray and read what's new. But those who do it for the sake of Allah, it becomes a season, a challenge for them. So they double, quad, triple and quadruple their efforts to get closer to Allah because they know they have 30 days. They have to make the best of these 30 days. The prophet said, \"Fasting and the Quran, they will intercede for the servant of Allah on the day of judgment. The fasting would come and say, \"Oh Allah, I prevented him from eating and drinking.\" And Quran would come and say, \"Oh Allah, I prevented him from sleeping.\" So Allah will accept their intercession and you will enter Jenna fasting and the Quran. So now you have to prepare yourself. Do I have someone to intercede? Do I have something to intercede for me on the day of judgment or not? The prophet says, \"Whoever fasts one day in the cause of Allah, Allah would prevent his face from seeing hellfire for 70 years.\" Yeah. You'll be as far as 70 years travel distance from hellfire. If you have fast how many days? One day. One day. What about those who fast 30 days of Ramadan? Yeah. It's it's unbelievable. The prophet says, \"Whoever fasts Ramadan believing in it and anticipating for the reward, Allah would forgive all of his previous sins.\" So he said from Ramadan to Ramadan is forgiveness. from prayer to prayer is forgiveness. Allah wants to forgive you, but we don't want Allah to forgive us. Unfortunately, we're so arrogant. We're so sure and confident of what we do, we fail to see what allahel wants from us. But is fasting only refraining from drinking and and and eating? The prophet said, \"Fasting does not just mean abstaining from eating and drinking. Rather fasting means abstaining from idle and obscene talk. Then you have to hold your tongue. You have to zip it. Halas in Ramadan. Can you do that wall? We cannot eat. We cannot drink. We cannot smoke during working hours. And you don't want us to gossip. I have to talk to my friend about my manager, my colleague, my wife did this, my neighbor. Oh, this is y fruit. It's okay. No, it's not okay because if you do not refrain from haram and from evil talk, Allah is not in need for you to prevent yourself from eating and drinking. This is more important for you welcoming Ramadan. How to welcome Ramadan. What is one of the prominent things of Ramadan that everybody knows at night time? Everyone knows, even the disbelievers, the non-Muslims, they're shocked. What makes the people leave their homes, leave their hobbies, leave everything and go to the masjid for an hour or an hour and a half to pray every single night. Unbelievable. What are they doing? They're praying. Why? Because they are show their gratitude to Allah. But they're crying. Why are they crying? Are they terrorists? Did they kill people? No. Because they have their sins. And then when they said they start to scrutinize a Muslim's style lifestyle, they find wallah this is problematic. The guy is honest. He comes on time, leaves on time, does not cheat, very kind to his family, very kinds to his kids. He obeys his parents. He connects to his kinship. This guy is Mr. Perfect. And truly speaking, Muslims are Mr. Perfect. A true Muslim is a Mr. Perfect. You want to check me or I want to check you, I go and ask your family. How is XY Z? Said wallah, he beats us in the morning and the evening. Then this is not a practicing Muslim. How? Ask the neighbors. How does he treat you? Wah. Mashallah. The smile is from here and there. Whenever we need him, he always there to help us. Ask the guests when they come do you open the door or you look from the you know eye and say I'm not here tell them I'm not here I can't they want dinner and I'm not going to give them. So Mr. Muslim is Mr. Perfect because he is complying. So when you go to what's so special about it ah there is a very big special thing for us as Muslims. You want forgiveness. The prophet said whoever prays night prayer of Allah would forgive his previous sins providing he does that believing and anticipating for the reward. All my previous sins all your previous sins major and minor it's a issue of dispute. Don't be greedy. Uh minor major you have to repent. I don't want to repent. I want Allah to forgive me because I need August I have to go to you know UK and have fun and party and play and no sorry major sins you have to repent tell repent Allah will forgive you so Allah will forgive you if you pray night prayer the whole month of Ramadan 29 or 30 nights from till pray night prayer Allah will forgive your sins but this is a little bit too any seven hours praying, eight hours praying from I can't do this. The prophet used to do it and his prayer used to make his feet swollen because of the length of his prayer. The companions of the prophet used to do the same pray the whole night. Abu Hanifh, may Allah have mercy on his soul. It was reported that he used to finish reciting the Quran 60 times in Ramadan. And how many times a day? Twice. Finish the Quran, read it from the beginning to the end. Twice. Every single day. Abu was reported the same. So how much do you pray? Crazy. What is this? Too too much. I cannot do this. I'm human. I'm not Superman. Well, the prophet gave you discount. Look at this beautiful religion. The prophet said, \"Whoever prays with the imam until he concludes his prayer, this is accounted and considered to be the prayer of the whole night.\" So if your imam prays for 40 minutes, what's the longest imam prays here? I know I know people especially here is very famous like they recite it into and the people say this is too long. What is this? 40 minutes, 50 minutes, an hour and a half, Allah would write to you as if you have prayed the whole night from and if you add to that prayer in congregation, this is the whole night again. And for 30 nights, Allah will forgive your sins. So you don't care. We don't care when is because we're definitely praying it as long as we do not miss any night. If it's the 21st, if it's the 25th or the 29th, it doesn't matter to us. Shah Ramadan, the month of Ramadan is the month of charity. Now, you remember the hadith Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him and with his father said that the prophetat wasam used to be as generous as the wind. You know when the wind comes, it comes everywhere. So he was as generous as the wind and the most generous of his times would be in Ramadan when Gibl revised the Quran with him. Why? Scholars say because the Quran tells you to believe tells you to have trust in allahel. So if I tell you who is pro your provider who provides for you what would you say? Huh? My manager. He writes the the paycheck. Who who provides for you? Do you have any doubts? Aban, do we have any doubts at all? Definitely. No one provides for us except Allah. Ya Allah, give me 1,000 real. I need charity to our refugee brothers in in Syria. Uh yes, but you I have this, you know, gifts and I have to buy dates and I'm going shopping. Inshallah, inshallah. Here's five. So it cont it conflicts with what actually you think you believe. When you read the Quran this becomes a realization when you give for charity and that is why the prophet said was bhan means evidence. So charity is evidence. Evidence on what? On your belief that you believe that allahel is the provider. The prophet said fasting is a protection and charity extinguishes sin like water is extinguished extinguishes the fire. Charity extinguishes your sins. So the more you have sins, you saw a movie, you heard a a song and you sought Allah's forgiveness, what to do? Give five real give 10 real give in charity. This expedites a lot of your sins. Imam Shafi says, \"I'd love a man to give generously in Ramadan as the prophet used to do because people are in more need in Ramadan because they're tired, they're unable to uh gain money, maybe work or so.\" And the prophet said, \"Whoever feeds a person who's fasting and he breaks his fast, that doesn't mean you come in the d time and tell him eat.\" No, this is not what is intended. What's intended is after you give him you give him something to break his fast is the prophet says he has the same reward. And I know people I know families wallah that with the grace of Allah they slaughter a sheep every single night. This is you're talking about 1600 real huh with rice and they take it to the masid and people and no one knows who they are. If I would do something like this, I would put a book poster. She assim invited you tonight for dinner. You and you who love and I would take a photo of you so that I would hold it for six, seven years that listen, I gave you food. But these people do it for the sake of Allah every single night. How much is are they paying just to feed the poor for the sake of Allahel? Now being generous in Ramadan is our Muslims characteristic. But this does not limit our generosity is not limited only to giving money but also to preaching. So if you have knowledge you utilize for me it's it's alhamdulillah it's much and easier and more convenient than spending money. I just teach. Alhamdulillah you guys don't can't teach. You have to pay. So I with the grace of Allah try my level best to teach to answer questions to do this to do that. It's a season we have to work. So it's not limited your generosity is not limited only to paying money rather than there is your generosity with knowledge your generosity with being forgiving and pardoning people. This is a form of generosity. Now the prophet said, \"Allah only has mercy on those who are merciful.\" How are you? I'm fine. No, no, I'm just asking you. How are you? Are you among the merciful? Uh, yes, sheh. I'm very kind. I'm very caring. I'm very loving. Do you pardon and forgive those who make mistakes towards you? Yes. If I ask the people in the masjid wall, every single day he fights with us, putting his foot on my foot and if I go away, he catches me from the neck. If my mobile goes by mistake, he shouts in the masid. Subhan Allah. What about your family? How is your wife complaining from you? Yeah, she's crazy. Okay. What about your children? Oh, they're disobedient. How about your father and mother? They're old, nagging all the time. And then then all these people are wrong and you are mashallah the most kind and forgiving and no it is you who needs to be fine-tuned you know you know do you know him the name he's the cousin of Abu Bakr you know Abu Bakr of course please don't don't make me be disappointed I was in London once and I was talking about a companion of the prophetatam and I said, \"Do you know Salah Awarenale or female?\" So, you don't know the man? He's one of the biggest and strongest athletes of the companions, a marathon runner. You don't know him? Said, \"No.\" And I asked him about two, three other companions said, and big big audience, mashallah. So I said awk my brothers and sisters if you go to Jenna and they tell you this is said nice meeting him don't know him and this is and this is this is this is Malik this is so you guys who is this I know Abu Bakr and Ali and and and and and I don't know these guys I don't know the majority in here take me to hell let me see and you go to hell I know everyone this guy I heard him he was on the top 10 and this is the best actress and this is the we have a problem we have we're going to Jenna inshallah so we have to start learning about our neighbors and those who want we want to be with so was one of the first to migrate to Medina and Shan trapped him so he was one among the three companions of the prophetam who slandered mother Aisha who are the three companions of course you know I just said his name to Hna her name is Hnash who is she the sister-in-law of the prophet and his cousin her her her sister is Zanab the the mother of the believer the third one was the poet of the prophetam who was h do we do you know the poets of the prophetam there there were three poets Abdah Malik Malik and the third one Hassanb one of the greatest poets of the prophet and he was among the three. So Abu Abu Bakr used to give his cousin Must money every week because he was the the poorest among the companions and he was a migrant one of them. When he slanded his daughter he was outraged. Does he have the right to be outraged? My cousin slanders my daughter who happens to be the wife of the prophetam and I'm the one who's giving him money. What is the normal thing to do to run him over with your car? This is the least you could do. But alhamdulillah they didn't have cars at the time. So he said I will not give him a single penny. Then Allah revealed a verse from the Quran and Allah says Shan and Allah says in it and let not those among you who are blessed with graces and wealth. This is Abu Bakr. Let them not swear not to give any sort of help to their kinsmen also poor and those who left their homes for Allah's cause. Let them pardon and forgive. Do you not love Allah to forgive you? So this was addressed to whom? Abu Bakr. So the prophet sallallaihi wasallam, did you hear what Allah said to you? And he recited this ayah. What was the natural thing from Abu Bakr to do? Allah is telling him, he's addressing him. Let them pardon and forgive. Do you not love that Allah should forgive you? And he said, \"By Allah, I love Allah to forgive me. I make you my witness, oh prophet of Allah, that I will continue till the day I die to give him allowance and I have forgiven him and pardoned him.\" End of story. Now compare apple to apple. How do you treat your wife? She's crazy. She's nagging. She's giving me problems. You have no excuse. If she was loving and caring and and and a sweetheart then who will you forgive and pardon? We all forgive and pardon those are good with us. When we are put to the test then this is what you should ask Allahel to uh uh uh help you and to give you the power to forgive and to give. Giving, being generous is one of the characteristics of the month of Ramadan. Allahel says shan threatens you with poverty and orders you to commit fa whereas Allah promises you forgiveness from him and bounty. So you should try your level best to invest your money. If I tell you give me 10,000 real and every month I will give you 4,000 real, would you give me? It's a good investment 4,000 meaning 2 months and a half the capital is back where allahel gives you more every real 10 real up to 700 real and Allah increases whatever he will subhana wa ta'ala so invest your money in Ramadan give in charity knowing that Allah doubles and triples and gives you more than what you had given it is the month of forgiveness as stated before Allah forgives in Ramadan scores of people much more than anywhere else. Aisha said, \"May Allah be pleased with her. If I were to attain the night of decree, what should I say?\" He said, \"Say three words. Oh Allah, you are most forgiving, most merciful and you love pardoning and forgiveness. So have your forgiveness on me and pardon me. Very easy. So if you want Allahel to forgive you, you have to begin to forgive others. You have to cleanse your heart and wash it with zum so that it is clean for everyone. Yes, but this brother in the in at work did something wrong to me. Forgive him. Yeah, but my neighbor did this and that. Forgive him. We unfortunately are filled with rage, with anger, with hatred. To me personally, if someone parks in front of my house, I get my blood pressure up the ceiling and I think h should I flat tire his tires the four or three only or should I put a need a nail because he would not see it and then or should I break his window? What to do? What to do? And I spent like two days just thinking what to do to him. Why is that? Where is your forgiveness? Where is it? He parked his car under my tree. The shade I'm waiting for since Allah knows when. This is my shade. It is my tree. Let it go. How many times do you make mistakes to others? Tens of mistakes a day. Would you like everyone to hold you accountable? No. Everybody shall forgive forgives me. Why don't you forgive others? So it is among the best months of the year for you to uh forgive. Uh finally welcoming Ramadan is very easy thing to say but walking the talk is very difficult. This is something that you have to train yourself. You have to condition yourself to begin and to acknowledge the beauty of Ramadan. Ramadan is a month of sincerity. Does anyone know if I'm fasting tomorrow or not? If it's Ramadan, nobody knows. Look at the child. He goes and makes wudoo. It's hot and he puts water in his mouth for woodoo and he spits it out. What happens if he swallows it? Who knows? No one. Look at that woman sitting four five hours in the kitchen doing food for her husband and her children and she tastes the food of course which is permissible without swallowing. What prevents her from swallowing? I travel sometimes from here to Medina or from here to Yamore during Ramadan on the daytime and I find this worshipper at the sun praying and he's fasting. Who would know if you pray or not? Who would know if you fast or not? Only Allahel. So it increases watching Allahel in your heart. And that is why the more you fast, the more fearful of allahel. I know a brother who fasts Mondays and Thursdays and he's happy of doing this and I say why are you so happy? He said, \"She every time I get into the car, when it's not Monday or Thursday, I listen to music. But when I'm fasting, I don't listen to music. And as weeks come by, I'm so used to fasting that it is Tuesday, I'm not fasting. And I want to listen to music, but I don't put it on Quran.\" And after five minutes say, \"I'm not fasting. Why I'm listening to Quran?\" But then I say, \"I'm listen. I cannot now change from Quran to music.\" And I continued to do this until allahel cured me from listening to music. Look at the beauty of fasting because it teaches you to know that Allah watches you. And once you do this, you will attain the fearness of Allah. You will start to fear Allah subhana tala. You will have this submissiveness. And you have to acknowledge the fact that the lord of the daytime in Ramadan is the lord of the night time. So to prepare yourself for Ramadan, you have to plan because in management they say if you don't have a plan, you will reach nowhere very soon. You will reach nowhere but very soon. Imagine you going out from your home at 7:00. Your car is filled with fuel and you have food with you. You're destined mashallah ready. Car is maintained and you drive. Where are you going to? I don't know. But I will reach there inshallah I have enough fuel. You will not reach anywhere. But what are you going to do this Ramadan? You have to start systematically. A lot of the brothers the first three four nights of Ramadan on the dotan fifth day. They're tired. I prayed for but my back hurts me and my knees. I have to go prayer wall. I had so much for and know I tried to make but I had to throw out so I I left salah so I'm not I came from you know tired that I couldn't say prayer I slept until when I put the food I remembered the hadith of the prophet when the food is served and the prayer is called for begin with the food begin with the food but the table is too big so I had to eat and eat and eat and then they brought um Ali and some basusa And this and we have to switch and then the subhan allah is prayer and he's still eating mashallah consuming like a wild beast. No, you have to plan how much are you going to read from the Quran every day and try to make it fixed? How many salah in the masjid in the first row are you going to inshallah attain? Because it's not enough to say I will pray in the masid. If you pray in the masjid you will lose one ra two. Sometimes you lo lose the prayer. But if you put your objective your benchmark that I pray in the first row the whole five prayers of the day then if you are a little bit late you lose the first but not and that is why the prophet said and start from tonight inshallah who uh whoever attains the first in for 40 nights how many prayers huh 200 40 multiplies by 5 200 salah if you for 200 continuous prayer attain the first not the first row says Allah abbar and you're in the row saying Allah Allah would write for you two uh exemptions one from hypocrisy and the other is from hellfire you will not enter hell and you will not be a hypocrite I tried this for Maybe 6 years I finished 30 days, 35 days. Once I reached 39 days and I missed it, I divorced my wife. But no, no, I was kidding. I didn't divorce my wife. It It is difficult. But wah once you get it, you feel good. Now you give it a try. Ramadan is there. Unfortunately, you're going to see that the first day of Ramadan, I'm in worksh on the cornes here, a big mansion, a big villa. Who doesn't like that? Everybody likes that. How about to have one in Jenna? Jenna is is more better than pray 12 a day. two before with four two after two after two after Allah will build you a house in Jenna. So try to maintain this also the best thing for you to do is to refrain from haram. The the worst evil we have is in our bedrooms. My wife no other than that uh the worst evil you have is the TV set. TV is the worst evil in your house. I watch only Huda TV and peace TV. Mashallah. How many hours? Half an hour a day. I watch your show every Saturday. Okay. What? What about the rest of the week? Yeah, we have Star TV. We have this TV. We have that TV and it's all music and it's all uh uh acting and and this corrupts the heart. It destroys your heart. So that is why when the you pray in the masid you don't have any taste for salah you don't have any taste for everybody's crying one of the brothers came to me I said last night something very funny happened said what happened he said we were praying inawi the two guys next to me were crying and sobbing and the one in front of me and the one behind me the imam everybody was crying I don't know I felt like was praying in a jail or something maybe some they killed someone or committed a crime and the poor thing He's shocked by the people crying and he's the only one who's not crying because he does not know Allah. What crime did our prophet doat wasam? What sin did our prophet do? Yet never ever he prayed without crying and sobbing out of the fear of Allahawel. So you know Allah better than him or you are free of sin more than him sallallahu alaihi wasallam. So you have to try your level best to go back to track. Welcome this month of Ramadan. Pray to Allah that he gives you the support to fast it to prayer to be away from sin and allahel would answer your prayer if you sincere. I pray to allahel that he makes us and you among those who fast and pray and give in charity until they attain and reach the highest levels of paradise with our prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam."
