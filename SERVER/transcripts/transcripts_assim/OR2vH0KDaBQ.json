  "transcript": "our first caller is Sister Medina from Germany allum alikum um if there is a great need or generally speaking a good reason for traveling can a woman use her non-mas Muslim Maham who's trustworthy for traveling I did not get your question um so can a sister who has a great need for traveling use her non-muslim Maham for traveling if if a woman has no Maham to travel with her it is not permissible for her to travel unless it is a real necessity similar to an a life or death situation so someone who's oppressed in her religion and fears FNA or on her honor and Chastity someone who is in great danger if not if she does not travel she may fall sick and ill and die and she needs medical attention she has to travel someone who is in a place that is not safe and there's no Mah to accompany her and she has to travel back to her home country or to her family and there's no one to accompany her but if she stays the evil of staying is far greater than the evil of traveling without a m then it is permissible to to travel she should try to travel with trustworthy uh uh women companion to reduce any evil that may happen and Allah Knows Best"
