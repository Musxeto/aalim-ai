  "title": "Reciting Surah Fatiha behind Imam",
  "transcript": "it has three questions one when should we recite the Fatiha with the Imam is it permissible to recite the fatiha while the imam is reciting it himself so when the Imam says a ham will help in I mean you see behind me al-rahman al-rahim rahmanir rahim' dances no you are obliged to listen to him so where do we recite it if you want to recite it between the pause between the fatiha and the surah and there is no pause per se from the Sunnah and the Sunnah is after you say later a little bit more Darlene I mean you begin a surah you don't leave a pause or a gap so that people would recite anything this is not the synonym so when should I recite the surah or the fatiha you may do that when the imam is reciting the other surah after the fatiha and you may not recite it at all because it's not mandatory when the Imam has read it in a loud prayer so two records of fagio two records of Mallory Manisha the imam recites it loud you don't have to recite it you can listen and this is sufficient for you if you would like to recite it then it would be when he is deciding the second surah and his second question"
