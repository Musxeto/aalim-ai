  "transcript": "sod off says can we take fan or performs Tijara from the Quran is it permissible to do so when you are pressed against time to take a decision if I understand the word fell which is glad tiding in opposition to believing in bad omens so if I'm coming out of my home and I see an accident in front of me and I say I'm not going to work today and I go back home why I saw an accident and this means that today my day is going to be bad and evil this is prohibited and a major sin it can mount up to it's called tasha or believing in bad omens the opposite of it is recommended which means alpha believing in Good Omens so I'm going out and I'm worried that my interview today is not gonna be good and I hear someone saying yes I read sorry it is a name which means happy or I hear someone say yeah father father has also a name which means successful so I feel happy because I heard these names and I feel positive my interview is gonna be great today today is gonna be a great day this is okay because this is thinking positive of Allah while believing in bad omens is thinking negative of allah azzawajal so this is fat and soda fizz asking can we perform faddle or Sahara from the or an and this is problematic because if I understand it correctly she means that I have a decision to make and it is so pressing that I have to make it immediately so what to do some people bring the most have the Koran and they open it randomly and they put their fingers and they look at the word if the word is hell or torment or the devil this is negative so they do not go ahead but if the word is paradise or Allah's approval and acceptance or a lot forgiveness or glad tidings to the believers this is positive I go ahead with it this is totally prohibited by the way a lot of the Muslims do this they randomly open the Koran and they put the fingers and they look at it and they act upon it this is like drawing the Lots the people of pre-islamic era in the jahiliyya those who were disbelievers and idol worshipers used to draw the Lots at least exxonmobil Islam what was that in their pockets they would carry three arrows one would say move on the other would say do not proceed and the third was blank so they put it in their bags and whenever they had a decision to make for example okay let's travel to up north for trade how is this with you guys said I don't know let's draw the Lots so they put their hand in the back and they choose one arrow if it goes says move on they go if it says do not proceed they said okay we cancel traveling to North to the north and we would look for another destination and if it was if it is blank they repeat this until they get it done this is not permissible this is what the idol worshipers used to do when you want as a Muslim to make a decision you have to firmly make a decision first after doing the homework and you diligence secondly you pray two rakahs of Asti Hara thirdly you say the dua fourthly you act upon it example I'd like to travel north for trade I have my money in my pocket I know who to talk to up north and I've decided to travel now in the beginning I'm hesitant should I travel or not is it feasible to trade or not I did my due diligence I studied the market I asked around and I am inclined to go ahead with it I feel comfortable so the decision was taken I praise the Hara two rakahs after Salam I make the door aloma Iniesta Hiro Kabir olymic watch dr. Luka be a quadratic was Alou coming p√∫blica etc the whole nine yards and I ask Allah social to facilitate things for me if there is good in it for me number four I booked my ticket I travel by car I go and travel up north having full trust dependence and reliance on allah azzawajal to do what I'm going to do this is the fullest aha it is not to choose for you it is not flipping the coin should I go or shouldn't I go this is drawing the Lots you make your decision your prayer Sahara you work accordingly but to open the Quran for random decision making process known as file this is totally prohibited and it is a form of humiliating the Quran why do we tell people do not hang posters of the Koran do not write Quran verses over the messages or in your guest rooms or in your living rooms why do we tell them don't hang it because it was not revealed to be a form of decoration Quran was not revealed to be a source of choosing between whether to buy Gucci shoes or Prada for example out of Allah this is humilating the Quran it was revealed to be recited read pondered upon acted upon not to be a form of decoration so this is not permissible and allah azza wajal knows best"
