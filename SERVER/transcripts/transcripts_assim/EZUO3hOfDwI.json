  "title": "When doing good deeds must we have intention 4 hereafter or can have 4 dunya as well assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "that whoever desires the Harvest of this world we will give them some of it but they will have no share in the Hereafter so when we do a good deed do we have to have the intention of getting rewarded in the Hereafter only or can we have the intention of getting rewarded both in the Hereafter and in the Dunya so what you do for the sake of Dunya and you are not doing it for the sake of Allah Allah may give it to you and Allah May deprive you from it but if you do Haram so I work nine to five and I'm good at my job and all what I want from my job is a good salary at the end of the month is my job Halal it's halal I may get this job I may get this salary and I may not this has no impact on my reward on the hereafter but if I work for worldly matters in a job that deals with riba or with bribery or with selling and buying Haram things then definitely I am sinful I may get what I wanted that is wealth and money through selling Haram and dealing with Haram but definitely on the Hereafter Allah azzawajal would not give me any reward and I would be sinful and I'll be held accountable so this is the comparison I can do things for the sake of Allah in this world not anticipating wealth and money but while doing this I find that Allah is showering money and wealth from all over the place alhamdulillah this is a possibility that Allah gives me wealth when I'm working for the hereafter and he may not but if it's the opposite if I'm working for this Dunya while doing Haram then definitely I'll be held accountable and there is no chair for me on the day of judgment um"
