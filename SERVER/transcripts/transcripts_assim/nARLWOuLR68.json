  "transcript": "Adnan from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Sheikh, suppose there is a person who had an argument with his fans and now he knows he is sinful but he is not apologizing to them due to his ego and pride. So he knows he is sinful but his pride and ego is stopping him. So is this kufr of arrogance? Of course not. Kufr of arrogance deals with things related to Allah Azza Wa Jal. Kufr of arrogance is to be arrogant to prostrate to Allah. Why? Because I don't want to put my head where my feet are. This is kufr of arrogance. But to be arrogant towards someone else, to feel that I am better than him because I am from this country, or I am from this ethnicity, or I am a manager and he is nothing. In this case, no, this is not kufr of arrogance. Rather, it is a sin by itself and Allah knows best."
