  "transcript": "assalamu alaikum welcome to another episode of with the Prophet I'm Ali Coleman of your hosts we today are continuing as promised a discussion about new Muslims we're joined by Sheikh Azam al-hakim of Saudi Arabia Salaam alaikum Wadi from Saddam Ahab's alone pleasure to have you with us and there are a number of things that we had hoped to get to today to continue talking about this rich topic there are many avenues that we've discovered that are important to get to get to my first question is about the difference between being born Muslim and deciding to be become a Muslim in the first case if someone is born into a Muslim family they are given a Muslim name and in the other case maybe perhaps it's adults evaluating the Islamic truth claims and deciding yes that level of processing intellectual Pro in the case of an imp resin in the newborn so what is the difference between being born Muslim and making a conscious decision to become a Muslim in our discussion here about yeah okay millena raheem alhamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallam oboro-sama ten little I mean Sayyidina Muhammad in water adios average rain there is a big difference okay between a born Muslim and a revert to Islam yes ala born Muslim hmm I was born to a Muslim parents raised to be a Muslim not necessarily having the conviction of being a Muslim I just found myself there and this is a blessing from Allah to us that we born Muslims so even if we go astray then inevitably we will come back because this is what we were born to be however a lot of us may fall short when traveling when facing new ideas things that we are misguided by misconceptions and we don't have the knowledge to counter that while when someone accepts Islam I'm envious he is 40 years of age he accepted Islam today which mean everything that he had committed in the past 40 40 years no matter how heinous and evil that was the moment he says ash-hadu I bear witness a la illaha that there is no God worthy of being worshipped Allah except Allah the moment he says this raising all is erased hmm so when I come to see this and I Wow look at this it's a great opportunity and and I don't have the same privilege I don't have the same luxury nevertheless I'm hopeful in Allah's mercy and I try my level best to do good deeds but a new Muslim is a new chapter it's a new life it's a new day it's a new beginning for him so he has more chances than me in gaining more good deeds with a clean she we promised to address the subject of incentives how does that Factory I mean that's one heck of a incentive the course that you have however many years of bad deeds erased there are other things though that we want to get into especially when it comes to heads of states those who are responsible for great many people would you like to talk about that see incentive this is the greatest incentive in the in the authentic hadith amnelis who embraced Islam on the eighth year of hijra who was one of the army leaders fighting against Islam and the Muslims Subhan Allah on the eighth year of hijra he was interested in Islam this guy is quite a case imagine even in the Mecca era when the Muslims migrated to Abyssinia the idol worshipers of Quraish sent two men to convince the Najah she the ruler of Abyssinia to send them back one of these messengers was on Romulus I see on the eighth year of Ashura allah azzawajal expanded his chest to accept islam so he goes to take the pledge of allegiance from the Prophet a little of Salaam and in Islam we would like to take the pledge of allegiance we extend our hand for a shake so he extended his hand to the Prophet Allah and the Prophet in return extended his right hand to shake then I'm robbing las pulled his hand away what is this mm-hmm so the prophecy what is wrong I'm mm-hmm so the amber said prophet of Allah I'll give you the pledge of allegiance but I'd like to make conditions okay so the Prophet smiled and said um don't you know that Islam erases everything that was before it meaning all your sins you because he was persecuting Muslim he was worried I have done hideous things so I'd like to take few conditions just to make sure I'm okay so this is the greatest incentive but this was not the only incentive Islam can also give financial incentives okay verse 60 in surah at-taubah chapter 9 so 60 chapter 9 Allah gives us eight categories where we can give zakat to and the fourth category is almo a lava onobu home those whose hearts are inclined to Islam so you can give you the cat money to someone who you feel that is close to accepting Islam as a form of incentive usually this is done with the heads of states now now they would call it a bribe but who cares people are taking tons of it it's given to Chiefs of tribes it's giving to dignitaries so this kind of incentive was done by the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam it was reported in an authentic hadith that the Prophet erase autosum was once in Taif after the Battle of her name and this was on the 8th year of hijra at the very end of it they gathered a lot of livestock because they won and the people fled their livestock so they were like forty thousand sheep twelve thousand camels cows and something that's enormous so the Prophet was standing on top of a small hill overlooking a valley and the valley was filled with sheep and next to him was a nomad and we know that the Arabs and the nomads loved their livestock so the man was shocked with what he was seeing so the prophet has some smiled and said to the man you like this you like these thousands of sheep and then I said yes the Prophet said it's yours end of story the guy ran and rushed to his tribe telling them all people accept Islam by Allah Muhammad gives the giving of a man who does not fear poverty who would give so much for just a man yeah he gave at least Allah to Sam a hundred camel each for those whom he had fought couple of weeks ago and they did not embrace Islam except hesitant and fearful of being prosecuted so such giving mmm-hmm there was done by the prophet alayhi salatu salam yet depriving the originally muslims in many cases the Prophet would give people money and deprive others so the Companions would complain Oh prophet of Allah if you give so-and-so he's poor but his Eman is strong and he would not listen to them and then he would explain Oh people I give those who are shaky in their Eman so that they can remain steadfast and I deprive those whose Eman is strong and solid so this shows you the benefits it shows you the wisdom of the Prophet Elisha said I'm giving lots of lots of very practical material stuff to to incentivize people even sworn enemies what about you know one of the things that you gave us a nice illustration about new Muslims coming to Islam you you said that it's like putting your life over laying your life into the frame of Islam and you have to cut away the things that don't belong and don't fit that are inconsistent if you're engaging in human sacrifice for example you can't do that anymore what about making mistakes obviously this is something is going to happen people have to slowly gradually make their way into Islam and along the way they're gonna be making mistakes how was how did the Prophet deal with this peace be upon him the Prophet that Islam was the best of teachers and he is our role model in all aspects of life when it came to dealing with Muslims with knowledge he treated them differently than those Muslims with no knowledge so if a person is knowledgeable and he does a mistake the Prophet to prevent him is also one of his companions once came out and the Prophet showed that he was wearing a golden ring okay and gold is haram for men to wear from mm-hmm so the Prophet era salatu salam took the gold ring from his finger and he tossed it on the ground and said angry to his companions why would any one take a stone of fire and place it in his hand and he walked away now if you compare this to the story of the man a nomad when the Prophet was sitting a little some in the Masjid surrounded by his companions mm-hmm a nomad comes into the Masjid he's a stranger he's a Muslim he came to the Masjid so the first thing you would think that okay he came to learn and all of a sudden the guy lifts his garment sits down and starts to urinate in the message inside the Muslim the companions were outraged I could imagine they just wanted to go and beat the heck out of him and the Prophet said ah Sam leave him until he finishes do not interrupt him and this is wise from the Prophet a son because medically speaking it would harm the man physically speaking it would pollute the whole message it if you run after a man who is urinating and he spoils the whole Bastion after the man finished the Prophet told the companions bring me the man so the man came he was in awe and terror and fear what did the Prophet say as a sinner shame on you you should not do this right no the Prophet said my son or my nephew these messages are built for prayer reciting the Quran for making dhikr and they're not built for these impurities that was it what a beautiful lesson to teach it's a good contrast the two stories you gave us of course but the funny thing is it was time for prayer so the man joined the congregation and during the congregation he said loudly he's an ignorant he does not know he said o Allah and everybody was listening it's a congregational prayer o Allah have mercy upon Muhammad and I and don't include with us anyone don't include anyone with us so your mercy will be deprived from the rest of writers who wanted to beat me yeah and after the prophetess um finished prayers said my nephew this is limiting Ella's mercy which is so vast and great so the prophet when it came to people who were ignorant he was new Muslims he was soft he was tolerant he was diplomatic in conveying the message hmm sick we're ready for a break when we come back I'd like to act continue with a few more things on our subject for new Muslims Salam alaikum welcome back to with the Prophet we'll continue our conversation on new Muslims we start with the subject of we talked earlier about this I'd like to go a little bit deeper maybe look at another aspect of it that is putting up obstacles for new Muslims overwhelming burdening the new Muslim with all these requirements and obligations what would you like to say about that how not to overwhelm the new Muslim with requirements well if you study the Sira of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam you would always find that it was a priority to call others to Islam so this was the main thing even if they were hesitant he would so Lala Salama compromise few things as we've mentioned about the story of the tribe of the thief when he told them that it is ok if you don't fight in Jihad and if you do not give in charity and he said and and explained later that once they become Muslims they will fight and they will give in charity so it is extremely important to highlight that this is a priority for people to accept Islam it is wrong when we put hurdles and obstacles in front of them a man comes to embrace Islam he's interested he's willing and instead of teaching him how to say the Shahada and accept Islam we tend to be more Roman than the Romans in the sense that oh listen you're married this is yes you see Christian no she's Hindu ah ok once you accept Islam you have to leave her hmm why I've been a teacher for thirty years well this is the law I say what are you doing said I'm just making things clear for him so no this is not your job we are not judges we are preachers we are to Islam what you're doing now is you're judging his life mmm in you judging what he has to do and what he must not do and this is wrong people come and say to a woman who wants to become a Muslim the moment you become a Muslim you have to separate from your wife from your husband you can't stay with him this is wrong they come and tell someone who's like in his 60s or 50s interested in Islam said yes but the first thing you have to do is you have to circumcise okay telling someone to sir get circumcised and making it an obstacle oh you have to quit your job or you have to do this this is not right at all you told me that the most important thing is to put it into a status of being in shirk being in shape meaning see Islam the most important thing is is still heat that you become a Muslim everything else which is wrong which is sinful which is it might be a major sin can be accommodated may be you'll spend some time in hell may Allah forbid inevitably gonna go to paradise inevitably because you're a Muslim and maybe Allah will forgive that all but if a person is not a Muslim and you're stopping him from becoming a Muslim because of these major or minor sins then he has no chance he's going to hell for eternity and that is why look at the bigger picture now this doesn't mean that we overlook sinful things bad things but all comes in due time right you know having the right environment putting ourselves around the right people adopting new habits in this new life is an important part of it would you like to talk about that I think that is the greatest and most important shew that we Muslims lack and definitely by default the new Muslims lack as well the environment has great impact on us mm-hmm in authentic hadith a man killed 99 people then he felt remorseful an assassin okay killing 99 persons taking their lives with his own with his own hands he went to a monk and he said listen I killed 99 people and I'd like to repent is it possible the monk was shocked said no way hmm Allah forgives you beyond redemption no way man you've killed 99 what are you talking about so that guy said might as well make it into three figures so he killed a monk so now he killed a hundred people then he asked about the most knowledgeable person in town so they directed him to a scholar and when he asked the scholar the scholar said sure who can prevent you from repenting however my son the village the town you're living in is filled with bad people it's filled with bad company you're accustomed to it and they're accustomed to you you in order to repent to Allah must go to village so-and-so where there are righteous practicing people stay with them worship Allah with them and your forgot your forgiven hmm I see so the guy goes and he dies in the middle of the way the angels of Hell descends and the angels of mercy as well and they fight among each other the angels of Hell say he killed 100 people the angels of mercy say yes but he repented so Allah sends an angel in the form of a man as Adi states to solve this confusion and he tells them measure the distance between the place of his death to both towns whoever he was closer to then he belongs to it so they start to measure Allah with his mercy orders the town of righteous spirit people to draw closer and the sinful town to draw further to go further so when they measure they find him closer to the righteous town and the angels of mercy take him what is the moral of this story if I am a new Muslim and I've been into sins all of my life all of a sudden I have become Muslim if my good company does not surround me 24/7 inevitably my bad company would catch up and say listen we've we miss you tomorrow Saturday night we have a party we have this we have goings we're doing paint shooting we're doing this things that I love and this is what Shaitaan invests mainly on so changing the environment is is important someone who's addicted to pornography the first thing to do in order to repent cut all internet connection remove all bad sites ensure that those in the family would always be watching you with the screen in their faces when you access the internet otherwise you're gonna go back again to that sin so changing the environment makes a person a new person yeah yeah we should set ourselves up for success and the music the cinema the the sports the oldest thing we have to be sensitive to what about the Prophet peace be upon him with in his interactions with new Muslims praising them acknowledging their accomplishments what what did he do what can we look to in this regard well this is human nature if I say good things about you you'll be encouraged you'll feel happy and you will do more and more and if I tend to criticize you and look down upon you and point out your shortcomings inevitably inevitably you'll be fed up and you will leave like the guy who went to a hiking trip with his son and the son tripped and shouted damn and the echo came back to him damn so he's telling he was shouting back to that sound who the hell are you me and he heard the sound coming back to him who the hell are you so he started shouting and cursing and getting nothing in return except what he says the father tailed told him stop don't do that he said don't you hear so this I hear but try something else try say you're beautiful so the guy the boy says you're beautiful and he heard the voice you were beautiful he said say good things and the more you say good things this is what you get in return encouragement is and praising people is the secret and the magic key to open closed doors Shh even advice or a shadow up the pace this guy is magnificent a tribe travels all the way to Medina sets their camp outside the skirts outskirts of Medina they all go in immediately to give the pledge of allegiance to the prophet Isaiah in the message so the Prophet looks at them and he said hmm are you all in they said yes but we have one person in our camp he's late he's coming on his way I said I'm the Pais what did he do once he put his saddle on the ground he went ironed his clothes took a shower calmed his hair wore his perfume but his nice new then after an hour went to the Masjid while his companions were all dusty dirty smelly so he took his time and then he came to the gathering and he gave the pledge of allegiance to the Prophet SM and accepted Islam did the Prophet let it slide nope he pointed this out and he said I said there are two characteristics in you that allah azza wajal loves and that is patience and tolerance or perseverance and this shows you that among this tribe all new muslims but this guy stands out in a crowd because of these two characteristics and this is what we have to do when someone accepts Islam we have to tell people and they would make him acknowledge yeah yeah we heard that yesterday you accepted Islam in the Islamic Center good job people give him gifts people praise Him we praise him by saying oh brother Ali is an expert in IT he masha'Allah accepted Islam and he would give a boost to our Islamic Center is this is that the guy feels confident and self fulfilled of this great leap to Islam not so sure we have reached the end of the episode thank you so much for your time and for opening us one if you can give me a one-word answer or two words short answer learning Arabic language for new Muslims important or not so much learning Arabic for new Muslims who want to pursue knowledge who want to be a students of knowledge who want to understand Quran by themselves and the Sunnah near is essential but those who may spend so much time and not succeed in it no you don't have to do this at the moment okay all right so there's no Arabic test to get into paradise I'm denying it is it thank you so much for being with us and thank you Sheikh for your taught like Allah he come and it's a pleasure being here mmm we look forward to continuing the show with next episode in sha allah we're gonna be talking about the underprivileged the poor inshallah until then assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullahu put a guy"
