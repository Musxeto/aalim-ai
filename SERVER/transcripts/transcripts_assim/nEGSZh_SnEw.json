  "title": "You said Hanafi Timing of Dhur & Asr are not according to Umm Al Qura Timetable, but they gave this",
  "transcript": "Z from Kashmir you told once that the timing of the hanafi school is not according to the timetable and correct yes the argument they give about the ass is the references of Al bukari and Al Muslim they give the two references uh the first one is that in which the prophet Alam compared his um with the two previous generations and the second one is the timing of last as long as the sun doesn't turn fail they justify the timing of by saying this so is it correct or not no it's not correct their understanding is incorrect the time has been decided in the Hadith of jiel may Allah uh peace be upon him when he prayed in the beginning of the time and the end of the time the end of the time is divided into two types type of selection and type of necessity the type of selection is when the erected object length is twice as long time starts when the object has a little Shadow pointing to the West this is time and as the shadow grows longer and longer and longer once the length of the shade is equivalent to the erected object this is the end of and the beginning of the time of now this time of extends till the shade is twice as the length of the erected object or the glow of the sun has faded and we can look at it so it's not as white and difficult to look at no it's a bit yellowish this this is a time that is recommended that you pray before but due to necessity or if you did not the time is extended until the sun sets so the hanfi timing is definitely out of the question and wrong"
