  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] can [Music] [Music] dear brothers and sisters in Islam and welcome to a new episode dealing with the Purity and the health of our hearts combined in the Hadith or mentioned in the hadiths of the Prophet the Hadith we are to discuss today is well known to the vast majority of us Abu Hur may Allah be pleased with him said the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam said do not laugh too much do not laugh too much for excessive laughter deadens the heart it kills the hearts it renders the heart to be dead laughter is when you have a cheering and smiling face and the teeth usually appear out of Joy if it is a accompanied by a sound that would be giggling a sound that can be heard from a distance and if it's soundless then this is smiling and the prophet Alat wasam asdah abdah may Allah be pleased with him said the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam used to smile I've never seen anyone smile more than the prophet sallallahu alaihi alhi wasallam which means that what a lot of the Muslims do today of having a frowning face and a serious look on their faces when you meet them is not from the Sunnah regardless of their titles of their uh um position in dawa when they claim to be Scholars and we've seen many of them their character is awful and unfortunately which means that the knowledge they have is not genuine it does not or it did not reflect on their souls because this is the prophet abdah says I've not seen anyone more smiling than the prophet may Allah be pleased with him he said the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam did not block me from entering and seeing him since I accepted Islam and I've never seen him without him smiling in my my face so if I go to a scholar a Muslim someone of knowledge and I sayam Alum and he's meeting me with a frowning face he's not a proper Muslim there's something wrong in him and his knowledge is not genuine because he has to be having at least a smiling face because this is what the prophet saidat smiling in the face of your brother is Charity this is an encouragement from the prophet Alat wasam so the prophet if you collect all the hadiths describing him they would indicate that he used to often La smile and sometimes he would laugh but without giggling and making a sound like so many of us us may do it shows that this is a sign of the purity of the heart when a person is smiling all the time that he is peaceful that he's easygoing unlike when people laugh excessively this shows that the heart is heedless and that it is hard so the heart is hard and stiff because excessive laughter means that there are no reminders of the day of Judgment of being accountable of remembering Allah and making Vick the heart is not susceptible for such Vick because Vick is the life of our hearts and this is what the whole program is about how to revive our hearts how to sustain the livelihood of our hearts and make it soft and make it filled with life Scholars say that the life of the hearts the glowing of the hearts is the essence of everything that is good however the death of the hearts the darkness of the hearts is the essence of all evil when the heart is alive that is its strength its ability to see its ability to hear its ability to visualize things and to process information and to see things for what they really are this means that the Hadith means that Hearts have a life and as well Hearts have death so the life of the hearts is to continuously obey Allah to hasten to do what Allah loves to be filled with the Quran with the Vick with the need and intention to do good things to others it's filled with peace and love while the death of the heart is is when it responds to other than Allah when it follows its swims and desires when it obeys Shan and the more the sins overlap and overwhelm these Hearts the more sick it becomes and the sicker the heart is the sicker the bodies are without any doubt may Allah have mercy on his soul says excessive laughter inherits the hardness and the stiffness of the heart and that would lead to being heedless and oblivious this is the death of the heart that is being oblivious and heedless IM may Allah have mercy on his soul says when the the heart is alive it dies with excessive laughter what if it's already dead IM says it becomes more black Al IM says the death of the heart makes it stiff and hard so that it would not benefit from any reminders like a dead person would not benefit by anything we say to them this is why when a person's heart is sealed he does not see right to be right and wrong to be wrong things are flipped things are perceived in the other form or way this is why when people are all going to the Masjid after the has been called and while they're going all to the Masjid you find people going to the opposite direction and looking your into your face as if duh what why are you looking at me and you're looking at them shocked you hear the call for prayer why aren't you praying the guy doesn't see anything wrong in what he's doing when you see a man well-dressed looks important and looks like he comes from a good family and has a good position and he's wealthy and he has a fancy car and he looks to be well educated but walking next to him or sitting next to him is a wife or a daughter not abiding by the hijab wearing her full makeup laughing loudly have no shame no shyness or bashfulness and he's proud of her going everywhere this is a sign that his heart is dead when you enter people's homes and they allow you into their guest rooms and you see all the portraits of their daughters and wives no shame where is the where is the where is the jealousy no this is Way Gone you guys come from the Stone ages no we come from the Quran and from the Sunnah we follow the Shar but you have a dead heart may Allah preserve us and protect us why does the heart die out of excessive laughter because when you laugh a lot and you overdo it the heart becomes stiff and almost becomes sealed so whenever it hears the verses of the Quran or the remembrance of Allah it does not react I was talking to a brother the other day and I was telling him to make amends with his father and try to go and seek his forgiveness because he said something that was disrespectful and he was undutiful to him so I said go to him and expect him not to forgive you from the first time fall down on your knees and kiss his feet kiss his hand ask him for forgiveness weep and cry said she I've never shed a tear in like 10 years what do you mean by cry and weep said Subhan Allah hearts that are made of stone only does not weep yours might be one of them and you have to revive your heart why do hearts die of excessive laughter because they become heedless oblivious neglectful and that's why they're unable to react to anything that draws them closer to Allah and because excessive laughter leads to Haram directly or indirectly because you just want to laugh even if that was on the account of making fun of Islam making fun of your parents making fun of others I am shocked why people pay standup comedians money so that they would make fun of their ethnicities and their religion and they would make fun of their countries and sometimes they make fun of themselves and we just pay money to laugh these are clowns yes sometimes some of them may have a moral story or Point some of them may have a punchline that is political or may help people but the essence of the whole thing is that what they're doing is Haram they earning is Haram and they have to cross the line to do these Haram things didn't the prophet say whoa and this is a word of threat and warning woe to those who speak to people and lie to make them laugh woe to them woe to them and these standup comedians usually are the most depressed people as psychiatrist say they want to make people laugh and the people do laugh but they themselves are messed up so many of them overdose so many of them commit suicide and we are shocked why they were filling the whole world with laughter and fun but deep down their hearts are dead and Shar came with so many commands and instruction to live a serious life and to engage in what reminds you of the Hereafter and to reduce the amount of laughter joking and fun is this the norm the answer is everything has to be put in perspective that's why the scholars identify wisdom what is wisdom what is hikma they say to put the right thing in the right place so definitely being serious and stiff is not something that Shar recommends 24/7 like Omar says may Allah be pleased with him I like to see an individual a man a real serious man but when he enters his home I'd like to see him like a young boy with his family so he jokes with his his wife with his kids there is fun there is humor but when he's out with the boys with the guys in the Masjid he's serious the more you lower your guard and start to make fun and start to make jokes people look down at you they don't take you seriously Shar tells you be serious mother says may Allah be pleased with her in the Hadith of the eclipse of the Sun that the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam addressed the Muslims and said oh nation of prophet Muhammad Alat wasam if you were to know what I know you would have laughed little and weeped and cried a lot and an may Allah be pleased with him said that the prophet sallallahu alaih Ali wasallam once passed by a group group of people laughing their heads off and joking so they were loud in their laughter so the prophet said to them remember often the destroyer of pleasures and who is the destroyer of Pleasures it's death when you remember that you and I are going to die soon you don't have time to laugh a lot but again this is not something that is a trend that we have to do 247 there are times where you can joke the prophet used to joke and humor his companions but he would never say anything that was a lie and this was not the trend this is not was not all the time but it was every now and then with the wife with the children with your kids when you're home yes lower your guard and you can joke and play with them but but remember do not excessively laugh smiling like the prophet didam is the best thing to do laughing every now and then is permissible but it is not a way of life that you keep on just trolling people or uh making fun of people or roasting people all the time and making fun and laughing all the time this lowers your bar and your dignity and would make people disrespect you"
