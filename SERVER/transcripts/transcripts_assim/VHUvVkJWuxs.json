  "transcript": "Khadija from Morocco Khadija Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu So my question is when I lift my head from Sujood I start saying Allahu Akbar until I am in the standing position. Is this correct? So you will not say Allahu Akbar. This is not the way to say it. The moment you raise your head you say Allahu Akbar. You said it in between this does the job Inshallah."
