  "transcript": "foreign yes sir what can I do for you so um my question is about um I know that you know riba and interest on a consumer level is Haram but does this apply to like government levels where the Nations have to take on like um loans and debt from other countries to you know acquire like the goods for their people and like it's something that every country does okay so brother saeed's question is related to the permissibility of what some governments May bend the rules if not break them when they deal with riba so we know that riba is a major sin one of the seven major sins in Islam and we know that it's between individuals I lend you a thousand you return at a thousand and hundred clear River so he's asking does this also apply to Big institutions Banks borrowing from Banks short-term or long term or in such as in the treasury Department or governments borrowing from Banks as in the case of the Central Bank borrowing from normal Banks or in the case of governments borrowing from the IMF and we know how they enslave countries with compound interests so a million that was borrowed 20 years ago is now a four or five billions compound interests and the government the country the people are all under debt and they pay riba and the IMF has no problem they control the world and they dictate raise the prices of fuel raise the prices of bread raise the prices of taxes and the people are being crushed and they're crying out of starvation and inflation and poverty I'm if doesn't care you borrow it from us we didn't come to you this is why Allah made it haram and this is why whenever you follow other than the Sharia of Allah you're gonna be squashed you're going to be insulted you're gonna be dependent on others begging them for pennies but if you abide by Sharia abide by Islam wholeheartedly not in some aspects you like and leave it when you don't like it no enter and embrace Islam wholeheartedly not selectively if you do this Allah would suffice you but you don't believe in Allah unfortunately they don't believe in Allah that's why they do Haram why do you have brothers why do you have night clubs why do you sell alcohol why do you deal with Haram why do you have riba don't you believe Allah yes of course we believe Allah is a provider and razakh so why don't you depend on him um you don't believe so not let's not beat around the bush and call us pay the Spade therefore it is not permissible for governments to borrow with riba from the IMF or from Banks or from individuals or from anyone because this is going against Sharia law and this is why we have Scholars to say what is according to Quran Sunnah not according to the whims and desires of Tom Dick and Harry"
