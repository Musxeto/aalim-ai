  "transcript": "uh you might think it's similar to what you've been asked before but there's a slightly detail basically um last year I was in a school and you had to have good grades and a good ranking in order to get to the best colleges and alhamdulillah by the will of Allah I worked very very hard and I got into the college that I'm in now which is a very good college but the thing is is that it may Allah forgive me to ensure that I had good grades unfortunately I cheated from time to times not a lot but I did cheat from time to time even though I was also working very hard and I was thinking and I know this is what was her but well I don't know and I said what if I transgressed against someone or some people because maybe I was selected instead of somebody else that didn't cheat and would that mean that it's hard for me to be in a college in this college and what that also affects the um in my income will my income be harmed as well if if you open a can of worms and it spreads all over you who are you going to blame myself so if I say to you oh what you've done is a grave sin you have to quit this University you have to ditch your grades not apply the certificate of your Olivers or a levels and you have to work as a janitor and nothing else and your income would be Haram would you do anything uh uh see this is why don't open a can of worms upon yourself and then start looking for a way out this is what shaytan does you guys have this in the UK the devil is in the details if you go into details the Devil comes and would ruin everything the fatwa came to you stating that if you cheated in one of the subjects or a number of subjects you have committed a major sin you're sinful but your degree is legitimate you can apply to a uni you can graduate and work and your income would be Halal but you have to repent this is the fatwa why dig in deeper as if you're digging your own grave and when you get the fatwa and you say whoops oopsie Daisy I wasn't anticipating this so what to do now the Sheikh said I have to do this I have to quit I'm not quitting I need to work I need to get married what are you going to do with the fatwa I'm going to ignore it and throw it in the Dustbin as I did when I cheated as I did throughout my whole life you brought this to yourself so stick with the initial fatwa your degree is legitimate your uni admission is okay don't think about others you may have cheated or deprived them from their rights concentrate on repenting expressing remorse asking Allah for forgiveness and do good righteous deeds and Allah Knows Best"
