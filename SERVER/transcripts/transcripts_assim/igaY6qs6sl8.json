  "title": "Can I promote product deals or sell during Black Friday? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Shafiq says can I promote product deals during Black Friday sales like create a webpage with Black Friday deals and promote that page to people who are interested in Black Friday's the Friday deals I get Commission when they purchase products people worldwide consider it as a shopping day but the name Black Friday rings alarm in me there's no problem Charla in benefiting from such sales so regardless of the name regardless even of the festival it's for Christmas and the holidays and in the new year benefiting from it buying stuff on that occasion is totally permissible making money out of it by selling your products is also permissible because selling and buying is halal providing that the products are Haddad however the name is not a good name so as Muslims we should not refer to it as Black Friday you can call it white Friday you can call it V Friday or whatever but as much as possible do not promote the name yourself and you must not advertise such a name but there's no problem in selling and buying and making money out of it insha'Allah"
