  "transcript": "uh Sheikh I I make 3D designs uh like um I make 3D interior design for the room or a building for example and a lot of these Interiors have Haram things like statues sculptures Etc and I know it's Haram for me to make a statue in 3D but we didn't be permissible for me to download it a 3D statue that someone else has made and use it in my design since I didn't make it it is not permissible to copy and paste something that is Haram and consider that to be someone's else responsibility you are responsible for whatever you include in your design so if you design a nude man from the Greek history as their sculptures and statues a form of Art this is Haram on you even if you did not draw it you're the one who's incorporating it in your design and the risk is in Allah's hands it's not going to be dependent on this Haram thing or that so don't include it and if Allah wills it you will be granted risk from ways and means you do not anticipate and Allah Knows Best"
