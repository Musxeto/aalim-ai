  "title": "Does reward of deed suffice for an expiation Broke oath: free slave Recite la ilaha illa..sufficient",
  "transcript": "the second question is from iman and iman says we normally supposed to free a slave for expiation for the breaking of an oath so we know that if i say wallahi i will not eat biryani tomorrow then i am served with briyani and i want to eat go ahead eat there's no sin on you but you have to expiate and the expiation allah mentioned that it is feeding or clothing 10 poor people and freeing a slave one of the three you choose so she is saying that we know that freeing a slave is one of the means of expiation and if i recite 100 times as per the authentic hadith i get the reward of freeing 10 slaves so is this authentic the answer is yes definitely it's authentic the hadith is authentic so if it's authentic will it be sufficient for the expiation meaning i broke an oath so instead of actually buying a slave and freeing it i say 100 times and this is equivalent to freeing ten so i have one down and nine to go and if it isn't authentic what's the reward well the hadith is authentic without any doubt whoever's this is part of the athkar of the morning and evening you say it 100 times in the morning 100 times in the evening allah azza would reward you as if you had freed 10 slaves and would erase 10 bad deeds and reward you with 10 good deeds with 100 good deeds and elevate you in jannah accordingly now the question is does this suffice my expiation of my oath answers no why because there is a difference between al jazeera and what does that mean check we don't understand arabic i'm coming to you come on hold your horses jazza means reward each za means to suffice so the reward of saying allah to the end the reward is as if you had freed 10 free uh slaves but this does not suffice for actual and actual expiations of freeing a slave and i'll give you another example that would make it clearer to you saying the prophet said it's equivalent to one third of the quran and reciting it three times is equivalent to reciting the whole quran i understand this is authentic hadith we understand that beautiful so now let us cascade it to the same situation if i were to pray fajr prayer for example or any voluntary prayer and i don't recite the fatiha i just recited three times in the first rakah three times in the second rakah as if i've recited the whole quran would my prayer be valid or invalid no doubt that it would be invalid why because i did not recite the fatiha yet it was included in reciting the whole quran when i read the surat al-qasas three times this is the reward you'll get but it doesn't suffice from reading the fatiha itself and i'll give you a second example and with that we will answer your question inshaallah the prophet said ali susam whoever prays fajr in congregation and remains in the masjid remembering allah azzawajal until the sun rises then he prays to raka's this would suffice him as if he prayed as if he offered umrah and hajj complete complete complete so now would i do this once in a lifetime and say alhamdulillah i don't have to go for hajj because it's obligatory upon me to go for hajj once in a lifetime and i did the prayer in the masjid and i got rewarded the answer is no you get the reward but it does not suffice from you going physically for hajj once in a lifetime and i hope this answers your question"
