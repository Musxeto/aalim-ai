  "title": "Can we say Ali alaihissalam, what was his rank among companions, & did he lift the door of khaybar?",
  "transcript": "Amar from the Netherlands um I have a question um iard I heard a lot from people that Ali that he lifted the door of and I also that he only removed it which one is correct first of all we do not say Ali to distinguish him from all the companions we say this is what Allah said in the Quran this is how Allah described them and Allah described those who gave the prophet Alam the Pledge of Allegiance under the tree that Allah has or Allah is pleased with them so we don't associate Ali may Allah be pleased with him with this is used usually by the sh and some of the scholars ofnah May by mistake fell in this mistake or the scribes who wrote the knowledge from them maybe changed it uh uh without their knowledge is Ali one of the strongest companions without any doubt he was the strongest of the Companions and the most bravest of all may Allah be pleased with him however Abu Bakr Omar are better than him and this is our belief as and we believe that they're all in jenah and that the prophet died while being pleased with them and Abu Bakr and Omar are buried next to the prophet Alat wasam in his home in the house OFA thirdly fourthly who's counting whether he carried the gates or uh uh opened it it doesn't matter because what counts is that he was strong but was he a Superman he could fly he could do things that others don't can't do no he was a human being but indeed one of the finest specimens of all may Allah be pleased with him and he was strong so there's no need to exaggerate and affiliate stories of superheroes with him that are not authentic or uh uh logical even and Allah Knows Best"
