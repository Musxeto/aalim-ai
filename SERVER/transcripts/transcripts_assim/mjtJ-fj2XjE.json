  "title": "Prophet ﷺ‎ said don't reply 2 those who don't give salam but a sheikh said otherwise & I believe him",
  "transcript": "did you say salaam alaikum uh yes or no no what did the prophet say Allah whoever starts questioning you before giving Salam do not reply to him so you want to answer to your question I heard a scholar saying that if you are already in the in The Thirst Etc and then you don't have to say salaam because it's already done in the beginning so you tell me what you tell me what I should do when I hear the prophet saying should I listen to your scholar to the prophet Islam sure I will say salaam but that's what I believe is again this is a a crossroad whenever the prophet says something and a scholar says something who should we follow I don't think this is a I think this is a no-brainer but when I say that no I believe what the Sheikh said this is a very huge problem on the day of judgment how would you face the prophet saws didn't I say this okay maybe I misunderstood the Hadith the Hadith is authentic by the way so you go back to the scholar and ask him whether there is something else to reply to this Hadith maybe he would say to you well there is an incident in Sun where the Prophet saws was with his companions and one after one answered asked asked him questions without giving salaam I would say okay that does the job but without that I would be hesitant to follow the scholar without following a Hadith that is Crystal Clear from the prophet Allah besides do you think I'm okay with salam alaikum every time it would be much feasible for me to go into the question and answer without any problem"
