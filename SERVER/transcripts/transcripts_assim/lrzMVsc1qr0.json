  "title": "Saying Ameen to the Dua of the Imam in a Raised Voice during Khutbah",
  "transcript": "Daffy from Indonesia Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So, Jumat Qutba here in my country, we used to say Amin when the khutib pray the second part of the Qutba. For example, praying like Allahumma kufir lil muslimin wa muslimat wal mu'minin wal mu'minat and Allah ya minhum wal amwat and all of the jamaat says Amin. My question is, is this permissible? To say Amin to the dua of the imam, this is permissible. However, it should not be said in a raised voice to avoid the dispute whether we are talking or not. So, you just say it in a voice that you hear yourself by saying Amin. Not by how they do it in so many Muslim countries where the whole masjid is shaken with Amin and people are shouting their lungs out. This is not the right way of doing it, but Inshallah, this does not impact the validity of their prayer."
