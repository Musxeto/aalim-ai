  "transcript": "Teodora from Romania Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh I'm a Muslim revert for over a year now Alhamdulillah and I really want to move to a Muslim country. Is there any dua from the Sunnah and from the Quran that I can make? Jazak Allah Khair Du'a are divided into two types. A du'a for a particular reason where the Sunnah told us, if you want this, you have to say this. And there is a du'a that is general, where the Sunnah did not tell us, if you want for example to heal your knee injury, say this du'a. There is a general du'a, O Allah, heal my injury. O Allah, provide me with a good job. O Allah, cure my ill uncle. This is general du'a. Likewise for hijrah. To my knowledge, there isn't any prescribed du'a for someone who would like to make hijrah. But there is general du'a. Every time in sujood, every time before concluding my salat, before salam, when it is time between adhan and iqamah, in the last third of the night, when it is raining, I raise my hands and say, O Allah, I praise Allah Azza wa Jal, Allahumma lakal hamd, hamdun kathiran tayyiban mubarakan fihi. I offer salutation upon the Prophet ï·º, Allahumma salli wa sallim ala abdika wa rasulika rabina Muhammad. Then I go and say, O Allah, facilitate for me a safe and good, prosperous hijrah to a Muslim country where I find my peace of mind and tranquility, where I can practice my religion and learn more and more about Islam. This is general du'a. You can do that as many times as you wish, and Allah knows best."
