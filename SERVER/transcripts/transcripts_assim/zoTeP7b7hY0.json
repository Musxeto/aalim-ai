  "transcript": "Ubay from Tunisia Assalamu Alaikum Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi How are you doing Sheikh? Alhamdulillahi Rabbil Alameen My question for today is what are the etiquettes of using miswak? Is it inappropriate to use it in the masjid or in the street in front of people? Do we use our right or left hand? Jazakum. There are many etiquettes for using the miswak but none to my knowledge is part and he used to extensively do this and he recommended brushing our teeth whenever we want to perform wudhu whenever we want to pray before praying and when also a person enters his sunnah. Now a lot of the people due to the western etiquettes see it repulsive to use the miswak in the masjid, in a conference room, in a business meeting, in the streets and it appears that they don't have anything against you but they have against something against the sunnah. So this one way or another raises feelings of resentment. May Allah Azza wa Jal protect us. And there's nothing wrong in doing it. I'm not spitting in your face when I'm using my miswak like this. Yes if I'm talking to you I wouldn't do, yeah you should do this, you should do that. This is inappropriate and unethical. But if I'm on my own, if I'm walking in the streets, if I'm in a meeting listening to someone and I'm using my miswak, I'm attentive. Even in khutbat al-jumu'ah and this may raise eyebrows for some unless they have micro-pigmentation. Anyhow, if you are listening to the khutbat of the jumu'ah and you fear that you will fall asleep, the khatib is so articulate to the extent that everybody's nodding their heads and dozing into sleep. Because it's a way of giving the khutbah and the subject itself and so if you fear falling into this form of lack of concentration, there's no problem in using the miswak. Oh Shaykh but the hadith says if you touch the stone then you have no Friday. This is for those who are playing around. But for someone who's about to fall asleep and he cannot shake it off, then using the miswak for this purpose insha'Allah would be fine and Allah azza wa jal knows best."
