  "title": "Is there anything called 'luck' in Islam? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "the question is my brother Atif is there anything called luck in Islam the concept of luck as the Westerners understand it does not exist in Islam where they tend to believe that whatever happened to an individual was pure good luck or bad luck meaning it had no preordainments to it it had no justification no wisdom and of course we don't as Muslims believe in that we believe that everything was preordained by allah azza wajal prior to creating the universe by fifty thousand years so everything that will happen till the day of judgement was already and now it is written in the preserved tablet and this writing was fifty thousand years before Allah created the creation so nothing is happening haphazardly without a wisdom without a reason however we as Muslims believe that someone is fortunate someone is lucky when allah azzawajal bestows his favours and blessing upon him so if I get to receive a gift a big library of books everybody says wow the shakers is lucky meaning that Allah has favored him he's fortunate not that out of the blue it came to him and we don't know who gave him this name or this blessing and the word luck in Arabic translates to have fortune luck and it's mentioned in the Quran in so many places and among the most prominent places when the people of karun show the fortune that he was given they said in the Hula do harvin arene he is extremely lucky to get all of this wealth so luck here to them was nothing related to allah azza wajal and this is why the wise people advised them to fear allah azza wa jal and not to be deceived by the glamorous things in this dunya and after a while they saw what allah azzawajal had done to karun they realized their mistake and allah social knows best best you"
