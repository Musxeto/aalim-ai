  "transcript": "um adnan says that if someone was not practicing and he used too fast few days and miss few days now he is chronically ill and he's unable to make up for the missed days should they feed poor person for every day missed or not first of all if a person skips fasting due to a legitimate reason as mentioned in the Quran those who are sick or traveling they must compensate and make up later on so these are two legitimate excuses for skipping fasting and likewise for those who have their monthly period or postnatal bleeding they are considered to be sick so once they recover and do not have any obstacles to prevent them from fasting they must make them up the second type is of a person who simply does not have a legitimate reason just before Fechter he thinks and says I'm too lazy I'm not gonna fast today this type of person who intentionally skips a day of Ramadan cannot make it up and even if he does it would not be counted so you do not feed a poor person for such a data was missed why because he deliberately intended not to fast though Allah has prescribed fast fasting over him in a particular time that is the day of Ramadan can i fast the month of Ramadan in Muharram or in rabbir or in Rajab of course not why because prescribed it to be fasted in this particular month so anyone who comes without a legitimate reason and skips it and wants to fast it elsewhere that would not be accepted exactly like the  prayer the iodine is given I'm at my desk working or in a meeting they say let's pray I said no I'm not gonna pray now maybe if I finish work I'm gonna pray they come and say listen there's five minutes before our I then go and pray say no not now and then ah sir I than is given says it oh Allah I will go now and pray no it will not be accepted the prescribed time is from this to that and you intentionally missed it likewise Arafah is on the ninth of the Higa you come couple of days early and go to alpha and stand there alone your Hajj is invalid you come five days later and stand in alpha alone is Hajj is not valid if you did not stand a moment in the day time of that or night time of Arafah then your Hajj is invalid because it is prescribed at a specific time the third case would be if a person started fasting so he intended to fast in a time at nine or ten o'clock he felt dizzy tired or lazy and he was tempted to break his fast such a person must make up for that day what's the difference the difference is that person number two did not intend to fast to begin with while person number three had commenced fasting and broke it and whenever you commenced a bad a form of worship and you break it intentionally you have to make it up this will not exempt you from the sin but as a punishment you have to make it up because it's a pillar that you have boy did yourself and you have to make that up so if he is number one or number three if he is sick chronically or his number three that he broke his fast after commencing it and he's unable to make it up now he should feed a poor person if he did not fast at all from the beginning of his number two there is no expiration and he cannot make it add up all what he needs to do is to ask a large order for forgiveness"
