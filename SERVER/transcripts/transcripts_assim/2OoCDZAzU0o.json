  "transcript": "Rumaan from India Sheikh if you give me permission can I ask two questions? I cannot unfortunately I have like about ten people waiting and the time is so short Akhi. So one question. No problem Sheikh Akhi. So this question is I'm asking on behalf of my wife who is a revert. So when she was born her father and mother were not married and they married after five years after she was born. So is it, does she, are her parents, I mean her dad's side family will be mahram to her or like are they non-mahram and she needs to cover in front of her dad and her brother? Okay first of all this is an issue of dispute when it comes to Muslims but when it comes to non-Muslims if they were not married if they were a boyfriend girlfriend and they got married later on and the man he had his daughter or son following him in Arabic this is a rough translation meaning that he took him over or took her over and gave her her name and considered her as his daughter then she is his daughter because he's the biological father he's not someone from outside he is the biological father and his side of the family are her mahram like his siblings etc. They are her mahram and Allah Azza wa Jalla knows best."
