  "transcript": "of Allah's creation to worship Allah by praising Allah but he did not have anything material with him all what he had was his sole belief that the Creator is one but he could not know how to worship Allah so he did not pray prayer when it was made M mandatory in the sense of General prayer not the five uh daily prayers he used to pray and recite the Quran which was revealed to him is sometimes Accused by the enemies of Islam that he burnt all copies except his how to refute this this is wrong a man may Allah be pleased with him burnt all the copies including his he only kept the copies that were compiled and written by zabit may Allah be pleased with him and the three we mentioned yesterday the the who were with him from the qurishi people whom we mentioned their names he instructed and he requested he did not force people they did not have any police so he instructed all the companions of the Prophet alham to bring whatever copies they have after zabit and those with him wrote These copies and the sahab all of them agreed upon them knowing that this is exactly what was revealed to the prophet Alat so his copy along with all the copies even of the copies of Ali may Allah be pleased with him all of them they were collected and burned so that it would ensure the preservation of the Quran as it was revealed to the prophet Alat wasam without any alteration without any change and to not leave any room for someone to come and say we have a copy of uh the Quran that was with Abu musar here you go it's different than what you have it it was not possible it was all destroyed to preserve the Quran as it was revealed sh you mentioned that orders of the suras was decided by Prophet Sall wasallam or the companions but I remember hearing from another speaker that it was even the order of the suras were inspired to Prophet by jelam he sallallahu alaihi wasallam revised the Quran to jelam please clarify there has to be an Evidence you heard from a scholar I heard from a scholar and he heard from a third scholar so this the list goes on this is there isn't any clearcut evidence because if there were a clear cut evidence ald there is no dispute but the problem is that there are Scholars who say it is stated by jel peace be upon him and they call this and some say it is it's almost the same word and what's the difference we have to stand from meaning do this no it's I have to wait it's inspired Allah made me succeed in choosing something and that is why they say that the Sunnah of the Prophet Alat the Hadith is either or means that the prophet was instructed to do this and that's what he did as in the Battle of Hud when Omar came to the prophet Alam and said why are we giving concessions aren't we on the right aren't they on the wrong so why do we give in in our religion and the prophet said I am Allah's servant and I will do what he tells me this is what he stood up I can't I can't choose this is what Allah instructed me and what the prophet does out of his own out of his own personal reasoning and it so happens that it is accepted and approved by Allah so it is accepted likewise what brought us to this subject order of the the order of the suras now some Scholars say it is it is exactly what J told the prophet give me evidence because if you tell tell me if it is you have to bring the evidence that the prophet before he died he said and so on give me something he said sorry I can't okay then how do you say it is that it was stated to be like this they say because the prophet said that so he mentioned both suras then told us that they are and that we all should learn them and keep them because so and so and so and he said so he mentioned these two suras and he mentioned three suras here and he mentioned one one or two suras here so this means that it should be in order said yes it's in order in these suras but the remaining 100 suras he did not talk about so how can you say no it's a must we cannot say that and those who say w it is the isad of the companions to put it in this order sounds the closest to reality and that the way that we can combine all thesei and Allah knows us she you said when Imam recite the Quran the other people pray behind doesn't recite FAA and Prophet sallam has said that there is no Salah for those who recite those who don't recite FAA how can you reply all of this because I prayed I told you don't don't that this this question comes to me every single time I lead prayer and the reason is because I do not leave a gap after the F they and people start thinking this she is from March is it's from Mars or from Venus why doesn't he leave Gap because this and this and this you know more than he lives Gap so there's something wrong well it's it's very simple whatever we do in prayer it should be and this is not we don't want to elaborate although there is nothing much left in the course all the rest is inshallah very easy we might and there is a very big big possibility that we finish before uh prayer if you are awake inshallah everything we do in prayer we have to know the evidence behind it meaning when I raise my hands and say allahar where should I do it should I do this or should should I do this what what's the determining Factor theith so if I raise my hands I will quote you a Hadith why don't you raise it to your shoulders I will quote you why do you raise it to your ears I will quote you but if you come and say allahar why are you punishing yourself said yes we have to hold our ears who says this the Sheikh the IM the maab I tell you with all due respect the prophet says pray as you have seen me pray and I have have not seen him who saw him sah Abu Ahmed did not see him he narrated The Hadith he reported the Hadith that report this therefore therefore when we come to the recitation of the Quran when the prophet led the prayer we also know the pauses where the Prophet used to pause in theah of Muslim Abu may Allah be pleased with him came to the prophet and said oh prophet of Allah sallallahu alaih wasallam do you see when you start prayer you make a pause in the beginning what do you say and he said oh Abu I knew that only you would ask me about this because he was very keen on learning and he said I say Allah the you all know of of course so this is the most one of the most authentic du recitation of the very beginning of the prayer and those who report narrated to us and describe the prayer of the Prophet Alat never ever said that he used to pause between fa and Surah he used to have two pauses one in the beginning of the Salah which is and the one before making and and and and Scholars say that this is just to take a breath and then allahar it's very very short but nowhere ever in the Sunnah you will find that and after he finishes fa he used to give a pause so that people would recite the faat after him never and that is why and he is one of the best knowledgeable people of our time may Allah have mercy on his soul if you if you read his books it is 100% compatible to the Sunnah even if this means that he goes against his own school of thought which is hamali school in so many cases like 40% he goes against H school but with the reasoning with the evidence that's why he says and it's clearly printed that the imams of the Haram are not following the Sunnah in this therefore whenever we pray people ask the question why do you do this so this is following the Sunnah then the second question comes if you're following the Sunnah when do we read the fa and this brings us to the ruling of fa and the ruling of fa reciting the fa is as the brother just quoted there is no prayer valid for those who do not recite with so this is Hadith that obligates it it's a must it's a and there is another Hadith where the Prophet Alam prayed once and then he addressed those who prayed with behind him do you pray or do you recite the Quran behind me do not recite the Quran except with fa because there is no prayer valid without fat Abu who narrates this Hadith said and then after he said this and then people were denied from this they denied from what from reciting the F and that is why these hadiths and other different hadiths made the people split into two a group that were led a group that was led by Imam alkari the famous IM the compiler of and he says that you have to read you have to recite the fat another group was led by Abu and the IM of the Hani school he says You must not read the fa at all if you're praying behind the Imam so now we have two big imams you know like mountains and each one has his evidence so what's the ruling coffee break the ruling was Islam may Allah be pleased with him and may Allah have mercy on his soul one of the greatest Scholars of Islam one of the greatest Defenders of Sunnah and one of the greatest warriors against B and he's the shikh of one of the greatest Scholars of Islam as well and he's the sh of and he's the sh of and he's a ofab all of these guys are mountains of knowledge he compiled a small chapter and he called it which meaning collecting the knowledge which meant that the knowledge of the ruling on reciting behind the Imam and he compiled all these evidences and analyzed it and came up with the verdict that reciting the fa behind the IM in the loud prayer is must it's neither mandatory and it's neither forbidden and this is how we look at all of these evidences and understand understand them one says okay then how do you interpret and explain there is no prayer valid to those who do not pray with umab we say is this a general rule or specific how why how do you say specific explain those who say specific are the same guys who say there are two rulings h two this why do you say specific you cannot apply it in F why yeah this is contradicting this is contradicting but it's General when the prophet says when the prophet says now this is General so you have to specify it with something else when the prophet says don't visit Graves this is General but when the prophet says I forbade you from visiting the Kor now go visit it so when we say now go visit it this is General so do we have to every one of us go and visit the why it's a permission but so how do you know it's permission the scholars no no no there is this is in when Allah says what is the meaning of I am in the state of if I break the state ofam because I'm through of my om or my Allah says if you are through from your go and Hunt is an order so that does this mean after every okay bring me my shotgun and I go and and start shooting birds and animals and maybe cats and dogs no but Allah says this is an order Scholars say whenever there is something that's forbidden and an order after it this means the order gets you back to the ruling before it was forbidden so before you were made forbidden to visit the graves what was the ruling it's permissible permissible if you go to the Grave you don't to go to the Grave not go to the Grave to worship of course you know to visit the graveyard the cemetery it was permissible and then the prophet said do not why because people were doing things that may affect their and after a while after all became Muslim then they says I used to forbid you from visiting the cemeteries now go and visit it because it reminds me reminds you of the day of judgment so now the ruling became exactly as it was before being forbidden likewise once you thrw you from your go and hunt this is not an order this is is taking it for to the same ruling before now when someone says the prophet said to those who do not recite this is a general ruling so how do we specify it by saying now you're saying it's must it's saying it's recommended that you recite but if you don't your prayer is still valid how do we know that this does not apply on every PR SLE case one example the Hadith when the companion when the prophet was bowing the sahi came to the mid he saw everybody's bowing from the door says allahar he bowed and he walked while he was in the all the way and this is you CAU meari and elsewhere and when he finished the prayer he he said who was that man who walked what how did the prophet know he could see from behind himat and he said I'm not like you I can see you from my back Allah if he could see B when they challenged him the pagans of qur they told him you went Mah to Jerusalem and you were taking to the seventh heaven in one night and came back you never went to this area in your life he said yes this is what happened they went to Abu Bakr do you believe your friend said yes I believe him you believe him said yes I believe him I believe Allah is giving Revelation to him shouldn't I believe him in what is much easier than this so they told him describe to us you said you went describe it to us what did Allah do Allah made the Masid in front of him and he started describing the windows the doors the colors where the People Park their camels where you know no parking Zone everything he described it to them exactly so the prophet has the ability to see sallallahu alaihi wasallam from Allah so the man who did this stood up and said I did it prophet of Allah I saw you bowing making rour I could not walk straight how do I do this and you compare this to the people when they enter the Masid and the IM says they wait until he prostrates and sits and prostrates and make and why are you doing this he said the is not valid if we join him so why should we you know pay this effort make two s without reasoning save time I'll save energy this logic of people this is Haram the minute you enter the Masjid you have to join the IM on whatever position he's in and this is a fourth issue write it in the in so the prophet after hearing his justification says may Allah increase your keenness on following the Sunnah but do not repeat this did the man recite the faat no did the prophet tell him bring another no which means that there is no prayer to those who do not recite the fa is not every time period there are exemptions you can take from it and among them is when the Imam recites the fa allowed so he"
