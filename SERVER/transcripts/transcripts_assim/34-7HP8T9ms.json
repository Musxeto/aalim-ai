  "transcript": "like is it better to not sleep and doing worship the whole night of Ramadan or is it better to sleep a bit and then wake up and worship as it won't be considered as tud if we don't sleep it is best to do what is normal and good for your body and for your daily routine not sleeping the whole night and worshiping Allah the whole night was not done by the prophet himself as mentioned in Allah in the Quran says to his Prophet that you may sleep you may pray half of the night or 2third of the night but you may sleep you have to sleep because if you don't sleep this means that the whole day would be spent in sleeping and you would not be able to study or to go to work or to do your chores at the home and this is not Islam Islam is a religion of balance of knowing how to organize your time the last 10 nights of Ramadan is a different story because this is 10 nights throughout the whole year where you are trying to detect so you spend your time in Sal Quran and the likes but the rest of the month of Ramadan no you go to do your own work as usual you sleep and you wake up and dedicate part of the night for your worship and and and and Dua and Quran that would be more than fine inshallah"
