  "title": "The Most Effective Means Of Dawah Today - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "according to you what's the most effective means of giving daah as I mentioned earlier each means has Advantage disadvantage but if you ask me in terms of reach in terms of cost Effectiveness I would say number one today is the satellite channel each one has his Advantage it should continue I'm not saying the other means should not continue but in terms of reach as far as Satellite channel is concerned a person can reach millions of people because for a person to come for a public lecture a non-muslim he may feel uncomfortable coming in front of thousands of people if a person gives a talk how many people can gather 100 few hundred thousand few thousand 10,000 how many the largest gathering I have addressed is 1 million people that's also once in the Blue Moon otherwise normally 100,000 people but on the satellite channel you can reach millions of people alhamdulillah millions of people and on estimate alhamdulillah now on average PE TV is reaching about 70 million viewers at present and inshallah I think in this Ramadan it's going to increase or going to multiply insh this Ramadan the statistics about 6 months back you know that throughout the world alhamdulillah now we're reaching more than 200 countries so what I have did in the past 15 years in the field of dawa that we did this P TV in one year alhamdulillah the amount it has reached the message that has been conveyed is much more than what we did in the past 15 years so the effectiveness of a satellite channel is much more and the cost Effectiveness if you calculate the amount you spend and divide it with the number of people watching it is maybe 5% a month it's less than 2 cent per person a month which is absolutely cheap"
