  "transcript": "iima from Guinea Allah bless you and reward you am mean so my question today share is about the fasting on the day of Doubt because like for example last year and this year I'm fasting almost all Shaban except like the first days or so uh so basically last year there was the day of Doubt for us because the C was not seen and all of that so I didn't pass that day of Doubt but this year this might happen again because authorities are quite not really competent let's say it like that but since I'm already fasting almost all of shaan if there's a day of Doubt can I still fast it as Shaban then and continue my stuff or no it better not to do it no you must not do it it's best to leave a day or two before Ramadan to avoid uh disobeying the prophet Alam and fasting the day of doubt"
