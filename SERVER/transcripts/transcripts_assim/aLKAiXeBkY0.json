  "transcript": "uh brother faruq from qatar if uh if my question is i think i heard uh he said that because his worship we cannot make our own way to worship allah so we must only use drugs from the sunnah or from the quran and only very rarely can we make our own dwaras if we are struggling with the arabic language and we must not make our own into like a habit of like saying them always so is this correct okay i did not hear the question from the beginning but i assume that his his question was there was a guy who says that we cannot make dua in our sujud in our salat except with which the prophet alaihis was used to make to us so any dua in the quran or in the sunnah we can make it if we want to make a dua of our own this is not permissible so this da he says and likewise we cannot make any dua in other than arabic because salat we cannot say anything other than arabic and this is not true you can make dua of your own you can formulate dua because allah says invoke me and i shall respond to you and he did not say you should follow the following procedures for dua just says call me invoke me therefore you can make whatever dua you wish not necessarily from the quran or from the sunnah definitely if it's from the quran and the sunnah it's a higher level because it's a better quality but sometimes we need to tailor make our own dua for a specific thing we want so there's no problem in that also this is backed by the evidence from the sunnah where the which we know is a number of duas verses of the quran sunnahs or general dua can be made to heal someone who's sick or afflicted by evil eye or jin possession etc the prophet said [Music] show me you're saying why this means that they make their own rookia and the prophet just wanted to make sure that there is no shirk in it and this also indicates that this is permissible as for arabic allah is the lord of all languages in salat you cannot worship allah except with the arabic that was revealed to the prophet salam when it comes to saying allahu akbar these are prescribed that words and phrases that you must memorize by heart whether you know arabic or not but in sujud if you want to ask allah to heal the illness of your son and you don't know how to say that in arabic there's no problem at all in saying in your own language you"
