  "transcript": "I shake due to the present is going on I was above 60 years old I've been going to Masjid for prayers regularly a hamdulillah Russian when I go recently couple of days before on Hanuman by putting a mask and handlers so people are making fun of me one guy said this is the kitchen kitchen kitchen gloves why are you wearing black mask I said this is a benevolent the pharmacy my kids drug it well I said you must have you must have inserted your soldiers a big bag plastic bag and as I was telling me you must come like it like a doctor from the hospital not wearing a jacket or Hospital in a prana or something like that all these things it hurts me a lot it hurts me a lot believe me then since then I have changed that place of my you know a syllable what he called place of prayers in a month I'm went to extreme right and the first or I used to pray just behind their Imam every time there next to the bottom okay likewise every time they are making and there's old man and may have something he's pinpointing don't know why are you all we're using the sanitizer every now and then but it just okay I got your point of use if so your question is why are you they doing this yeah yes they said 60 above 60 years old people are is a quickly cash this stupid virus you know Mahalo I don't know so they said better I stay at home and pray at home so I went to further then after that I feel like going but my children stopping me please don't go please don't go having a problem in my knee also me problem also walking and all that that's all I want to say bye I will answer you Shalom now Abu Youssef is a casualty that has fallen in this war against the covet 19 not hamdullah fallen sick but its collateral damage as they say first of all we have to address the issue of whether this fear is real or not now whether you believe it's real or not this is up to you I have to keep this to myself so if I believe that I shouldn't be shaking hands because all doctors say that remain away from physical contact as much as possible in Saudi Arabia we embrace one another we kiss on the cheek we shake hands so if I decided not to do this this is my right this is something that the doctors encouraged me to do so you have no right blaming me but if you don't believe in that and you start to shake hands with everyone you meet this is up to you I can't blame you first of all so we have to respect one another the issue of bullying people keep on bullying others why do you wear masks why don't you put the lab coat on you look like a doctor why do you put protective gloves you're going to somewhere that is polluted or dirty you're going coming to the Masjid what yeah it is none of your business what I do is my concern who are you to talk to me about these things thirdly you Abu Youssef should rise up you should not go down to their level when they talk to you about this just if you don't have your face mask on just smile and shrug your shoulders and move on don't even reply to them bullies enjoy it when they take you out of your comfort zone when do you make you reply negatively or rudely or just to agitate you this is what fills them up with happiness and content so let them speak their mind who cares if you feel that you need to protect yourself like that this is all up to you but rise up don't go down to their level fourthly or fifthly who's counting the facemask as the medical experts say is worn only when you fear that you might be infected but for healthy people they say that the chances of you catching up and being infested in the mask is greater so if you're okay you're feeling okay just take it off and wash your hands thoroughly for 40 seconds they say every time you go back home try to avoid touching your face and inshallah you'll be protected but to be intimidated to be afraid beyond the normal levels to stop going to the Masjid subhanAllah in times of crisis we have to turn to Allah so again supplicate pray yes if I'm infected if I fear that I might be infected I have to add as an obligation stay home put myself in quarantine not to endanger other Muslims but if I'm healthy and there's nothing wrong in me then yes you go to the Masjid you enjoy praying behind the Imam and ask allah azza wajal to protect you and don't give in to people's criticism as for what you fifty or sixty years of age last week one of those infected by the covered 19 in Johan Province in China he recovered and how old was he he was a hundred years old so it is in Allah's hands way demerit - for who - if I fall sick it is him who cures me don't hype it and exaggerate but do not at the same time underestimate do your due diligence try to wash your hands try to stay away from physical contact but live normally don't think that whatever you touch is gonna contaminate you or endanger you this is too much and Allah so Allah knows best"
