  "transcript": "perfect with no fluffy or other laws of Allah a way of life of life a way of life a way of life Islam is a way of alhamdulillah me no salatu salam wa ala nabina muhammad wa ala aalihi wa sahbihi ajma'in all praise is due to Allah you asked a lot to exalt dimension in grant peace and send His blessings upon the prophet muhammad sallallahu alayhi wasallam brothers and sisters in Islam world will come to a new episode on the topic of marriage I'll give you one example brother yeah yeah one brother we went to propose for an okay and Vanunu came out said huh tell me tell me what happened but they refused I mean as a matter of fact that the mother said if it is you fine no I came to proposed anyway so but we said anyway you should brace the FOB said you know what today I was praying us too horrible to him I was always saying oh Allah please let it happen see he's not believing the matter - to allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala they say father that i leaked the matter to Allah subhana WA Ta'ala just to answer just so that there will be no misconception among the viewers a person says I've prayed istikhara it could be that they had already preconditioned themselves that they wanted up their minds or it could be that they truly didn't know so they say and it wound up in divorce or failure we say well that is your test in life meaning the fact it does there's no guarantee of success what is guaranteed is that Allah Azza WA JAL will grant you what it's better for you what is better for you could be in a trial just like the prophets what was best for them is that they went through all kinds of trials until they achieved what Allah allowed them to achieve so you know we don't want the viewers to think that once there's a conflict between the spouses or divorce comes around say all this the heart must have failed me in the beginning if they had truly relied upon Allah because in theirs situation that is the best thing that could have happened to them even though there were some elements and they could be sins that happened afterwards that they made the marriage break apart it doesn't have to be you know something from the beginning so providing the the Shahada is done properly probably yes yes yes it's important I can elaborate usually people called me in say shape I pray this Tahara and I married my wife and 20 years later we divorced this means my Sahara was not correct I said hey it's like making esta Hara buying a new car and you don't maintain your car you don't take it to the mechanic and three years later it breaks related to the good analogy buying the car is ready to stay Hara what happens afterwards it's your own shortcomings so you have to again make another Sahara for something else and keep it's not a package deal I may cast a Hara for my education my job and then it's completely a flourish with roses this is not related to a Sahara parts of the things that a delay marriages for the girls is similar to the boys education career lenient and this is extra because a woman from the Sayyed tribe from the lineage of the prophetess and her parents would insist that she only managed someone like her and this caused a lot of the girls that to get married also one of the things that yeah I believe that our mutual but in this the side of the girl is more is the specification so he has to be my knight in shining armor coming on a white horse it has to be so this and that she gives a lot of specific ages long about the job about the car and after even if he's qualified she says I demand a flat I demand a mate I demand a driver I demand this and this and this she makes it horrible she makes it impossible to fulfill which leads to being late in getting married and girls don't know this and mentioned this before every day counts so if you are saying that I have to finish my education you'll be 2223 the chances of you getting married is far less than half already yeah and then career and then I've seen people I've seen women I know that have been rejecting proposals until they've reached a certain age and they said okay we'll accept any age and those who are proposing if she's 28 she'll get a proposal from someone who's 40 yes she's knows too old when she is 35 the people proposing will be 50 or 55 which is okay I'll accept but the problem is that this guy is already married once or twice you know I'm not gonna be a co wife which is 50 she says listen give me anything I'll accept but it's too late no one is gonna look for you so the age becomes a deterrent becomes something that prevents a woman from getting married and that is why whenever someone who's suitable comes gee miss must take it up because of the time I have one or two reasons that I feel that are extremely important if you allow me yep the first one is well let me begin with it maybe it will suffice is a crush on someone a lot of the girl have an illusion or a crush on someone so you propose she said no I don't want to okay someone else and they're all good why because she had someone in the back of her mind she had she had never met she had never ever spoken to but she is wishing that this guy comes one of the sisters said an imam came for taraweeh in england and he led the prayer and I loved his voice and I wanted and I praying since a year now but he makes him my husband so I said oh my daughter have you ever seen him you know his character just no no but his voice is beautiful I say MJ's voices is maybe more beautiful is it a criteria in determining who to marry or not to marry the voice is not a criteria so the crush is extremely one of the means of deterring or stopping a woman from marry can we call it a crash instead of a crush it seems like Spears it's a crushing your life surely it is and the final thing which I would like to mention then you guys make amend is unfortunate a lot of the sisters may have indulged in forbidden relationship and they've repented and they felt deep remorse and now they are practicing sisters with nabob they made a mistake Satan is there he's never absent so now whenever someone who's righteous and practicing proposes she rejects it why I don't want to deceive him I don't want to cheat him all right some others say can I say that I had relationship and I fornicated if so that I would not be cheating and it is completely not permissible to expose the things that Elijah has concealed Allah has ohshit conceal your sin and no one knows about it it's not permissible for me to go chef Dahlia you know I did this and this in the past because there was happiness with your permission regarding this point it is authentic narration at the time of signal Monica Bob a man came and he said my daughter committed zina and Cinerama asked how is he now he said he told him his pious practicing all this but someone is proposing should I inform him said no Rama told him if you inform him I would beat you up so numb someone might argue he's going to find out that he's not a vergence there is no hymen okay so here at the time of the Sahaba that the absence of the hymen is not I can explicit evidence that he committed zina because the hymen could be ruptured due to many things imagine men even now horseback riding bicycle exactly exactly so that's why they are Lama they discussed the issue of restoring the high okay for a such accident is this permissible they said yes it is permissible yes it is permissible if this has happened because of some cultures this would ruin the life of the girl throughout her life and you don't inform the person you don't inform the person but for a woman who is immortal leading a moral life it's different some scholars as well this is in in the Mohammed Meah and many of the conference's this issue was addressed so what I'm trying to emphasize here what Sydnor almost saying he said if you tell him I will beat you up so that means you don't aim for and you don't disclose your or air your dirty linen so basically because this seat the seat is not permissible but I guess here the Sharia is looking at the harm and it's not deception here yeah I'm saying it would have been but because of the greater harm perhaps of the exposure so that you commit the lesser of the two evils and the covering the owners of the is more important if for the believers and some scholars say that this issue of hymen is not permissible because it opens the door so even they give an example if a woman was raped though this is not her doing restoring the hymen is might be permissible for her but this would open the door for the vast majority of those who were not affected by force majeure as they call it so some scholars prevent this because this would be out of the fear that this might open the door for anyone to you know I understand I think I think you know one of the things we always have to emphasize people may be watching this and in this discussion we've put forth a couple of different opinions but I think the important thing is that if anyone has a situation themselves personally they should get a personal fatwa they shouldn't just act on what they've heard from us saying here they need to discuss personally their own situation with a check and this is the best thing to do rather than saying I heard check awesome say I heard chef Salim saying and better ask personally about your own show so the some of the reasons that may prevent a girl from marrying at an early age and I believe that it is our advice to all of our viewers inshallah if you have a son if you have a daughter try to get them married as soon as possible providing that they are fit if your son is 20 21 years of age but he's impulsive that is irresponsible he does not respect the elders definitely I would not encourage you to get him married because you were yeah you would have transgression of over that young girl until he is proving himself then you can get him married likewise with the girl same thing for the ladies if their reach that age education that can wait that can be done simultaneously but don't prevent the daughters from getting married as well perhaps the shuttle oh we can hear some more of them after the break we'll be back shortly said I'm Radhika but I care to welcome back yes it is authentic narration at the time of signal Monica Bob a man came and he said my daughter committed zina and Cinerama asked how she now he told him his fires practicing all this but someone is proposing should I inform him said no amar told him if you inform him I would beat you up so numb someone might argue he's going to find out that he's not a virgin there is no hymen okay so here at the time of the Sahaba that the absence of the hymen is not I can explicit evidence that you committed zina because the hymen could be ruptured due to many thoughts back to basic exactly exactly so that's why they are Lama they discussed the issue of restoring the hymen okay for a such accident is this permissible they said yes it is permissible yes it is permissible if this has happened because of some cultures this will ruin the life of the girl throughout her life and you don't inform the person you don't inform person but for a woman who's immortal leading in moral life it's different some scholars as well this isn't in the Mohammed Meah and many of the conferences this issue was addressed so what I'm trying to emphasize here what Sid neuromas saying he said if you tell him I will beat you up so that means you don't inform and you don't disclose your or air your dirty linen so basically because deceit deceit is not permissible but I guess here the Sharia is looking at the harm and it's not deception here yeah I'm saying it would have been but because of the greater harm perhaps of the exposure so the you commit the lesser of the two evils and the covering the honours of them is more important if for the believers and as some scholars say that this issue of Heineman is not permissible because it opens the door so even they give an example if a woman was raped though this is not her doing restoring the Hyneman is might be permissible for her but this would open the door for the vast majority of those who were not affected by force majeure as they call it so some scholars prevent this because this would be out of the fear that this might open the door for anyone to you know I understand I think I think you know one of the things we always have to emphasize people may be watching this and in this discussion we've put forth a couple of different opinions but I think the important thing is that if anyone has a situation themselves personally they should get a personal futur they shouldn't just act on what they've heard from us saying here they need to discuss personally their own situation with a check and this is the best thing to do rather than saying I heard check awesome say I heard silent saying and better ask personally about your own shows so these are some of the reasons that may prevent a girl from marrying at an early age and I believe that it is our advice to all of our viewers inshallah if you have a son if you have a daughter try to get them married as soon as possible providing that they are fit if your son is 20 21 years of age but he's impulsive he's irresponsible he does not respect the elders definitely I would not encourage you to get him married because you were yeah you will have transgression of over that young girl until he is proving himself then you can get him married like what's with the girl same thing for the ladies if there reached that age education that can wait that can be done simultaneously but don't prevent the daughters from getting married as well chef another issue I thought might be worth discussing and this is more prevalent probably in the West maybe in India as well I don't know you have okay you described an impulsive immature boy disrespecting his elders you could find a lot of young Muslim boys like this in the West but they're making Zena the girl they're making zina with she's also the same like him what is better they keep making xeno they should get married well this is a good question but it depends on the two boy and the girl if a boy with this qualities comes to righteous practicing the two who are making Zeenat okay now or boyfriend's girlfriend relationship this happens a lot and they Jam for couple of years and then they decide to get married well the marriage contract itself cannot be except with condition and among the conditions is first they have to repent and secondly she has to have a monthly period to ensure that there is nothing conceived in her womb after these two conditions are fulfilled then she should follow the normal procedure which is proposing to her guardian nowadays people are not honoring this marriage contract so they meet in university and she says to him I'm your wife at the sight of Allah and he says you're my wife at the side of Allah Allah that and the angels are our witnesses yeah they don't even care about which is the Allies enough they say this is not marriage this is nothing clears you know fornication it's a major sin because they have not as chef Salim said come through the door they came through the window so for anyone who is indulge in such a relationship what to do you have to first of all repent to Allah and most of them would say yeah hey what next no no let's go to point 1 did you repent no because you were asking what's next because you don't want to so we leave them to keep on making zina because that's what that will happen this is the reality show we're talking about the reality no reality we should tell them ok guys we'll help you but you should start happy life so both of you repent ok I start to clearly like you but what's the problem - a problem is problem is this I will tell you exactly they will say ok I just want to try and make this halal you don't want to help me I'll just stay the way I am we are making it Holland what I'm telling you the reality discussing yes I'm telling you the reality I know this from my own life and people and dealing exactly where I say to them chef you need to make a toll but you need to make a one a month you know they were saying ok forget it and they will keep on doing this no no I am talking to to you guys ok down there ok use your gray matter okay use your comments this is that they wouldn't be me okay use use your common sense you you love the girl fine we have no problem we'll get you married so what's the problem that you repent and say oh Allah forgive me and he says Allah forgive me what's the problem I don't see any problem there's no problem you're being too lazy I mean if they if they came sorry for interrupting but hey I understand what you're saying it's like people they want they want miracles in other words okay well fix our problem yeah we've done everything wrong no we're not willing to repent we don't have time to it for one month we just wanted to resolve our problem Islamic Lee there's not much you can do for these people I mean they there's some must be some sacrifice and it's not like they're being asked to climb a mountain and roll back down say just repent to Allah as something you do in your heart the conditions can be met while you sitting in that very gathering hamdulillah it's been facilitated repent to align the way I see minimum requirements under hain it's like someone coming to me and saying listen Margaret being three Ricard odd number is a no-go for me I want to pray to hmm and I say you can you have to pray three said then I will not pray respect the hell with you if you don't want to pray this is shadow this is religion you are indulge and fornication a major sin you want to rectify this this is what you have to do if you say no this is not to my liking well sorry but no cigars you have to go and look for another religion because it is not my earnings it is the rulings of I have enough customized Islam for you okay okay what's the anyway that's fine I'm sure but I don't think so there is any any brothers as we received many emails cases like this and when you tell them that you have to do this repentance and this and so first they have to make repentance yeah repentance and then they should to start get married and start about the they have to wait for a might one man says look girl it could come after two days she's on her menses yeah so this is the Islamic way of ensuring that there is no she's not conceiving doing the test does not what if she is conceiving whoa this is and this happens yeah yeah this is something she has to clear she has to contact one of the shoe to give her a specific factor because basically there cannot be marriage contract with a woman who conceived out of wedlock until she delivers a child and becomes pure then she could marry anyone but this forbidden relationship this pregnancy is a barrier and consumption of the marriage basically it shows if anything the consequence of being you know zena's this is the calamity that that will - and you know the children will suffer you will suffer your spouse will suffer your parents will suffer your society will suffer it's a child that's going to be more devastating is devastating well I think that's the time we have for this aspect of marriage and inshallah and the next episode will be dealing with the other aspects dealing with the rights of their husband and the rights of the wife which should be of major interest to our audience we thank you for tuning in and we'll see you in the future inshallah Salam aleikum wa rahmatullah wa barakato we"
