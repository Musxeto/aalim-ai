  "transcript": "Abdul is asking about the ruling on praying behind a TV screen as they pray live in Mecca in the Holy Masjid al-haram so can we pray in congregation the answer is no this is not permissible and if you do pray your prayer is invalid first of all because this is not an actual congregation this is virtual they are in a city and you are in another city their sunset is different to your sunset their mother it is different than your mother not only that even if you were in Mecca itself and you were residing in one of them towers adjacent to the harem and you can see the Kaaba and you can see the worshippers doing Tawaf and you can hear that more than and the Imam leading the prayer you cannot pray in your room though you can see everything below you why because if anybody calls and says where are you you would say I'm in my room you wouldn't say I'm in the Masjid so are you with the congregation you cannot say I am with the congregation because you're not so their prayer in their rooms is not permissible let alone to pray behind the TV screen and la knows best"
