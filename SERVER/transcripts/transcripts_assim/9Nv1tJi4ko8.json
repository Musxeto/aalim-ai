  "title": "How a person become Kafir",
  "transcript": "I as second question says does a person become a kafir if he sits in a place where qu4 is being spoken about and does not leave but hates it in his heart now the issue of kufur which is this belief he is a very important thing to know because you cannot be properly a proper Muslim without avoiding the things the things that nullify your Islam however some of us are obsessed and this obsession leads them to classifying people he did this that he's a cover I did this then probably I am a kafir I have these thoughts in my mind am i a kafir and it's taking their energy it's taking their Eman it's draining them from the fear of allah azzawajal into just materialistic things and engaging them only in labeling people and this is a serious issue as for iies question if you are in a place and someone is ridiculing the prophet alayhi salaatu Sarah or making fun of Allah verses or making fun of Islam or criticizing something from our religion now you have an option either to stand up and say this is Haram and you have to point out why it's Haram and telling them that this is covered or you may simply leave if you're unable to clarify your point and tell them about it this was mentioned in the Quran where Allah Azza WA JAL says vinasyati complicated and either similar to my attila hue follow me how are you stars that would be half Allah top aluminum Hatter yahoo luffy hadith in raya in nakum in am Islam so Allah is telling us that Allah has enjoined upon you has revealed to that if you were in a place and you found that the verses of Allah are being rejected and ridiculed so do not sit with them until they engage in different topic otherwise you would be like them allah azza wajal would gather the hypocrites and the disbelievers together in hell on the day of judgment so it is a knack of ko4 if you do not retaliate or at least point out that this is Haram similarly to the march that took place in Paris those who participated in it if they knew that what they were doing is Haram and they knew that this thing is something that nullifies this lamp and yet still they participated and they marched with it and when someone asks them is it okay to make drawings depicting the Prophet Elias or Simon ridiculing Islam and he says this is freedom of right they have the right to do this this is blasphemy this is something that nullifies the person's Islam but the conditions have to be fulfilled upon each and every individual we don't give a blatant or a blanket takfeer for all no each one has to be specifically fulfilling the conditions and we have to make sure that he does not have any obstacles before giving that ruling"
