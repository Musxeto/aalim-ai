  "transcript": "doctor from Hamburg from England had two questions Zala hip and in its logical how is it possible to know whether this drink intoxicates or not see al-hilal ooh billion well haram Oh billion Helen is obvious Haram is obvious between them are dubious matters the one who gave us the criteria of knowing whether it intoxicates or not whether it is halal or Haram is a prophet himself as it is he who said man asked Allah kathira faculae lujan so by experience if anyone would have drunk a particular drink and got wasted after three or four glasses of it we know that this is Haram and we have to stop nowadays as he kindly only stated now we can tell the percentage of alcohol in a drink and if doctors or let us say even traffic policeman tells us that if we find in your bloodstream this percentage of alcohol this means that you're wasted and you're not fit to drive so if the doctors say point naught it's not in points if they say like 2% or 3% is safe it would not intoxicate you but if it is more than it would in this case this is something that you can follow because other than that we don't have any an experience of it this is a drink and I'm going to drink it does it mean that in order for me to know whether it's Haram or halal I have to take like seven or eight mugs and if I can walk a straight line then it's hell are know if there are other means that can tell me if it's intoxicating or not then I have to work it out other than that the presence of alcohol is not a determining factor because sometimes we may bake a cake or bread some juices may contain a small fraction of alcohol in it and this does not make it Haram so I hope this answers your question"
