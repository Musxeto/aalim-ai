  "transcript": "Nabeeda from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Ibn Uthaymeen, today when I'm doing Maghreb, I was almost standing as you are sitting for the second rakaat. Then I remembered that I have to sit down, so I sat down instead of standing fully. And finished the prayer like this without giving the frustration of forgetfulness. Is my prayer valid? Why did you not prostrate for Sahu? Just like this, I didn't know. I can't understand your question to begin with Nabeeda, to tell you the truth. I only am answering you hoping that you would clarify. Did you or did you not make a mistake? I don't know. I just did. Nabeeda, if you don't know, how would I know? See, if you thought that you did not offer the right number of rakaat, and you rectified it, then you have no problem. You have to offer Sujood Sahu. If you thought that, no, I am doing the right thing. And this Ruswas is coming to me every single prayer, so I am ignoring it. And I'm continuing my prayer as usual. And you did not offer prostrations of forgetfulness. You've done the right thing because it's reoccurring and shaitan wants to mess up your prayer. But if you were doubtful, and this comes to you once every week, once every month, once every year. You were doubtful whether I prayed two or three, and you were inclined that, no, I prayed two. Or you were inclined that I prayed three. And you continued according to your gut feeling and the best of your knowledge. In this case, you have to offer Sujood Sahu as well at the end of the prayer after Salaam. If you did not offer Sujood Sahu due to forgetfulness, I forgot. I did Salaam and I went and I remembered half an hour. Your prayer is valid. If you knew that you have to offer it, but still did not want to perform it, then your prayer is invalid and you have to repeat it."
