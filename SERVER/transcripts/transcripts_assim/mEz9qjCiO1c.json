  "transcript": "afrina says is this permissible to join in a combined group of male and female in on facebook whatsapp or any other social media or the girls should be only in girls group well to be in a group that involves participation from your side it's a step towards free mixing so it is not permissible not recommended at all if you're joining a group like a mailing group where you receive beneficial things without your participation without chit-chatting either private or publicly there's nothing wrong with that but to be in a group on facebook and you put your likes to what a man says and he knows that okay afrina is the one who gave me thumbs up and maybe directly directly messaging you about hadith or about a sunnah or something like that this is not permissible and safest for you to be alone in a an old girls group"
