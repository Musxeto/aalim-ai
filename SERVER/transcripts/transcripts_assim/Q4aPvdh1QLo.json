  "title": "Hunting with a Dog, do I avoid eating the part the dog bit",
  "transcript": "Muhammad from the US. There's an authentic narration attributed to the Prophet Muhammad alayhi salatu wassalam in regards to hunting in which he said and I quote, when you set off your trained dogs recite the name of God while sending them off then eat that game end quote. Now I know the saliva of dogs are impure so my question to you is what would I do with the part or area of the animal that the hunting dog bit? Would I avoid eating that part of the animal? JazakAllah khair. No, you can eat that part as it was not mentioned in the hadith or by the doings of the companions that we should purify it or cut it off or wash it off which means that as long as the shariah did not elaborate or address this issue it is forgiven and neglected and you move on with the grace of Allah azza wa jal."
