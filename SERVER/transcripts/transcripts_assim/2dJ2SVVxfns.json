  "title": "He keeps repeating his wudu & wasting water (Pleasing Satan & angering Allah) #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "yes sir um there's a brother over here I know it sounds strange but I'd like to know how to advise him essentially in ablution uh if he spits the water out of his mouth like a number of times or he puts the water in his nose like slowly so he can make sure it's in each nostril or if he does this or that in his application he thinks it's innovating so he keeps repeating his abusion how do I advise him by saying to him that every time you repeat it Allah is angry with you but Satan is pleased with you what you're doing is definitely against the Sunnah of the prophet assalam and the way of the Companions and you do not by any chance claim that you know more than them so definitely you're following the footsteps of shaytan who is very pleased with you because you're an advocate of his and a very good student of his the bad news is Allah is angry with you every time you waste money and waste water and obey Satan in whatever he tells you and Allah Knows Best"
