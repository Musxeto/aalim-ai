  "transcript": "says when can a father disown his son or his daughter this is too generic usually it has to be something that is worth disowning so if a father says i disown my son why because he married a woman i told him not to marry well who's getting married him or you it's him so this doesn't make any sense what's wrong with the woman is she a a a a prostitute is she an atheist no no no but she comes from a different sect from a different tribe well with all due respect you come from the cave ages from the stone ages nobody thinks like this anymore if she's a righteous practicing woman and he loves her and he cares for her and she loves him and cares for him they're happy disowning him is sinful on you not in him he's not obliged to listen to you who to marry and who not to marry because he's the one who's getting married not you he said i disowned him because he doesn't pray anymore okay that's good if he doesn't pray then he is on the verge of not being a muslim i disowned him because he disrespected me well nowadays we have to look into the pros and cons disrespect by saying one single thing a mistake that took once in a lifetime and not something repeated or continuous insults and humiliation and disrespect there's a difference so we have to weigh things and we have to look into things um he married a hindu woman okay marrying a hindu woman is zina and the man is invalid and his children are born out of wedlock yeah you can disown such a person so this is too generic it's it isn't a manual where i can say okay check check check oh no this is not right you have to be specific in the situations so that we can answer you"
