  "transcript": "Nashem from the Philippines? \nand my question Sheikh   may I still have valid if if i pray my prayers \nin our house especially the fajr prayer because   they Athaan done in the masjid cannot reach \nin our house and to reach there in the masjid   it takes usually seven minutes to eight minutes. \n[Sheikh] only seven minutes to reach the masjid? okay and the Athaan couldn't reach in our house. \n[Sheikh] okay I will answer inshallah   Nasham from the Philippines, he says he \nprays fajr in home because the masjid is   seven minutes far away from his house this is \nnot permissible. For a man a seven-minute far uh   distance from the masjid is obligatory \nfor you to pray there, I'm talking about   walking distance huh so if it's seven minutes \nwalking distance you must pray in the masjid."
