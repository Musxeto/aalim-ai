  "transcript": "rabat is when two armies are anticipating a fight they're anticipating to engage so those at the frontline they're not engaging but they are waiting for the right moment to someone for someone to attack them or they would attack them these people in a village or a town besieged by an army those who guarded are called more ability they are in rabat those who are attacking it but not yet engaged are also in rabat and allah azzawajal has told us that what a single night in rabat in anticipation and guarding the army in anticipating to engage with the enemy is better than so and so years of fasting and and and and reward at the side of a large soldier now the Prophet is giving us an example sallallahu alehiwassallaam with waiting for the following prayer so if you make wudu and you walk to the Masjid and you pray motherly prayer and you wait so that Risha would be called for the time is due the prayer would be called for and you join them this period of waiting of an hour or so is Rabat because it is like anticipating engaging the enemy army and likewise you're anticipating the honor of standing at the side of Allah and Allah Sojin knows best"
