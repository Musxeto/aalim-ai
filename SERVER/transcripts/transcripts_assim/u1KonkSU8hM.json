  "transcript": "So uh when using social media users with names like that include Allah's names like Abdullah or Abd Rahman may simultaneously appear on the screen with things like non-Hijabi woman and etc. So my question is is if someone knows this and he's still using and scrolling on these apps is this an act of kufur?
