  "transcript": "Arthur says Saturday was the seventh day so Arthur had a girl and on the seventh day of her birth they slaughtered the keeper good but the problem is that she has a sort of an illness that makes the skin yellow and she's John deities I think they call it whatever and she's hospitalized so he's asking that is shaving the head of permissible after she's released from the hospital it's an issue of dispute a lot of the scholars say that shaving the head of the girl is not recommended or permitted and some said no because the justification given by the Prophet as Salaam applies for both boys and girls the Prophet said al-islam lauder his appeal on the seventh day and removed the filth from his scalp from his head and the filth these moistures and discharges when the child comes out is in both boys and girls so removing the firth that the filth benefits them both so I recommend that you do shave the head of the baby girl for a better growth and for better health in sha Allah if you don't want to then again a great number of scholars said that this is not needed and allah azza wajal knows best"
