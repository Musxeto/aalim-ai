  "title": "He had a procedure for prostate and involuntarily passes urine and wears diapers, prayers valid?",
  "transcript": "If we say no, then we have to kill him. Ya Akhi, Allah is Most Forgiving, Most Merciful. Allah tested him with this calamity and the urine is coming involuntary. What should we say? Chop it off. Come on, what would you want me to do? Ya Akhi, I'm dripping, I'm wearing diapers. No, there is nothing, there is no hardship in Islam. Ya Akhi, beautiful religion. So many people come to me and this is my speciality, OCD people. So they come to me and our urine Sheikh, they call me. Everybody's coming with problems with urine. Sheikh, I have a problem. What do you see me? Toilet? They all come to me with this problem. But it's funny, but it's sad. This is what the Sheikh mentioned, the two gates of Shaytan. Doubts and desires. If you pay attention, who said this? Which Sheikh? No, no, he quoted it from Ibn Al-Qayyim. Of course, you all know, but you're respecting the age. Ibn Al-Qayyim, the Sheikh said, Ibn Al-Qayyim said there are two windows for the soul that he corrupts your soul with. Doubts. This is how Shaytan corrupts your head with these shubuhat. So you keep on not knowing what you do. And I always tell people, the easiest thing to ward off doubts, is Islam a religion of ease and simplicity or a religion of hardship and difficulty? Ease and simplicity, which is number A. What you're practicing in your life, is it A or B? Everybody says B. Then you're not practicing Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Atheism, anything, but not Islam. Our religion is easy and simple, full stop. So don't make life difficult. Whatever a test Allah is testing you with, Allah makes it easy. And this is one of the legal maxims. Whenever it's so narrow and difficult, Allah makes it wide and easy. So someone who has urine incontinence and wears a diaper, what to do? No problem. The moment the adhan is called, this is the time for you to pray. So whenever you want to pray, go to the toilet, change your diaper, watch yourself, put your diaper, clean diaper on and make wudu. Shaykh, but the moment I put the clean diaper on, I'm dripping. No problem. Make wudu. I'm still dripping. No problem. Go to the masjid. I'm still dripping. No problems. Pray. You have the time until the time is expired. Even if you drip, even if you have urine, this is the ease of Islam. So don't make life difficult. Islam is an evolving religion. It adapts for all circumstances because Allah is the most forgiving, most merciful, and He makes life easy for you and me. It's left."
