  "transcript": "eustress says there is one hadith that says that lucky is the woman whose first child is a daughter if first child is a son does it mean that a woman is not lucky first of all this hadith is fabricated it is mold or not only that it is not authentic it is fabricated it's it has no roots in authentic books of hadith somebody came and made it up so you cannot say that a person's first born child determines whether he is lucky or not this is something from Allah Azza WA JAL Allah gives whom he wishes females and gives whom he wishes males or mixed them males and females and he makes whomever he wishes barren no children so to claim that this person is lucky or unlucky according to the first born this is baseless in Islam"
