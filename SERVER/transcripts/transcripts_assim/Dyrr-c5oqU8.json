  "transcript": "Ammar Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Alhamdulillahi Wassalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Welcome Ammar Baye What can I do to you? Sheikh I have a question Some of my friends like when we talk They narrate Hadith or they share Hadith with me If I hear something really new I go home and try to check it What they said is correct or not To check if it's authentic If it's not, next day I inform them That what you said is not correct And this and this But sometimes I'm not able to find out What they said is correct Or I'm not able to find any evidence Of what the Hadith they're saying is correct or not What should I do in this case? Should I just follow what they said? Or should I refrain from following their advice about the Hadith? Jazak Allah Khair Akhi, this is normal We all do this I do this all the time I hear something new I learn it I go back home I check If it's authentic I apply it If I could not find it I trash it Because if it doesn't exist And I cannot authenticate it or verify it Then I do not put it in my database I do not digest it Because I only take in what is authentic From the Hadith of the Prophet Anything that's not authentic Or I cannot verify I refrain from accepting it Until it's been verified So, yes If you hear something and you cannot find it Ignore it and don't implement it"
