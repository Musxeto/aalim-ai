  "title": "Raffle Draw Coupons that are given by Malls & Supermarkets etc - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "safe says in many shopping malls there will be a contest like raffle draws there is if we as customers purchase anything for 200 reals or more we get a cone in which we get inside the raffle contest and winners will be getting cash or a car as a prize so is it allowed this is an issue of dispute my own opinion is if you go to that mall to buy a specific thing without having this competition or the raffle in your mind so my intention is actually to buy this perfume to buy this body lotion to buy this pair of trousers which is more convenient to me closer to my home and the prices are fine and I do not go there to be part and to participate in the lucky draw in this case whatever cones they give me it's a gift and there's no problem none whatsoever in participating and putting it in the box and if you win a car then this is Hallett but if you go out of your home and you go to that mall to buy in order to participate this becomes gambling a sort of buying a lottery ticket even if you want to buy krauser's but instead of going to the shop next to you or the mall next to you you go to the further one just to be part of that draw this is not permissible"
