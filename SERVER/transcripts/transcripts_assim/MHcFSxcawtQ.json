  "title": "Islam & The Renaissance? Do we separate Islam from science? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "when we look at the title of the lecture to reflect upon the quran the quran and the impact of that upon the renaissance of the ummah we have to understand what is the meaning because sometimes the words can be misguiding so when we say that the renaissance this was a movement in the middle ages so to them the christians in europe it is related to the rebellion against the church and renaissance is to go out of the norm and to separate science from church we don't have this in islam islam embraces science and islam goes side by side with science so sometimes a person may fear that such association between the word renaissance and islam can be misleading and to some they would understand that in order to do this we have to separate signs from islam when this is not true you"
