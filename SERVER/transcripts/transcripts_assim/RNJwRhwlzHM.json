  "transcript": "so yeah I have a question regarding I pick up uh and let's do others so I I just want to know that um can we sit at the curve like we have to sit on in odd days in Masjid or we have to um I said I take out for 10 uh straight days okay first of all the calf is a highly recommended Sunnah and the prophet saw Allah in the beginning the first 10 nights of Ramadan then he made it in the middle ten nights of Ramadan then he continued to make it in the last 10 nights of Ramadan the full 10 nights so this is the Sunnah secondly no one knows when leilator is so it can be in odd numbers nights and it can be an even number nights because this is dependent on the month of Ramadan is it 29 or 30. so when it's 29 the odd numbers differ than when it's 30 because we detect the odd numbers by uh um taking out the last 10 nights of the month so when it's 29 the last 10 nights is different when then it's 30. so the odd and even numbers are not known until the month is over then we can tell therefore it is wrong for people just to go every night of the 21st third fifth seventh and 9th thinking that definitely is one of them no it's not it can be of the 20th 22nd 4th 6th and eighth and 30th depending on the month is 29 or 30 days and Allah Knows Best"
