  "title": "Should I get married despite having mental health problems that I go to thearpy for?",
  "transcript": "Ahmed from Kuwait Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh I am 25 years old and I am nearing the age of marriage and I would very much like to fulfill that part of my deen however I do struggle with my mental health and mood instabilities and various other challenges. I have been into therapy for the past two years and I have a few diagnoses however it's not to say that I can't get married, I can but I am worried that it will affect my married life or my partner on the larger scale. So I don't really know how to approach this and I would really appreciate you. Ahmed, have you had your therapy with a Muslim therapist who's practicing Islam or with a normal therapist or a psychiatrist who just listens to you and takes notes and says, yes ok tell me about your childhood our time is up. Then second session, tell me about your abuse at school is this the type of therapy? When I was looking for my therapist I made it a point that it should be a Muslim one because the spiritual aspect is very important to me so it was indeed a Muslim therapist from the UK and they really did emphasize on working on my religion and practicing spirituality and staying close to my religion as in Islam which would have a direct impact on my mental health as well. Then what happened? It has helped me to a certain extent yet I'm still not confident in how it would affect my life after marriage. I would highly advise you to get one session only with me if you can afford it and inshallah I'll do my level best to eradicate any doubts that you have with the grace of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala because this is what we do. We talk to people we see their weak points we give them positivity with the grace of Allah azzawajal and teach them and show them how to hold and abide by positivity and trusting Allah and everything goes well inshallah azzawajal"
