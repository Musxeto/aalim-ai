  "title": "Hair that is Prohibited, Mandatory, and Permissible to Remove  | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "his first question was about the hair that we remove so in a nutshell I didn't understand his question a man in his body there are three types of hair one hair that is prohibited haram to be removed and that is the hair of the beard and the hair of the eyebrows a man is totally prohibited to remove this hair secondly hair that is mandatory that is wajib to remove and that is the armpit hair and the pubic area hair the prophet aerosol sallam told us that this is from fitrah from human nature as in the hadith of mother aisha ten characteristics of human nature of Petra and Ana similarly allahu anhu told us that the Prophet timed forty days as machs to remove to remove such hair so these are two types the third type is permissible and this refers to the rest of the hair that grows on your body so if a man wants to remove the chest hair or the arms hair or the legs here a bit awkward yes but it's hella there's no problem in doing this insha Allah"
