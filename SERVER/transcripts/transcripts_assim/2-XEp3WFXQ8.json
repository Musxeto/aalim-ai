  "transcript": "first off I want to say there's a zoom bombers in the in the meeting Zoom bombers I don't I don't know about this and I have I'm a dinosaur I don't know about these things so it's the admin who is supposed to know how to mute everyone else and not to allow people to bomb us from bombs and terrorists yes yeah my question is in Sun prayers that have two like the four before do we recite the opening supplication and the only at the beginning or once in the first ra and once again in the third after saying first of all it's an issue of dispute whether Sunnah before of four ra to be treated as a single prayer like or a separate prayer two by two Abu hanif's m is to deal with it as four like andani authenticated some of the hadiths that they are four the vast majority of Scholars say that voluntary prayers should be two concluded by Salam then another two concluded by Salam and so on depending on theith and another addition which some Scholars made that weak however when you pray for Sunnah together as a one single prayer a lot of the scholars would say you're blames worthy this is not according to the Sunnah but if you break it into two by two even the hanafis would say okay it's not the best thing to do but yeah it's it's your your prayer is accepted hence this is what I recommend you to do secondly if you insist and say no I'd like to follow the Hadith according to Al's authentication and to abu's and I pray it as a single prayer in this case the and can only be said in the first and the first second third and fourth R you don't say that and Allah Knows Best"
