  "transcript": "from India as my knowled I know it's an authentic now Prophet Sall wasallam that raising the hands in Salah and in here in India why when I ask the like older people they say at the time of prophet Salli wasallam the and the people of that time used to carry the photos in their underarms and so that's the reason Prophet wasam has ordered to raise the hands is this a true no this is only said by ignorant imbeciles regardless of their age in your country this is excuse my French stupid now imagine the companions carrying Idols under their armpit and the prophet orders them to say Allah abbar so it would fall down okay I understand this and then they're going to pick it up after every ra and do this and the prophet would order them to raise their hands give me a break this is totally bogus illogical even fools don't say this imagine let us assume it's true okay then the prophet told them okay stop now you're Muslims there's no read because you don't carry any idols under your armpit so why do we when we come in prayer in the beginning till date say Allah abbar according to their logic we shouldn't do this because we don't have any Idols this is totally ridiculous and this is the uh um the result of being a blind follower of a particular maab you have the audacity you have the shame to discredit and to reject the Hadith authentic Hadith in bukari where the Prophet used to raise his hands and say no no no no this is because of Idols how what what kind of Islam do these people have I don't know to honor their school of thought and their Imam they're willing to discredit disregard ignore fabricate the authentic Hadith of the Prophet Alam they're not following the Sunnah un fortunately"
