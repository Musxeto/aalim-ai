  "transcript": "uh charos from sri lanka says can you tell us about atel this is a long topic if you go to my youtube channel you will find where i spoke about this in the beginning of the series of taheed which i did not complete and then hopefully inshallah someday i'm going to get the motivation to just sit and do it i wouldn't take a lot but i need a push may allah make you guys make dua for me inshallah i'll be able to do that so the hidden fact is based on not naming allah or describing allah with other than what he himself described himself with or his messengers end of story the beautiful names and attributes only come from allah and the prophet now to have fulto heat you must avoid a wheel and a tattle and the temple and the tequila and to go through this it's going to take a long time but in a nutshell wheel is like what the asha'ira are doing so they say is risen over the arch so they said no no he has overtaken it he has conquered it so they change the meaning into something uh else allah's hand they say that this is uh well actually the first example of the throne this is dealing with a tariff to divert the meaning is to say that allah's hand means power this is allah's power allah's love meaning allah's intention so they misinterpret the word itself take means how so when you say allah has risen over the throne how has he risen and this was opposed to imam malik and imam malik started swearing and said that ali's how to rise on the throne is known the how is unknown and this question is an innovation by itself and a temple is to give a simulation or to give something that is similar to so when i say allah's hand i say allah's hands what are you doing yeah this is allah's hands it's like like our hands no this is totally prohibited there's nothing like unto him subhanallah and he's all hearing all seeing so we believe in what allah has described himself without misinterpreting it allah has a hand without distorting the meaning the hand is something else without saying how the hand looks like or how it is because we know how the hand is but allah's hand is unlike anything we know of yet we understand what a hand means and fourthly we do not give examples to it so i hope this answers your question you"
