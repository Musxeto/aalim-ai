  "transcript": "do your advice share for parents who stop their children from trying to make something Halal and get married at a young age what I'm saying at young age I'm assuming is not 12 year old but we get the high schoolers that are now in mixed schools that are interested in one another and they want to make it Hal and they approach their parents with request first of all let's look at the options on the table option one number one get them married option number two don't get them married option number one getting them married is not rocket science I'm feeding the punk I'm clothing the punk he lives under my roof he uses my car he uses my gas so what's the difference if I add another mouse that would eat with us if they say Bismillah that would be bar and there's no problem in that what's the problem if I can save my son from FNA from doing Haram from fornicating and you know it's easy you don't have to wait for the prong you can do that before so what is it everyone around him is pushing him huh are you still a virgin mother everything around him is tempting him and you know that you want to save him from Hell Fire so what's the problem providing he checks the boxes that he's sensible he's rational he is worthy of taking the responsibility not someone who's impulsive I marry him today he divorces tomorrow no no no this doesn't work like this you have to prove that you're a real man worthy of getting married so this is option one option two if he doesn't get married what would happen you as a father bear the responsibility but he as a individual Muslim adult also Bears the responsibility if he does Haram he'll be thrown into hell it's not a big problem but if he's unable to get married he has to fast he has to do what the prophet told himam L his days and try to abide by the Shar to the best of his ability so my point is I've I know people who are 16 and 17 who are married and they are happily married they're real men I know girls who marry at the age of 15 and 16 and they're very sensible Good Housewives good uh um reasonable mothers to their children that's a win-win win but you have to get out of your comfort zone you have to get out of the stigma we have and inshallah Y things would be better here"
