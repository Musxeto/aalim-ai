  "transcript": "Sheikh, does breaking knuckles invalidate Salat? Now the things that invalidate Salat, one, are the things that invalidate your Wudu. So if you did not break your Wudu, your Salat is intact. Two, the things that invalidate the Salat are the things that would take you out of the description of Salat. So Salat is like this. If someone looks at me, he would say, the Sheikh is praying. But if I am, during praying, I do this, what is the Sheikh doing? Whoa, hey, what are you doing? He says, I'm praying. Hallelujah. What kind of prayer is this? This breaks the Salat. Because whoever looks at me, says that this guy is not praying, he's dancing, he's playing around. If I am facing the Qibla, and all of a sudden I do this, then this breaks my Salat. Because I gave my back to the Qibla. Unlike if I do this, if I do this slight movement, if I look, this doesn't break my Salat, but it reduces it, especially if there is no legitimate reason. So breaking your knuckles or cracking your knuckles, whatever they call them, this is a gesture and a movement that is disrespectful to Allah. It shows disrespect. Usually people do it without paying attention to it, but nevertheless, it is disrespectful to Allah Azza wa Jal So does it break my prayer? The answer is no. Your prayer is still valid and you have reduced your reward drastically, but still it is a valid Salat and Allah knows best."
