  "title": "Can I delay the prayer to its end time? (Disliked to delay Asr) assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Ibrahima from Senegal Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu So, I wanted to ask for example, if I missed the Jamara prayer and I wanted to pray my prayer in segregation, if I could delay it, not delay to the end, but if I could delay it right before it ends and then pray it. Yani, you want to pray at home? Ibrahima? Yes. If you miss the prayer in the congregation, we know that the prayer has a beginning and an end. So, if it's like Dhuhr time, for example, the prayer time ends when the Adhan of Asr is called. So, if the Adhan of Asr is called at 3.30, and you want to delay your Dhuhr, which you already missed with the congregation, and pray it at 2.20, there's no problem in that. There's no time of dislikeness or Karaha. Similarly to Asr, for example. Asr is different, because Asr has a permissible time, and then when the sun goes yellow, which is about 45 minutes before sunset, this is a time of dislikeness. It's permissible, but it's disliked. You shouldn't pray it at this time without a legitimate reason. Other than that, it's fine, Inshallah."
