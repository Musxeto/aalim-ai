  "transcript": "alikum it's just a question regarding uh some people they criticize the scholars of a Sunnah so is it upon us to defend them or not like they make the upon the scholars and things the question is that some of the people attack the scholars of a sunah is it upon us to defend them I believe that it is our duty to defend any Muslim individual and this duty is magnified when this individual is a scholar and we have to filter our feelings towards other Muslims see when we say that we areah does not give us the right to criticize and ridicule other sex Scholars so he is a Sufi he is this he is that and I make fun of him I make fun of how he speaks I make fun of their beliefs ridiculing it and this is not an Islamic way of dealing with those who differ with us in our opinion Allah tells us that the Jews spoke to MSA peace be upon them when he instructed them to slaughter a a cow what did they say are you ridiculing us are you making fun of us what did he say so it is out of ignorance to ridicule people and to look down at people and do to people as you like them to do to you deal with them in respect but if someone talks bad negatively about Muslim Scholars you have to stop them listen Allah will hold us accountable to every single word we hear and if he continues tell him fear Allah remember when they put the cotton in your ears and in your uh eyes and this is when you're dead and they're preparing you for burial remember this so at that point you would not want you would have wished you had not said anything negative about anyone so I I believe that this is what we should do and Allah Knows Best"
