  "transcript": "foreign oh the second month of the fourth year of hijrah the month of safar was a very tragic month for the muslims ten of the finest companions of the prophet alaihis salaam were betrayed by the envoy who pretended to be muslims and requested their presence so that they could teach their people about islam in the middle of the way they found that this was only an ambush for them ten of the companions of the prophet salallahu fought till the death and the eighth soon followed and two were taken as prisoners of war ibn adi may allah be pleased with him was given to the family of al-harif who he himself killed him on the battle of badr so his family wanted to avenge their father he was held captive for a few days until they decided to execute him and just before his execution we were told that a lady of the house where he was kept captive said that i've never seen a prisoner as noble as me allah be pleased with him she said that he requested for a blade so that he could shave the areas that we're told to shave and without her noticing one of her children ran to him and he had the child with him playing and he was sitting next to him with the blade in his hand and she was terrified she thought that he would do the normal thing for any prisoner who was just about to be executed and he saw that petrified look in her face and he told her are you afraid that i might harm him don't be and he set the child back to his mother she said that he was not like any other prisoner he used to she says he used to eat grapes when there was not a single grape in the whole of mecca and this was a blessing from allah azzawajal and when it was time for his execution he requested that he praise two raka's and they gave him that last wish and he prayed two raka's and after he concluded them he said that had i not fear that you would think that i would prolong it because of fearing death i would have and they executed him the other companion i had that how they executed him were barbaric way and they were you know cutting off his skin and his muscles piece by piece is corrected i i do not recall any of this incident but he said something he said poetry that describes that even if they take peace and bits and pieces of my body this would not be enough because this death of mine is in the cause of allah azza so and who knows maybe allah will bless these scattered pieces of flesh and and skin but we were told that he was executed and he was crucified on a pole and then one of the companions and and his name is came and at night time and took him and buried him without them noticing the other companion was said and as we said before he was bought by safwan ibn umayyah and in his execution day just as they were about to behead him abu sufyan bin harp stood up and said ozeid do you wish that muhammad sallallahu alaihi your prophet is now in your shoes in your place about to be executed and that you are among your family and loved ones it's a normal question a man is about to die zaydim nadithna said by allah i swear that i would not love that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam would be hit by a thorn in his hand or in his leg and i am with my family i'd rather die and not even this little pain would come to my prophet salallahu and said i've never seen anyone love anyone like the companions love their prophet salallahu and just before he was executed he supplicated to allah and he they executed him in haram area close to the ka'ba and he said o allah destroy them all and do not abandon any one of them alive and kill them all muawiyah said that the minute he started supplicating my father threw me on my side on the floor and it was the practice of the people of quraish whenever anyone supplicated against you if you lay down on your side on the floor then you would escape this this is what they thought and this would not do any help among them was one of the companions by the name of sayid may allah be pleased with him sayed ben amir was a ruler years later of and the village or the city he was the ruler of complained to umar that this man while sitting and judging among the people faints every now and then he faints so he called him back he came to medina and told him what is the cause of your fainting what's wrong with you why do you faint every now and then he said o caliph of the believers or umar i was among those attending the execution of zeidman defender long ago and whenever i recalled the supplicit the supplication he made i faint he's a muslim he's a companion but just because he was present at that time doesn't the action of abu maha uh in that you know incident when he threw his son on the floor in order for him as he think that it could avoid the supplication of that great companion this action that action does it give us hint that they believed in the prophet i mean his message but they were trying to deny it because he knew that this application would make something well as i said this was a traditional an arab tradition even before islam whoever supplicated they were afraid that it would be answered especially if he was unjustly treated so it has nothing to do with their belief or disbelief of the message of prophet muhammad yet they did believe that he was the messenger of allah but it was arrogance and denial but on that particular occasion they did what they did or abu sufyan did what he did because it was the arab tradition to dodge and escape this supplication so that it would not hit his son on the same month the same tragic month of safar of the fourth year of al-hijrah the prophet salallahu while he was in medina he was approached by one of the tribal leaders of najd of the center of arabia and his name was malik the prophet started salallahu introducing islam to him the man listened he did not accept but at the same time he did not reject so the man invited the prophet allah to send an envoy of his companions to come and tour the villages and tribes of nash and call them to islam again there were suspicion so the prophet told his guest of his fears and he told him that we have lots of bad experience with the tribes of najd and the tribes surrounding medina and amer malik and he was known as he told him that they will come in my custody and under my protection i'm a leader of the tribes there so no one would do any harm to them the prophet allah trusted his word and he had a mission he wanted to call the people to islam so he sent 70 of his finest companions they were known to be and means the reciters of the quran so these 70 were all excellent companions of knowledge level uh to the extent that they've recited the quran and they knew it by heart so they were among the elite we they were described in the books of seerah to work at daytime and feed the people the poor people at night time with what they've made in the morning and they used to pray all night long as in a night prayer to allah the almighty so the prophet alaihis allah sent them and they went and they started touring the villages and the tribes of najt and they were armed but at the same time they had the security of abu al-barra malik he was the leader of his tribe so in a sense they felt safe because they had the permission to tour without being a face with any harm or danger as long as they have this great leader protecting them and his word was sufficient and enough in these tribes i believe we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we will be back so this is an open invitation for everybody to recognize god and enjoy his blessings in this life and his mercy in this life and in the here after as well allah each name has a meaning each name signifies a nature of allah almighty which no one shares or is compared to allah in it and welcome back the 70 companions of the prophet allah were touring the villages and the tribes of calling people to islam they went to a location known as birma una or the well of ma'una and they sent one of their men to introduce islam to him and he was the leader of his tribe amer but he was a wicked man he was a very bad man so they sent to him a man a companion by the name of and he was so close to the prophet sallallahu salaam along with his sister um sulaim and also um haram evil she was also close to the prophet allah and the stories say that they were related to the prophet allah through suckling and they were one of his mahrams harambe went to amir even up to to introduce islam to him as he was the head and the leader of benir tribe and i was as he was introducing islam to him now remember he's a messenger and messengers are not to be killed by all means and it's a global thing it's a tradition you never kill the messenger so haram was introducing the message of islam to ahmer this wicked leader and without him noticing hammer hinted to one of his soldiers to kill haram so the man in a cowardly act came from behind with a spear and he put it through his back until it went out from his chest as he was introducing now the reaction of haram was astonishing the minute he felt this blow he took the blood and put it on his head and face shouting i have won by the grace of allah the lord of the kaaba i have won this was the first and last things last thing he said he did not think about the wife that he did not marry or the children that he did not trace he did not think about the farm that he did not farm and harvest he did not think about the buildings or the house he did not build the only thing that jumped into his mind that i have won by the grace of allah one what you're being killed you're you're dead this shows us that what was on the back of every single companion of the prophet was the definition of winning if you are turned away from hell and succeeded in entering paradise then you have one as allah tells us in the holy quran and as soon as as this messenger was killed sent to his people that come on let's go and attack his companions who were camped outside of our tribe they didn't know about what's going on but his people rejected his call and objected and how did you how do you dare do this when amir malik gave them his protection we will not move one single inch with you so he turned to banu bani sulaim another tribe and he requested their support and that's and and and the tribes of the quan and they all came with him he they sent their army and they surrounded the 70 companions of the prophet and they killed them all they attacked them by surprise and killed them all with the exception of kaab of nazid who was taken as as dead and he and they left him they thought that he he was dead but he was not there were two of the companions who were taking care of the camels and and the rides that was with them and they were al-mundir even and as soon as they saw the birds flying they knew that something wrong happened so they went in and they saw their companions dead and munder could not hold himself back he went and said i will die on what my brothers and companions died on and he fought them and he and they killed him as for amr ibn umayyah he was held capture as a prisoner he was captured as a prisoner he was brought to the leader of that tribe the wicked leader amir ibn and once he knew that he was from the tribe of mudar he said that i will let you go free because you are now a slave of mine and my mother has set a slave free and until now she did not buy a slave to set him free so i will consider you to be her slave and i will set you free but he chopped his hair from front and this was a sign that they did something wrong to him robert was set free and he left immediately to medina and before he reached madinah allah azzawajal revealed what happened to the companions to the prophet so he gathered his companions and he told them that your brothers met the polytheist met the disbelievers and they've killed them all and they requested allah that i would deliver the message to you that they are they have met their lord they've met allah and allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with allah look at this beautiful message no revenge no a vengeance all what you want to know is we are martyrs allah's we've met allah and he's pleased with us and we are also pleased with our lord now amraya was on his way to medina to inform the prophet allah of this treason so that they could retaliate and avenge the companions on his way he met two polytheists two men and he camped with them not telling them that he was a muslim he camped with them and until he saw them asleep he killed them and he took their goods and their luggage and went to the prophet and he told the prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam about what took place in and he told him about the two he killed what he didn't know that these two had a treaty with the prophet salla a couple of days ago and the prophet told them that you are safe and sound nobody of our people would attack you did not know that he just wanted to kill any disbelievers in front of him because of what they've done to his companions and to whatever they've done to him so the prophet alaihis allah had to pay the blood money for the fat to the families of these two men that am killed now the the time the financial situation in medina at that time was not very prosperous and the muslims did not have enough money so the treasury was empty the prophet the prophet allah did not have any money to pay for these two that armor killed so he had to go to those who had money and who would that be you think the jews the jews so he went to the jews requesting their assistance because he had an agreement with the jews that he would defend them and they would defend the muslims if anything would have happened and if they needed to pay someone they would assist and they would lend the prophet allah and he will pay them back so they had an agreement with them and to honor his word the prophet had to pay the blood money for those who were killed because he signed the treaty with so he went to the jews to ask them to help him and that was in the third month which is over the fourth year he went there along with some of his companions the close ones and as he was met by the leaders of banu and nobir they promised the prophet sallam to help him and they sounded very nice in a sense too nice this was not the norm with with the jews so they told him okay stay where you are a prophet of allah you're a guest and we will bring you the money the blood money you requested you know the banks are closed uh we will get it from here and there but rest assured that we will bring it to you so the prophet allah with his friends sat next to a house in the shade waiting for them to bring the money what the prophet sallam did not know that the leaders of the jews gathered and in their meeting they said that this is your only chance to assassinate muhammad so that you can get rid of him one of them salam rumishkam who was a fierce enemy of islam told them people you know that he will be informed by allah you know that whatever you say he know he knows it and this shows you that they also knew that he was the messenger of allah and in some incidents they used to say that we know that he's a messenger but he's not a messenger to us he's a messenger to the arabs and up to the moment there are people that think this way they believe in prophet muhammed they respect him they believe he's a messenger but they say he's not a messenger to all humankind he's a messenger only to the arabs and by itself this is a claim that is easy to reject because if you believe he's a messenger then you believe that he's telling the truth and in the quran that he uh brought to us and in his sunna he tells us that you have to believe in him or you will be in hell and he was sent to all mankind and he also said about the previous prophets which they have in their own book of course all of this was said and stated in the holy quran and he taught us this so they should and must believe in him i'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program until we meet next time um hmm oh hmm mm-hmm"
