  "transcript": "Ashraf says please describe how important it is to close the doors and windows or put curtains over these at the time of mullah Ruby and what can be the nay the harms of neglecting this Sunnah the prophets hadith alayhi salatu was-salam which was narrated by Bukhari and Muslim and others he said cover the pots and tie the leather containers water containers close the doors put off your lanterns because the devil does not untie a water container does not open a closed door and does not uncover a covered pot there are many Hadees and all of these hadith state that once it is sunset it is night time that we should do a number of things these things all revolve around protecting us from the devil's the jinn and this is understood from the hadith of the Prophet Ali salah salem when someone enters the house and he closes the door of the house saying bismillah the shape on the devil tells his companions we cannot spend the night here and when he eats his dinner and says bismillah the Shaitaan tells his companions we've lost dinner and we've lost a sleeping place so this taxes from the shaitaan to say bismillah the Prophet said re salatu salam there is one night every year where a certain illness or disease comes down from the skies and any vessel any plate any part that is uncovered it will enter it so you must cover all pots or or cups or plates or food even if you just place one miswak on it this would prevent it from entering and likewise with closing the doors with tying the warrick water containers etc now having said that scholars say that all of these are recommendations and not mandatory so if you don't cover the plate no problem it's not how long if you don't close the doors and you leave it partially partially open there's no problem in that it's not haram but you're going against the sunnah as far as the windows i did not see any mentioning of it in any hadith but most likely scholars compared it to doors being a place where a person can exit or enter to the house from but there is nothing of mentioning curtains or closing the windows it's only for the doors and hence most likely people in rural rural areas or in cities when the weather is fine they don't turn on their air conditionings and they need to open the windows for a current of fresh air there's no problem in that none what so ever you"
