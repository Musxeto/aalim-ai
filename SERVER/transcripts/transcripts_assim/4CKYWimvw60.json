  "title": "Who are Ahle hadees & can we follow them? Why do people criticise them? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Jia says can you tell me about can we follow them in my country most people say that they are not good we should not follow or listen to them is that true first of all Jia is a name a label and everyone can claim the label and not necessarily be part of that school so everybody says we and so many of those who label themselves as are actually deviant sects who do not relate to so they are all under the same umbrella that's follows the Quran the Sunnah and the righteous predecessors in their understanding of all of that now to just label yourself that you are from is not sufficient we have to scrutinize that person see how his AA is and see whether he is actually part of implementing the correct AA following the Quran and the Sunnah with the understanding of the righteous predecessors or not if he is then he's from which is a positive thing so why do many people in my country speak ill about them those who speak ill about salais or or are usually either deviant sects with corrupt and this is why they would like to tarnish their reputation so that they do not spread the authentic valid or because they are blind followers of their school of thought so anything that goes out of their school of thought they consider that to be deviant even if it's following the Quran and the Sunnah because of their blind following they believe that anything that is out of their school of thought has to go against Islam and that would be part of going against the Quran and the Sunnah not knowing that this is the Quran and the Sunnah so if you know what you're doing and if you know who you're following and which ideology which which methodology to be followed which the prophet and his companions and the and the used to follow and you follow that you could care less or more what people say who cares I am following the footsteps of the Prophet Alam whenever one says to me why are you doing this I said because the prophet Alam said so and so and so either they bring me another verse of the Quran or a Hadith to contradict this to counter it or they would say yeah but Imam so and so says otherwise say Subhan Allah you follow your IM I follow my IM Prophet Muhammad so I hope this answers your question"
