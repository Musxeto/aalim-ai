  "transcript": "Amir from the U.S. Amir. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. Yeah so Sheikh I have some debts I had to pay off right and I was wondering like is it okay for me to like my mom you know she usually buys things for me and I was wondering like she wouldn't like you know pay for my debts or anything like that I was wondering if it's if it's okay for like me to ask you know my mom to like get a like a gym membership for me that's really cheap or something like that instead of Amir your mom is your mom you can ask her for anything and if she's willing and giving that's that's fine who else in this world do we have the audacity to go and ask and beg other than our parents so we go to them and we ask and if they give that's the nature of parents and if they refrain or decline or request we have no ill feelings done whatsoever so go ahead ask your mom for a membership for paying you part of your loans for buying you a gift and anything she's a mother and she loves doing this for your sake and Allah knows best."
