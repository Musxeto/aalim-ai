  "transcript": "I'm it says what is the beginning and the end time of morning and evening supplications this is a good question we know that there are so many enemies out there and without our Armour we're vulnerable for attack so if you don't have your body armor if you don't have your bulletproof vest if you don't have protection you are susceptible to evil eye black magic and V engine position may Allah protect all of us so what is to be done among the first that come on the list are the eighth car of morning and evening so these are car constitute your antivirus your armor your vest that is bulletproof so it protects you and if you fail to say them you're not protected maybe you'll get something maybe you're not it depends on what Allah has decreed for you so what are the times for the morning earth car the beginning it's after the event of Fechter so no doubt once the event is given the dawn after the break of dawn you can say that car of the morning and for the evening they differ some say after a sir others say after Maghrib and both have their evidence backing it up I'm inclined to say it after maverick this is the beginning what about the end as for the morning-after car some say it ends with the sunrise and others say it can end at the end of Baja time which is about 10 minutes before the add-on of all bearing in mind that if I say it at 10 o'clock for example from the break of dawn till 10 I'm not protected so it is essential to say it as soon as possible so the beginning we know break of dawn the end either by sunrise or by 10 minutes before a ton of the whole what about the evening of car the beginning is an issue of dispute whether it's a sir or Margaret so for those who say ah sir they say that it can be extended until sunset and some say that no it can be extended until the first third of the night which is usually like ten o'clock in normal times and those who say that it begins at MRIB sunset they say it is extended until the first third of the night expires but again we should not mess around with it and we should try our level best to pray it on tie or to say it on time you"
