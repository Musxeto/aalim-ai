  "transcript": "F from the US um question regarding the is prayer and the V with respect to the so I seen many lectures but like still I just want to clarify myself so if I pray Isha and concluded the Isha prayer with the V so from what I've been taught like you know um that um once you conclude your Isa prayer with the with not to PR the now provided that if I wake up or like intentionally this is not true continue I got let me mut it um but um so yeah so if I pray with her and I wake up like around 2 a.m. let let's say I set an alarm or like you know wake up myself so can I still pray theud 100% yes you can there's a confusion among the Muslims who don't seek knowledge properly and learn properly from the Quran and the Sunnah the confusion is due to the fact that the prophet said there are no two wi in one night and the other Hadith make the last of your night prayer Witter so people made the math and said hm if I prayed and then prayed W then I should follow the second Hadith make the last of your night prayer Witter and this means I cannot pray afterwards and this is not true because the prophet himself as narrated by mother AA Used to offer his Witter prayer and afterwards pray two raas sitting down and praying two raas indicates that you can pray after your Witter however it is highly recommended for those who know that they will wake up in the middle of the night at 2:00 3:00 and they're fixated on that it's best for them to delay the water to be the last thing they pray at that night but if someone is hesitant or uncertain whether he's going to wake up or not and he concludes after is by praying Witter and then goes to bed and wakes up at 2: or 3:00 a.m. he may pray as many ra as he wishes two by two but no Witter because the Witter he prayed after Isa makes the total of whatever he prayed that night in odd numbers and this is the Sunnah and Allah knows best introducing a privacy focused Islamic matchmaking app that follows the soona no photos no chatting and a w involved matchmaking process find a Pious spouse the sooner way download nisv now"
