  "title": "Can Muslim women preach Islam publicly and on social media platforms? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Emmett says can a Muslim woman preach Islam on social media there are so many women who are preaching Islam on social media without covering their face is this permissible first of all you have to ask yourself what is the purpose of hijab why did Allah mandate hijab is it not to protect women from men and to protect men from women did not Allah Azza WA JAL mentioned in chapter 33 verse 53 so that as app that whenever you ask the mothers of the believers for something let it be from behind a hijab this is purer for your hearts and for their hearts Allah is addressing this to whom to the Companions of the Prophet Allison to Abu Bakr Omar Othman Ali and he's telling them that when you do so with your mothers the wives of the Prophet RA salatu salam the mothers of the believers do so meaning asking them from for some utensils from beyond a curtain from beyond a hijab why because by doing so this is purer for your hearts or companions of Allah and for the hearts of the mothers of the believers what about our hearts we know that their hearts are way purer than than mine and yours our hearts are corrupt are tarnished by sins and desires and whims so aren't we in need of such purity more than them definitely yes so this defines the purpose of hijab that women come out on social media to preach Islam let alone to do anything else the question would come and be aren't there enough men to do the job why would we need women to come on social media answer because women like to ask other women and there are some private issues that only women can address that's good but it has to be in all segregated section it has to be done privately between women among themselves not in public not when I type and I can see the sister giving Dawa on YouTube okay she is reminding us of allah azza wajal yes but men a lot of them have corruption in their heart when they see such a woman what a beautiful or average or even not beautiful Shaitaan is there Shaitaan comes to me and beautifies her and saying that Masha Allah she's righteous she's good-looking and she is knowledgeable and makes me adore her this is how Shaitaan works this doesn't happen with men women look at the Sheikh and they don't fall in love with him because Allah did not mandate men to wear hijab Allah mandated women to wear hijab because they are more fitna and mother Aisha who's the most knowledgeable among women may Allah be pleased with her she's our mother yet she never addressed men she never addressed the companions asked weird that's strange the prophet of Allah is all of them told us to take half of our Deen from Aisha because she was so close to the Prophet she learnt a lot of the deal and she was among the Companions that narrated a lot of hadith so we learn a lot from her yet she never addressed them she never did a sermon or a lecture in a Masjid though she is the mother of the believers no one would have ill intent with them but this is the religion of a larger watcher nowadays unfortunately women Muslim women that is I'm not referring to other Muslim women have been brainwashed with the issue of empowerment nowadays even women who memorize the Quran in the past fully they have taken off the hijab not the cob they have taken off the hijab totally and they are calling other women for empowerment for being independent for standing up in the face of men for rejecting their father and brothers guardianship to travel alone without a Muharram to do anything that a man does our Villa is this Islam these are delusional these are ignorant imbeciles don't be fooled by them memorizing the Quran because they have zero knowledge of the religion of Islam what they're doing is exactly what Shaytan wants them to do Allah says in the Quran walk our Nephi beautycon stay in your homes this is where a woman should be taking care of her parents they can care of her husband and family giving the family a safe haven to flourish and to and to thrive in but Shaitaan tells them no go out work mix with men you can drive Formula one cars you can be a pilot you can be an engineer and build high-rises you can do the what is this and there is no shirt on telling man stay home you can be a good housewife you can be even pregnant and bear children he doesn't say this to men why because he doesn't need to Oh what he needs is to corrupt one woman and this is more dangerous than a thousand cannon but Muslim women are heedless they don't pay attention and not only that see if you corrupt your own self if your sinful tough luck you'll go to hell alone but if you are the leader and if you are guiding other women are the girls to be corrupt like you then you have a big problem you'll take your seat next to Satan in Hellfire why is that because you are a leader in taking people away in guiding them astray in showing them the path of hell why all of this is happening now because of the media especially the social media women just want Fame the only women even men unfortunately I've seen few samples of women and men saying heinous things saying stupid things just to be famous like that person who came on an interview saying that I love Hebrew I love the Israeli people is he a Muslim what kind of Islam is this it's just wanting to be famous an old story that always repeat this but it is important to comprehend the meaning of it in the season of Hajj like our season the pilgrims caught a nomad a Bedouin who had feces in a bag wanting to soil the curtains of the Kaaba so just before he did his heinous act they caught him they beat him and they took him to the Muslim ruler when they showed the Muslim ruler what he was about to do he said subhanAllah are you a Muslim and the nomads said yes I am a Muslim and the judge said this is impossible how could you be a Muslim and do such a horrendous act and the man said I wanted to be mentioned among the Muslims even if they curse me no problem you just wanted to be famous notable oh you want to be famous even if they curse you so whenever they come to mention it yeah yeah you remember that man what's his name may Allah curse him he wanted to soil that's the curse of the Kaaba with feces this is what's happening in the social media how many followers do you have Oh masha'Allah you have so many followers how did you gain these followers by giving proper knowledge by being sincere and teaching people by let us not let us avoid Islam by giving them beneficial advice or by interfering and saying anything that makes you popular saying anything that makes you stand out in a crowd a Syrian blogger a couple of days ago said that she enjoyed having illicit relationship outside of the marriage Constitution she admitted fornicating committing adultery why would a woman do such a thing she says I invite women to do and share my experience how would you be let him in a shape on the regime this is blasphemous what is she doing why is she exposing herself like this a prostitute a slot what else can you describe her but why is she doing this even prostitutes hide their identity the answer is because she wants exposure she wants to be famous she wants to get more likes and more followers and this is what will break a person's back therefore my advice is for the women for the sisters to fear allah azzawajal not to look after exposure you can be beneficial to the Ummah if you simply go to segregated places like so many - yes do they attend conferences but no one attends their lecture except women and it's not recorded you can do a lot by having students like this but to come out in the media showing your face showing your voice and you know the restriction and prohibition of this this is not very wise of you"
