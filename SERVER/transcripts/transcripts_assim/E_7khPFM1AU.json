  "title": "The Role Model (Prophet ﷺ‎) (14) - Things that amazed him - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "like any human being the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam had feelings so he may get angry and he may become pleased and he may become happy and he may become sad sometimes the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam would see things that astonish him things that would Amaze him and hence would make him a bit surprised whether these things are of Allah's creation and Allah's actions and doings or whether they are from someone else his companions or anyone else however the prophets was never amazed by the adornment of this Dunya because Allah told him this directly in the Quran not to be fooled by what people possess in their hands the adornments of this life don't be impressed by their wealth their children their health the things that Allah gives to them in this life because these are only a test so the prophet Allah was never impressed by worldly matters unlike us when we see a fancy car we're shocked we turn our heads looking at it when we see a beautiful mansion a lavish lifestyle a hefty bank account we're Amazed by it not the prophet Allah because Allah brought him up to not give any importance to such materialistic things once the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam was given a garment made of silk and for the Arabs and non-arabs even to us nowadays the touch and feeling of silk is so soft and nice so the companions kept on wondering they were Amazed by touching this soft fabric and how beautiful it was so the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam redirected their attention and he fixed the way they look at things by saying to them do you like the feeling of this fabric are you Amazed by it by Allah the handkerchiefs that said may Allah be pleased with him has in Paradise are much better and softer than this and we know that may Allah be pleased with him died in the uh Battle of the trench when he was hit by a an arrow and no one knows who hit him with and he kept on bleeding from that injury for a whole month and then he died and the Throne of Allah shook out of Happiness when he died because he was coming to them as per the authentic Hadith so the prophet sallallahu is telling them this is worldly issues neglected don't be amazed by it think of the bigger picture think of what lies ahead in Jannah if you're destined to enter it there will be much softer and better fabric than this Allah as stated warned his Prophet Allah for being amazed or impressed by such things Allah says so let not their wealth or their children impress you Allah only intends to punish them through them inwardly life and that their souls should depart at death while they are disbelievers and also Allah says and do not extend your eyes towards that by which we have given enjoyment to some categories of them it's being but the Splendor of worldly Life by which we test them and the provision of your lord is better than is better and more enduring this is the attitude of Muslims when you see the richest billionaire when you see the lavish Yachts or palaces they possess we're not impressed good for you enjoy it while you can it's few years couple of decades and another one bites the dust you're six feet under and then you'll get what's coming to you as for us we're terrified in this life we enjoy whatever we can put our hands on only if it's Halal and pleasing Allah and when we look at others we could care less let them enjoy what they want because they're going to pay the price and we are going to pay the price of whatever we earn unlawfully or we enjoy without having the concession from Allah to enjoy it so the prophet salallahu sometimes was amazed and impressed by Allah's actions and this is to glorify Allah when you're impressed of Allah's actions this is to glorify Allah and to show that you're Amazed by his creation and his actions once the prophet salallahu said to his companions don't you feel amazed how Allah azzawajal deflects their insults to me the people of quraish why they used to nickname him [Music] meaning the insulted one the one who's cursed and he says Allah deflected this by my own name which is Muhammad the name I was born with and it means the praised one so no matter how you insult the prophet is no matter how you depict him wanting to make fun of him or ridicule him he's still on top and you are a stinking corpse in few years time nothing you could do that would tarnish his reputation his name is being called five times a day every single inch of Earth Round the Clock 24 hours seven days a week his name is being called in every Advan in every iqama in every prayer two billion Muslims offer to Allah azzawajal so you can't touch him you can do nothing he is the praised one Allah has praised him and given him the beautiful name of Muhammad also the prophet salallahu was amazed astonished shocked by how negligent ignorant people are aren't we all we're all ignorant we live our lives we pass 20 years of age 30 40 70 80 and we still think that the Energizer Bunny is still ticking we still have time we still have credit We're Not Gonna Die and the prophet salallahu was amazed by this and he said I haven't seen anything like Hellfire those running away from it are deep asleep and I haven't seen like paradise those seeking it are deep asleep so neither when you're afraid you're running away and neither when you are pursuing and seeking Paradise you run into it you're asleep you're doing nothing also the prophet Allah shared with us his amazement of the disbeliever on the day of judgment when he stands in front of Allah azzawajal to be held accountable and he says in defiance no I don't accept your records or Allah that show my sins and my disbelief I need a witness so Allah says you have a witness from your own self and a witness from the angels so his mouth is shut and his limbs are permitted to speak so his hands his legs his body parts all speak and testify against him that yes he did this and he did that then he's allowed to speak and to open his mouth and he would curse his own limbs damn you I was defending you I was trying to protect you and all what I get is condemnation from you you're testifying against me to Allah and he's tossed in hell the prophet salallahu also was amazed and by the way when the prophet salallahu sees something that amazes him or impresses him he would say subhanallah and this is how he would Express his amazement he was amazed once when um his wife came to him once and said o prophet of Allah why don't you marry my sister so the prophet was shocked by this request and says would you like this because usually jealousy would not allow a woman to want someone else to share her husband with her let alone her own sister so he said would you like this so she said o prophet of Allah I'm not someone who does not want you but I would love my sister to share this goodness that I am enjoying in this life what could be better than the prophet himself so the prophet salallahu said this is not permissible for me I can't join between two sisters this is prohibited as mentioned in chapter four sort of Nissa and then he said do not display your woman folk to me don't propose to me such things also the prophet when it was related to marriage used to be shocked by the amount of Dowry people pay a man married a woman from the ansar and gave her four ounces of silver and we know silver is nothing it's what it's not that much so the prophet was shocked and said Allah four ounces of silver as if you are taking the silver from this mountain meaning you're finding finding it freebies you just take it and give it away not having to work hard for it and what would the prophet say if he were to see how much Dowry people are paying how much expenses they are wasting over one night in a five-star hotel or a wedding hall throwing the money over food over people who would at the end of the night can them and consider that food was tasteless not well cooked not much salt or too much salt despite all what you've spent to please them the prophet salallahu also wondered how could people do such a thing when they do not give Allah the proper estimate he visited a man who was sick and really badly sick and he was so sick that he was so thin that it was noticeable so the prophet salallahu asked him this is strange did you supplicate did you make any Dua that is out of the ordinary the man said yes I invoked Allah and said oh Allah whatever you were going to punish me for on the day of judgment oh Allah make it a punishment for me here in this life so that when I come on the day of judgment I have no sins to be punished for and this is why he felt this sick so the prophet said subhanallah this is the word subhanallah nobody can tolerate Allah's punishment in this life wouldn't you have said why wouldn't you ask Allah for forgiveness and ask him to give you something that is good in this life and the Hereafter and to protect you from Hellfire then the prophet made Dua for him and Allah cured him with his grace sometimes people when it comes to illnesses they don't appreciate Allah's power and ability so once there was someone who's wounded so the prophet called the doctor so the people around him said oh prophet of Allah what would medication do to him and the prophet was amazed by the response he said subhanallah did not made an illness descend to Earth without having a cure for it so why are you so in despair of Allah's Mercy every illness has a cure and a remedy for it a healing for it but not all people know you have to keep on looking and the prophet sallallahu would teach his companions if he sees something nice or hears something nice by expressing his amazement once he heard the man praying and he said in his prayer this is one of the vicar in prayer Allah the prophet said I was impressed and shocked by what he has said because the gates of the heavens were opened for it IBN Omar says after I heard this from the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam I never left saying these words in my prayers and also the prophet was amazed by people seeing people entering Jannah with shackles in their necks and hands and we explained this in an earlier episode and these were the captives of War who were taken into captivity as disbelievers and while they were enslaved they discovered Islam accepted it and this made them enter Paradise because of their captivity the prophet salallahu also expressed his amazement when two men from the East came and they delivered a speech in front of the Prophet Allah pledging the their allegiance to him accepting Islam so they introduced this with adoration a beautiful eloquent speech the people were amazed by their eloquency by their beautiful selection of words and the prophet said some of the speech of people is a form of magic and this is to express his amazement and how impressed he was by what they had said praising that the choice of words can have the impact of magic of course the good magic not the Bad Evil sorcery and the prophet once was with his companions and all of a sudden he smiled and laughed and he asked his companions why wouldn't you ask me what's making you laugh a froth of Allah so they said what is making you laugh of prophet of Allah he said I was amazed and impressed by the affair of the believer all of his affair is good if he was afflicted by a blessing and a favor of Allah he would praise Allah azzawajal and that would be good for him but if he was afflicted by a Calamity or a test or something that he does not like he's patient and that is also good for him and this is not for anyone except for the believer which shows us that the Affairs of a Believer is always good perfect and he's always evolving and ascending in goodness whether he's favored and blessed or he's tested and tried by Allah he's always content he's always praising Allah azzawajal and this can only be to a Believer non-believers disbelievers don't share this and that is why the prophet was impressed and Amazed by how tolerant and content a Believer is with the predestiny and the Divine decree of Allah the Almighty"
