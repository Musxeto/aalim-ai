  "transcript": "from Zambia. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa'alaikumussalam Wa Barakatu. Sheikh I just wanted to ask about saying Takbir at the gathering, is it from the sunnah where a person says Takbir and then they respond Allahu Akbar? No, this is not from the sunnah and unfortunately it is prevailing in so many countries that I've visited when we enter the masjid or we enter the lecture hall and out of their enthusiasm they say Takbir, they say Allahu Akbar, what are you doing? This is not from the sunnah. But people unfortunately substitute it for clapping and also you can't fix something wrong with another wrong. Two wrongs don't make a right and Allah knows best. you"
