  "title": "Taking photos of food & posting on social media. Asking a Sheikh about fatwa of another Sheikh Assim",
  "transcript": "uh ayan from canada he says that there is a fatwa for a particular sheikh that's saying that taking photographs of food is haram i'm not aware of such fatwa and the second most important thing than this fatwa is it is totally impolite or let us say in appropriate to ask a sheikh about the photo of another sheikh and giving his name this is totally inappropriate because you are insulting the sheikh you are coating so either he's wrong or i'm wrong someone is wrong someone is and i'm not sure whether he said such a fatwa or not and i don't believe that would say such a fatwa maybe he would comment on what is happening on social media on instagram on facebook where people keep on posting their day-to-day activities there are bloggers there are youtubers there are influencers that would post everything in their life like five four hours a day this is our living room this is what i had for lunch this is what i have for breakfast look at my ice cream look at my food in the fridge and this beside being showing off it breaks the hearts of some of the poor of the weak in islam iman etc so this is unadvisable but i would not go to say that it is haram without proper evidence whether you have a business or not shooting a or snapping or taking a photo of your a meal or a good food that is decorated nicely is totally legit"
