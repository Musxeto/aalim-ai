  "title": "Should we hide our mandatory & voluntary good deeds? Can we lie to conceal them? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "that we should hide our good deed so question is um if we hide it from everyone and then someone asked us that do you choose this and that so what should i say should i lie and if i say yes so they appreciate and they appreciate us so i think it's real what should i do first of all good deeds are either mandatory or voluntary so mandatory deeds such as going to the masjid or fasting ramadan must not be hidden on the contrary people must know that you're doing it so if you're going to pray maghrib and you're walking to the message and someone says hi what are you doing he said i'm going to buy some groceries and you're not lying you're going to pray maghrib and then buy some groceries that is not a good thing to do you have to not boast about it but show it to the whole world that you are complying with allah's instructions and orders and you're going to pray in the masjid like he ordered you to do there are other deeds that are voluntary so if you are doing something that's voluntary you don't go around telling people hey listen i did this i did that i am doing this i'm doing that and this is similar to what imam malik used to do during the month of ramadan as his sister narrated she says that malik used to spend most of his time reciting the quran and whenever someone entered the room he's in he used to cover the quran with his sleeves or with his uh garment so that people would not see that he was uh actually reading the quran to conceal his good deeds so yes if you're fasting you don't have to go around people saying to them today's monday i'm fasting google i'm i'm a good person no don't do that but if you are asked can you lie definitely not if you're invited someone gives you something to drink it said no no come please it's just on the house it's on me please drink it there's no problem saying fasting and this is not exposing your good deeds this is something that islam permits it can be a form of calling people and it's also part of the sunnah the prophet says assam if some of you is invited to a feast or to a meal if he's not fasting he should eat and if he's fasting he should make dua meaning you can attend but say that i'm fasting and you make dua for them that would be equivalent to answering it and allah knows best"
