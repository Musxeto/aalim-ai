  "title": "If a Christian acquaintance visits me twice a year Does it count as taking him as best friend (ally)",
  "transcript": "I know that it is not permissible to take non-muslims as close friends there is a Christian guy who lives in another country and he comes to my country twice a year whenever he comes to my country he sends me a text message asking me if he's welcome to come to my house I don't do this for dawa purposes but just to catch up with him if I accept him in my house twice a year and I don't have any types of communications with him in the meantime would I be considered as the one who takes Christians as close friends the answer is no there is no problem in entertaining him twice a year casually like any other person this is not taking them as allies or uh uh close confidence and there's no problem in that"
