  "transcript": "sent an email and she's complaining about how her husband had changed she's saying Subhan Allah we had a beautiful relationship and my husband was very caring and loving whatever little things I used to advise him and tell him about he used to do them so whatever advice I would give him about Islam he would mallah uh do it but and and get the energy uh for that and now sub he has changed and nowadays he doesn't seem to like any things related to Sunnah and when I tell him to follow or to do this he gets angry and she prays for him that Allah would return him back to being the good man he was and being the love of her life in uh her marriage so she's depressed well this is a test and it's not a roller coaster at the same time but it is a test from Allah Allah created us to test us and he is telling us that paradise and hell is waiting for us so you have to tolerate your husband you have to examine and scrutinize and analyze your life what made him change is it that you're not taking care of yourself you're not the woman he married 10 15 20 years ago you're not taking care of yourself you're not taking care of the children you're taking things for granted is it because he was so kind and nice and loving to you throughout the previous years you took that for granted and you stopped improving and that is why he is not interested any in you anymore is it because you nagging him about things that are an issue dispute yet you're insisting that he has to do it this is Sunnah you have to follow it and he may think that it is not mandatory why should I do it so you have to revise your life and see if you are bossing him a lot if you're bullying a lot and you have to know what to do if nothing is applicable in your case and you are the same soft and nice and loving and caring woman in this case you have to look into his life what has been introduced to his life a new job a new career lots of debts lots of financial uh uh obligations and you have to think how you can improve his life and finally if nothing works you have to communicate with him tell him speak out your heart and tell him that you would love to sit with him and with a third person who would give you marriage counseling this may help inshallah"
