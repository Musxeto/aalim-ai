  "transcript": "uh with regards to um um selecting a um a spouse um concerning that one can only look at the spouse once please can you quote any um um any backup from the of the Quran sir and concerning that that one can only look at the proposed and spouse on the default in Islam the default is that it is prohibited for you to look at other women full stop no legitimate reason it's not permissible so this is a default I see someone walking across the street and I go doy what are you doing though this is the first site I didn't blink no this is Haram it is not permissible for you to look and to check her out she's not a book in a library secondly there is an exception where there is a necessity I'm a physician a doctor and I have a female patient she has a problem that requires me to look at a specific area of her body so so she has pain in her pinky I would say okay take off your clothes whoa hey what are you doing oh it's a legitimacy no it's not she has a problem with her pinky look at her pinky only the rest of the arm should be covered let alone the her body ah I didn't know that so you can only look at what is required for you to look at times of necessity similarly someone's proposing the prophet said who's ever interested in a woman for marriage he may look at her so that it would encourage him to marry her ah this is an exception so when I go and propose I'm allowed to sit with this potential woman that I'm interested in marrying and I'm allowed to look at her face I check her out see her height is okay and and the likes and to see whether there's chemistry or not I'm not buying a product the reason is the prophet said in another Hadith when a man proposed and he told the prophet Sall s alai wasallam I propose to this woman the prophet said did you look at her face did you look into her eyes the man said no the prophet said go and check her out meaning go and look in her face because the eyes of the ansar has some deficiencies in them maybe they're cross died or some uh something wrong in it so so that you wouldn't regret your decision after marriage when it's too late go and check out how she looks if you're happy and satisfied go ahead with it so this is the exception not the norm so you saw her you sat with her you spoke with her and a couple of days later said I'd like to do it again maybe this time um let me invite her to a candlelight dinner and maybe some violin music in the background heit wait what are you doing this is dating yeah but I'd like to look at it again no no this is not fine you looked at her you saw what you are getting into that's sufficient now you make your decision or move on"
