  "title": "Devils are chained & Gates of Hell are closed, does this also apply to the Jinn who do possession?",
  "transcript": "Usama from the US. So my question is regarding the famous hadith that in Ramadan the gates of hell are closed and the shayateen and the jinn are chained. Does this also apply to the jinn that are involved in possession in black magic or some asr on an individual that, does this also apply to those jinns? The Prophet ﷺ said that when Ramadan is due the gates of hell are closed and the gates of paradise are opened and the masters of jinn are chained so that they would not be able to do what they used to do before Ramadan. So this does not mean as so many of us think that whoops there are no devils, no jinn, no possession, no whispering of shaytan. No, the Prophet ﷺ did not say that and what we see and observe definitely confirms that he did not mean that. What he meant was the evil is reduced in Ramadan and eleven months of the year we see the gates of hell, devils doing whatever they want to do and the amount of evil is so high while during Ramadan they are subdued and the amount of evil is way reduced than before but there is still evil. So they still whisper, they still possess, they still do their evil things but on a much lighter and smaller scale than outside of Ramadan and Allah knows best."
