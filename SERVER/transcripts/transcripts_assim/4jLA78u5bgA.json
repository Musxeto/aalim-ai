  "title": "Can Muslims accept authentic Islamic knowledge given to them by Atheist / Agnostic? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "shik if an agnostic who has been studying Islam for many many years and now very close to accept Islam however he feels majority Muslims don't know Islam properly don't study Islam some of them even doing Innovations so he wishes to correct them Enlighten them by providing your videos or other shak's lectures is there anything wrong in it and can Muslims accept that as long as he's providing authentic sources ja first of all such an agnos IC person must not care about others before caring about himself all what he's doing is going down the drain Allah will not reward him for that because he himself is not a Believer it's like a carpenter who fixes people's doors and windows while his own home his door and windows are broken it doesn't make any sense as for the people who are on the receiving end if the material comes to them from a sheh a student of knowledge or an atheist or an agnostic person they don't accept what they see without filtering it and trying to figure out whether it coincides and goes in in line with the Quran and Sunnah or not if it does alhamdulillah it doesn't matter who gave it to you as in the Hadith of Abu Hur may Allah be pleased with him when he over three nights used to catch someone trying to steal from the treasury of the Muslims and he let him be and the prophet every day tells him after fer he is a liar and he will come back so the second day and the third day the third day he did not let him go he said I'll report you to the prophet Alam so he told him let me free let me go set me loose and I will tell you something that if you say it you'll be protected from the devils and he told him about aat when he prayed f with the prophet Abu told him because the prophet said AB what did your prisoner do last night he said he told me I'll teach you a verse of the Quran I'll teach you something that would protect you from the devils and the Jin and he read aat the prophet said to him he had told you the truth though he's a blatant liar so the prophet did not say no no no no reject whatever he said to you because he's a liar rather he accept Ed it yet pointing out that he's a liar similarly this agnostic person if he sends good materials and good lectures that you can benefit from no problem in that and Allah Knows Best"
