  "transcript": "um chef and last time I asked you about um this software group and I talked to you about this one manual preventing one brother from Messi um about it about this one brother who prevents other brother from entering the Masjid for what why um because this because this is a brother who prevents him claimed that just because he's following this one Sheikh he's done allowed to enter the message subhanallah yeah so um for example this is one video um spread and what's wrong about that okay does this person who prevents others from entering the Masjid owns the Masjid is his own Masjid I don't know it's on YouTube and um no no no these what you see on YouTube is a bunch of baloney these are all fabricated or um these are sketches pre-made from before and they just put it to a stir confusion there is no reality to it no one can stop me from entering a Masjid when all the other worshipers are watching if so imagine if I'm trying to enter a Masjid and someone says no you're a deviant check you're not allowed to enter the Masjid what about the 150 other worshipers there would they just wait silently or would they intervene and say hey this is the house of Allah who are you to stop him and he says no no he does this he does that they would not take it this is the house of Allah so if he has no Authority and the other worshipers are there he has no uh Power to stop that person and I would advise that person next time to bring five of his relatives and friends and and enter the message and see if he can stop them or not"
