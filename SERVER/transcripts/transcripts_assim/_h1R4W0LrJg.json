  "title": "Is fearing someone who could harm you, shirk? #assimalhakeem #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "okay sh we know that uh certain types of fears are part of hidden acts of worship and that if a person directs Their Fear towards other than Allah then it's kuur so my question is if my brother is involved in Black Magic and I cannot sorti with him is fearing that he may harm me with s considered as kuur Jia if your brother is known to be physically abusive and you fear that if you talk to him he's going to slap you on your face or stab you with a knife is this kind of fear shik yes or no Jia are you with us or you gone okay she's gone so as I said before multiple times the fear of others that is associated with revering them worshiping them fearing them in things that only Allah can do this is shik natural fear such as the fear of lions of a black mamba fire drowning this is not shik fearing someone who could harm you physically is not shik but when I'm in the middle of the house and I fear a ruler or someone of great power though he's not able to see me or able to control me and I have this fear that is similar to the fear of Allah in the ABS of that individual that is associated with revering him and glorifying him this is shik and this is not found except with those who worship other than Allah for example a thief was caught red-handed stealing and they say to him you stole he said no I did not steal he said swear by Allah you you did not steal he said wall I did not steal said okay swear by Imam Hussein or by Tani or jilani one of the a as he believe in said no I can't do that they will curse me I will be doomed for eternity not because it's shik he's afraid of them literally afraid of them that is true shik and Allah Knows Best"
