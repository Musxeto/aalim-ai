  "transcript": "he says that the sister is complaining that her husband uttered the word of divorce three times at the same time so he said or you divorc tce and this is his first time what should be done and they live in the USA they should consult the Imam of the Islamic Center where they live but theoretically speaking technically speaking it's an issue of dispute some Scholars say that when a man says to his wife you're divorc divorce divorce then she becomes forbidden totally for him until she marries another man he cannot remarry her again or reconcile until she marries another man and has sexual relationship and then be divorced without any intention for getting back to the first husband it has to be a legitimate second marriage and the most authentic opinion is that divorcing a woman three times at the same time takes place only once so if you take say to your wife you're divorced divorce divorced this takes place as one divorce and the second divorce cannot take place until you reconcile your wife after reconciliation you may divorce her again and we all know that there is um legitimate divorce and an innovated forbidden divorce and a lot of the Muslims 99% of their divorces take place in the innovation forbidden category because you cannot divorce your wife except uh by two means either when she's pregnant and the consensus of Scholars say that when a pregnant woman is divorced the divorce takes place or when she is in the period so after she gets her msense and she is pure and uh uh you did not have any intimacy with her if you divorce her this is a divorce in accordance to the Sunnah and it is valid any other such divorce is considered to be inovated"
