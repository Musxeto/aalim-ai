  "transcript": "Consider Subscribing ğŸ˜„ [Questioner] from India? [Questioner] In aÂ \ndream I saw one man who was resembling Prophet ï·ºÂ Â  but I just saw his backside and oneÂ \nanother guy he was pointing towards thatÂ Â  and he was telling me that look Prophet ï·ºÂ \nis protecting you from the bees that areÂ Â  coming towards you, so did I reallyÂ \nsaw Prophet ï·º in my dream or not? [Sheikh] The scholars say if you are ableÂ \nto recognize the Prophet ï·º from his facialÂ Â  features as described to us in the authenticÂ \nsunnah then you have seen the Prophet ï·º.Â Â  Failing to have done so, because you only sawÂ \nhim from his backside, even if everyone aroundÂ Â  him in the dream told you that this isÂ \na Prophet ï·º, this is not the Prophet ï·º."
