  "transcript": "aha from india says uh he would like to know how many rakhas did tamim daria and kab lead the prayers in taraweeh because we know that umar may allah be pleased with him gathered all the muslims to pray behind these two imams this is an issue of dispute depending on how authenticates the hadith whether they prayed 23 raka's or they prayed 11 and there is no point in going into such dispute whatever you choose to do 11 is good 23 is good 51 is good whatever you you want to pray the sky is the limit the prophet never limited it to 11. don't be confused nowhere that the prophet came and say do not pray more than 11. yes the prophet did pray 11 raka's but he did it limited the prophet only performed hajj once in his life but he didn't limit it so no one can come and say no no i'll pray i'll offer one hajj that's it because the prophet prophet haslam offered one hajj no if it was a sunnah to be to get hold on to the prophet would have hinted when the man said how should i pray night prayer the prophet said two two and if you fear fajr then give or offer one of witter he never told him to 2 but do not exceed 11. and allah knows best you"
