  "title": "Ruling about Halal Nail Polish in Islam - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "sent us a question saying that my daughter got to keep what is known as halal nail varnish from a brand company it has bubbles of oxygen and they say it is Haddad is it really Holland first of all whenever we want to answer a question related to such issues it doesn't matter what the brand is it doesn't matter what the company or the maker is what matters is the ruling and when we come to the issue of nail polish or a nail varnish the ruling is clear anything that is a barrier anything that prevents water from reaching the part we are ordered to wash in evolution in Woodill then the ablution is not valid why because I must wash that limb I must wash my hands including of course my fingernails but if there is a substance like paint like glue like anything that prevents water from reaching the actual nail in this case my model is invalid now if it is only a color like henna for example if it's just a marker or the color of a pen this is not a barrier this is a color so this does not affect your rule but if it has a layer if it has a mass to it that I can scratch out and remove in this case it prevents water from reaching it regardless of what they claim that it has water bubbles or oxygen bubbles to it water does not reach there because it doesn't stick to your nail without some kind of glue or some kind of a substance that's why it's making that layer therefore the there isn't any such thing as had a nail varnish to my knowledge and hence the prayer would not be valid"
