  "transcript": "Ghazalia from Singapore Ghazalia or Ghazali Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Yeah hi Sheikh, I have two quick questions. One only Ghazali because we have so many people waiting. Okay okay sure. So in my country they are right now doing this thing called Salatul Hajjah in most of the mosques like 90% of the mosques. May I know whether it's a bid'ah or because they conducted that right after Friday prayers. Okay Salatul Hajjah is backed up by a hadith but this hadith is not authentic. The vast majority of scholars say that this is a weak hadith and as we know we Muslims only follow the Qur'an and the authentic hadith. These are the sources of our religion and therefore what is being done in your region is wrong and you should not follow that and Allah knows best."
