  "transcript": "arsalan says is cards playing without gambling Haram or not now we know that it is permissible in Islam to have entertainment to entertain yourself to play providing that you do not cross any of the red lines so if you play cards generally speaking if you try your level best not to involve anything Haram and what do we mean by anything Haram for example gambling so we play if I win you buy me dinner if I lose I'll buy you dinner this is gambling total totally prohibited major sin Haram is that when we are so obsessed by it that that is being cold and we don't go to pray we miss prayers Haram is involved when we start to fight and curse one another over a game I did this you should have done this Haram is involved when there is hatred when there is grudges Haram is involved when you start to cheat and lie so that you may win if the game itself is hella no problem if you play poker but on a matches or on paper clips as whatever this is Haram because the concept itself is based on gambling though money is not involved but if it's a general game that you're playing just for the fun of it the essence of it is Helana sha allah as long as it's not consuming our time and pro any preferably that you try to cover the king the Queen and the jack because it has the features of a face if possible if not then I see no problem in sha and sha Allah"
