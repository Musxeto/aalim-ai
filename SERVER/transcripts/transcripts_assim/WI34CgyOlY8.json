  "title": "I joined imam in 1st tashahhud, could not finish it & imam stood up, how to continue assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Alum allum Salam I have this confusion that whenever I join if I ever join the Salah late and I join like when the IM is in the first and then by the time I get down then after like two or three seconds he goes up am I supposed to like go up with him because then I'll be omitting a waj act like intentionally the whole the whole ra is omitted wasn't it is it valid no so it's no problem if you just sit down for a couple of seconds and you say and he says Allah abbar you move on and move on normally because at the end of the day you're going to make up two raas afterwards regardless whether you finished your tah or you didn't so don't worry about this"
