  "transcript": "now joining us through zoom from the holy lands from mecca our honorable brother and friend dr muhammad s a blessed event for you and your honorable family and the whole muslim ummah muhammad sheikh muhammad to you and to your viewers it is always good to hear from you i mean you are making the screen of uh zad illuminating masha allah with your kind and and beautiful face and alhamdulillah we're blessed to have you with us to share with us in the coming five minutes uh because we have a live show unfortunately it's not sufficient we need more time with you and the honorable guests before you to express some of the wisdom that you have about the aid the jubilation and happiness and some of the messages you would like to deliver so the floor is yours if we look into the term it comes to crown always an act of worship a great act of worship so we have two aids annually crowns the great act of hajj and abel it is to celebrate breaking our fast after completing a beautiful course of fasting and not only fasting and not only of praying and giving any charity but also upholding the ties of kinship getting closer and closer to allah remitting loads and loads of our sins so it comes as a gift from the almighty allah and if we look into the ayah ayah number 185 chapter number two in which the almighty allah says and then he says if one is sick if one if troubling then you simply skip fasting because of or due to sickness due to troubling provided but you will have to make up those days after ramadan when you recover when you become a resident and then he says well he took me lulu is an opportunity to do couple things to glorify the almighty allah for heaven guiding us for this blessing for remitting our sins for bringing us closer and closer to him for increasing the level of our iman for granting us this great gift of enabling us to pass during the months of ramadan in addition to rewarding us this magnificent word of the gate of and on every single night of it allah almighty have released many many of his servants from hellfire we asked almighty allah to be among them so in order [Music] so this is one of the means of being grateful to allah to celebrate aid the way that he wanted us to celebrate him to thank him by obeying him he does not mean by any means that hey it is over fasting is over good deeds are over and now it is time to break our fast and our covenant with allah and to be on the rules no after 30 days now we have tasted the sweetness of iman now we have tasted the beauty of abstaining from sins you broken the handcuffs and the chains that they were chaining you of sinning of sitting before the screen watching what allah is forbidding of wasting your time unnecessarily chit-chatting and vain talk no time our life span is very limited and we need to acquire as much possible as kind of as we can of the good needs in order to be eligible on the day of judgment heavy in order to enjoy the present life in paradise because of that if someone and i'm not being advocate of the devil but if someone says come on for 30 days i've been locked in my masjid fasting reading the quran and now you say read is a day of jubilation and happiness where is the happiness you're still telling me to confine myself is is this true we don't have happiness i can assure you unfortunately whoever utters this statement has not yet benefited with the 30 days course those who have benefited of the month of ramadan they would wish and they would love that ramadan will continue forever because it restrained us from sinning and it restrained us and it broke us loose from the chains of waste in our lifetime addiction exactly addiction of whatever sort of addiction and also a lot of friends and family members whom we have not been talking to ramadan was the opportunity to uphold the ties of kinship and the friendship and so on so it's so it's all beautiful so allah doesn't say that um you know you don't have the right to have fun or laugh or enjoy your life as a matter of fact from the sunnah we know that the prophet sallallahu salaam used to save a beautiful white house especially for the one so it is highly recommended to wear the best of your clothes and toward the best of your perfume and to distribute the aid gifts and exchange gifts pick up the phone if relatives and friends are not nearby and wish them a happy and blessed you know one of the beautiful traditions in in in the eighth prayer shaykh hasan is that you go from one root and when you come back walking you take a different route why in order to meet a larger number of people as many people as possible so that you wish each other what happy and blessed and may allah accept our fasting it is an invitation to reconnect to reconcile and to crown our fasting and our worship with the greatest means of being grateful to allah by saying practically not just verbally thank you allah for giving us this opportunity it's not us it is not an opportunity to send and get lose from goodness into evil god forbid so halal entertainment halal entertainment is in the day of eight and it is also halal during ramadan not only in the eid but what i mean is enjoy your life in briefly i know your time is very short and you're running out of time if we scrutinize the quran from cover to cover how many times allah said it is haram it has been made forbidden it is forbidden a few times everything in life is permissible except a handful of things pertaining to eat and food consumption pertaining to sexual relations you know enjoy uh getting intimate with your spouse or spouses with regards to earning uh every business transaction is beautifully lawful except do not deal with usually do not steal do not achieve people and so on so life is beautiful life is lawful and the prophet sallallahu alaihi and his companions did indeed enjoy it as it should be and as i said we will not give you your due right in five minutes we need at least an hour to get these pearls of wisdoms of you pleasure but and it's always nice to see you healthy and i pray to allah azzawajal that you he keeps you your mother and your honorable family all safe and sound and healthy to worship him to obey him and to get closer to him until the day we die may allah azzawajal make this read a joyful event for the whole ummah of islam and an honorable event for all of us allah"
