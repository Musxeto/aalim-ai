  "title": "EP. 1 Dealing With Mistakes - The Prophetic Way || assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] can [Music] ald dear brothers and sisters in Islam and welcome to this new program of the prophetic ways of dealing with mistakes and this would be our daily program during the month of Ramadan of 1445 Hijra 2024 with the grace of Allah asael with the exception of Friday inshallah till the last 10 days or nights of Ramadan where we will take the first half dedicated to the program's material and the second half or what remains dedicated to your phone calls uh like usual in askel first of all why are we dealing with this topic this topic deals with human nature because sins mistakes errors are something that human humans are created upon the prophet said in an authentic Hadith every son of Adam is prone to error to mistake to sin and the best of those who ER are those who repent now we as Muslims fail miserably in a lot of cases when dealing with those who fall into error and mistakes and sins some of us fail to forbid evil we fail to correct people's mistakes when we see them and we live with it as nothing has changed or happened no harm is done I'm not forced to enjoy virtue and righteousness and forbid evil and vice I don't have to this is freedom of others this is their own personal affairs I should not intervene or have a say in it and this is a huge mistake because it is part of our Im so it's it's an issue of a if you don't have it in you your Iman is false and the prophet indicated and showed us the way when he said sallallah alai wasam whoever among you sees an evil action let him change it with his hand meaning by taking action so if you're a person of authority you are a ruler you are a Muslim judge you are a policeman you're a boss you're a father you're a husband do you have authority over those who are below you you must take action if he cannot then with his tongue you have to change this evil with your tongue meaning by speaking out and if he cannot then with his heart by at least hating it and resenting it and believing that it's strong and that is the weakest of faith and this was narrated by IM Muslim in theah what does this mean it means that this is part of of your Iman and we know that Iman is 60 plus branches where the highest and the most elevated is ill and the lowest is removing harmful things from people's way so in order to fulfill these branches of Iman you have to have this in you the ability to change what is wrong what is evil what isar now some do not say anything some say everything so they're like the religious police no one passes in front of them without telling them don't do this or do that as if they are in their ey Towers controlling people with their wand this is wrong and if you add to this a rude behavior and arrogance and not being diplomatic you do have a problem some of these enthusiastics may do these things out of their sincerity so they think not paying attention to a person's ignorance may he may not be knowledgeable of the ruling not paying attention to the person's age he might be a youngster or he might be an elder to you he might be a parent and you're speaking to them in such a rude fashion thinking that you have the knowledge you have the power to say whatever crosses your mind not being able to differentiate whether they've done this out of human nature and weakness at a time when they were vulnerable or they've done it out of defiance and arrogance and the likes and this is something we will inshallah come to discuss in later times as we progress in this series and such rudess such negative attitude from people who think that they have the ability and the right to control others made people repel against and away from Islam they made them hate what they're preaching even they're if they're saying we're salais we're this we're that no you're not salais you're super super copies you've not let any Rock unturned you've not let any scholar or di alone you're like fly eyes falling on dirt not seeing the bigger picture the better in people's behaviors the attitudes the positivity in them this made people hate salafia this made people hate Sunnah because you're pushing it Way Beyond the boundaries you're not able to differentiate between a b that takes someone out of the fold of Islam like for example the of and a b of something that's disputed among Scholars like using using the prayer beads and you're using the same Al artillery to attack and they're not the same but this is what you think oh he's he's this I'm going to boy cut them I'm not going to talk to them I'm going to tarnish their reputation Wherever I Go and all what comes out of their mouth is not getting people closer to Allah rather getting people away from Islam this is not the right way of doing it and it's something we could sit and talk and dispute upon for hours however as Muslims we always refer back to the Quran and to the Sunnah and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam used to frequently inaugurate his speeches when addressing huge Gatherings such as in the eids in the jumas and the Fridays and and the likes he used to say the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam and no muslim argues about this no muslim would say ah but I beg to differ because he would not be a Muslim if he thinks that anyone's guidance is equivalent or better than the guidance of Muhammad sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam our Prophet no muslim would dare say this though millions are actually believing in this and implementing it in their lives but they they're not not say it and speak it so the guidance of Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam our Prophet is the best of guidance without any doubt why because the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam is supported by Allah the prophet's rhetorics and actions are controlled and supervised by Revelation from Allah asael if they were sound and correct then so be it if the prophet made a mistake Allah would fix it and correct it on the spot as he does not utter a thing from his own whims and desires rather it is a revelation from Allah Asel therefore the methods of the Prophet Alat wasam are the wisest his methods are the most successful and when used most likely the people would respond positively to it why because it is the methods of the Prophet Alat whom Allah ordered us to take him as a role model and to follow his methods and ways in life and if we do this with the correct intention we will be also rewarded for it so it's a win-win both ways people will adhere people will learn and accept and you will be rewarded at the sight of Allah now it's worth noting that when you dive in the Sunnah of the Prophet Alat was and reap the fruits from all these trees in the garden of the Sunnah you will find that he used different methodologies and ways and this means that it's not one size that fits all sometimes the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was soft and easygoing as in the case of the person who urinated in the Masjid the way he asked his companions to stop and not to interfere until the man is over with what he's doing although it's in the middle of the Masjid and the way he spoke to him afterwards in a very kind and diplomatic and fatherly way in cont contr with how he dealt with his own companions such as Abu may Allah be pleased with him when he in in a fight in Rage said to bil the Abyssinian while he was fighting with him he could not control his emotions and he said your mother is black this is racism and this racist comment did not go unnoticed the prophet said you are a man of ignorance and Abu was among the first to embrace Islam in the history of Islam and he said oh prophet of Allah after this age and I'm a person of ignorance he said yes due to your racist comment when he saw a man wearing a golden ring he was outraged and he went to him snatched the ring out of his finger and tossed it away and said why would any one of you go to a stone of fire and place it in his hand and left now compare this to this you'd find that there are reasons and only Scholars and people of wisdom and knowledge can differentiate when to use this method of advising people person urinating in the Masjid and when to use such harsh words like he said to Abdullah may Allah be pleased with them when he came once with clothes that were dyed in yellow and zaffron yellow or orange and this was one of the characteristics of the idol worshippers this is solely for them to wear but being a a youngster and thought that this looked hip so he wore these and went to meet the prophet Alam the prophet did not say to him what are you doing my son this is wrong no he said did your mother order you to wear these clothes and that was really aggressive but it was due to a wisdom and a purpose coming from the prophet Alat we know that sometimes you have to be this aggressive you have to be blunt and straightforward and sometimes you have to beat around the bush you have to be diplomatic you have to say few things that may help help those you're trying to give advice and to correct their mistakes so this is up to your isad and isad doesn't come out of thin air it comes from looking into the Sunnah weighing the pros and the cons trying to figure out the circumstances and whether it's fits the scenario you're approaching or you should use another uh uh approach and this only is given to those who have knowledge who have wisdom those who have an understanding so that they can match things together and be able to know what is most likely to to be used here and most likely to be used there now there would be a number of guidelines and points that we should pay attention to but probably we would delay this inshallah till tomorrow and we will have a short break and afterwards we will take your live questions inshallah as usual so stay tuned the"
