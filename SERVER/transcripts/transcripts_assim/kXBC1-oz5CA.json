  "title": "How to wash the EARS in Wudu, do we wipe the inside and outside",
  "transcript": "Tezwar from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Barakatuhu My friend had a question regarding Wudu. He said could you show a demonstration on how to wash the ears the most minimal way possible? Like is it okay if we just wash our ears by inserting the finger inside the hole or do we have to wipe the outside as well? Jazak Allahu Khair It is not washing Akhi, it is wiping. So whatever counts as wiping does the job. And most people do this. They bring the index finger and they put it in their inner ear and their thumb is outside. And they do this. That's it. This is how you go. You inside, round and down and that's it. You don't have to complicate things. SubhanAllah, I've said this before that the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam told us that there is a designated shaytan whose job is to mess up with your head with issues of Tahara, of Wudu, of Ghusl and the likes. And the Prophet even went on to say his name is Al-Walhan and he's doing a good job. When people talk about little things that are so negligible and nobody cares about, they say no, no Shaykh, do I have to wash my eyebrows? Yeah and bring a brush and come and put some conditioner on it. What is this? Just wash your face and move on Akhi. No need to do this with your eyebrows or at the tip of your nose or the corner of your eyes. All of this is a can of worms that you open and then you're complaining of the worms that you're having."
