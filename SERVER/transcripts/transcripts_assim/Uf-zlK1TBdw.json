  "transcript": "- love mother Haman handleable and sallallaahu Salaam Baalak arrived in Rasul al-amin nabina muhammad in wada adding he was happy oh man today we had he was an opportunity he in a young Dean and my bad we begin inshallah with the remaining fourth school which is the school of Imam Muhammad bin Mohamad even humble as a bunny may Allah has have mercy on him and on all of the four Imams of the great schools of thought now Imam Ahmed is like all the other imams pious righteous had a lot of knowledge and a lot this came down I don't know a lot and he had a lot of piety in him but before we go into talking about this great Imam his name was Ahmed bin Mohammed even humble as a bunny some of them considered or disputed whether he was an Arab or an an Arab but definitely without any doubt to anyone who knows in lineages that he was a pure bred Arab he may Allah have mercy on him was from the tribe of Shaban and that was in Iraq he was born there and as many great of our scholars he was brought up by his mother his father died when he was young and unfortunately he was brought up as an orphan he wasn't at all rich but he wasn't at the same time stone broke he had just enough and this is one of the signs of nobility when a child grows up undistracted by the wealth by the power by everything else he grows up to be more focused and this is why our children are not focused they spend so much time on video games on football on things that distract them and when you ask them to memorize a song they will pick it up in the first time they hear it but if you give them a chapter of the Quran and ask them to memorize it they would find it one of the most difficult tasks to do when was a ma'am IMed born I told you this before 164 HP and he died in the year 241 the noticeable thing so halala maybe this has no significance but it may any draw someone's attention to the fact that he was born in the month of Revere Darwin like who like the prophet prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and died on the 12th of Rabi I'll I would like the Prophet is awesome so this is a coincidence it has no significance not nothing at all but it is good to know about it by imam ahmed even humble was known to be among those who were pious and righteous and of the law heaven and his son says that my father used to pray every single day 300 raka and this is what this is voluntary prayers and the Salif this was well known about them no one dares to say hey this is a beta what do you mean by bitter he said the Prophet our son did not pray as much yes but the Prophet did not deny us from praying as much soul Allah are your Salam if you look at the way that the Companions used to pray you will be shocked because they the Companions used to pray as much of the lognormal used to pray so long prayers and this is not an innovation why because there is something that is restricted to the better you may not add or delay or delete but there is an open door for ibadah for you to pick as much as you wish so if I for example would like to spend my time from now door saying some handle of the Handy is there any problem with that no process no bid no it's not bitter there is something that is restricted the Prophet had never done a little officer so I cannot say after prayers to Allah who I had 12 times specifying the surah specifying the number without any reference one says the sky is the limit is it yes but when you put a number and you designate the position then you are in an in a bidder but if from now until moderate I would like to say Allah muscle the ala muhammadin wa ala ala muhammad i don't count million time no any problem no problem the sky's the limit therefore you do not come and say that a man I met used to pray 300 and this is wrong this is too so much no it's not his son Abdullah says when he was sick he was tired he used to pray 150 now compare apples to apple how many times do o do we miss not per month but per week the Sunnah that was Sunnah whoever preserves 12 Sunnah what will happen to him Allah will build him a house in Genda how many times do you miss it per week there's a problem if this is his habit when doing it in such a fashion and it's not part of the recommended shouldna rather it is part of malice I'm talking and not concentrating so if you don't understand what I'm saying that's good because I don't understand what I'm saying I mean to get connected but I will assure Allah eventually reach their hot spot on even the house what is not there you got a number [Music] okay now song okay where were we okay what else I'm not said whatever hadith I wrote I have acted oh look this is also one part of his pious piety being pious allah azzawajal says in surah the soft limit hakuna matata father why do you preach what you do not act upon imam ahmed part of his vast knowledge is that he used to walk the talk he said every single hadith i wrote i acted upon this is difficult when you come come to talk about it in our level what about someone who memorizes approximately a million hadith a thousand thousand hadith like him a madman he said every single thing I acted upon except one hadith which the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam said it was narrated that the prophet performed copy you know hey Gemma and he gave a whoop aibi the one demand the companion who performed hajima one dinner so I decided to act upon it I performed a JAMA and I gave the man one dinner one dinar is equivalent to what you can buy a ram a sheep in the hadith of the Prophet gave one of the companions one dinner I told him to go and buy a cheap a sheep so he bought a sheep on his way back a man told him Allah this is a big fat sheep you want to sell it he said yes how much to dinner so he sold it for to dinner went back to the market bought a sheep for one dinner and came to the Prophet as some with one dinar one sheep so the Prophet gave him the dinner dinner is back and the ship is a bonus so the Prophet Allah sosam asked Allah for barakah in his transactions the companion state we saw this man while live he sold sad he would have made profit in it because of the Baraka of the Torah of the prophet salallahu alayhi wa aalihi wasallam okay it's not opening again okay abadeer said as Jeffrey told us I met is an imam in eight qualities imam in the hadith imam and jurisprudence fell in I mean language mmm or an imam in poverty Imam in Zoot diamond piety Imam in Sunna meaning that the hamish a free is praising the Mamet not to have been among those who teach learn preach in order to gain money if you look at his biography you will find out that he was among the least interested in dunya he would not get involved in disputes or he would not get involved in acquiring a position Imam Shafi himself told him that there is an opening position for a judge you know the judge has Authority the list is that people come and bring you food bring you gifts bring you things as former bride Imam Ahmed said to Imam Shafi if you ever repeat such a request to me you will never see my face asking me to be appointed in a government position this is a heinous request coming from you I tolerate it once next time I will not meet you I will not talk to you now Balarama says Abu Saleh and he's one of the great Imams of hadith told me your father memorizes a million hadith a thousand thousand hadith it was said to him how do you know he said I reviewed with him once and I took them from the different sections meaning that he acquired knowledge at the hands of imam ahmed and he learned from him the different chapters of hamas women Baraka and he learned from him the different chapters that the the hadith are compiled upon and he counted it and it was almost a thousand thousand hadith now a question would rise how is it possible that there are a million hadith while we hardly have ten fifty or fifteen thousand hadith authentic and fabricated the old scholars of hadith when they memorized in name al-ahmad of india true this is one matin they memorized it with 50 to 100 different hadees' narration chain of narrators and this is why when an imam and imam al Buhari came from bahara and to birth that into a lyric when he came they wanted to make a test to him they said well though he heard so much about this scholar of of bahara and we would like to give a test for him what did they do they selected 10 men and with each man they gave him 10 hadeeth so the total of what 100 hadeeth each hadeeth has a chain of narrators and imagine the text itself but they mixed it up so they changed this one here and it's like an aerobic cube huh so they change it and when the imam came he sat of course he was young but he was an imam he wasn't any high person and talking and doing things that he's not supposed to do so each one of them said imam i have a question about a hadith hadith number one he gave the chain of narrator with a different senate with a different method so they mum said I don't know this the second hadith felt hadith tenth hadith and every hadith he said I don't know it so the men sat another one stood up and the same process and the man just simply says I don't know so the people were disputing the scholars said someone who said well lad the guy is smart he triggered it out but it doesn't show on his face this is what we call pokerface it doesn't show he's not smiling he says yeah yeah I know I know he was adamant the others say no no this guy has nothing he doesn't have knowledge after the tenth finished he said you true he said yes said as for number one his first hadith is sown so on so he repeated the wrong narration to memorize the good narration is normal but to memorize it once though wrong and he corrected him by fixing this one with that one with this one until he solved it after that incident everybody said tell us he is a man we know we do not dispute we do not test him so a mama didn't have memorized a thousand thousand hadith and he was older than remember honey remember Holly came to the man I met just to show you the caliber of a ma'am I met a man Buhari came to him and showed him the side and told him this is what I have compiled and he gave him some advice and some corrections according to his knowledge may Allah have mercy upon them all okay what else Abdul Razak who is at the reserve do you know see our problem is that we are limited to different or certain types of books Masson enough have the Lud's up is one of the trusted books of hadith what value does it have over the other books of hadith like judge Medina say that it has the narrations of the companions a lot what we know as al-assad and you cannot acquire shock simply but by reading Quran and Sunnah and that's it no you have to understand the Quran and Sunnah how through the understanding of the self so when I why do I get the companions narrations the Tiberian narrations turbidity every narrations from muslim hassan abdul razak from sunday evening i be shaper Musa directly mom said I can hack him etcetera these books contain a lot of these narrations so Abdullah was one of the great Imams in Yemen and he says that I have never seen anyone or any person more or learning in jurisprudence north pious normal pious than a madam in Hamburg of course how the result is one of the shape because anyone you learn hadith from his your dialect shift so he was one of the shoe of Imam Muhammad the advantage of a Muhammad upon the three previous Imams is that he did not leave a place without traveling - when he started acquiring hadith he was sixteen years of age he stayed with his Imam in Balad for four years until he took everything that Imam had then he was allowed to travel now bear in mind that he started travelling when he was 20 he went he was in Kufa mother he went 12 Basra he went to a sham he went to Egypt he went to al-haj as mccann Medina and he went to Yemen and the rose up was in Yemen he met him in Mecca during the high season and with him was the marine one of the great Imams of hadith they were always together one of the funny stories was that Imam I am the marine animal magnet were traveling and they passed by a gathering circle of knowledge at their time there were a lot of storytellers who would just sit yet not know what's up no Twitter no Facebook so this was the social media they sit and the guy says and so-and-so happened and the Hellfire came and the Angels did listen all of these are what fabrications but people enjoy listening to tales so imam ahmed hmmm yeah yeah came and saw this storyteller saying that and I might even humble and your heavy marine told me that the Prophet said Ali some songs also and they told me that the German is description so so and they told me but humbly I have made and each one is looking did you tell him no I've never met him so after the class was over and everybody but you went out i'ma do me a hamburger hey man I went to the man Salaam aleikum walekum sir hey my name is Ahmed humble and this man is a Marine and you're reporting things that you've heard from us so where did you get it from and look at the audacity of such people he left in sarcasm from the message do you think you are the only I didn't humbly I hadn't trained the world and he left so yeah yeah even when he was with great I've a Mac Mac they were all great compilers of hadith in Hajj they were fortunate to meet have the result so ahem the Marines said this is Ahmed in Hamburg so I'm the Razak started to say may Allah bless you I have heard so many good things of you I pray to Allah that he make you steadfast and encase you in knowledge Imam so yeah yeah I said ok can we come tomorrow here in Makkah and hear the hadith from you said yes the shaman after he left Ahmed was angry this is why did you say that he said why not this is what we were traveling to Yemen one month travel one month journey the guy is here in my cup said no by Allah I will not accept this I went from Baghdad with my intention to travel and to spend money and to put effort into learning the hadith of the Prophet Ursula I would not compromise this adjure it's easy it's coming to me no I will travel and he refused to listen from him until he went and traveled all the way to sana to Yemen to learn from him this is how they put so much effort in learning it's not like what we do nowadays we want something share well three hours is a lot can you make it in five minutes Jenny o samurais samurais I can't make it today I have to go take my kids do they have a football match but I'll come at 1 o'clock can you give it to me in a nutshell inshallah this is not the way of acquiring knowledge humbleness dedication patience tolerance and travel you have to put some effort in order because this knowledge if you give it all of yourself it will give you a little of it knowledge if you give it all yourself all your money all your time it will give you very little of it so you have to dedicate more and more so who did Imam Ahmed start to learn from Abu Yussef he learned from Abu Yusuf the student of kahani fur mmm Abu Hanifah Muhammad Hassan is Shabani and Abu Youssef el badi both were prominent Imams of the times and Associates of imam abu hanifa so he began to learn from him so he took the fill of abu hanifa his great friend and contemporary Imam Imam Shafi he learned from him and from Imam Shafi who learned from him and Malik so he managed to gather all the fill of the previous three schools of thought and measured with his own when did he start to teach and become an imam when he was 40 years of age because the 20 years was spent in collecting and traveling and learning and when he was 40 his fame was all over the world so people came from all over the world to learn from him Imam in New Jersey he is different than even opium even though I am is a student of Athenian but even all Josie he is a one of the scholars of the fourth century he's humble and he says that his classes were attended by 5000 people 500 of them only wrote the hadith that he was narrating 4500 came only to learn from his moral conduct and his ethics and the way he speaks nowadays one of the most or one of the greatest things that we lack is when we learn from the Sheikh his generosity Yama lunch is on me today they learn from him his generosity they learn from him his tolerance they learn from him his politeness the way he dresses the way he walks we lack this nowadays we do not find this nowadays we would like to have scholars that would teach us I remember I'm stalling for time I don't have materials oh no I'm joking we haven't shot enough when I used to call Shipman bass I told you the city he had two telephones only with no no multiple lines only two telephones and he used to sit in his office in Riyadh between mother Manisha be at time so I used to call him Rita Rita Rita until it connects his assistant raises the phone while I can hear him talking to the other person so he answers him regardless of the answer now by the time he gives the assistant the telephone and he picks up the second call we'll law he in these few seconds I can hear him say [Music] now he utilizes the time between calls to make what to make Vicki now I've learned this from the shake I remember that when I used to go from one place to the other I used to whistle I used to sing a song you know songs that are so many centuries ago shape and remind you of them you hear one word all of a sudden you continue to complete the whole thing what is this whatever I wanted to do something I remember she would mess dress it no sir Pamela have dela but it's more rewarding let me do this so this is what you learn from real Adama that you learn from the way they speak if you go to a sheikh and he is impulsive he is rude he's abusive if someone asks him a question said who are you to ask me a question look at the are you stupid and he makes fun of him what will you learn you learn the same attitude if you sit with a share all what he does is yeah there is also he is an innovator he doesn't understand anything he doesn't have knowledge he does corrupt rápida and he just keeps on slaughtering mohammed abdullah ali ahmed everyone he knows ok they're all bad who's a good scholar I don't know about the boots cause what you have to look and you will find the mashaallah may be close to you do you learn from such - it is problematic people attended a Mamet's class because they learned from him and don't get me wrong even Imam Shafi Imam Malik Imam Abu Hanifa they were all the same but he was more prominent because he is closer to our times those times they were focusing only on really him a time they were focusing on 360 degrees everything Israeli ok I used a scholar he was knowledgeable and he was pious he's Allah at the top did he mix with the government did he have a land gift or money coming from you know the government sponsoring him because this is also and they tell us he would not accept one dirham from the ruler to the extent that his son Saleh he heard that he accepted a gift from the halifa he refused to enter his house till he died he said no I will not eat at your house you eat from the khalifa' khalifa' man and money is haram it's all taking from the people is taxations etc and he refused so when you come to look at him you'll find that he was what a real imam now historians say that allah azza wajal granted victory to Islam through two men one Abu Bakr when the Prophet died that is salatu salam and all the tribes apostatized and he's the only one who stood in their face and he fought them until restored Islam and Imam Ahmed when the fitna of Demirtas Allah and the mark says Allah are those who came and started to talk with philosophy about the attributes of Allah so they refused to say that the Quran is Karim Allah is the attribute of Allah they say no it is created it is Muslim and this means that you are saying something about allah azzawajal beautiful attributes that contradicts with the belief of additional jamar the vast majority of people conceded and I talked about scholars because either this or the sort accept Mohammed Amin notion and I met him in Hamburg Hamilton or was executed beaten until he died I am Adam in Hamburg was imprisoned it was tortured was flogged two plus years three rulers of the Abbasid era or doula or a lil moon al worship and then what dozen or more possum analogic three of them continued to have this harsh judgment on him until the worship and after a few years a large L granted in media and he took him out he elevated other Sunnah and he made the whole thing wrecked being rectified alhamdulillah as Virgil now Alabama sure free we spoke about that okay Shakalaka a big thing here John do you think it's like a locket I sent for a collage even then you are in the wrong place [Laughter] so Alabama shock very used to address email I've met look at the humbleness of Imam Shafi him Emma Hadees younger and was one of his students yet he acknowledges that his knowledge in Sunnah is far greater than among Schaffer so he says imam muhammad if ever you get a hadith that is authentic with you please update me so that we can refer to it and this is the methodology of all Imams that the hadith is the corner point that they depend on it's not something that a hadith nowadays you talk to students of knowledge and you tell them the Prophet says as I've said they they'll do this which shows you that such a person you cannot learn from any person who does not have full respect to a single hadith of the Prophet as Salam any person who mocks or ridicules the one single hadith of the Prophet Elisha Sarah well I I would even hesitate to make fun of an a weak hadith I would hesitate why because he may be my knowledge is not that strong maybe after a week or two I discovered it is an authentic hadith how would I feel always have this great respect for the hadith of the Prophet a son because this respect means that you're respecting the Prophet himself all a source of not few words but you're respecting the Prophet through that by when we come to the history of the humble school of thought again we have three stages the beginning the expansion era and the settlement era one would say that why do we have these stages okay first of all the four Imams had the beginning has a start where the Imam even wrote a book like in the case of mmmm Malik or the contemporary wrote his fat was his verdicts was collected but this was not a full-fledged men have yet so those who came in the expansion era started to expand so they come to the photo of the eminences okay the common denominator between all of his fat was is that we should follow the following procedure in order to reach a verdict rope and a femur hub has different procedure than the shaft and the Maliki than the Homburg and then you have the settlement era and then the settlement era these are the late scholars who have everything in front of them so they start to filter the books and they put the methodology of the map that is followed until date the date of the settlement era and what comes after it now we have books and these books depend some of them are concise in size so they don't give you more than one opinion and this is the met hub so it tells you pájaro water if it is changed in smell taste or color then it is path if it's changed with a pure substance it is power meaning that you cannot perform Moodle with it it's not parole now this is they say that this is the mecca for example there are other books which would expand a little bit insane no there are two opinions in the matter of ahima tip number one it is power on  when it is started only and they write this for you then you have the third and most widely accepted is the books that deal with the different schools of thought janna for example in your math hub in your shaft EMF have one of the biggest and and well-known encyclopedias is and much more sure helm has that this was written by Lee mam and never we and it's almost this big I have it in my I used to have it in my book shop it's so big so huge and when you read it you find crazy things mmm no away yeah and he died when he was like 36 years of age or 40 maybe no I don't think I don't know yeah he's was and he wasn't married by the way like a man he wasn't married but he compiled so many books in a Freeman hub among them is min hazard poly be min hazard father be now Imam and Noah we was in the first settlement era because there was a second a settlement era but among the first was Imam and now we he wrote Manhattan poly beam which was explained by the Shaffer scholars in so many titles and he himself explained it in row total poly beam of his own but when you come to see you find out that the late scholars of the map are the one who settled it and he they channeled it so that you can learn and this is why we have these books Imam Muhammad never wrote a book of his own then you have the students who compiled his Messiah in the problems that he used to face so one comes shed if a person has four wives he divorced one of them and she is in Rinda can he marry so this is a mess Allah can he marry no because he still married to for this one who he divorced is still his wife he can reconcile if he dies she will inherit so he cannot marry because he would be marrying a fifth and this is what masala one problem so they compiled it among them was Al Hilal volum hala al Haram al hasan ham and all of these different names where we have inshallah we don't need to go into details with them by the way I'm not answering what's up I'm just seeing the schedule 10:30 to 10:40 break is 1040a or 1040 although it's a long time we move on to the issue of following a mess up now we have a big problem among the students of knowledge we have people that say as you find in page 23 that it is mandatory for you to follow one single map and on the opposite side we find people saying that it is totally prohibited for you to follow a map and in between the vast majority of scholars say that it is permissible so what is our stance where do we stand when it comes to schools of thought first of all condemning prejudice and keeping alliances accordingly is among the consensus of all scholars of Islam now these are the things on page 22 these are the consensus of scholars what do we mean all scholars of all different schools of thought again that you must not keep allegiance to a person just because he's humble and you're hungry no this is something that is abort this is something that is not acceptable because then it is not on the Quran one and the sooner I keep my allegiance because of Allah he is a chakra like me so we are brothers we we have strong and I keep admitting with him because he's a heretic and this was the only prevailing in the past centuries in Hallam Mecca the Masjid al-haram they used to have four member one for Japanese people to pray one for Hanafi one for Maliki one for humbly not only that hanafis and Shafi race had long disputes to the extent that it was prohibited to marry from one another they would not marry then as if it's a different religion the consensus of scholars that this is not acceptable so we have to believe this now now I'm not talking about issues of dispute I'm talking about the consensus of scholars number two accepting all four schools of thought and accepting it books meaning that nowadays when we hear calls from so-called students of knowledge saying that we have to burn all the books of the met have some of them come with to effect hell body of a man with a half of them and had job and they burn it they come to the books of a mutiny Oh am i Adama they burn and they say this causes drift and confusion among the Muslims we don't want this no this is not true we accept all four schools of thought and here you can illustrate your knowledge and tolerance meaning I I see and believe few things that are mandatory in my opinion yet a Jolliffe has different opinion either he accepts mine or I leave him no as long as he's following a book that is authentic a meth lab that is accepted Hamas if he is a Hanafi and he decides to put his hand under his belly in salat and I believe that I have to put it on the chest according to my mother have according to the hadith so would I feel a little bit drawn away even if I don't say it but he doesn't follow this no this is his belief this is his conviction I had a debate with Amina Bilal Philips in Birmingham about the was it's a lot no salaam yeah pops alot he says that whoever abandoned salat is not a kafir I believe he's a kafir so would I not eat with him or speak with him because he's different opinion I had another debate with everyone abou Osama regarding the hub I believe that it is a must so when I see a woman with not wedding Bennett pub would I accuse her or would I say she is not worthy no she believes in it she has a belief of her own I respect that I would not judge people because of what I believe unless it's black and white if some of I believe that going to soothsayers and fortune tellers is and one goes there and I said well I respect your this is I don't expect it but if it's a difference of opinion ash a fairy says that if you touch a woman even if your wife you make wudu they lose a lot of water this is his opinion I the rest of the schools of thought say no the Prophet used to kiss his wife and goes to pray with a poodle so I respect we as part of our knowledge respect other people's own conviction providing it falls under what the four schools of thought but if someone comes this is a share my opinion is that I believe suraj old muta marriage of muta is halal I look into four schools of thought no I understand no Gemara no where did you bring this person a Jeffrey book gyah this is Xena so what I respect you no I'm not respected this is unacceptable sit share but this is his conviction say this is his conviction in the wrong way if his conviction is that stealing my money is halal so I said okay I understand he is my wallet no there are things that are possible to tolerate and there are things that are unacceptable in Islam completely so number three the follower can adopt a different opinion if reach the level of Shahada and this is a issue that would put us in a dilemma why now the issue of HT hat what is this there Oh what is young fatwa no opinion photos you say well no no what does is she had me if the Hat comes from the Arabic world word JUnit which is effort so in fact you will find a lot the usage of HD hat and it means to exert your effort in reaching a verdict so I did my best until I have no more resources hearts I give up then this is usually heart by who's qualified to make each they had this is a big problem because each D had requires tools you have to have different forms abilities Sciences in order to make HD hat would I accept someone who is a Rivard coming and saying to me happy that the fear of this area is wrong Oh what did you find it I said I founded the city with Kathie Lee this is wrong I said ok how do you know I said I studied it it said masha'Allah let's see your average D hat said of course you know Arabic said no do you memorize the Quran he said no have you done any studies in the sciences of the Quran or in the sooner I should know but this doesn't sound logical so uh sound logical this is not HD HUD rest please take a mattress and a pillow put your head and sleep the sleep of a transgressor a transgressor is a bada sleep which Allah will reward you for that rather than they are be awake and give us this nonsense of yours each Nihad has tools and this is why scholars say that the type of HT hat there are three four five seven depending on how you classify it what kind of types are you talking there is what is known as mujtahid Mortlock what is the meaning of what o'clock is any all around you know you have this small Honda it can go in little roads you have the bigger Honda it can go when it's raining and then you have the four-wheel drive a multi-purpose SUV this goes in rocks in sands and so must I tell mullah is the SUV when you come you find that he's perfect and fluent not in Arabic in the sciences of Arabic so now who was soft in lP&L Bela the whole nine yards okay will you come to Quran he doesn't only memorize the Quran he also knows Rigo al-quran he knows possible Atef seal he knows NASA Wellman soo what was abrogated and what was not and he knows everything regarding the tuffsy when you go to hadith the guy memorizes the hadith he knows it you've gone through it so many of the shoes of knowledge will you tell them about psychic Buhari said never read it but I know how to search he's got the computer like myself without computer and nothing if I need it to know hadith I just google it or search for it I find it it says Bukhari Muslim ha it is sigh so tentacle did you see it in Buhari said no no but my laptop says it's ok and this is wrong a mistake the mullah knows this because he explained it he interpreted he memorized it will you come to the guy doesn't study the only one met hub he said it all format hubs and he know the ins and outs and why did they make the mistake and why did they say other than what the other schools of thought say so he has comprehensive knowledge this man does not require to pick up the phone and ask 'what's the ruling on so-and-so because he is the share he is fully equipped to learn from the Quran and the Sunnah so this kind of a booster hit it is accepted for a follower of a school of thought such as alum and knowing this kind of scholar to follow a school of thought while following the evidences meaning that he's an imam in a chef email happy but you can find in his writings that this is what Imam Shafi says but the hadith of the Prophet as salam is different and this is most most authentic yet he is a devout follower of the head of the shattering meta without any doubt he's not like even taymiyah for example event a mia is one of the Souness of the hamburger meta but he is mujtahid mukluks meaning that he follows the principles of imam muhammad has no problem in telling you that this is wrong in in Muhammad's men have and this is right because the Prophet said saw its own so-and-so end of story and he has the qualities of being a rooster hit not block then you have second category which is musta hit mu a yet he is limited and such much the head can be a Magna way because he never goes against Imam Shafi reads schools of thought though he is capable yet he always follows the principles of Imam Shafi and gives you the evidences from the Quran and Sunnah that backs it up or when there is a difference of opinion he gives you the most authentic opinion so he doesn't initiate something from his own then also can be a third category of most ahead Alma Alma yet which is a person who is not capable of giving fatwa or verdicts and everything why due to his I would not say incompetence but due to his lack of knowledge of making him mr. head Matlock yeah and he has little bit in Arabic he has a little bit in a salute of Steel he has a lot in the filter of salat so everything about salat inside out his he knows it do we call him mr. hight MOT luck or no pay yet no we say that he's no paid ensalada so you may and and the vast majority of students of knowledge who graduate from universities if I have a PhD in Sharia this doesn't mean I'm a scholar PhD nowadays is a thesis that you compile right and come up with but it doesn't mean that you are qualified I sit with a lot of PhD holders and they don't know what they're talking about their thesis was in the movement of the finger in salat so they know everything that has to do with moving the finger in the shot for example it's not of course sir it was that easy I was about five they have knowledge in this but if you ask them okay okay a man died leaving a wife a mother one daughter three siblings four grandchildren what is the inheritance I don't know I didn't kill him I didn't ask you until the morning I said how to distribute the inheritors I have no idea now you have PhD Sharia yeah but it was only moving the finger on that man show me which one and I moved the finger and tell you so again it's a thesis but he might be mistake in this branch this person is mr. hit in the rulings of Hajj I come to him any question hatch I know that Schieffelin is excellent I would never ask him about transactions of selling gold and silver or stocks because his knowledge in transactions and and financial issues no good so again you have to classify people and know exactly whether they are worthy of being Hempstead in the madhhab or not and finally it is permissible for a follower of they all agree the consensus of scholars that the permissibility of following the Imam and attribute in rulings to him when convinced he can a mullet what is the meaning of a mullet a follower of MF have this is coming from the now at eppley the doclet means that you imitate so the scholars all agree that and a follower of a map or an imitator cannot give that one because you are not qualified to give fatwa you don't have but you don't possess the knowledge and this is why the vast majority of students of knowledge would always say share heaven best says or imam abu hanifa says they coat the one who gave the fatwa they would not say no this is haram why because the Prophet sits on throne so whose opinion is this is mine but are you mistake no I mullet then you do not have the right to give fatwa you have to attribute the fact worth to the one who said it who is a mistaken who is an imam by himself by hamas ya sheikh we have yellow"
