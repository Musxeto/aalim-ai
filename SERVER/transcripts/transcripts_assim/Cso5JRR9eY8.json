  "transcript": "[Music] so basically let's say you're in taraweeh and obviously normally we do the whole quran in 30 days isn't it so if i have let's say on my phone or if i have a grand muscat with me can i read along the translation if that makes sense while this law is going on okay i will answer inshallah finally abraham from the uk he says when i pray taraweeh throughout the month of ramadan i read the quran from my mobile phone but i also read the translation in english is this permissible the answer is totally prohibited and it invalidates your prayer might as well read the daily mirror what's the difference oh this is a translation translation is not allah's words this is in english and it's someone's understanding and translation and it's not permissible to do this during salat yes if you're not praying and you're reading the quran on your own time and you read the translation side by side this is totally legit without any problem and allah azza knows best you"
