  "transcript": "[Music] H from bahin I want to ask that there are different Reas of Quran like R so how was the revelation of these different types of qurans and if we if one memorizes all the types of rat is the reward more okay I will answer inah Hua from Bangladesh I think I think um he says that the different narrations of the Quran like Etc why are they different and how did they or how were they relieved it's a long story for you how is not an issue because this is none of your concern or mine We Believe number one that the Quran is preserved we believe that this is from Allah we believe that Allah will protect it till the end of time full stop so take all these Whispers out of your head number two the prophet himself says jel gave me the uh the Quran on one so I asked him to increase me and he added one and one and one until he finished seven so we know from the authentic Sunnah that the Quran was revealed on seven which some interpret as dialects and others interpret as different ways of using ITB says it's like saying come on get close come near so it's it's it's the same a proximity of the meaning different words so we believe that when Abu Bakr Omar andman all agreed to compile the Quran and make it into one book they made it on the last which jiel revised the Quran with the prophet Alam in the last year before he died and this is which we have today and all the other six or the other which is 10 are Incorporated in it but the main writing the main calligraphy the main uh uh way of compiling it is on the last and this is preserved and you don't have to dive into it because the changes or the differences are less than a handful so there's no way for non-muslims to come and say oh the Quran has been tampered with or changed no it wasn't compared to any of your scriptures that has thousands of virgins different cont context different chapters different translations there's no similarity none whatsoever this book was revealed 15 centuries ago it Remains the Same as it was revealed with the same language that more than three or 400 million inhabitants of Earth speak today and understand it without any translations"
