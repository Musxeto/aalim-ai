  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Kashmir I just wanted to know that sometimes we do teach \nin front of people so that they may learn from us   for example if I see a person and he does not \nknow that when you stand up from Ruku you have   to say even so if that person is standing by \nmy side so I just read it a bit aloud so that   this person may think that or may ask me about \nthese things or we do many things in front of   people so that they may learn from us will this \nbe considered as a form of Riyya' showing off this depends on your intention and only Allah \nknows your intention if you do something like   reciting a Surah after the Fatiha with the \nintention that the people next to you know   that this is part of the Sunnah or for example \nin the hanafi Masjid and they don't recite the   Fatiha and you recite it a little bit a little \nbit loud so that they acknowledge that you're   reciting the Fatiha they may be intrigued to \nask you afterwards and you can teach them this   is your intention what's your intention to \nshow off most likely not most likely it is   to show people and to teach him that is totally no \nproblem in that and you rewarded for it inshallah and have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford it \nthat's good for you if you cannot you're entitled   for one free session and this is for everybody \nif they can affirm by Allah that they cannot   afford it because they're poor I'll give them \none free session without a problem a full half   an hour so come to me and let's speak about \nit inshallah within the following two days   or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for All"
