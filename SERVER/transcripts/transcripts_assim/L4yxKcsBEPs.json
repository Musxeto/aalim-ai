  "transcript": "okay is ruling on muslim youtubers if they use vocals instead of video in the videos instead of background music with instruments is it okay to use the vocals okay the second question he says when i make videos some people put music in the background others put vocals what is meant by vocals this is what we call nasheed so if we have vocals at the background is this if it's normal vocals that humans do like humming this is one way of doing it humming it sounds nice but with my voice i think nobody's gonna watch this but nevertheless it's humming it's vocals is it halal haram if it is known to be vocals and it does not have the same impact as music like the acapellas this is music you get six eight eight tracks or sixteen tracks of the same person or different people each making a particular sound with the beat with the bass with the whatever and the conclusion is it's the same impact and effect that the normal song had so if someone does an acapella of a billie jean for mj for example and it's the same impact of the song so but there's no musical instruments it's haram there's no musical instruments it has the same impact so this is why sometimes beatboxing would be hara no musical instrument but you have the same beat and you have the same impact of drums etc therefore it becomes haram so normal vocals normal hums humming sounds that do not let or get you the same sensation you have when you're listening to an orchestra or a symphony or the likes there is no problem with that and allah knows better you"
