  "title": "ðŸ†• Can he Audit a financial statement without calculating Riba?ï¿¼ assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Your scholar is Ahnaf from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum. Sheikh, can a person audit the parts of a financial statement that contain interest? He will not be helping the company calculate their interest or documenting it for them. He'll just be checking if they said the truth about their earning from interest, for example. See, the issues with accountants and auditors is very sensitive because if they have to deal with Riba, their job is haram. So if a financial auditor is just revising the financial statements and checking the numbers and coming to a conclusion that this is okay or this is not okay, without having anything to deal with Riba, meaning he would not say, okay, you guys had 10 million dollars in your bank account, which means that you should have received X amount of interest over such a deposit, but I don't see it in the financial. Why? And so they rectify it and correct it and they put it in, no, this is haram. Now you're auditing this or you're saying that you took more than what you deserve or you took less than what you deserve when it comes to Riba, this is not permissible. If you don't have to do this and you have nothing to do with saying that Riba was supposed to be added or was supposed to be given on this particular quarter, in this case, if you don't have to do anything with that, inshallah, there's no problem in that, though I very much doubt that to be the case."
