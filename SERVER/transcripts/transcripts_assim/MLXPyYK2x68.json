  "transcript": "i remember seeing in a clip a video clip of one of the quote unquote prominent da is who was ridiculing this concept after a lecture he delivered in one of the gulf countries a woman approached him with a book and from the way he's talking you can understand that this book is kitabu tau haid written by the imam muhammad abdul wahab so he said i look into this book and i said what is this she said this is a beneficial book you should read it and maybe talk about this subject he said why she said because this is an important book he said why would i talk about something allah did not talk about it in the quran look how ignorance overwhelms people due to their hatred maybe or due to their envy maybe or due to their simply ignorance he thinks that the word tawheed because it's not mentioned in the quran we should not address it and he made the fuzz out of it is everything not mentioned in the quran is rejected in our religion this is the methodology of al-quran yun those who neglect the sunnah ignore it and don't pay attention to it with your concept of thinking i should also reject the jal the antichrist though it is mutawatar everybody knows that it is part of islam and whoever rejects it is an apostate it's not found in the quran and the list goes on and on and on we believe in the sunnah as well as the quran and we believe that the prophet's teachings alaihis wasalam came to explain and to complete and to specify what was general in the quran so to come easily and cross out tahit because you don't find the word and what is the hate a lot of the people are ignorant of the meaning of ash so when you tell them what is the meaning of that they say there is no god except allah that's it if you go to the quran you would find that the concept of tawheed is far greater than this definition because the heed is to believe in the oneness of allah azzawajal and by the way for those who claim that the tawheed is a phrase or a word that is not found in the quran and the sunnah this only shows their ignorance to heed the origin of the word is found in sahih al-bukhari tawheed is the first thing that the prophet allah used to order his messengers to deliver in the hadith of the jabal in sahara bukhari the prophet salallahu sent him to yemen and he told him that you shall come to the people of the book jews and christians and he said to him let it be the first thing you call them true is to believe in the oneness of allah in arabic fallacy this is"
