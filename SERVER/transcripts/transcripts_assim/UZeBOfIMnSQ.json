  "transcript": "Fazil from Kashmir Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Walaikumussalam Sheikh I have heard that one day the Kaaba will Tawaf Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam. Is this authentic? One day what? Kaaba, Kaaba Yes Will Tawaf the Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam I don't understand. I know the Kaaba. I know the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam. I don't understand the question. Are you asking me that one day Prophet Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam will do Tawaf in the Kaaba? Oh the Kaaba itself will do Tawaf around the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam Let me ask you this. Do you think this is logical? Come on Akhi. So don't ever repeat things you hear unless you hear them from trusted ulema, scholars. Or you read it in trusted books of religion. There is tons of misinformation or as our friend says, fake news. Spreading all over the internet, social media. And the enemies of Islam are trying to undermine it by such false information. So Akhi, don't pay attention. Take your religion, not from TikTok, not from YouTube and Facebook or Twitter. Take your religion from trusted scholars of Islam. From trusted sources of Quran, Tafsir, Hadith, Fiqh, etc. This is how you learn your religion and Allah knows best."
