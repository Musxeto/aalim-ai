  "title": "Going out with my female relatives who don't cover themselves",
  "transcript": "meanwhile we have a few emails Omar Ahmed says I want to know what's the ruling on a man in public with his female mams and they do not abide by the hijab but the man is encouraging them to wear it yet they still don't and won't listen to him is this okay first of all it is not permissible for a woman to to go out in front of non mahs to go out in public without abiding by the hijab Allah forbade this in uh uh the Quran when he said and do not Adorn yourself and expose your uh uh beauty Beauty as used to be done in the first time of Jah of the time of the pre-islamic era so this is the order and instruction of Allah now if a woman fails to abide by Allah's instructions she is sinful however what is the stance of her male Maham of her brother of her son or of her father now as a father or a husband they have complete and total authority over the daughter or over the wife Allah says in the Quran oh you who believe protect yourself protect yourselves and your families Hellfire so this is is an instruction from Allah so a father is obliged to force his daughter to abide by the hijab and to wear decent clothes and not to sin as he's also obliged to do that with his son so if the son wants to go out wearing shorts for example this is prohibited he is obliged to force him not to do so likewise a husband must do the same with his wife and if the wife is defiant if she is insisting on sinning and not abiding by Allah's laws and and and regulations he's obliged to force her to do that the problem is when this woman is your mother or she's your sister now the brother is encouraging his mahs to wear the hijab but they're not abiding so he is left with two options and one of them is the easiest and most lovable and likable to most of us and that is to cut all Communications not to do or to have to do anything with them not to drive them around not to take them to any place because of their sin and sometimes rarely that is sometimes this might work when a woman has no other means of transportation and and she loves her brother she loves uh her son Etc and she may give in and come back to her senses but in most of the cases they would have an alternative way uh uh to do without you which means that it is your responsibility to weigh the pros and cons it is your responsibility to see the advantages of going out with them and the disadvantages of not going out with them if the cons and the disadvantages are far greater in this sh in this case you should refrain you should not um do that intentionally because you will cause more harm if you recall uh um I maybe I did not do this on Huda did it somewhere else but the prophet Alam when three of his companions did not Marsh out with him on the 9th year of Hijra to the Battle of tabuk one of them was Malik and the other two uh uh were uh uh two great companions who witnessed bad but because of their sin the prophet Alam ordered all the people of Medina not to speak to them or to return their Salam for a for a whole 50 days they were like aliens no one would look at them or communicate with them or speak with them for 50 days and such kind of Abandonment to abandon them worked with them because they had the love of Allah and the love of the Prophet filling their hearts so such kind of reprimanding worked with them yet this can not be the case with everyone else if I do the same with my son and I know that my son has bad company and he will probably pick up uh uh uh doing drugs or robbing houses or stealing money from people because I kicked him out of the house in this case I should refrain therefore the brother should look and at the same time it depends on the brother's status in the society if he was the IM of the Islamic Center for example and or a and his niece is a Muslim but not practicing and not wearing the hijab he cannot be seen in public with her because people would not come and ask mashallah she who's this she's your niece she's your daughter she's your sister they would think ill of him and not of him personally rather they would think ill of Islam as a whole so it depends from what person to the other keep on advising them keep on trying to keep a low profile not to be seen with them in public as much as possible but at the same time to limit the possibilities of them doing sinful things or going um into more Haram because they're not with you so try your level best to uh minimize and limit this um s has a second question"
