  "title": "Forgot Allahu Akbar during movement but said it after reaching the pillar, repeat prayer? assimal",
  "transcript": "Suham from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu In Salah yesterday, I thought I didn't say Takbeer of movement while moving, so I said it after reaching the pillar, but later I realized that I already have said it while moving, so do I have to repeat my prayer? Some scholars say that when you repeat one of the obligatory acts of Salat, then you have to offer prostration of forgetfulness for inserting and adding something of the prayer that is not part of it. Others say that if what you've added in the prayer does not jeopardize its format, so whoever is looking sees you praying four rakahs with eight sujoods, everything is legit, because he doesn't know what you've said. So for example, I'm in Ruku' and I say Subhana Rabbiyal A'la, Subhana Rabbiyal A'la, Subhana Rabbiyal A'la, and then said whoa, I'm in Ruku' I'm not in Sujood, I should have said Subhana Rabbiyal Azeem, so I rectify and say Subhana Rabbiyal Azeem, Subhana Rabbiyal Azeem, Subhana Rabbiyal Azeem, Sama' Allahumma Al Hamida. Now do I have to offer Sujood Al Sahoo? The answer is no, but I've added something that is not part of the Ruku' which is Subhana Rabbiyal A'la, it should have been in Sujood. They said no problem because the format itself did not change, and Allah knows best. you"
