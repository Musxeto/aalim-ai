  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] AC [Music] alhamdulillah now why would I have to perform W because I'm in the state of minor ritual impurity what generally causes this minor ritual impurity defecating urinating or passing of wind among sleeping and eating camels meat so what we usually do on daily basis is the first two urinating defecating and maybe passing wind I have to perform W however this type of relieving yourself in Islam has etiquet you got to be kidding me no I'm not the disbelievers came to Salman Al phari may Allah be pleased with him and they said to him your Prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam taught you everything including how to relieve yourself and they're mocking this issue meaning that this is too much Salman did not let it slide he said yes he told us not to face or give our backs to the he told us not to hold our private parts with our right hands or not to wipe ourselves with our right hands and to to not use less than three pibbles or Stones Etc so our religion is complete unlike any other religion on Earth and it's not from Tom Dicker Harry it's from the Quran that is preserved until the day of judgment and from The Prophet's teachings that is also preserved so what is or what are the etiquet of relieving yourself first of all we have to understand and know the fact that humans have been answering the call of nature since Adam peace be upon him so it's not a new thing it's not a thing that you should burden yourself and be obsessed with like so many people are due to Shan's Whispers making them OCD patient this is a natural thing a normal thing that happens every day so when a person urinates or defecates he has to clean himself and to clean oneself from such filth or dirt is done through two means or two ways one is known as Al and the other is known as is to wash your private part with the front or back passage with water nothing else you have to wash it with water is to wipe off the traces of such filth using pibbles Stones hard surface like toilet paper or cloth or anything that would purify the passage not the inside rather the exterior part of it and part of the etiquettes is to do that in odd numbers so the minimum is three wipes then five then seven and Etc and and this is optional whether to use water or to use hard substance like toilet paper but if there isn't anything to wipe with then it is a must to use water what are some of the etiquettes of relieving one's uh um self number one the Dua it is Sunnah that before you go to the toilet or to answer the call of nature to say the Dua which translates toah oh Allah I seek refuge in you from the male and female devils and saying Bismillah is a visor or a screen between our a our private parts and the eyes of the Jin so these toilets are inhabitant by Jin and Devils when we say bismah they're blinded they can't see so it is essential to say this when you go in and when you go out the Sunnah as in the Hadith of mother may Allah be pleased with her that you say or I seek your forgiveness and this is what uh um the prophet used to say Sall alai wasam and you can say other duas such as all praise be to Allah who has relieved me from this harmful thing and and and give me good health Etc part of the eates of entering the lavatories is to use your left foot when you enter and use your right foot when you exit and also part of the eates and Sunnah as mentioned earlier that you only use your left hand when you hold your private part or you clean your private part uh uh not your right hand only your left hand and the Hadith is the prophet said when any one of you urinates he must not uh hold his private part with his right hand rather this means that he has to use his left hand and some Scholars say that part of the eates of answering the call of nature when urinating specifically is that a person sits down or squats because this is what was generally practiced by the prophet Alam it is safer for a person that he would not have any Ricochet from his own urine coming back to his body and to his clothes and it is more concealing of his if he's in the open rather than when he's standing up nevertheless it was proven in alari that the prophet Sall wasallam did urinate while standing up so it is permissible totally to urinate while standing up it is totally prohibited to answer the call of nature in places that would harm people so in the places where they walk in their ways in their streets in the places they seek shade under a tree in reservoirs or places they may use to drink water and you soil that and spoil it by urinating the all of this is totally prohibited and a cause and means of attaining Allah's curse upon the individual who does this also among the things that need to be care careful with facing and giving your back to the Kaa to the when urinating or defecating and this is an issue of dispute among Scholars regarding whether we're prohibited from doing this in an open area while in a closed area or within the structure of a building that is permissible this is an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion is inshallah that if you are in a building or in lavatories or toilets that are built in the facing or giving your back to the you have no other choice or alternative but when you're constructing your house it's a must upon you to change the direction and Allah knows best what is not recommended yes it is permissible but it's not recommended to do when uh uh you're answering the call of nature you should try to avoid answering the call of nature that is urinating where there is wind that may bring back your urine back to your body so don't urinate in the direction of of the wind rather Let It Be With the Wind so it goes away from your body and it is not at all recommended to speak it's part it's not part of the etiquette of Islam to speak or talk when answering the call of nature unless there is a necessity what people do in public Laboratories chitchatting and and and talking is indecent uh altogether also it is is not recommended to urinate in a hole in the ground for the fear that it might be inhabited by Jin or reptiles or snakes that may come back to you and harm you and also it is not recommended to enter lavatories while answering the call of nature with anything that may contain the name of Allah such such as uh um notes with the name of Allah or the Quran Etc unless you are afraid that it may be stolen some banknotes have the name of Allah on them if you keep your wallet outside you'll come back most likely not to find it likewise if you put your Quran and you fear that people would snatch it and run away with it then this is a necessity that you have to uh accompany it with you if there's no one else uh to save it for you okay then what about mobile phones I have my Quran app on it and some books there's no problem because when you have a CD or your uh app in a mobile phone it's not the actual Quran you cannot see it you cannot touch it it's data stored on it and as long as it's not open and it's not displayed in the lavatories or in the toilets there is no problem with that and Allah Knows [Music] Best for"
