  "transcript": "farooq from qatar says is kamaflaging the truth considered to be lying this is known in arabic as atari so if someone says to me do you have 10 euros and i said i don't have a dime and i don't truly have dimes i have dollars so am i lying no this is not considered to be lying it is camouflaging the truth and it is one of the ways of avoiding lying so if the teacher says do you have a phone with you and he said no look i don't have any phones but you have it in your pocket this is not lying because you're showing your hands and it's best not to do it but if you're going to get into trouble then this is permissible to do inshallah"
