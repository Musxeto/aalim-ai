  "transcript": "[Music] um i have a question about a story so i was reading a moral comic of siblings and family so the story starts with two twins being born in the family and like in one line it says that the twins reincarnated and which i know is false and uh i am an adult so uh the story doesn't have anything haram or any obscenity uh and the stories doesn't depend on like reincarnation at all it only shows that the twins are a little more mature than other kids although everyone is shown to be mature so my question is uh is it permissible to read such stories with the condition that if there are any dialogues about their past lives i will like totally skip them jazakallah did i answer you on my website omar uh i couldn't uh describe the question there yes i know i know but what did they answer you on my website you said you didn't like you don't know that was your answer good i couldn't describe that's why i asked again i will answer inshallah emma from bangladesh uh she said she's asked me a question a number of times on the website and i am getting old when i get frustrated of the same question being repeated from different angles i simply say i don't know why are you holding back knowledge i'm not holding back knowledge when something is as dubious as this meaning novels are not based on true stories and therefore scholars say that it is permissible to put fiction into it but the limit of fiction has to be defined so if you put fiction bringing people to life after death or changing a man into a donkey or sorcery or zombies or killing people and making a living out of it and things that are on islamic we have to draw the line so when she continued to ask about two boys twins being reincarnated having powers having this and that such novels are not the end of the world if you don't read them so don't read them when she insists on saying no i have to have a clear answer i said i don't know you"
