  "title": "What is better for traveler, to pray in masjid / pray where he is & shorten his prayer Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "so my question is if someone stay in a place for a temporary period whilst traveling is it better for him to offer their prayers in shortening or to offer them incomplete from congregation in the masjid barakallahu so the question is clear a person traveled to a particular town or city and he has the option whether to pray in the message with the congregation or to pray behind and shorten his prayers without any doubt if he is within or if he is close to uh a masjid within the vicinity of a masjid it is mandatory according to some scholars and highly recommended to the vast majority of scholars that he attends a prayer because though he is a traveler he hears the event so some scholars apply the hadith of the blind man who came to seek uh permission from the prophet allah to pray home due to his blindness and the prophet asked him a specific straightforward question do you hear the event and the blind man says yes the prophet said you have to respond so some scholars even cascaded this to a traveler who is exempted from praying with the congregation due to his traveling and he's given the concession of shortening his prayers so which is best definitely praying with the congregation but if someone prays behind and prays home and shortens prayers inshallah his prayer is valid"
