  "title": "Ruling on watching Horror Movies - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "the first email we have for today is from brother Hassan and he's asking a frequently asked questions and his question is is watching horror movies Haram now the question seems simple enough to a lot of us however instead of giving you a fish everyday let me try to teach you how to fish in order to answer such a question is watching horror movies Haram is it prohibited to watch horror movies or if we make it a little bit more generic is it prohibited to watch movies in general now how would I answer such a question is it something that one shoots from the hip or one has to look into this question through the Quran and the Sunnah definitely as Muslims it is not my logic or your logic that governs such an answer what governs an answer is what Allah Azza WA JAL told us in the Quran and what our prophet sallallaahu seldom told us in the authentic Sunnah I don't think there's any difference of opinion between us in this regards any Muslim would definitely legislate and refer to the Quran and Sunnah whenever there's a dispute otherwise he's not a Muslim agreed agreed I hope I can I can't hear you but I'm assuming you said you're saying agreed so let us look at movies in general in movies you have soundtracks which means there's music in movies generally speaking there is free mixing which means that there are men and women and most likely there will be partial nudity or a lot of nudity in movies especially in horror movies there is a great amount of violence of crime being committed and sometimes the criminal wins and they go for a sequel showing how ruthless the criminal was and how he managed to survive for so many part 1 2 3 etc so if we go to the Quran and Sunnah we see that Allah Allah ordered us orders us to lower the gaze and not to look freely so I cannot watch a woman freely and enjoy what I'm doing and having fun especially if she is inappropriately dressed listening to the music is haram and this is the consensus of the four schools of thought you cannot be one of a fifth school of thought you have to be a follower of one of them at least and inciting violence encouraging people to commit crime no sound Muslim in his sound mind would say that this is okay and this is why we prevent our children from watching such movies in short watching movies is Haram for these reasons and because of the frequent dangers resulting of it and because it is sinful waste of time waste of money and above all it dilutes your religion your Eman and makes it so thin"
