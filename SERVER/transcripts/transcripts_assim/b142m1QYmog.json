  "transcript": "xn says after taking the hustle from major impurity if someone prays and then realized he hadn't rinsed his mouth and nose does he have to repeat his O soul and prayer the issue of rinsing the mouth and the nose is an issue of dispute whether it is mandatory or it is recommended and Sunnah and what do we mean by Sunnah see in wouldl there are six pillars and the first pillar is washing the face second pillar washing the arms to the elbows third pillar wiping over the head fourth pillar washing the feet to the ankles fifth pillar to have this sequence followed sixth pillar that there is not a long gap between each pillar it has to be simultaneous so washing the face is the first pillar but sure we always know that washing the hands three times in the beginning this is Sunnah this is not mandatory nor it's a pillar so if I immediately go and wash my face this is that I think to do what about rinsing the mouth and then the nose it's an issue of dispute in the humbly school of thought they say it is mandatory in wouldl why because the prophet alayhi salatu salam had never ever performed woudl without doing that he had never skipped it in whistle the Hanafi school of thought and the humbly school of thought say it is man there it mandatory to rinse the mouth and the nose and this is the most authentic opinion so in your case as an if you remember that after two or three minutes from performing your whistle even if you drive yourself and you remember that you didn't rinse your mouth and nose go ahead and do it because the gap is too little it doesn't affect it in sha Allah but if you started to pray and you remember that in this case we tell you no you have to go and perform the hustle if the gap is long and if not then just rinse your mouth and nose and repeat the prayer all over again"
