  "title": "Can we use left hand to eat, drink, hold glass, or feed my son if my right hand is occupied?",
  "transcript": "Umm Amina from the Emirates Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu You're not allowed to use your left hand in eating or drinking or feeding your son with your left hand. And this is not true, because if they were to let go of their left hand, the glass would fall. So actually it's the left hand that they're drinking with. And this is totally prohibited, one has to avoid using the left hand to the best of their ability. Maybe the only case that this is permissible is when you're grabbing a sandwich for example, a big cheeseburger. Some of us are fasting, so they were swallowing saliva when I mentioned the cheeseburger. Man up, it's only a few hours. So you hold the juicy, big, fluffy cheeseburger and you take a bite. You're holding it with both hands, this might be an exception and Allah knows best."
