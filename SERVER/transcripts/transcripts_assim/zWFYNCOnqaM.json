  "title": "Sheikh reacting to a video of Morgan Freeman visiting a masjid & listening to adhan Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh are you familiar with uh an actor narrator he's pretty well known his name is uh morgan freeman yeah he's well known yes uh he traveled around many parts of the world you know and one part uh where he actually got a chance to listen to the adhan to visit the masjid i want you to go ahead and have a look at this this is actually in egypt and then uh give me your thoughts your reaction to this i've decided to return to cairo to try and understand who god is to muslims islam believes in the same god as jews and christians but i want to know if there are differences in how they think about the divine historian of islam ahmed raghav has brought me to the al hussein mosque and you can just come in here just like the catholic church so it's always open to prayer yeah if you want to come in here and you can hang out with uh yourself and allah yeah absolutely i'm just in time to hear what muslims believe is one of the most beautiful sounds in the world the call to prayer [Music] for the faithful the song of the muay zen is a manifestation of god himself so that's the end of the prayer is by saying assalamu alaikum much like you in you in the encounter with anybody and it is because the prayer is essentially a meeting with god collection like hey you know see you later nice talk see you the next time that's in egypt no so what do you what do you think morgan freeman if we all i mean we can end up dying tomorrow before him we don't know when our death date departure date is but if uh if we just go by years he's uh closer than than most of us right so now he's got to hear uh some of the teachings of islam if we if we have to send the message to to morgan freeman and then uh maybe if he was to visit your area of the world maybe he can come also visit with you and uh in his next documentary series well first of all yani we wish and hope for all humans to accept islam regardless of their position of the rank of their fame now having said that morgan freeman i think was doing this documentary uh for a purpose and he wasn't doing it for him own self so he has a script and he's following the script if they were to take him to a hindu temple he would have said what was in the script like what's his name this uh i have a certain skills uh that i will know how to get you and i don't know how to kill you uh lithium uh liam neeson when he was in turkey yes some something like that so he they praised that he was so impressed with azan and later on he was yeah i mean it's part of the job so we wish that they all come to islam we wish that they come and ask us and debate us and ask us what what islam is i i don't like this in your religion no problem i'll clarify it to you they have so many scholars or diaries or students of knowledge around them they can get in touch with but they don't because this is their lifestyle if you read the sunnah the prophet sent to heracles or to the uh the emperor of the byzantines a message the prophet as i've sent him a message when this ruler this emperor read the message said wallahi he is on the right path in a fight where next to him i would have taken his shoes and washed his feet and drank the water of that so people asked him okay are you accepting islam said no no no i was just testing the people the prophet said that is islam he did not want to waste his empire so he knew that accepting islam means losing all the wealth losing all the power losing losing his empire so he decided to keep that over that thing is done most celebrities are like this who wants to let go of all the wealth and fame for claiming that oh islam is beautiful you have to submit your will you're not able to do this so unfortunately but yeah sure thing anyone who wants to come and talk to me or let alone i wouldn't say talk to me talk to someone who's more knowledgeable talk to scholars talk to someone who you may benefit from but if they want to come and talk to this poor slave of allah i'm always there and just a phone call away you"
