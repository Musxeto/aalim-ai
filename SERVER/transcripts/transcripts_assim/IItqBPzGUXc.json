  "transcript": "Imran says are we sinful for talking bad about a certain type of food that we don't like I heard the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam never said he didn't like any food he simply said I don't eat it so must we also say the same well actually what you heard was not accurate the Hadith states that the prophet Allah never criticized a food that was offered to him he either ate it or rejected it so he wouldn't say that oh it should have been cooked a little bit more there is little salt in it it's too spicy it's this it's not out of criticism of the food this is inappropriate and not from the Sunnah why the host would be heartbroken when he tried his level best to present you with something that would honor you and instead of being honored you kept on criticizing the food and that it is this and it's that and this is why you find this very clear when you're invited to weddings for example so you spend a lot of money to hire the hall and to get the food and the catering and when the guests come instead of making Dura and being appreciative everybody starts criticizing oh the seafood is little the shrimps are small why is the meat uncooked why is the rice so chewy why is this and why is that so instead of you being honoring them and feeling appreciative they throw this back into your face and you feel insulted and this is not permissible as for criticizing or let me rephrase that as for disliking a certain type of food which is not presented to you so we're in a gathering we're not eating and somebody says um biryani and I say I don't like chicken biryani why I don't like chicken I like beef so would that be criticizing the food no this is my preference likewise when the prophet Islam was presented with a desert lizard and he was told that watch out this is Desert lizard meat the prophet refrained and the companion said is it haram he said no I just simply don't know this food it's not found in my uh Country and I don't fancy it that's it there's no problem in doing such a thing insha Allah and Allah Knows Best [Music] and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and the evening I will uh try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah"
