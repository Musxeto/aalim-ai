  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu So my question is, what advice would you give to a young person that wants to get married but has fear of having good children in these times? He's afraid of having good children in these times. Number one, the advice. Fear Allah. Why, Sheikh? I don't want my children to grow up in this time of fitnah so that they would not be corrupt, so that they would not be raised against Islam or become enemies or hypocrites. Fear Allah. Why? Because you're thinking negatively of Allah. As if you're killing your children because of fear that they will starve in the future. This is exactly what Allah mentioned in the Quran. Don't kill your children out of fear of poverty. We provide you and them. So you have to trust Allah, first of all. Second of all, do you think you and I have any role in upbringing our children? We do what we're told to do, and the rest is in His hands. Imagine, Prophet Nuh, 950 years, giving da'wah to his people. And he's one of the strong-willed messengers. There are five of them. Nuh, Ibrahim, Musa, Isa, Muhammad. Peace and praise of Allah be upon them. And yet, his son died as a kafir. He's begging him, my son, come on board, embark on our ark. He said, no. 950 years, and he could not convince his son. So was it in his hand? Not only that, his mother, this child's mother, also died as a kafir. His wife and his son. So what's the problem? Definitely, it's not in Nuh's approach, peace be upon him, because he's the perfect teacher, the perfect da'ia. Then the problem is that Allah guides whom He wills. You do what you're told. What are you told? Bring children. Come on, Sheikh. Why are you laughing? You are to bring children. This is what you're told. The Prophet said, peace be upon him, marry, and this is for the men, marry the woman who's fertile, who's kind and loving, for on the Day of Judgment, I will boast other messengers with the number of my followers. This is the instruction of the Prophet. Not to say, honey, I think we have two children. This is enough. We have a nucleus family. May Allah make it explode. What is this? We are in nuclear weapons? What nucleus family? We have no such thing. Have children as much as you can. I have 13, alhamdulillah. And I am a happy father with 14 grandchildren. That's why I look old. But seriously, I love children. And children are the joy of life when you see them hanging on chandeliers, and jumping from one place to the other, breaking things. Life is beautiful. Now, 12 of them memorized the Quran by heart. I didn't do a lot of work. I put them in a special school. I tried my level best, giving them incentives, giving them quality time as much as I can. But with the grace of Allah, they've grown up to be good, righteous kids. Alhamdulillah. Do I have bad apples? I do have bad apples. Bad oranges, bad mango tea. What was it called? Yeah, I love that. But tomorrow I was promised to be brought, inshallah, some. I'll take it with me. So this is what I... Do I feel sorry? Yes, I do. But is it in my hand? No. Did I do my best? Yes. My wife is sad. Did you do your best? Yes. Did you do anything wrong? To the best of my ability? No. We followed the Quran and the Sunnah. We were nice. We were kind. We were tough when we needed to be tough. We were too soft in understanding when we needed to be. And we gave them all what we can. Financially, emotionally, everything. The rest is in Allah's hands. Don't think that you can do it with your own power. The Prophet ﷺ, our Prophet, was addressed by this ayah, إِنَّكَ لَا تَهْدِي مَنْ أَحْبَبَتُ You, Muhammad, do not guide whom you love. It is Allah who guides whom He wishes. Allah the Almighty gives wealth, gives health, gives prosperity, gives security to those whom He loves and those whom He doesn't love. But He never gives iman, belief, tranquility, and happiness in the hereafter in Paradise except to those whom He loves. Trust Allah. Think positive of Him. Get married and have children and invite me for the aqiqah."
