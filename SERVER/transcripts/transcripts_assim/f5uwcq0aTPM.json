  "title": "Does fainting nullify one's fast? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "faatima says if one fainted out of tiredness of fasting would her fast go a void or should she continue fasting there's no reason for her to cut her fasting it's like falling asleep does not impact your fasting answers no so if a person faints before the Adhan aphasia and wakes up only after Isha in this case we would say that yeah this person did not fast because this was not voluntary and he lost consciousness and he could not attain one second of fasting unlike someone who was asleep in this case a person who's asleep can wake up and is not unconscious per se so to answer your question fathom there is no problem in fainting while fasting and waking up and continuing the fast"
