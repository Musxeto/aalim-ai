the laws of a love a way of life a way of life a way of life a way of life Islam is a way of life ald all praise due to Allah we ask Allah to exalt the mention and Grant peace and send his blessings upon the prophet Muhammad his wives his companions and all those who follow them on their righteous path Until the End of Time welcome brothers and sisters in Islam I'm your host and today we have with us we have and we have Dr MDU Muhammad welcome uh we will be discussing something we can call it super controversial and we hear this word all the time it seems that there are some who may label many things as B While others say that this is an over abusive usage of the word and that not everything is B and we intend inshallah to bring some clarity to the issue of B what is B how do we identify is every act that is not from the Sunnah a or are they things which are just not from the Sunnah yet not perhaps the uh the mash will elaborate on this very sensitive issue and and we can begin with sheim can you give us a definition possibly a linguistic definition of the term ald it appears to me that is derived and stemmed from to innovate or to create something that was not there originally mhm so one of Allah's beautiful name Nam and attributes subh and the word itself was mentioned in the Hadith of the Prophet Alat when he used to inaugurate most of his speeches by saying that everything that is new or created in the religion of Islam is a bid an innovation and every inovation takes its person who does it astray so and this leads to Hellfire eventually so the word b itself it is not related to what we do it is not related to transactions it is not related to the way we live it is related to The Way We tend to get closer to Allah by so could there be innovation in worldly matters definitely not so we can't drive a car cannot be an innovation that is condemned by Islam uhhuh okay so if I say that the prophet Alam used to ride a mule okay so from now on I'm going to go to work riding a mule because riding a car is an innovation people would consider me to be insane because this is not related to the Sunnah M so lots of times we hear people saying that why do you use microphones in the Masjid this is an innovation why do you have carpets in the Masid why do you have lights in the Masjid we tell them that this is not a form of worship now this is different than when someone comes and says listen I've innovated two rakas and I call it the two fiery raak which distinguishes the Hellfire but I would say okay is this founded do you have evidence for this if if he says yes and the evidence is authentic then I have to revise my own religion because this is baseless and if it's not then this is what is considered to be called your input before we elaborate on this issue the issue of the first of all I would like to draw the attention of every Muslim that the dean of Islam the religion of Islam has been perfected and completed and no muslim will argue about this fact a you asari came to your Prophet taught you everything he said yes he taught us everything that is with h did you say to S Omar there is an verse an Ayah in your book you Muslims had that verse or Ayah came down on us use we would have taken that day a day for celebration who would be commemorating that day so s asked him what is it which a you are referring to he said this day Allah has token say today I have completed your dean and I have completed my favors upon you and they have chosen that Islam as a way of life for you so the dean my dear brothers and sister has been completed and perfected and if something has been perfected and completed which is complete doesn't accept addition what accepts addition is the incomplete it's like a glass of water yeah like a glass of water if it is full to the brim it will not accept it will overflow if it is full it will not accept if it accepts it means it was not full question to every Muslim is your de complete or incomplete you ask yourself answer this question Allah is saying it has been completed so there is no room for any Muslim to come and add anything to the dean what we have to do is just follow the dean apply it in our life Implement every single teaching in it an AR poet is said referring to this fact because those people who are saying there is this is a good B good innovation in the de I was going to mention that okay they don't know what is coming out of their heads actually because when you are saying there is a good bid it means the dean is in need of it if the dean is in need of this Innovation it means the dean is incomplete that's why IM Malik he said IM Malik said whoever claims there is a good innovation in the dean he is accusing and insinuating that Prophet Muhammad did not convey the message you're accusing your Prophet when you say it is a good Innovation that means there is deficiency and you are there is a gap and you're filling that Gap some may site evidences though they may site for instance heard these arguments that um of course we have a number of them we have Omar no we'll come to all these things we'll come to these the types of B have answers for and the types of B so first of all the fact that every Muslim should agree to that the de has been completed and that's why Prophet Muhammad wasallam said which means whoever innovates anything in our matter which means our deed okay it will not be accepted from him it will be rejected why because the dean which Allah subh chose for us is to worship him on his terms not on ours so the dean has been perfect Ed and completed and there's no room for adding anything to the de which is we call it so now as mentioned it is root actually and we go to the root of which is okay the Arab they say which means when the shik changes its mode of walking the way it works start limping so this way now the key camel is limping it's not its normal way of walking something new something new without a previous example that's why Allah is the B the fashioner the originator of the heavens and the Earth without a PRI prototype or example so is it safe to say that the term why Norm always we have to differentiate between two terminologies or two meanings of the word the lexical meaning which is the meaning in the dictionary linguistic meaning and the technical meaning which is the word the meaning which the Shar used that word so keep in mind that the dean came in the Arabic tongue so the word b an Arab understands the meaning of it so it means something new so anything in new linguistically can be called B linguistically anything new cameras TVs Cars airplanes anything new so is Islam against all Innovations all Novelties no that's why the prophet was very precise when he said in our matter which means our Dean so when it comes to the dean don't innovate why because it is complete Islam has given you the room to innovate in the dun and the early Muslims they realize this very well and they drew the line when it comes to the dean just follow when it comes to the D innovate and invent and we all recall the famous Hadith or incident when the prophet wasam arrived in Medina the people of Medina the Anar they were farmers and they used to pollinate the palm trees you putting the pollen so they said should we pollinate the palm trees this year he said no so they didn't pollinate the palm trees date palm trees so the produce was bad quality they came and say see see the produce he told us not to to pollinate and said we he said we prophets and messengers of God were not sent to teach you how to run your mandane Affairs you are the experts in this field so this Hadith teaches us that when it comes to the mundane and worldly things green light is given providing that it is done within the framework of the Shar when it comes to the dean now just follow I said no said follow and do not innovate okay inah we'll be taking a short break and after the break I would like you to discuss more about the evidences that may be cited to support the idea of good B and how to adequately provide answers so we'll be back soon inal a way of life of alhamd welcome back so we were discussing a sensitive issue of B and just to summarize I guess it's safe to say that the term is not a problem there's a linguistic meaning and legislative meaning uh the linguistic meaning May apply in the religion like such as it could be a positive term like when describes Allah subhana wa tala or it could be negative have a negative connotation if it inails introducing something into the dean which was not part of it is that safe exactly now yes yet with the clarity of this understanding still you hear counterarguments incidents that happened at the time of the Prophet Alat wherein the people understood from that event that it endorsed the idea of adding into the religion and that this is a matter of flexibility was praying after the and that was not from theah he didn't learn it from the prophet it's part of the de now acknowledging the things of the sort so how would we adequately address these issues perhaps you would like to shed some light on this I would leave this to one of the but I'd like to say that what's strictly is that the word itself is a beautiful word is a good word because people in general like and love to to do something new to see something new it attracts people so because of the beautiful meaning of the word it distracts people from the truth and we need just to and alhamd usually use the word in in a correct context all the time when they say in the negative sense all the time they say B in the religion because B outside the religion it's okay as long as it goes with the general guidelines of Islam and this this is the meaning that I want to explain to every Muslim don't be scared of the word what we should be scared of when it is used in religion we are not supposed this is the area of divinity no one in this universe has the right to make any changes in this area of divinity only Allah subhana wa tala who decides the religion and as the Sheikh said that we worship Allah according to the way he wants us to worship him not according to the way that we worship him otherwise if you look at it this simple statement if we worship Allah subhana wa ta'ala the way that we want to worship Him you can imagine his way is different from the Sheik's way and from my way and everybody has his own way so this is not in other words if we worship Allah subhana wa ta'ala the way that we want to worship him that we are making ourselves Gods because we are originating we are stating that the way that we want to do it no Islam means you submit yourself to what Allah subhana wa tala says so this is area whereas the area of B in as mentioned in many examples yes you are encouraged to do VI as long as it does not collide with the spirit of Islam so we are encouraged to be creative we are encouraged to be problem solvers but look at this example that I heard that this example from in one of the states of in California a person who doesn't know who doesn't have the background that that we just explained and that this area of bid in the religion that's danger there was a problem in on Friday prayer people work and they yes they have no time to get 2 hours from their work leave and to come to pray so they were discussing the matter what should we do so one person suggested that why shouldn't we move jum prayer to Sunday you know and I think it's a good suggestion yeah but he doesn't know about B and religion nobody can decide nobody can has the power to do this he doesn't have this Islamic background alhamdulillah is clar these issues to the people it became very simple for anyone no now this is the area of divinities this is the area of the religion we cannot approach it we have to follow as the she said we do not innovate in this but we are supposed to follow what the prophet s wasallam and the sun of the Prophet Sall alaihi wasall is so clear to the degree that each one of us would know now we quot and we have the evidence from the Sunnah and we have to follow it it's very simple perhaps there's no other biog graphy or sunn of any human being on this planet is as clear as the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad s alaihi wasallam so it became simple for Muslims alhamdulillah because it's well documented that we can say okay this is had been done by the prophet sallallahu alaihi was but there is another level and this is the level of the scholars when they clarify that the prophet sallallah alhi wasallam did this in this context as the example of the trees that the sheh mentioned right now yeah so even the people at that time they did not understand the prophet in the beginning yet so when then he made a general statement this is your life we you know more than others uh we are not supposed to tell you about your life you can innovate in this issue other words this is the essence of the the what the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said because it has nothing to do with the religion but if it has to do with the religion it's only Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam who would say this is okay or not so it's a mercy from Allah that he would often say to the people and yet he would be in a situation where he would explain that this is a matter of the D so that nothing will be hidden ambiguous yes when the the imams and the scholars say definitely they mean in the religion and we want every Muslim whenever he hears this he understands that in the religion so otherwise means all the bidas whether it's in the religion or not but what's meant in this context is only restricted to religion we are yet to hear though what could be said to these incidents which took place and how do we understand them in the context of what we have explained previously so whichever one of you is interested in uh tackling this head on it will be the incidents you've mentioned it happened at the time of the Prophet Alat wasam for example when B prayed two after every wo and performed whenever he answered the call of nature he used to perform woodoo and offered these two ra the prophet asked him B why is it that when I went to Paradise I heard the your flip flops in front of me was that he said I don't know the only thing that I do is so and so so the prophet approved of it and also the man that the prophet sent in an expedition and he used used to lead the people in prayer and after every Surah he used to recite so they told him either you recite alone or recite the Surah alone but why combine them he said this is a Surah that has a description of Allah Asel and I Love It For the Love of Allah and the prophet told him go and tell him that Allah loves him for his love those who innovate use these two or more incidents to justify their inov yet they don't look at the other side where the Prophet for example was angered by the actions of three of his companions when one of them said I'll pray all night without sleeping the other one said I'll fast all year without breaking my fast and the third said I will not marry women intending to do something extra because they asked the wives of the Prophet Alam about what he used to do in his house and they thought that the forms of worship that the prophet was doing Alam was little so each one of them said I'd like to Excel and do this so that we could Elevate ourselves in in Paradise the prophet did not approve of that so the issue is the things that took place at the time of the prophet and he approved it it is part of his Sunnah the approval okay approval but again this does not mean that it is something advisable to do unless the prophet has done it himself so if someone says okay from now on I'm going to lead prayer and every Surah in the first two I'm going to recite afterwards we say this is permissible but it is not advisable though the prophet approved of itam which means it's not an innovation but it's a lower level than following the Sunnah of the Prophet because he didn't do it because he do it and he did the rest of the companions who were more knowledgeable than this companion did not do it yet we don't say anything we say this is good you're okay now as long as it happened at the time of the Prophet Alat we say that the prophet's approval gives it a green light but if someone comes after the death of the Prophet Alat wasam and does something then we say listen if you're not one of the four rightly guided companions if you're not not Abu Bakr Omar or Ali you have no right even if you were a companion yourself because the prophet's death and this type of legislation and the prophet himself told us that you should follow my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the four guided KHS well okay I I did not mention this because I thought that it falls under a bigger umbrella because those who innovate usually say that the prophet saidat whoever leads people to something that is good then he will have their reward plus his till the day of judgment and whoever leads people to something that is bad then he would have their sins and the sins of those who follow him till the day of judgment but due to the fact that this may take a little bit longer I don't know if you want us to address it now can we do it in the next episode but you promis to give us something elaborate inshah I'll do my level best cuz I've heard this I mean this is probably the most common argument in this issue so that's we will end it with that and we are looking forward inshallah to the second episode wherein we will discuss the incident of statement what an excellent Innovation does that endorse or does it not endorse Innovations uh thank you for tuning in we look forward to seeing you in the future what a way of life a way of life and"
