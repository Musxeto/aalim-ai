  "transcript": "nor from nigeria he says allah azzawajal said to the angels i am leaving in on earth a successor referring to adam so someone said that this means that allah did not send adam to earth from paradise as a punishment and this was already predetermined and this is not true this is not true because allah azzawajal knows what is going to happen as we all know allah knows the past the present and the future allah predestined everything that's going to happen till the day of judgment 50 000 years before allah created the universe when there was nothing yet allah predestined it and had the pen write everything in detail so allah knew subhana wa and this is what he was prophesizing to the angels telling them this is what's going to happen and this does not mean when telling them this that adam would not sin peace be upon him and eat from the forbidden fruit or the forbidden tree and be punished by being descended to earth for that and allah repented upon him so what this person is saying is not true and allah knows best"
