  "transcript": "Salihin from Canada. My question is, Sheikh, what is the minimum level of knowledge that you must have or credentials in order to answer a question and answer like you or Dr. Muhammad Falah and any other director or official in the Islamic world? I could barely understand your voice because you're speaking from the phone. Correct me if I'm wrong. You're asking what's the bare minimum of knowledge a person has to possess in order to answer questions? That's correct, yes. Okay. So, this is related to the question. If someone asks me, what is one plus one? Do I have the knowledge to answer and say two? The answer is yes. So everybody could answer this question. Someone asks a salesman in a car showroom, how much gas can I put in this Toyota Corolla? From the top of his head, he would say 50 liters. He knows that. He read the catalog. So he possesses the knowledge necessary to answer the questions. So in order to answer a question, you have to have the knowledge that backs it up. Some of the students of knowledge possess a lot of knowledge and they're qualified to answer such questions. They can. Some of them have a limit where when asked a question, they'll say, whoops, this is way above my pay grade. I don't know. I have to check and ask the major scholars. Some of, unfortunately, of the duaat shoots from the hip and he speaks about finance, he speaks about politics, he speaks about social aspects and mashallah, he's like a phone booth, just put the coin and start talking. This is wrong. So the knowledge is extremely important and this is why Muhammad ibn Sirin, may Allah have mercy on his soul, said this knowledge that you're learning from students of knowledge and scholars and duaat and storytellers, this knowledge is religion. So look and scrutinize who you're taking your religion from. Therefore if you were asked Islamic questions that you have knowledge of, how many rakahs do we have in Asr? Four. You have no problem in saying that. But when someone says, okay, can we combine Asr to Maghrib if we have a necessity and we're flying and there's an emergency and blah, blah, blah, you don't have knowledge, you refrain, you stop. I don't know. And whoever says I don't know, this is half of the knowledge and I hope this answers your question. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
