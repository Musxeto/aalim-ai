  "transcript": "a bit early before actually going into surgery like um invalidate your prayer no it doesn't it doesn't invalidate your prayer but it has no value so if you thought that while going to say subhanallah and you touch the ground and you say nothing and you rise up you did not say a thing but if some people out of hastiness while they're going just before touching the ground this is and then they rise up this is okay without any problem in that insha Allah"
