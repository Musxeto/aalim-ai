  "title": "Is it sunnah to visit family members on Eid? What if there is free mixing? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "just want to ask if it's a sun to visit family members during and to chitchat with them and if there's a free mixing can we stay home and call them okay first of all it is not a Sunnah per se to visit family members during Eid it's a cultural thing and whenever the culture does not go against Islam then this is permissible We Gather inid and it's difficult to say say okay sh what's the ruling on giving what money that we give to children as a gift it wasn't done by the companion so it's a b no it doesn't work like this what's the ruling on gathering on lunch we invite relatives and we eat lunch on the first day of Eid it wasn't done by the companions it wasn't done by the companions these are cultural things greetings of Eid Jubilation and signs of Happy happiness all of this is something good it's not limited to 1 + 1 equals 2 it's open with the grace of Allah so that there wouldn't be any hardship upon the Muslims so if the culture doesn't go against Islam it's fine but the moment you say okay we visit relatives inid that's good for you what's your diet because they offer a lot of chocolates and things but they have free mixing shik now this is Haram immediately you block this okay she they would be offended tough luck I'd rather them being offended than Allah being angry with me I can't be in a place that is freely mixed either you segregate or I'm not going to visit I'm just going to give you a call or send you a text message"
