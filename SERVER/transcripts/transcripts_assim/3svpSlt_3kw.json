  "title": "What is our role in supporting Daees, Scholars, & Students of Knowledge",
  "transcript": "jainal from belgium he says there are lots of scholars students of knowledge and diaries who are following the manhattan of the salaf trying to spread islam and sunnah and to counter innovation and deviant sects what is our role with them to help them okay this is very generic so basically as a community we have to stand by them as long as they are in according to the quran sunnah back them up defend them when there is need to be defending them help them financially help them logistically try to promote their da'wah for the sake of allah and to tell you the truth all what i am doing would not have come to the surface had it not been for the favor and blessing of allah alone and the handful of volunteers who are doing tremendous efforts and work in my youtube channel on my website designing them the brothers in bahrain who refurbished and redesigned my website free for the sake of allah they don't charge a penny and they do this anticipating their reward and they do it for the sake of allah azzawajal if all those who call to allah according to the quran sunnah we're fortunate to have such support wallahi we would be in a better place providing that we don't blindly follow the sheikh in whatever simon says no we have to cross-examine whatever he says and does with the quran and sunnah we don't give people more than their actual size so that they won't be deviated inevitably by over praising them so there are different means of support businessmen can support those with good management skills can support those with pr abilities can support and help the cause and everyone in his own field can support to spread this da'wah and to defend it"
