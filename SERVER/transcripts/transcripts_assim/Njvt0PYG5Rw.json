  "title": "Did Abu Bakr commit shirk when he said to Prophet \"Me, my family & wealth are all sacrificed for you",
  "transcript": "the prophet said allah no wealth has benefited me as the wealth of abu bakr abu bakr broke in tears may allah said o prophet of allah isn't me my family my wealth all sacrifice for you so he's saying it isn't this shirk yeah this is abu bakr the first man to enter the jannah from the ummah of the prophet muhammad sallallahu alaihi the first person and he is the highest in level among all muslims and you accuse him of sheikh and do you think that the prophet assam would have turned a blind eye if it were shirk or if it was sinful of course not when i say that i'm sacrificed to you and my family and my wealth why am i doing this for his sake of course not he's doing it for allah's sake and when we say ash muhammad rasool allah are we making shirk because you say ash and immediately we say ash ah why do you associate this with that mushrik who said this our belief in the prophet our love to the prophet our obedience to the prophet these are all part of believing in allah without believing in allah all of this would be in vain believing allah without these things would be also in vain so it is a cluster of things and whatever we do to the prophet islam when we offer salutation when we love him when we follow him this is all part of our obedience and love to allah the almighty"
