  "title": "Am I sinful if the teacher puts me in a group with females? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Raqi from Indonesia. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. So I currently live, I mean I'm currently in a school where it's not gender segregated and that sometimes the teacher puts me in groups with women. So my question is that is it allowed for me to work together with women on group works or is it not permissible for me to do so? Men are the breadwinner. As a man you are obliged to go to school, to go to university and to work. And unfortunately in so many countries that do not abide by the Islamic rulings, you may find yourself in a position where you have to freely mix with the opposite gender. Which is haram. But due to it being the least of the two evils, that is working with the opposite gender rather than quitting everything and staying home again and not being able to work or to provide for your family, then you may do so by following the Islamic rulings. Not to be in seclusion with the opposite gender under any circumstances. Not to freely look without any boundaries but rather you have to lower your gaze. Not to flirt or socialize or chit-chat freely. Rather keep it strictly to business. One plus one equals two. That's it. Not trying to be funny or humorous etc. In this case inshallah you're fine."
