  "transcript": "uh my question is about donations so do we need to specify and intent for the specific donation type like Zakia kafara and so on or is the general donation considered inclusive of all or any of these categories for example excuse me if I donate to sponsor an Oran or provide a monthly Food donation for a family this be classified as the god automatically without spacing find it seeking guidance on this matter the prophet indicated [Music] that Deeds are by what a person intends them to be and this means that all forms of worship if they do not include an intention then it's like someone getting in his car in the morning that is H that's having a full gas tank starts early and drives without any destination he will reach nowhere pretty quick because he doesn't have a destination and the intention is your destination so if I give a th000 quid and I don't have an intention this can never be zakat Allah will never accept this as a zakat because zakat has to have a prior intention before giving the money if I give someone who's in real need in hospital and he cannot pay his medical expenses and I give him Â£1,000 and after I walk away I said H he's needy he's very poor okay this is my zakat money it doesn't work because before giving the money it you should have had the intention of zakat it's like someone waking up in the morning offering faer prayer and after a couple of hours he did not eat or drink anything since the aan he says hmm I think I have a missed day since last year's Ramadan so I'm going to make it today this is not valid because the intention was not prior to the break of dawn and the prophet said whoever does not have the intention to fast mandatory or obligatory fast before the break of down that is at night time his fast is invalid yes I can fast voluntary anything I give away can be voluntary NE charity but anything that is mandatory whether it's a f zakat an experation which is also mandatory for an oath that I broke or for a sin that I made an oath or a pledge or a vow that I made it has to have the prior intention or it won't be valid"
