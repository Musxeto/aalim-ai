  "transcript": "fatima says in such scenarios what should a Muslim do when I start studying or do my own works my mom asks me to do other works or starts to talk with me or starts to ask me questions here I don't sit to study or do my works without helping her or without doing my part of the house chores you have to know fatima that there is whatnot one size that fits all we have to go out of our ways to please our parents while not harming ourselves so you can always talk to your mom politely and diplomatically and telling her that you need an hour or two to do your work or your homework or to do your studies after doing your shores and helping her but you cannot simply stop talking to her for hours without end and also you cannot leave your studies and chitchat with her for hours without end you have to learn how to balance you have to learn how to communicate with your mother and try your level best to go out of your way to please her when you don't have anything to do rather than sitting there and asking what to do and what to do and expecting people to come and show you you have to come up with decisions of your own that you seek Allah's pleasure by while weighing the pros and cons of such decisions"
