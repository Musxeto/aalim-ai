  "title": "Photographer is getting paid for haram photos, give to charity? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "uh MAA from Germany Alum I contributed a Photography book which entered it second edition on August 1st and I had a contract with a Publishing Company since 2021 and while I've removed many photos and told them I won't provide new images they continue paying me for sale so now they want to pay me for the second edition so my question is should I donate this amount to charity as it is might be Haram income so let me understand this you are a professional photograph photographer and you have this book yes and what is the percentage of Haram images in it um so there are four other um photographers in this book so there are a few I guess uh some majority of it is Haram then yes you have to donate this money because it's not Halal for you to consume it okay"
