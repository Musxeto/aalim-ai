  "transcript": "first sidra says can a woman pray to allah that her husband should not have any other wife in jannah except her not even in as i cannot bear to see my husband with anyone else this question is related to suha's question and suha says i have heard you saying many times that this is transact uh transgression in making dua can you please explain what that means okay so sidra's question is transact transgression indu what's transgression in dua how do i transgress when i make dua transgression means that you either ask allah something that allah told us that would not happen or that you go into details and the origin of this is the famous well-known hadith of abdullah ibn al-mura may allah be pleased with him the companion who heard his son supplicating and he says o allah i ask you the white house to the right side of the person entering jannah and we don't have any evidence in the quran or in the sunnah that there is such a white house and that the location of that white house is to the right of a person entering jannah so abdullah said to his son my son ask allah azzawajal for paradise generally don't go into details for i had heard the prophet alaihis allah say there will be from my own people who will transgress in dua and in purification in purification this is commonly found among muslims when they perform moodle multiple times or take half an hour to perform moodle or 40 minutes to perform husul or get these viswas whether they have splashes of urine or so and this is how shaytan works so this is understood what is transgression of dua when you ask for specifics o allah i ask you for a new 2021 escalade a plutonium virgin sports with new spark plugs what is this this is transgress dressing in doha ask allah for a good car ask allah for a specific car ask allah azzawajal for something that in general is good and allah would make it happen but if you ask allah azza for wings so that i can fly like a bird or if you ask allah for the ability to stay underwater for six hours without the need of breathing or scuba diving tanks this is transgression in dua likewise when sidra says i'd like to ask allah that my husband does not get a second wife and no what is this this is the arjuna this is allah's jannah and allah azza told us that men would have two wives in paradise but your lack of knowledge and your lack of understanding how things work in paradise led you to this allah told us that in paradise you'll be 100 percent and 50 satisfied so why do you ask for such things that allah azza has given men and guaranteed you satisfaction this is a form of transgression in dua and allah azzawajal knows best"
