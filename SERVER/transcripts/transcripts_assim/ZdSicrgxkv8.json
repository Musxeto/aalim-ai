  "title": "Can I make my Christian grandma happy on Christmas day? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my grandma is non-muslim and I'm taking care of her um but she has strong feelings towards Christmas but I'm a bit confused so what am I allowed to do when I see her unhappy on this day without intending to celebrate like can I distract her with all things organize a walk I feel like trying to make her happy on this day will make me a hypocrite on the contrary a what is prohibited for us as Muslims is to celebrate that day or to congratulate non-muslims with it but to be happy or to make people happy not because of that particular day rather because they're depressed or it's your nature to make people happy there's nothing wrong in that at all nobody said that this occasion we should all be gloomy and drowning and uh uh mourn one another on the contrary be normal and if you see your grandmother or any of your loved ones whether Muslims or non-muslims being unhappy and you want to make them happy with Halal things not because of that particular day rather throughout the whole year this is totally permissible inshallah"
