  "title": "Is the Movie Contagion (2011) about Coronavirus, considered to be fortune telling? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so brother phase question was the there is a movie made in 2011 and apparently it speaks about the spread of the corona virus in Wuhan Province in China and it's 70 to 80 percent resembling what's happening at the moment so is it permissible to watch this movie secondly is this part of fortune-telling well first of all I don't know about the movie I haven't seen it I've heard people write about I've seen people write about it and but I don't know about anything about it what I know is that Hollywood produces thousands of movies a year and so does Bollywood and now we have Nollywood from Nigeria and tomorrow maybe we'll have Jabbar Wood from Japan I don't know they keep on producing their trash and we as Muslims take it and embrace it unfortunately therefore it would not be hard for any script writer or author to come up with such a story remember that Corona is a family of viruses and there was Merce there were SARS there is Ebola there is so many pandemics and epidemics and diseases with the biological wars and their creativity comes up with such stories now adding to that we know that the Prophet told us Allison that the jinn eavesdrop and listen to what's going on in the heavens before Allah throws them with meteoroids that burn them but some of them managed to escape with one lie that he heard and he gives it to the fortune-teller who is it up with 99 lies and presented to the masses so the people listen to 100 lies but when one comes they said this is the one that he said so there is a possibility that all of this is a mixture of creativity of fortune-telling but as Muslims we do not watch such trash because it's filled with music free mixing Haram things and it has nothing to benefit us with"
