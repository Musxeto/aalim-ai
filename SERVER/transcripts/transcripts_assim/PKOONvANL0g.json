  "title": "Combining Maghrib and Isha during times of hardship - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "say it from Iceland saying that because Maghrib is a ten o'clock and fetch it probably is about two o'clock so it's very short the people pray Maghrib and Isha they combine they go home and they break their fast and they have their meal and they come for taraweeh is this permissible the answer is combining their Asia - mother it is permissible when there is hardship upon the Muslims so if you say that if I pray Asia on time which is 11:30 this leaves no time for me to sleep until fetcher and I may lose fuzzy and I'm a professor but then I would miss going to my office because I did not have sufficient time of sleeping if this is the case and there is hardship upon you as an individual you may combine so if the community has this collective a hardship they may do this and they have no problem in sha Allah but if someone is in a weekend and he is gonna sleep the whole day he must pray mullah Ruben time raesha on time and with the doing of the people they're having their meal and coming back for taraweeh this is permissible insha Allah"
