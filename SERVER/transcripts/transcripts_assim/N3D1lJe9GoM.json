  "transcript": "Ismail from Pakistan. Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum. Sheikh I'm saying there's a member in my family, they're a doctor and they work in a hospital and and they may be they may be operate a clinic in the hospital and what happens is that what you call they they say that they work a certain amount and they get points and with those points maybe the pharmaceutical company or something they can get like a laptop or a tablet or something and they're asking me to like search for a good laptop for them so I don't know if this is collaborating on sin because I saw your videos but maybe their situation is a bit different it's like they are getting points or their and then they can redeem those points to get the laptop maybe they sell the medicine of the company so is it allowed to help them or no when when a doctor works for a clinic and he's getting paid by the clinic that he does not own and the pharmaceutical companies give him a laptop a phone a course in a resort in Goa for example or in Sharm El Sheikh or in Dubai for three days with his family business class tickets and the whole nine yards this is a bribe it's not a gift they're not giving it to him because he's a handsome person if he was an engineer pharmaceutical companies would not give him an iota if he was a scholar or a teacher they would not give him a thing so they're giving him this bribe so that he would prescribe their medication and sell it and this is not permissible if they're giving it to the owner that would not be a bribe because then he's an owner he's not being paid by someone to do his job so that would be a gift for him and he's free whether to write the prescription or not but when he's working for a company or a hospital or a clinic and they're paying him any monetary income that he gets from patients or from the others this is a clear bribe"
