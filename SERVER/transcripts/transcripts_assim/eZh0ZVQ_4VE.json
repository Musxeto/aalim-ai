  "transcript": "vegeta says what's the difference between father and wife hanafi says which is wajib does this mean it is fart the vast majority of scholars other than the hanafis the vast majority say that fardh and wajib are the same because by definition to them foreign is what we are commanded by sharia to do and if we do it we are rewarded and if we fail to do it we are punished and become sinful this is the definition of both father and watching the hanathis have a similar definition to that so they also agree if you do it you're rewarded if you don't do it you are sinful but they differentiate by saying that fault is what has been proven through evidences that are definite they said and rajib are the things that we're mandated to do through evidences that are speculative vanilla to the boot yet they all agree that both of them must be executed and if you if you fail to do this you will be sinful so it's a technical term and of course we always go with the vast majority because there is no distinction there is no difference in sharia between fort and wajib and um you"
