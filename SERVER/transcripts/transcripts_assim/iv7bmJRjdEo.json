  "transcript": "Faheem from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. Due to laziness or a legitimate reason sometimes we are in a situation in Fajr or Zuhr Fard prayer at the mosque that if we pray Sunnah first then we surely miss first one or two rakah of Fard prayer at congregation. So my question is attending congregational Fard prayers from the very beginning or praying Sunnah at first no matter what, what should we prioritize? The Prophet Alayhi Salatu Wassalam clearly answered this question. He said if the Iqamah of the Fard prayer is given there is no prayer valid except the Fard. What we see in the subcontinent in Bangladesh, in Pakistan, in India, when we hear the Iqamah of the Fajr and we go to the masjid, the Imam is reciting in the first rakah, we see people coming instead of joining the jama'ah, the congregation, they go behind the pillar and pray Sunnah al-Fajr. Their prayer is invalid. No matter how quick they pray it, it is invalid because this is what the Prophet said Alayhi Salatu Wassalam. So now either you know more than the Prophet or you don't. Definitely you're going to say I don't but I'm following my Imam, my Mawlana and this is wrong. Follow the real Mawlana, follow the Prophet Alayhi Salatu Wassalam. So you have to, you must join the congregation and afterwards you can make up for this Sunnah prayer. you"
