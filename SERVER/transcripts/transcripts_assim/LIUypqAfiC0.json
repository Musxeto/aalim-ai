  "transcript": "Anna from Uganda Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh My question is It's said that One of the best things is to pray on time But as for women It's not a must For us We can delay the prayers So my question is If my mother asked me to do Something that I can do afterwards After praying Would I be sinful if I disobey her? As long as you know that She would not be angry Alhamdulillah You can pray And then do whatever she told you To do And better more you can notify her That you would like to pray first And this would take 10 minutes, 15 minutes And then you will do Whatever she wants you to do But if you know that she is In urgent need of that thing And The time Is extended So if you do what she asks you And then go and pray There is no harm done, there is no sin None whatsoever Alhamdulillah, it's a win-win situation Alhamdulillah"
