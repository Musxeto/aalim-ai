  "transcript": "foreign 40 supplication for one afflicted with doubt in his faith and this is a growing problem nowadays unfortunately with some muslims attributed to lack of knowledge lack of righteous practicing companions surrounding you 24 7 and because of indulging and watching debates with atheists or following celebrities on snapchat or instagram that throws doubts in your head and you're unable to ward them off so the prophet is teaching us what to do whenever you have these doubts about allah azzawajal or about islam you should do the following yes yes number two you should renounce that which is causing such doubt the biggest cure for your doubts is blocking them not debating with them not answering these whispers don't have an argument with shaytan because he comes from one front while you're trying to rectify it he opens another five fronts so now you're scattered between six of them trying to refute each and every one while you're doing this he opens another 20. now you're overwhelmed you're doomed the best way is just to renounce it to block it then hadith number 134 you should say i believe in allah and his messengers say this statement whenever shaytan comes why because this cements your belief in allah azzawajal and protects you from whatever attempts shaytaan is trying to do and also affirming allah allah's beautiful names and attributes so you should say because this is what the meaning translates to he is the first and the last who is allah the first without the beginning because if there's there was anything before him he wouldn't be god and he's the last without an end because if there was anything after him then what was after him should be god but there isn't anything and you should also acknowledge that he is the upper most one and the inner most one and that he is or he knows well all things these four beautiful names of allah azzawajal incubate time and location so allah azza in regards of time he is the first without an a beginning and the last without an end and in terms of location allah is above everything and allah is closer to everything from anything so he is the upper most one and the inner most one as well as wajal now we move to other types of dua and this chapter chapter 41 it is dealing with settling a debt and most people ask frequently oh sheikh teach us a dua that would help us from our debts and pay that would pay off our debts well a very short and concise and beautiful easy to memorize in arabic o make me or make what is lawful enough for me as opposed to what is unlawful what does that mean sometimes we're so greedy we want more and more and more i'm asking allah to give me halal and to make this little halal suffice me in instead of a lot of haram that would have no barakah no blessing in it and that would not be sufficient for me either so and spare me by a grace of need of others and this is a bigger problem most of the time we keep on looking at what people possess oh i like his watch i like his car i like his mansion i like his authority and wealth and this dua limits your gaze to what allah has in his hands from anyone else's so that i would not need anyone else but you when you need others you feel dependent upon them and you get humiliated frequently insulted by them because you want what they possess what they have in their hands but when you have this independence when you totally dependent on allah you feel independent from others and this is what this dua is all about it's a beautiful dua if you continuously say it allah would enrich you would make you wealthy and you would not need others than him with the grace of allah this is all the time we have until we meet next time i leave you alone [Music] foreign"
