  "title": "Have pollen allergy, pollen gets stuck in my beard Can I trim my beard #Assim #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "sh so I have allergy to Poland here in the UK um and the allergy or the hay fever I get people say is unlike the hay fever they've seen on anyone else uh and actually sometimes it can get so bad that I'm even if I'm in my bedroom I have to wear a face mask um so so she when I actually go outside um there's a risk of catching Poland in my hair in my eyes and I wear sunglasses and a cap to protect myself but there's nothing to protect my beard so um and you know my nose is obviously above my beard so I can inhale this poing that I catch so I was wondering uh until I'm in the UK and I don't make Hijra um can I trim my beard um to prevent the um severity of this allergy and then once I make Hijra I can do as per the Hadi which is to let the beard grow I cannot answer your question because I'm not a medical doctor and I cannot judge the severity of your case so many people come to me with similar situations but it turns out that they're just wanting a way out to trim their beard or to even shave it so this is something between you and Allah do you think if you shave your beard anybody's going to complain or judge you or uh maybe punish you of course not it's only Allah who's going to do this so unless it's an emergency it's something of urgency you cannot do that because it goes against Islam who's qualified to judge a truly Muslim a practicing Muslim uh a doctor specialist who would say that yes this is 100% definitely the uh the cause of your illness and it's dangerous and it's going to cause you this or that but if the allergy is just sneezing welcome to the club there's nothing wrong in that or something fatal in that so this is something to be determined by a a Muslim practicing righteous Muslim specialist who would advise you and weigh the consequences of keeping it or uh trimming it and Allah Knows Best"
