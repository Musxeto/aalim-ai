  "transcript": "And Namshaykh, someone asks, is it okay if I perform ablution naked? If people are not looking, no problem, my guest. Ablution has nothing to do whether you are fully covered or totally naked. Ablution is washing your hands, your face, your arms, wiping over your head, and washing your feet. It doesn't matter whether you are clothed or not. So to answer your question, it is totally permissible. Al-Fatiha."
