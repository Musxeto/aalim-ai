  "title": "The Role Model (Prophet ﷺ‎) (7) - Things that he remembered (Memories) - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "today we're going to talk about going down memory lane memories are part of us and as they say it's it lights the corners of our minds everyone has memories some are painful and some are Pleasant and very often we recall these memories and the difference between a Believer and a non-believer when it comes to Memories sometimes painful memories can be cause of hardship depression a lot of sadness and mental illnesses to none Muslims it can cause such impact upon Muslims but it is always way way lighter as Muslims anticipate the reward from Allah and they are tolerant whenever they recall it they see Allah's blessings upon them when they remember such painful memories and often Allah himself reminds us of such painful memories so that we can see his favors and blessings upon us today compared to yesterday and remember when you were few and oppressed in the land fearing the people might abduct you but he the almighty sheltered you supported you with his victory and provided you with good things that you might be grateful Whenever there is a moment of going downhill few days weeks months maybe years later when you recover and be in a better place you look back reflect and Ponder upon these old days and be praising Allah azzawajal and thankful to Allah the prophet salallahu used to sit with his companions after Fajr while he's remembering Allah and they are recalling the days of pre-islamic era and the things that they used to do and they laugh of how weird and if we were to say stupid illogical things they used to do because they were not Muslims so they used to laugh about these silly things they used to do in the past and the prophet used to smile with them not only that sometimes the prophet Allah May sit with his companions and tell them about his past which is not that frequent but he would recall few of these memorable events once he said to his companions every prophet had Shepherd sheeps so they said what about you it's the prophet Allah said I as well I worked for the family of so and so and Shepherd their sheep for a number of gold coins or so so he was paid for that when he was young before he got married among the things he recalls and shares this memory with his companions for a purpose he says to them I had witnessed in the house of of Abdullah a treaty or a covenant called helpful fudul and I would not want the world in exchange for witnessing such a treaty and if I were to be called to a similar treaty in Islam I would have answered and this shows you that there is nothing wrong in collaborating with the non-muslims over virtue and righteousness if there is a charity organization that gives relief to the poor and needy and those who were struck by calamities earthquakes floods Etc there's no problem in working with them and helping the poor even if the donations are from non-muslims and given to non-muslims because this is a humanitarian act the prophet said if I were to be called to a similar treaty in Islam though it is not part of the Sharia I would have answered it and this treaty was a call by Abdullah foreign when it was known by the tribes around Mecca and the people of Makkah that a lot of Injustice was done so quraish used to do a lot of Injustice to others in the Haram area in the sanctuary and this was unheard of so they had to take a stand and they signed this treaty that whomever is being oppressed or treated unjustly the whole of quraish according to this treaty would stand in the face of the oppressor and Avenge the victims among his memories that people usually did not know of before becoming a messenger noticed something that was really odd and strange he says that I know of a rock in Mecca whenever I passed by it it used to read me Salaam it used to say assalamu alaikum before I was revealed to by Allah azzawajal and I know this Rock's location till date I know where it is in Mecca so this is a memory though Vivid yet profound because it prepared the prophet Allah for something that was much bigger and that he where to be revealed to by the angel with the message of Allah the prophet saws even when he was secured in Medina even when he was safe among his people he remembered the old days he remembered the trials of Allah azzawajal the calamities the hardship he says I was intimidated in the sight of Allah when no one else was intimidated and I was harmed and abused physically when no one was harmed or abused and I remember 30 days and 30 nights Bilal and I had nothing to eat that was suitable for a living creature except something that Bilal could hide underneath his arm so that they would not take it from him 30 days and nights a whole month and the prophet had enough he had barely anything to consume for himself and for Bilal as well such hardship engraves the goodness people do to you at times of hardship you never forget this and the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam remembered the good things that were offered and done to him even by the disbelievers after the battle of Bader in the second year of Hijra there were prisoners of War and while they were in captivity the prophet salallahu remembered and he said if we're alive and he interceded for these stinking prisoners I would have set them free for his sake after they had rejected him and stoned him until his feet were bleeding when he went to Mecca he was afraid that if he enters Makkah again the Idol worshipers of Makkah would kill him so he needed someone to give him protection offered this protection and went to the Masjid of al-haram and announced it to the whole tribes of quraish that Muhammad is in my custody and under my protection and whoever lays a hand on him then he has to answer to me and nobody ever said or did anything to the prophet which made the prophet saws recall his favor even after his death and the prophet indeed remembered the favors of the Muslims as well he said no one had ever done me a favor except I would have repaid him in full or more anyone except Abu Bakr he had done so much to me I could not repay him Allah the almighty will repay him and there is no wealth that had benefited me more than the wealth of Abu Bakr also the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam loved his companions and loved his relatives from his companions one of the most beloved people to his heart was Hamza even may Allah be pleased with him and Hamza was the prophet's paternal uncle and at the same time he was his brother through suckling they were all brothers from suckling they had the same wet nurse and we all know that Hamza was martyred and killed in the battle of uhud and the one who killed him was Washi IBN who was a slave to Hind binturutuba and she ordered him to assassinate and kill Hamza if he can because Hamza Ali and um a third companion from Benny Talib managed to kill her father her uncle and her brother so she was outrage and wanted vengeance so she told him if you kill Hamza you were set free so he ambushed him and he threw a spear at him without him noticing him he could not face him in battle nobody could face Hamza in battle because he was a fierce Warrior and the prophet described him to be the lion of Allah so he managed to kill him and years passed by and Hamza and and why she was free roaming the Earth but he didn't feel good and Allah through Islam in his art so he came to the prophet Allah and gave him the Pledge of Allegiance and accepted Islam then he asked the prophet if he were if he has safety and no one would attack him so the prophet said yes you're a Muslim you're safe so then he revealed his face and told him that I am Washi and the prophet immediately recognized that he's the Killer of his uncle so he asked him how did you kill my uncle and when he described to the prophet Allah the process made Dua for him forgiveness Etc but because of the memory of his dear Uncle to his heart the prophet said to him I have a request if you can don't show me your face again because whenever I see your face I'll remember my uncle Hamza and what you had done to him and I don't feel good about it this is what some painful memories do to you the prophet salallahu also remembered the good memories the love of his life the mother of the Believers Aisha says I never felt jealous of any of the prophets or the wives except from Khadijah though I've never met her and I've never seen her I was very jealous of her because the prophet so often mentioned her name Khadijah did this Khadijah did that Khadija used to like this and whenever he slaughtered or sacrificed a ram he would order give portion of this to this woman and that woman and this woman they were friends of Khadijah the prophet never forgot the sweet memory of Khadijah and how his life was perfect with her may Allah be pleased with her and the prophet salallahu also had sad memories that would sort of haunt him every now and then he always remembered his mom his mother died when he was six years of age so he barely remembers things about her yet the love of the mother in the heart is something that cannot be forgotten and the prophet Allah once visited her grave and he wept a lot and he made everyone around him weep as well and he said I requested Allah azzawajal to seek forgiveness for my mother and Allah denied me and I requested him to visit her grave and Allah granted me this request how many times do we recall and remember our parents if they were dead how many times do we remember them when they're alive by severing them by trying to be dutiful obedient and respectful by trying to make them laugh and be happy and enjoy the few remaining days of their lives and finally the prophet Allah had beautiful memory of his companions whom he loved and shared their pains with them yet they were martyred or died before him the prophet salallahu as with him says once went and prayed for the Martyrs of ushud and those were who were buried in al-baqir and that was like a farewell bidding the living and the dead as if the prophet was bidding us farewell as living and he was also bidding the dead that was at the last days of his life"
