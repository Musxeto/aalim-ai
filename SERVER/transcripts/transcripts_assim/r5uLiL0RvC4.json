  "transcript": "Sajid says chef should we ascribe ourselves to the Salif and call ourselves Salafi as this path is the correct path and also to distinguish ourselves from a little bita this depends now the general trend who was some Malcolm will muslimeen this is a person the Quran it is Allah who called you Muslims so when someone comes to me and says hey Hassan what are you I'm a Muslim say I know what kind of a Muslim what do you mean but what kind of a Muslim he said yeah we have Sunnis we have shiri so I said I'm a Sunni so what kind of a Sunni so what are you going on he said yeah because we have Sufis we have super Sufis we have hanafis matter we DS Saudis said are I'm from a hallucinogen ah ok what kind of Alyson noÃ«l Gemara come on you're wasting my time said no no we have to know no you don't have to know I'm a Muslim . now the trend is becoming that who are you their armor Salafi okay what kind of a Salafi who what kind of self are you following because we have Salafis we have super Salafis we have jihadi Salafis and and they confuse people and they won't be happy with you because some Salafis if you don't follow their 4 or 5 a Lama or Samaha then you're not a true Salafi because you're not on the man hatch and if you follow the Quran and Sunnah follow bimbisara they means still you have to refine your art either your many Haj otherwise you are an innovator this is totally wrong going around saying my name is asommus Salafi and or Salafi and they they add labels and this is part of sectarianism this is taking parties and abiding by it by it this is dividing the Ummah there is no need for that a Salafi a true Salafi is a person who's a Muslim with a clear a peda that follows the appeal of illusion l-jamaa of the Seraph but the way that people are using it now it's being abused and sherry Burnette Amin says that this is not permissible and this is part of sectarianism as practice nowadays"
