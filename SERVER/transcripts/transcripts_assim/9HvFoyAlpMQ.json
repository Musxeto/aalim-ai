  "transcript": "peace be upon you for the greatest of profits is someone's his own legal Mohammad symbol Louisville really he was saying I'm among all the prophets more Hamlet was the last as he's was a mission of the greatest ask there was only moral degeneration people come to a little adoration 40 nations smilla rahmani raheem hamdu lillahi rabbil aalameen sallallaho salamo alikom oboro-sama tyndall al-amin nabina muhammad anwar ali yo sabia Jermaine assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh rumor mill hot Bob may allah be pleased with him accepted islam but this was a bit late he accepted islam six years after the revelation started to the prophet alayhi salatu salam and there were a lot of companions before him who accepted islam yet though he came a bit late but soon he came in the first row among the closest to the Prophet array salatu salam actually he became the second best the second highest ranked in the muslims among the companion salalah warrior send'em and why was that because of his belief because of his devotion to islam to the prophet salallahu alayhi were early he was Elam the prophet salallahu you seldom gave who the glad tidings that he is in paradise once the Prophet sallallahu ala Salem was talking to his companions about a vision and he said that I entered paradise and this can be one of two either that this was in a night vision where the Prophet Ali salatu salam dreamt it and we all know that the dreams of messengers and prophets of Allah are a revelation and they're all true and that is why Ibrahim peace be upon him when he saw in his night vision in his dream that he was slaughtering his son is married he woke up and he went to his mail and said o my son I see that I slaughter you and immediately his son who was a messenger as well but he was only 14 or 15 years old at the time said Oh father do as you are instructed this is a revelation from Allah you do not consult me and Ibraheem was not consulting him he was telling him about this so that he would prepare him for slaughter so the vision of prophets and messages of Allah are a revelation and they are all true and the Prophet tells us that he saw this in a vision or he saw this when he was ascended to the heavens in what is known as it is Trotwood Maharaj the Night Journey he tells us that he went into paradise and he saw this beautiful palace this beautiful mansion with a woman outside of it a beautiful woman and he asked the arc angel jibreel gibril whose mansion is this and he told him that this is omar i'ma hop up and the Prophet sallallahu ala hear you say them said Omar because I remembered your jealousy otherwise I would have entered this palace this mansion but I remembered how jealous you were and armor cried peace be upon the Prophet as and may allah be pleased with Omar Omar wept and said o prophet of allah do i feel jealous because of you you are the blessing of Allah upon us do I feel jealous because of you this indicates that remark is in Paradise may allah be pleased with him and anyone who says otherwise he's not a muslim anyone who doubts this is not a muslim anyone who talks negatively about her is not a muslim it was reported once that he was attacked by a number of the men of  the pagans he was attacked and he fought with them for more than six hours until he fell to the ground alone now whenever I read this story I'm astonished anyone who does martial arts knows that if you are fit you could probably fight you could probably aspire for 10 minutes 15 minutes a one who's unfit would not be able to do this for 30 seconds if you just fight or wrestle with someone 30 seconds and then you're out of air Romar may allah be pleased with him did this for more than six hours until it was almost sunset from midday to sunset on his own fighting a number of people who are attacking him because he was a Muslim whenever we read such stories we are astonished this is not natural and had it not been reported in authentic books we would not have accepted it for example cinema evening a quar may allah be pleased with him one of the great warriors of islam not a lot of people know about him but this man in salado Davey and the treaty of her davia gave the pledge of allegiance to the Prophet that is some three times in the beginning and the middle and the end every time the Prophet says where is salamah and he gives him the pledge of allegiance to fight to the death and in the middle he asks where is salamah and salamah comes again and at the end he asked where Solomon why was that well it was reported that once group of nomads attacked the camels of zakat where the prophet used to keep these camels of charity they attacked these camels and they took them away and only sedima and another man saw this and they heard the report so salimah told his friend to go and tell the Prophet Isis ramp to get a posse to pursue them and he set on foot after those who took the camels and they were at horseback imagine that was early morning just after the break of dawn the story goes and this is in sahih muslim and elsewhere the story goes that he ran on foot until he managed to follow them whenever they entered the valley he used to go on top of the mountain and throw them with rocks killing or injuring whoever he can they sent three or four warriors to fight him and he would fight them on foot they would come on top of the hill to try to fight him he would kill them all and then goes back runs after them and kills those who are at the end of the caravan and attacks them and whoever he kills he puts a sign so that when the Muslims come they see this did person they know that cenima killed him and that whatever belongs to this that person belongs to salama because the Prophet said that is awesome whoever kills a person then he owns whatever belongings this man or did man have and that is why at the Prophet re so Sam said mankato a cotillion fella who sellable imagine this took place from the break of dawn till sunset on foot and whatever he killed someone he would say hood ha unable to acquire take it and I'm the son of Al acquire and they were petrified from the name and they were telling him while fighting you're the same one who started following us at the beginning of the day and you said yes he managed to do all of this from the break of dawn until almost sunset until the soldiers of Allah came with the Prophet al-assal salam where he managed to get all the camels of the Prophet Elisha ram and saved it all and was that it no what did he say to the prophet alayhi salaatu son when he met him this is sha Allah what will we know after the break so stay tuned oh it was the last welcome back sellable aqua after all of this effort he put into getting and freeing this herd of charity of zakat he met the Prophet allah salah salem and said o prophet of allah give me a few men and I will go and follow these people and annihilate them all and the Prophet said salala assalam o se llama Malik TFS char that you have conquered them so give them the room at the moment they are in their tribe in hotter fan and they're drinking milk now after all of this effort one would expect that salama would take a camel or to mount on a horseback and go back to medina it's a long distance he's been running fighting rescuing this herd for more than 11 hours imagine this endurance and this strength this stamina but not sell em i may allah be pleased with him on their way back one of the Companions said anyone would like to race me on foot to medina anyone are you all afraid he's challenging and salamis said to him don't you have any shame in you don't you expect these men to race you i'll race you i'll take you give me a break after 11 hours ten hours inshallah five hours you still have stamina to race to marathon this man and cinema says that we started running and I was a bit behind because I wanted to keep air just before we see the outskirts of Medina and he said we're running jogging they didn't have any air and their feet they didn't have any you know sneakers that would take them there I don't know how they were running but it was tough and the man had the stamina to jog to run and he says as we reached the outskirts of Medina I put it all in and I raced the man and I till I came just behind him and I smacked him in his back and I said well I've overtaken you and he went and he won whenever we read beautiful stories we know that this is an athlete this is a sportsman not like one of those who is almost stripped naked swimming or jogging or doing whatever he's doing for the sake of a gold medal this is bravery this is what people should do for the cause of Allah not to boast about it not to brag about it and likewise Oh Madame Habib Allah be pleased with him his strength his power was totally devoted to protecting Islam horrible hop up when he wanted to migrate to Medina he did not do this in secrecy he went to the masjid in full armor and he addressed the dignitary of Mecca the pagans all of them were gathering in their tens and hundreds around the Kaaba and he said I am migrating to medina by the way and whoever wants his mother to lose him let him follow me so if anyone would follow me I would kill him and then his mother would not have a son any more look at this bravery look at this manhood and no one dared to go after him the contrary they thought that let us get rid of him he's a pain in the neck we do not want to see him anymore he's causing us more trouble than being away let him go so he left may Allah be pleased with him and during the ten years in Medina he had lots and lots in his hat he did a lot to Islam and to the Muslims Abu Bakr may allah be pleased with him when he was on his dying bed he appointed him as a halifa as a leader of the muslims and that is why he said that if i were to die then may allah be pleased with him is to succeed me he is the successor of abu bakr and that is why he used to be known as halifa to Holly fatir jalila the successor of the successor of the prophet of allah salallahu alayhi Wadi he was seldom the difference between his rain and the rain of Abu Bakr was that Abu Bakr his reign was only for two years and few months a couple of months while his reign was five times as big it was about ten years and a half and that is why the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said in an authentic hadith he said that while I was standing by a well drawing water from it Abu Bakr may allah be pleased with him and Roman king both of them came so Abu Bakr took the bucket and drew one or two buckets but there was some weakness in his drawing and may Allah forgive him then Umar Akmal hop-up came and the bucket turned into a very large one in his hands I had never seen such a mighty person as he in doing such hard work till all the people drank to their satisfaction and watered their camels that knelt down there so scholars interpreted this hadith to be of the great battles and conquest that took place in the time of armor may allah be pleased with him abu bakr only rained for two years and few months and that is why he had little time to manage but he did a lot of things he fought the apostates he sent the army of Osama bin zaid may allah be pleased with him to the north and he collected the Quran and compiled it and he did a lot of things but two years you could manage to do so much weiler Omar had ten years and a half and that is why he managed to do a lot and that is what was meant by the hadith of the bucket becoming very large and the drawing of a bunker is very weak because he had little time and that is why the Prophet said as some may Allah forgive him because this forgiveness means that his brain is very short that he would die may allah be pleased with him now abu bakr did not want this world did not want this life and life did not want him so it was different to the rain of remark yeah let me please with him because Homer did not want this life but this life this world came crawling to him in his brain in his era there were a lot of conquest and victories to Islam that what made the money pour into the Treasury of the Muslims yet remark was not changed by all of this may allah be pleased with him omar was a pious person he was tough even on himself he would not indulge in this life to the extent that he would be a slave of it didn't our prophet alayhi salatu salam terrace abdul Denari with dirham may the slave of dinar and derham get no success why was that because if you're a slave of your wallet if you're a slave of money this is your driver and this is what makes you do well or do badly but if you are a slave of Allah if you are a servant although almighty then Allah will make this world come to you crawling on its knees I'm army allah be pleased with him was a generous person he was not as rich as the other companions but he was generous with whatever he had it was reported that the prophet alayhi salam salam once instructed his companions to come and give charity so he came with half of what he owns fifty percent of his possession brought it to the prophet alayhi salatu salam as charity the prophet elias alot some on the 7th year of hijra gave him a portion of high buck and this was the era where a lhasa gave money to the muslims and this did not make him rich because he was rich by his Spirit he came to the prophet and it's awesome and said o prophet of Allah this portion my share in high bar is the most valuable thing i have and i would like to give it to Allah and to the prophet alayhi salatu salam so the Prophet said well I'll advise you with a better advice take this and make it as a walk and maybe this transistor endowment so make it so that it is not sold it is not given and it is not inherited this is solely for allah azzawajal and whatever comes from it give it to the orphans give it to the widowed and give it to the poor and so he did may allah be pleased with him and everyone knows that i wanna may allah be pleased with him was a strong person not only physically and not only in taking decisive decisions but also he was strong in forms of worship the prophet salallahu REO to sell em once in one night passed by his companions and this was the habit of the Prophet that is awesome he used to pass by his companions to check on them if they were offering night prayer or not this was reported when he he visited his daughter Fatima and his son-in-law and cousin Ali even i bethought it may allah be pleased with them both and by the way Fatima is married to the cousin of the prophetess of the first cousin who is Ali ABI talib and this is a clear evidence that in Islam there is nothing wrong in marrying your cousin whether it's paternal or maternal cousin this is permissible for a man to marry his cousin of course a female cousin in some countries they think that a cousin is like a brother it's forbidden no this is wrong the Prophet himself alesis am married his maternal cousin Zainab and Josh and I leave me batati married his cousin's daughter Fatima may Allah be pleased with them also this is permissible in Islam and it does not by any means contradict or conflict or go against the teachings of Islam going back to our subject remark may allah be pleased with him was once praying night prayer when the prophetess m was doing his routine and the profit by the way and this what brought the subject to our minds the prophet went to his daughter Fatima and to Ali bin Abi Talib and they found them lying down on the ground so he said don't you pray night prayer and I'll he said well the souls are at the hands of Allah whenever he wants us to wake up we will wake up and pray and the Prophet left the house a little bit disappointed and angered by this response and saying that man was mostly arguing what kinda in santa clara shaken gedolah man argues a lot instead of complying to the instruction and safe yes profit we will do this we will correct this o prophet of allah he's saying what can a nice and acknowledging in gedolah the Prophet passed by Abu Bakr his house and by homers house and he heard abu bakr reciting the quran silently without any voice and he said abu bakr why are you doing this why are you reciting the quran silently he said o prophet of allah i have made a la hear me he's the one I'm talking to why Lamar who was reciting the Quran in a loud voice said o prophet of allah i wake up the sleepy and i kick away the shape on and the Prophet said Alice off salam I'm up go a little bit lower and abu bakr raised a bit your voice this is all the time we have for today's program until we meet next time fee amanillah assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
