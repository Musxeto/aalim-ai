  "title": "Will Abu Lahab receive less punishment on Mondays as he was happy on the day the Prophet ï·º was born?",
  "transcript": "from muhammad and he says is it true that abu lahab will receive less punishment on mondays because he became happy on the day when the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was born now this hadith is found in say al-bukhari and this confuses a lot of the people especially those who tend to reject the hadith or those who are inclined to follow the whims and desires and reject concepts of the hadith because a hadith or two could not go down the throat easily and similarly is this hadith at hand what is the hadith first of all it is narrated in sahih al-bukhari who is by the way he is not a companion so he did not hear it from the prophet ali because he that did not meet the prophet sallam so uh zubair says when was addressing the issue of may allah be pleased with earth was a concubine a slave girl who was owned by abu lahab who is one of the prophet's paternal uncles and he died as a kafir and there's a chapter in the quran cursing him and stating that he's in hell fire what did abu lahab do he abused the prophet al-islam he cursed him he attacked him and tried his level best to make the people reject the prophet allah's message that's why it was revealed in the quran says that thueba was a concubine that was freed by abu lahab when the prophet was born when she gave the news to him saying that a nephew of yours was born so he was so happy and he set her free roorwa says some of abu lahab's relatives so we don't know who these relatives are saw in a dream so this is a vision not a reality or a hadith or something proven the quran of the sunnah it's a vision so abu lahab in a dream and he was in a bad shape so he asked what had happened to you he said i'm in a very bad place in hell however i was given something to drink because of me freeing to waiver setting her free when i was happy because of the prophet so is this possible the ayah of the quran states that and for those who disbelieve will be the fire of hell death is not decreed for them so they may die nor will its torment be lightened for them so the torment would not be lightened for them what does that mean it means that it would not be reduced so this ayah means that it wouldn't be reduced what about this hadith number one it's not a hadith it's a narration from zubair so it's not attributed to the prophet nor it's attributed to any of the companions thirdly it's a dream and in islam we don't base any value on dreams where we can say halal and haram right or wrong therefore this hadith is just a random statement that has no weight in islam nevertheless is there any problem to say that allah can favor whomever he wishes by reducing the punishment as he wills no there's no problem in that doesn't it go against the ayah you just recited no it doesn't because the ayah talks about torment in general not to favor them in specific areas but the torment is in hell still it's not going to be reduced upon them like in the case of abu talib where the prophet told us allah that due to his assistance to the prophet salallahu he was alive allah reduced his level in hell fire to be of what you know therefore the hadith is not authentic as per a hadith to the prophet is just a saying it's just a vision it's not a attributed to the prophet salallahu to the companions and allah knows best you"
