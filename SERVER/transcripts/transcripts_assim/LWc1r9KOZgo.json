  "transcript": "and the last and third question when we wipe over our socks for w Do we wipe over the top or bottom and what is the evidence the Sunnah is that we wipe over the top of the foot of the sock or of the not the sides and not the bottom and this is what all scholar of Islam had said when talking about wiping over the socks and the Hadith of Ali may Allah be pleased with him which was mentioned in AB da and elsewhere he said if religion was by Logic then we would have wiped the bottom of the socks instead of the upper part however I saw the prophet Alat only wiping the top of his socks and this indicates that Islam is not something that we do and we require a justification a logical reason for what we're doing no Islam is to submit your will to Allah believing that it is the truth and believing that the all wise only commands us to do what is beneficial for us so we accept this we embrace it and we execute it it's not something that goes by Logic and this shows us how compliant Ali may Allah be pleased with him as well as the rest of the companions with Allah's commands if we if we were to wipe the bottom of the sock we would only soil our hands and the dirt would still remain but this is the command of Allah to wipe only the top part of the socks it's a symbolic gesture to indicate our belief and commitment and to show and explain how we follow the Shar and Allah Knows Best"
