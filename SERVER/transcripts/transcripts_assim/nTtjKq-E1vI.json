  "title": "Does the prohibition of breaking ties with kinship include distant relatives? | Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "rush it says as ties should not be cut with relatives does it include first relatives there are parents brothers sisters or cousins second cousins or distant relatives are also included well first of all cutting the next of kin severing kinship is a major sin and this is given now your relationship with your kinship varies so my relationship to my parents is definitely not like my relationship to my siblings and to my siblings is not like to my cousins and to my cousins is not like to my second or third cousins and so on and therefore each category varies in the way I connect to them so I connect totally and fully to my parents in terms of obedience being dutiful respectful and financially supporting them far more greater than I am to my siblings so each one of them is yes if you sever your kinship your sinful but my second cousins for example I can call them once every couple of months and still be considered to be on good terms with them but I can't do that with my siblings let alone my parents because if I don't call them my if I don't call my parents on like daily basis and check on them I'm not beautiful and if I don't call my siblings like every couple of days or every week and check on them and meet them and see them I'm considered to be severing the ties of kinship but how do we differentiate and how do we measure that this is shivering or connecting scholars say that connecting your kinship is something dependent on the earth on what is acknowledged and accepted among the community and the society so they say that when the society considers something to be shivering the kinship than it is nowadays for example if you give your sibling a call every couple of days for 20 to 15 to 30 seconds how things are we doing how the kids house work do you need anything yeah well I haven't seen you your mom was fine I went there yesterday and maybe next week we have this and yeah okay yeah okay good talking to you said I'm not myself that's it this would be connecting to your kinship but if for example your brother invites you to his son's wedding and you don't show up this is silvering kinship especially if you don't apologize any accepts your apology for a legitimate reason so you have to weigh the pros and cons but again your further relatives do not have the same rights as the close relatives of yours and Allah knows best"
