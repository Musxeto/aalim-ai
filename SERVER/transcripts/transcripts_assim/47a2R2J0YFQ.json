  "transcript": "Sadman from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Sheikh, last week I asked you a question about a school. I hope you remember it. No, I don't. I don't. What's your question? What did I answer you? So what changed? Sheikh, the Christian cross in the dress, I was worried about it. I answered you as well. So why are you repeating the question again Sadman? It doesn't make any sense. I said if they don't compel you to do anything haram. Now if you say no, they don't force me to do anything haram except having the logo with the cross, put a patch on it, do something about it, but you can still go and study. This cross that they have as a logo, you're not compelled to wear it. You can turn it upside down. You can put something on it. You can wear a blazer on top of it. You can do many things and Allah knows best."
