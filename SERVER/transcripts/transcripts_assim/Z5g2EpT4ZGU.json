  "transcript": "[Music] sir sir I have a big question actually uh there is a problem in the house okay in India there's a problem going on in the house some uh bad things are happening like evil things in the house uh they are not letting the family stay in the house some like that so what shall we do I don't know I do not know the Unseen so when you talk Ambiguously like this it might be there are Crooks breaking into the house there might be mice and reptiles eating the people there might be gin there I don't know what you're referring to Sir Gins and snakes like in one room when the family members are going during uh like after a time uh sunset time they are telling do not enter this room this is ours and when nobody is there in the room everything like from the uh cupboard the clothes are thrown away and and even the family members who are living over there they are reacting in different way and you know they are saying do not enter this room and just leave the house okay so one of the two either you guys are hallucinating and you are convinced that the house is possessed and your Hallucination is making you hear these things and whenever one says to the other did you hear that and they say yeah yeah we heard that and you start to believe this lie or no the actually the house is possessed so if the house is possessed what to do the Jin cannot harm us and When We Fear them they become stronger and they grow more influential so what to do should we call the Ghostbusters there's no such thing read Surah Al Bak in the house it burns them read repeatedly the last two verses of specifically the last two verses of theah Al Bak the prophet says it prevents the Jin from entering your hearts for three days and nights read repeatedly aat and blow around the house and this burns them alive and continue to do this repeatedly with full conviction that Allah is their lord Allah is stronger than them and Allah will make them go out if this does not improve and fix rapidly you can do this r on water and you can sprinkle it around the corners of the house and at the entrances of the house and do that repeatedly until the house is clean but never fear them if I'm in my house and this happened few times I hear the doors banging and the lights turned off and I say and I speak I say turn it off turn it on I'm not going to be afraid of you and I read the ayat loudly in the last two verses of Surah Bak it doesn't happen again so be strong depend on Allah and never fear them and nothing would happen inshallah"
