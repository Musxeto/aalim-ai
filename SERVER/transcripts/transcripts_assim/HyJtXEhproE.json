  "transcript": "Fahim from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah Wa Jazakum. First of all, such an agnostic person must not care about others before caring about himself. All what he's doing is going down the drain. Allah will not reward him for that because he himself is not a believer. It's like a carpenter who fixes people's doors and windows while his own home, his door and windows are broken. It doesn't make any sense. He said, he told me I'll teach you something that will protect you from the devils and the jinn. And he read Ayatul Kursi."
