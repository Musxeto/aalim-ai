  "transcript": "and you as well I just wanted to ask you know in a basically in India there are many people who say this is fake Hadith uh came after 300 years after the prophet you know how should I debate with these people how should I answer them thank you okay Allah first of all those who want to undermine Islam and attack it they tried to attack the Quran and they were immediately attacked back and there were so many Defenders of the Quran so they retreated they thought of it again and thought that the best way to undermine Islam is to pretend that they're honoring the Quran while insulting and trying to take away the Hadith and the Sunnah of the Prophet which the Quran itself says you have to abide by it and you have to understand the Quran through the Sunnah so they come up with these allegations false lies totally bogus they say that the Hadith came to 100 years after the Quran and this is a total falsehood and lie the Hadith was written at a lifetime of the Prophet himself among those who were known among the companions who write everything that the prophet says may Allah be pleased with a man with his father he had more than two big camel's load of scriptures that were filled with the prophets sayings and words was one of those who memorized everything that the prophet is all narrated and preserved and memorized the Sunnah of the Prophet Islam protected it and handed over to the tabirin who wrote it down and memorized it who themselves handed out to the table in the first three honored and favorite generations of all times so these Hypocrites liberals who had never end their lives read the Quran once and if you ask them a random Ayah in the Quran or read to them a random Hadith from the Sunnah and ask them ask them which one is an Ayah and which one is Hadith they would not know they can't even differentiate they don't have the knowledge to tell which is which and if you go to the shortest Surah of the Quran and ask them what's the interpretation what's the meaning of the words they don't know yet they have the audacity to come and sit back on their chairs and lean on their sofas and say that the Hadith was written 200 years ago this is a lie so don't listen to these ignorant imbeciles who don't practice Islam look at their wives and daughters and you can tell how modest such people who are trying to defend Islam are pretending to how bigger liars and hypocrites they are look at their conduct their the way they deal with people and you will definitely know that they have no relationships shipped to Islam and Allah Knows Best"
