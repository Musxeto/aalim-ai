  "title": "Can I lick food, hold glass or feed my child with left hand if my right hand is busy assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so um sometimes I know we're not supposed to eat with our left hand but sometime I find myself licking my left hand when maybe I'm carrying food and my thumb deep into the food or something drops on my left hand and I just cly Li it or sometime when I'm drinking water and I'm heing with my right hand so I use my left hand and I support it with the right hand i'm might thanful for doing this way you not allowed to use your left hand in eating or drinking or feeding your son with your left hand now some people do this they hold the cup with their left hand and they put it underneath the right hand and they do this so that they would convince themselves that it's the right hand that is doing the actual drinking and this is not true because if they were to let let go of their left hand the glass would fall so actually it's the left hand that they're drinking with and this is totally prohibited one has to avoid using the left hand to the best of their ability maybe the only case that you're grabbing a sandwich for example a big cheeseburger some of us are fasting so they were swallowing the saliva when I mentioned the cheeseburger man up it's only few hours so you hold the juicy big fluffy uh uh cheeseburger and you take a bite you're holding it with both hands this might be an exception and Allah Knows Best"
