  "transcript": "the prophet furthermore goes on in in his short concise speech to abolish to abolish yusuri and he tells us that this is one of the major sins in islam and when we look and reflect 15 centuries ago what kind of ribba was there i'll give you a loan of a thousand you return them 1100. very simple very easy look what this had grown into nowadays you have institutions that facilitate riba mandates reba in slaves countries and individuals through river the imf the international monetary fund enslaves countries for billions and billions not of loans rather of interest compound interest the countries have paid the original loan years and decades ago but they keep on milking them in a recent form of colonism and everybody is working hard to pay off such a debt and they keep on growing richer and richer and looking for other countries to colonize and to enslave people nowadays work more than their ability to pay off their mortgages to pay off off their loans they got for buying a car or a property or the furniture or to finance their summer vacation everybody lives on credit cards and they pay compound interest something that the prophet warned against allah 15 centuries ago and the muslims don't pay attention to the curse that allah has placed on the people who take riba and give interest in riba and witness this contract writing and those who write and keep the books they're all in the curse of allah alike no one has the upper hand over the other they're all equal you"
