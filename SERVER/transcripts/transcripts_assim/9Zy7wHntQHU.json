  "transcript": "and alhamdulillah health Anatomy salli ala muhammad analyzer mean nabina muhammad in while he was happy humanity had a Western mission that he Diomedes am Abbado assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh and welcome to this 50th episode I think I'm losing track of of the numbers but the Charlotte is the 58th 50th of the Islamic concise and book on hook and we are still discussing the chapters that deal with marriage divorce holder etc and one type of what is usually discussed in such topics is known as El ela ela and it's translates to suspension of marriage and this is when a man swears not to have any sexual intercourse with his wife indefinitely and or he specifies a period more than four months so is this a divorce no are they still married well actually he swore by Allah not to touch her indefinitely or for a year or for six months is this Helen says no he's sinful for that because this harms his wife if it is more than four months but if it is within the four months period this is permissible okay what does ELab mean ela is stemmed from the verb Allah which means to swear Allah says in the Quran lil Adina you learn I mean Missa a hymn terrible so Arabic yeah sure for those who swear not to touch not to have intercourse with the wise they may anticipate the period of four months after that they have to end this so you alone means to swear by Allah also in the famous hadith when a man who was a monk used to come down from his place of worship and up in the mountains and see his brother who was a sinful person and he advises him and he tells him fear Allah what you're doing is not good this is Haram etc and the brother doesn't pay heed he continues to sin one day this monk got angry and he said by Allah Allah will never forgive you so Allah said who is it who swears upon me I would not forgive I have forgiven his sins and cancelled all of your good deeds the Arabic word mandala via a la la who is it who is swearing and there are so many other examples for the origin of this word so now we have a situation a woman comes and says my husband said by Allah I will not have an intimacy with you for a whole year what should we do the answer would be he's entitled to do that performance after the four months are over easily either given the choice to expiate his oath by feeding ten poor people or clothing them or he must divorce the woman if he says no I am still insisting on not having intercourse for another eight months in this case the judge asks him to divorce her if he refuses either options then the judge steps in and overrides his rights and he divorces that a wife from him and this is known as dissolved mint of the marriage contract solution of the Manas contract or in Arabic called facade this is within the powers of the judge himself to do that now if we were to look at the power of the word and I've stated this before and I always emphasize on it in Islam there are people who claim that it's just gossiping it's just talking we're just playing around and this is unacceptable in Islam with a single word you can enter Islam and by the when we say word in Arabic al Colima can refer to a single word like a tree and can refer to a phrase like la ilaha illaallah or a sentence so this is considered to be a word it's like when you say to someone I'll give you a word of advice he's not gonna say one single word is gonna say a sentence or maybe a couple of sentences but this is all considered to be a word so when this word you can enter Islam and with a similar but in the opposite direction you can say a word that gets you out of the hold'em Islam you can get married by just saying I accept and you can divorce your wife by saying I divorce you so the impact of what we say is huge Allah says in Chapter nine surah at-taubah well in Eltham layer odin in the mccune ana hold one another and if you were to ask them they will say merely we were just fooling around all say to them ab allahi variety what a sulie couldn't do test a single were you mocking with allah his verses and signs and his messenger were you walking around do not seek forgiveness do not give your excuses you have become disbelievers after being believers meaning that you've exited the fold of Islam why because they were just mocking around by just simply saying a joke about Allah or the Koran or Islam these three hypocrites we're exposed because they were during the Battle of Tabuk not the actual battle they were traveling so at nighttime when camping they used to chitchat so the three two of them spoke and one was silent listening and the two said we have not seen like the Companions of the Prophet al-assad Salaam big bellies lying tongues and the scariest the most scared when meeting the enemy so they're criticizing the Companions so Allah revealed these verses of the Quran from Surat October exposing them and taking them out of the fold of Islam therefore it is extremely important to watch the words that come of your mouth in a moment of anger and rage thousands of men divorce their wives and then come knocking on our doors sure can you find a way so that we can reconcile and get back together how do you control yourself in the beginning none of this would have happened now this I would not have intimacy with my wife for more than four months and you and I swear on that this was practiced in the past among the Arabs nowadays really we would find people saying this but if we move on a little bit to the following section we will find something that is quite used nowadays and this is known of Bihar what is of the heart of Bihar is stemmed from the word of aha the verb is vara Hara and a vowel is my back it's called vada and this is a format of prohibition when I'm angry with my wife and I say you are Haram you are prohibited upon me like the back of my sister or my daughter or like my mother you are to me Haram like my aunt or any one of my mom's so with this phrase with this word that came out of my mouth I said and I made my wife Haram so did I divorce dancers no I did not divorce her so what was that this wasn't a divorce rather it was a leha a prohibition I made something that was halal for me prohibited it's like saying well aji I will not use my phone now I swore about not using my phone so I made using the phone something restricted upon me what you do I have to expiate how to explain free a slave or feed ten poor people from the middle standard of a meal or to clothe 10 poor people if not possible then I two fast three days but when it comes to the heart and saying to your wife that she is Haram for you as if she is your mother now this is something more serious so if you go through this section Allah described it as iniquities and false and the husband who does this then his wife becomes how long for him to approach including how long for him to kiss or foreplay until he expiates for the sin that he had committed allah azzawajal says in the quran those who separate themselves from their wives by saying you are as unlawful to me as my mother and then go back on what they have said must atone by freeing slave before the couple may resume their full marital relationship so this is what has to be done that they have to expiate and the Prophet said Ali his salat was said in an authentic hadith when this case came in front of him he said do not come near her until you have done what Allah has ordered you so what is the atonement of the heart if a person has done this and again this is not very famous among the people nowadays but it is still sometimes we get rare cases of it however why would the man do unfortunately this is done when a man reaches a stage of not only wanting to separate from his wife he could have done this through divorce he wants to punish himself to hurt himself not hurting his wife and unfortunately this is happening a lot I get through marriage counseling people coming to me and the man is practicing and he says to me share my wife makes me do things I could never ever dream of doing she manages to get the worst in me and this is difficult to be able to get the worst of a person this requires a lot of evil and deviancy unfortunately and each spouse can do this to his or her spouse magnificently but in a negative way not in a positive way so the man comes and says I'm a calm person I never fight I'm a mellow type of man whatever my wife says even if I don't if I disagree the worst thing I can do is not to reply but she curses she shouts she breaks things at the house she she takes off my glasses so that I can see she takes off she takes my mobile and throws it in the wall and breaks it into pieces she says awful things about my mother about my siblings she insults me so bad that I end up when leaving the home in a state of trauma I listen to music I'm a practicing Muslim but I listen to music i watch movies I may go to areas that I would never have dreamt of even driving through so it's like Satan is overriding me making me do heinous and her on things and whatever I get feel remorseful or regretful I get this feeling of yeah do it man do it she'll be the one sinful for that because she's pushing you to sin and I'm I'm unable to control myself share a nice espa√±ola now I've heard this a lot it's not justifiable the reason you're given your giving are lame you'll be held accountable day of judgment for your actions not her but she would be accountable for pushing you this far so similarly when a man is so frustrated with his wife he simply says that word and drops his bomb you are prohibited like my mother so they come in not the doors share what can we do what should we give in order to expiate the sin of ours well the Quran has stated this clearly in surat al mu J Dilla Ora mujadara a woman came to the prophet Isaiah and said o prophet of Allah my husband said this so the Prophet said I have no answer to you but to say that you are prohibited for him as his mother is prohibited for him and she said o prophet of Allah she argued the Prophet I married him long ago and I conceived the children and they breastfed from me until I was old and tired and weary he comes at the end of my life and says such a statement so Allah revealed this surah and in it it says that those who do such a thing they are indeed saying something that is false and they are transgressing and the expiation was mentioned in the quran before they can get intimate one free slave if this is not possible due to the lack of cash or the inability to allocate a slave like we are nowadays then you must fast two consecutive months whoa 60 days yep without a break you have to fast out those if you diabetic if you're unable to fast you have medical reasons in this case the third alternative is that you feed 60 poor people about 1.25 kilograms of rice each so this is the expiration for a person who falls into this grave sin of Bihar then should we go to the periods waiting periods or should we go to the questions because we have a lot of backlog regarding questions and most likely maybe subhana Allah I don't know but hopefully next Saturday we will devote a whole session for the questions so yeah I think I think we should go for the questions just to be safe rather than to be sorry okay hustlin says as the endowment is binding and cannot be revoked my question is if a person intends for endowment but changes his intention for whatever reason may it be is this permissible as you've stated in the beginning endowment is binding so the answer is no if he uttered the words he cannot change it and we've just talked about the importance of the word once it leaves your mouth it becomes man binding so if a person says I want to locate this plot of land for charity after saying this verbally he said oops no tell you what let me a locate the other one too late it has been already said and you are committed to it but if you are thinking of building a message a intending to do this doing your calculations you have not committed yourself verbally or in writing about it you have not talked about it is just in your mind this is not binding this is an intention you can change that to something else something more something less even cancel it because nothing is binding to you at this moment and stage Rashid says in which er can we see our own extra dress after the door over pollute the vast majority of scholars say that after rising from record in The Witcher prayer it is recommended to say Allah Medina Freeman hadn't won a finicky man our faith and to the rest of the short dorm which the prophet Alice Aslam had taught a lesson in know Ali may Allah be pleased with a man with his father but they also say that it is permissible to add to this your own to us because it is a place of dua providing that you make these doors in arabic but if you don't know how to ask allah in arabic then you can insert your own door in your native language personally i would highly recommend that you do not do that in volute a twitter because the closest you are is when you are in your suit and in every salat you have minimum force suit so you can easily do as many to us as you wish in your suit without any problem insha'Allah a free now says in the subcontinent it's a common practice to give Salam to elders by bowing and touching their feet especially on wedding at all please say something on it sir it is not permissible to bow to anyone and this kind of humility is only reserved for allah azza wajal so bowing and prostrating is reserved for Allah the Almighty now if the culture mandates that you need that you squat that you bow and sometimes that you prostrate you have to fight this because this is against your religion what if your parents argue and are angry with you no problem unfortunately that you cannot please them by this freezing Allah there is no obedience to a creature while disobeying the Creator Subhanahu WA Ta'ala therefore you have to be diplomatic dutiful polite but not to obey them when they order you to do something Haram rush me says can we raise our hands for dois after it being a mouse after every for prayer raising the hands after concluding the fall Salam aleikum to lost Salaam aleikum o Allah and then you raise your hands a big drop why are you making drawn the chef's we're making dog because we want a lot to respond to us are you sure yeah of course then you're not doing it because it's a cultural thing and because everybody else is doing it no no no we want a lot to respond to answer well I have good news and I have bad news which one you want first whatever share the good news is that the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam taught us when to make dua that is most likely to be answered and he said that there are two places in salat during the salat when there is a connection between us and our Lord where Allah answers our do our most likely and that is in every student whenever you are Institute Allah responds to your door and you the closest you can ever be to Allah when you are Institute secondly Allah responds lance's Eldora just before concluding the salat with Salam so at the end of my jihad my salutation after I made the door a llama and now became a vegan advocate in my fitness he had the gel now I can start asking my door for 5 minutes 1 minute 10 minute according to what you want and then conclude that with Sarah I got lost I walked alone this is the good news if you want a lot to answer your door the bad news is that after Salaam this is the time for thicker subhanim allah thirty feet times ayatul kursi although allah i had pulled out of the falafel hardness and the rest of the vicar never ever it was reported that the prophetess um raised his hands and started to make dua nor the four rightly guided caliphs nor the great companions of the professor none of them so what does this tell you this tells you that you and your community are doing something that was not done by the Prophet s system or his companions yeah sure what we wanted and intended something good said yes you did Ikey but so many people intend to do well and they fail to do so so my question to you again are you raising your hands and making dua after salat because it's a cultural thing or because you want a lot of answers answer your door if it's the latter then I told you when Allah would answer your door most but if it's the second then this is an innovation to do after every force a lot like we see all over the world not only in the subcontinent all over the world people are doing it so now you come to the fork of the road you want to follow the majority of the people or you want to follow follow the Quran and the Sunna it's your choice Karima says under the recent circumstances is it permissible for a woman to get a power of attorney to consent to manage from her wali if she is another in another country the question is clear a woman is stranded in the UK her guardian is in Pakistan and she wants to get married but with the lockdown it's been almost four months and she fears that she might fall into Haram and there is no point of delaying the marriage and Allah only knows how long it will take so if this is the case can her guardian her Willy her father send a power of attorney so that her uncle in the UK her cousin the imam of the masjid any Tom Dick or Harry he names by name to take her responsibility and give her away in marriage that says yes as long as he's a Muslim and he's known to her father and he gives him this power of attorney this is legitimate and permissible if a woman is divorced then can she marry someone with her own free will or does she need a guardian in this case - this is from basura say it Mahmoud the answer is clear the Prophet himself alehissallaam said there is no marriage between brackets valid without the consent presence approval of a guardian and two male witnesses so whether the woman which the Prophet did not specify whether she's a girl the woman a virgin a non virgin previously married or never married a widow all of those cannot get married without the proposal and consent of her guardian so the concept that well she was married before and divorced now she's a grownup woman she can marry even if a father does not approve this is totally not true and she must obtain the consent and approval of her father her noona says what is the ruling on music we've stated this before that music is haram in the quran and in the authentic Sunnah and in the consensus of the four schools of thought in the quran it is mentioned in surah tell Ezra chapter 7 verse 63 I think where Allah says to Satan was tough she's managed apart I mean home basaltic provoke those whom you can with your voice Mujahid one of the great scholars of tafseer and from the tambourine said the the Satan's voice is music and also in Surat Luqman and saw that an atom Allah mentioned this as the great scholars of the Companions like of the Lamas road of the lunar Amara the Lama zubayr an alumni a bass they all say that this is musical instruments in the Sunnah it is reported inside Helaman Buhari and certainly there would with an authentic hadith where the Prophet said Allah salat wa salam there tianhua women Oh Matias the hello nan hello well Hari well hum well Mass there will be groups of people from my Ummah who would make her on things Helen they would make silk for men fornication drinking or consuming of intoxicants and musical instruments they will make it halal which means that they are prohibited the four schools of thought agree that musical instruments are prohibited and some go to extreme when they say that listening to it is sinful enjoying it is blasphemous but this is too extreme so it is simple to listen to music and we all know that music changes your mode it changes the way you feel so when you listen to different types of music you can be happy you can be mellow you can cry you can get depressed it changes the way you feel and Islam prohibits this because this is something external you should feel like this when you recite the Quran when you hear the Quran because this is divine so Quran is the word of Allah and music is the word of Satan whatever fills your heart and overwhelms it will control it so what you see today is very obvious the impact of music on people look at the class of aerobics without music they can't work out and you can see that most car accidents are influenced by listening to rock music music that made them speed and lose focus and it's sufficient for us that Allah has prohibited it you don't have to go for explaining or giving legitimate reasons for people to understand it is simple Allah prohibited it and we abide by it as Muslims Francis says is it okay for an unmarried Muslim woman to ask a Muslim man to marry her this is inappropriate for a Muslim woman to approach a man because human nature dictates that women are sought after and men are the one who seek and pursue and I think I gave an example earlier that when a man wants to encourage his son to work hard and study well he says do well in your exams and in uni and once you graduate I will choose the most beautiful woman for you for marriage this is his incentive a man can never say this to his daughter finish your high school and I will accept an offer of the most handsome man who proposes to you because this is something he cannot guarantee he has to go and look for him and for his daughter so this is usually not normal for a woman to propose to a man and so many people sisters and others who whenever I say such things they object and reject especially on Twitter which is filled by 99.995% of ignorant imbeciles unfortunately you can tell by the responses they have no idea what Islam is they're Muslims my identity sometimes I post an ayah and someone or more comments I never heard this before where is it in the Quran Allah yeah you've got the audacity to expose yourself big time in front of all of these people showing them that you are so ignorant about the basics even in the Quran and not only that sometimes people even go the extra mile when they criticize and say what is this I've never heard something like this this is ridiculous and they keep on criticizing and well-known fact they only criticizes because they don't know about it ah he asked before you make a fool out of yourself and publicly and on the record when someone who's supposedly more knowledgeable than you way older than you and Adam someone who's been preaching Islam for so long maybe before you were born at least give him the courtesy of asking politely so that he would explain to you chef I enjoy reading your posts or tweets whatever and I have learned a lot from you however this particular point I'm ashamed to say that I've never heard about so can you please direct me where I can get more knowledge of it no problem I immediately put Islam Q&A link for you to learn more or explain it to you if I had time or I had a separate link to one of my youtubes that I can provide which is usually difficult for me without my team but to come and jump the gun and say oh this is ridiculous he always says things like this and you don't even know what we are talking about and when someone goes to your profile he finds followed by 10 or 20 people so who are you there is an etiquette of communication with someone who is way more knowledgeable than you especially when you are ignorant you don't have the basics you don't know Arabic you don't know any there is no no Quran you know nothing so you have to learn first the origin of things the vast majority of people usually comment to say how dare you say it is not permissible for a woman to approach a man for marriage mother Khadija did this first of all mother Khadija when she married the Prophet Isis Salam hypothetically when she proposed to him how long was the prophet Aslam a messenger for ah you caught me off guard Shira why do you always ask me question maybe five years no I don't know maybe two years no about ten years yes he was a messenger for ten years when she proposed to him wrong answer ah he the Prophet Elisha salam was not a messenger it was not a prophet after marrying her by fifteen years he became a prophet of allah soldier ah I didn't know that well now you know what does that tell you beside you be ignorant it tells you that the ruling of mother Khadijah proposing to the progress son cannot be the view of Islam because Islam at that particular moment was not revealed to the Prophet I saw Salaam so the rulings cannot be obtained from it because the Prophet was not a prophet was not a messenger yet secondly why did I say hypothetically because it wasn't mother Khadijah who proposed to the Prophet ssinnim her companion her female companion was the one who suggested that she marries him and when she saw that Hadiya did not object or refuse she that is the friend went to the progress amp and said to him how about marry Khadija and the Prophet agreed to that I son so it was not a woman coming to a man proposing to him this is totally inappropriate no matter how righteous the man is Shaitaan is waiting for the right moment I remember once in Kuala Lumpur I was in a Salafi Masjid giving a lecture and after the lecture was over we came out to nice-looking sisters or shall I say daughters came to me Oh chef said I'm an acquired Muslim we loved your lecture etc of course being the share I had to lower my gaze and not look and then one of them said chef can we take can I take a selfie with you then I had to you know have exclamation marks excuse me have a selfie what was I talking inside the machine for an hour doing what this is what we usually preach Islamic ethics is this it's not makeup so she was taken by surprise and she said no no no you got me wrong I want me and my friend to take a selfie with you so this is the Han Allah okay that's okay that's understandable because then it's not hollow anymore it's not seclusion you and me no we have a third one to break the whole whole world what kind of a Muslim woman would degrade herself to that level sure if you're a father figure and you're an uncle it's okay no it's not okay this is totally Haram and this is why you may end up finding some people who used to be considered as students of knowledge may fall in the traps of Shaitaan may chit-chat may raise the barriers some lectures you find the day joking and having a good time with sisters sometimes you find them celebrities going in and the women are crying and shouting and as if the Beatles just walked in what is this and the Dare is happy you know it's funny yeah well it's it's fun to be famous I will be landing in a ship of you this is fitna and a woman must avoid falling into fitna must keep and preserve her dignity and honor by not exposing herself to a man going to him say what about us getting married if you wish the guy looks up and down at her and says yeah but I have to examine the merchandise I would so this is totally inappropriate and unacceptable now if a woman knows of a person that she's interested in getting married and he's worthy of being proposed to she must speak to her mom or if she's in good terms with her father she must speak that accurately with her father and tell him about the good things about this man and then asks him to propose yes the father can go to a man like Rama did with earth man and abu-bakr where he said to them that Huff's us husband just died and if you're interested in getting married earth man said give me some time to think it over he was just recently widowed and then he said no I don't feel like getting married now so he went to a walker and he also offered his daughter to a Booker there's nothing wrong in that but for a woman to go directly this is unacceptable Xena says if a woman does not have any guardian and she wants to get married in the situation what she can do it is difficult to assume that a woman does not have a guardian unless she is a Muslim revert with none of her relatives from her father's side are Muslim this is possible or she is adopted or an orphan that knows no relatives of her at all but usually it is not the case usually it's a woman and she lives with her mother and maternal uncles her paternal cousins live in another country or she has uncles that she doesn't speak to or she has a brother who she fought with and she wants to look for a way out no she cannot get married she has to get married through her guardian but if she's a revert if she was adopted and she doesn't have any relatives known to her then the Prophet said I saw some acyl paru when the human level ii-era the Muslim ruler or whomever takes his place such as the Muslim judge in a Muslim court or the authorized Imam of the Islamic Center in a country that is non-muslim country he becomes the guardian for such a woman and Allah knows best insha Javed says is it allowed to ask Allah for something for the sake of the Prophet Ali thought was Salaam this is an issue that some scholars said that this is and others said that it is an innovation and the most authentic opinion is that it is an innovation why don't we say it's Sheikh because he is praying to Allah and begging Allah through the means through the wasilla of the Prophet Aristotle Salam this is backed by hadith but this hadith are not authentic this is why we don't say it's ship channel slamming taymiyah says that whoever asks Allah through the vasila or the right of muhammad sallallahu alaihi salam is an innovation because no one has a right over allah to be begged through so i ask you o allah i demand or Allah that through the right of prophetess upon you that you clear my debt no this is totally unacceptable this is an innovation Rabia Khan says I have a question who are freed from Jahannam in Ramadan in our final destination will be this or if our final destination will be decided on the day of judgement who are freed from Jahannam in Ramadan if our final destination will be decided on the day of judgement first of all your final destination is not decided on the day of judgment your final destination was decided when Allah wrote the destiny of all fifty years fifty thousand years before Allah created the creation so before Allah created the whole universe by fifty thousand years it was written in the preserved tablet that I will go to this destination whether heaven or hell and you will go to this destination whether heaven our help then who is freed in Ramadan in Ramadan those whom Allah willed to be from the people of paradise will be freed from Hellfire and this is courtesy from Allah soldier this is a gift from allah subhanaw taala we don't know who will qualify for it and this is why we make a lot of door to allah azzawajal to set us free during the nights of ramadan and to make us from rota Harun are those who are set free from Hellfire so there is no contradiction all the contradiction is on in your mind and our minds when we think that predestiny opposes and goes against free will not knowing that predestiny is Allah's knowledge as imam ahmed says al Karim Allah this is a large knowledge and we are not qualified to understand it because it is way beyond our comprehension and I get I have given this example in my last or the one before last class on explaining the whole Salathe when I said that as humans we have our limitations so the hearing we have is capable of hearing what humans can hear if the noise is so loud it can pop our ears and we can lose our hearing ability and if the frequency is so low as in the whistle of dogs dogs can hear it it's so low we cannot even notice it so we have our limitations and when it comes to predestiny definitely it is way about beyond our expectations and limitations this is Allah's knowledge but nothing happens in this universe universe without his permission and he instructed us what to do and what not to do so if we do what we are not supposed to do if we sin if we transgress this is our own free will but allah azzawajal also willed it because nothing happens without his will yet he gave us the free will to choose and it was our choice that we will pay for analyzes and knows best finally sharifa josh says a guardian cannot be from the girl's mother side and this is true the guardian has to be from the asaba from the paternal side from her father's side so number one is her father number two is her paternal grandfather number three is her son number four is her brother number five is a paternal uncle if none of those were available then number six her paternal cousins first cousins if not then the further the further those who share her name family name but her maternal uncles even if it was her uncle the brother of her mother he cannot assume such an honor and responsibility and Allah Sojin knows best so with this we conclude our session and with the grace of Allah today is Monday next class is Thursday and on Saturday if Allah is willing we will try to meet for our lecture in sha allah so gel which will be dedicated the whole hour for answering your backlog of questions but don't quote me on that because the date may change and the times may also vary I will inshaallah inform you on thursday with the grace of allah and until then I leave you free manila was salam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
