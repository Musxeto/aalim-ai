  "transcript": "uh so my question is about these Hadith please [Music] can you like briefly explain this I didn't according to this hasid if I use a perfume which is which has a bright color or which which doesn't have a very heavy scent would it be considered as imitating woman this is a Hadith at the moment I'm not sure whether it was said by the prophet or by one of the companions but this is a very well-known Hadith I have to recheck it and it translates to the perfume of of men is what has a scent and has no color and the perfume or a dormant of women is what has color but does not have a scent now this is regarding what a man or a woman May wear in front one of one another even if they were none maharam providing it is not visible so amen can wear any type of perfume as long as it has a scent strong weak it doesn't matter you can wear any type of perfume but you're not you are not allowed to wear anything that has a color so you're not allowed to wear wear makeup you're not allowed to put glitter on your body or where henna Mehendi on your body other than the recommended or a permitted area such as the hair and your beard for the henna so this is for men as for women a woman cannot go out wearing perfume because this is totally prohibited and the prophet salaam made that a major sin and one of the reasons to prevent a woman a woman from going into a Masjid if she's scented and wearing a perfume where men can find the scent and the smell of it but she can Adorn herself with makeup lipstick whatever providing Nan mahram or incapable of seeing that due to her wearing the hijab and Allah knows less"
