  "transcript": "afrida says in the last class of islamic you said those who hate islam inside but don't show it it's the worst kind of blasphemy so my question is if i get these sort of people in my relatives or around me is it permissible for me to have contact with these people or i must leave them we said that hypocrisy is something that you cannot pinpoint because a hypocrite believes and hates islam and the muslims yet shows everyone around him that he is a muslim and he loves and cares about islam and this is why the prophet assad never killed any one of them because they acted like muslims so how could how could he do something like that to someone who's claiming to be a muslim that wasn't possible however we said that one of the ways of fighting the hypocrites is to expose them expose their actions so if i have a relative or a colleague and i'm accusing him of hypocrisy this is a very dangerous thing how can i accuse him of something that i don't have evidence of that can't stand in a court of law so do i know what's inside his heart no sheikh but he always does things that no one does except hypocrites again you can't label people like that you remember the hadith of islam said may allah be pleased with him and with his father when he was in jihad at war in a on the battlefield fighting someone who killed so many muslims at the battlefield and they had a duel and when the disbeliever felt that he's about to lose and to be killed he said usama killed him when the prophet heard this the prophet was outraged he said you killed him after he said the prophet of allah we are on the battlefield and we are at war and the guy just killed so many muslims he didn't have the time to sit and reflect and say to himself oh yeah yeah islam is the right religion i think it's the right time for me to accept islam he just wanted to save his himself the prophet said did you open his heart to know that this was his intention what are you going to do on the day of judgment with allah and he kept repeating it so again i speak to you afrina who told you that these are hypocrites and they are out of the fold of islam as long as they did not say something that incriminates them big time you have to treat them as muslims do you have to contact them you have to mix with them no if they're bad muslims or their bad influence to your iman you simply can just [Music] keep your distance maybe give them salaam whenever you see them but this is it you don't have to go further than that you"
