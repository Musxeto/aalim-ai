  "transcript": "she says she made a number of promises in the past and and she broke them sometimes she made a promise on the quran and we spoke about that earlier so i'm not going to repeat it again the ruling on making a promise on the quran or an oath on the quran so she says what to do now some people say i have to expiate first of all if you promised yourself like i'm not going to smoke there is nothing on you because you did not use the word of allah if you said in your head wallahi i will not smoke then there is nothing on you because you did not utter it you did not say it if you verbally said o allah i promise you or allah well i will by your name i will never smoke again this is an oath that was said verbally and hence you have to expiate it if you were to break it and the expiation is to feed or to clothe 10 poor people or to feed a slave you have the choice one of these three if you cannot financially do any of them then you must fast three days for every oath that you have taken by allah's name and said it verbally now if you took an oath not to smoke and you smoked and took another oath not to smoke and you smoked and took a ten or three thousand other oaths and you broke them all you need one expiation but if they are different things not uh not to smoke not to listen to music not to watch movies not to miss a salat these are different so each one needs an expiation and allah azza knows best"
