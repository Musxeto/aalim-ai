  "title": "Going out in public with a mother who does not wear the hijab permissible? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Ariz from UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh my question is, so my mother wants me to go to the opticians with her to get my eyes checked for new glasses so I can already see quite well right now with my glasses but if I go with her and she doesn't wear the hijab will I be sinful for this? Yani what will you do when you have a mother that does not abide by the hijab? Are you going to move out from the house? Is it only the doctor that you are afraid of going with her to? What about the cousins, the uncles? What about going to the grocery shop? What about going to the park? What about going everywhere? This is not logical. She's your mom. You cannot disown her or like a fingernail just clip it and move on. So you have to be diplomatic, you have to be wise, you have to be knowledgeable in trying to win her heart instead of focusing on things that would only make her more distant from religion and from accepting whatever you advise her to say. I feel that there is nothing wrong in you going to the doctor. Going to the doctor is halal. Checking your eyesight every six months is recommended so that it would not deteriorate more. Being with you, this is something that if you are unable to avoid which is a bit weird because you're supposed to be a man and you're supposed to go on your own and manage yourself or things on your own. If this is not possible, there is no problem in that and Allah Azzawajal knows best."
