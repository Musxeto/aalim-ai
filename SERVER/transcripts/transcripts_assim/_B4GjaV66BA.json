  "title": "Taking someone out of the folds of Islam (wearing cross without belief)? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Yusuf from the Emirates Assalamu Alaikum Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi So my question is, is wearing a cross without the belief in it an act of Kufr? Because my grandfather has on his Facebook a post saying Merry Christmas with a picture of a cross and I don't know if it was like resembling, you know Mary and Jesus, like the Christian version of them Yani would you like to take him out of the fold of Islam? No I don't, but I don't want to take myself out of the fold of Islam. Why are you taking yourself out of the fold of Islam? It's none of your business. Don't visit his Facebook page and if you can open the issues of Aqeedah indirectly, that would be fine. But just jumping to conclusion and if you notice your question Yusuf, you'll find that you have a problem. You said what's the ruling on wearing a cross without believing in it? And when you gave the example, you said that he posted something on his Facebook. So he wasn't wearing it, correct? So definitely there is a gap or a loop here that has to be fixed. Wearing a cross without believing in it, this is something between an individual and Allah Azza wa Jal. We can't say whether he believes in it or not. The action itself is Kufr. came to visit the Prophet ﷺ, interested in Islam, he was wearing a cross. So the Prophet said to him, the moment he saw him ﷺ, remove this idol from your neck. Like most Christians do. They worship the cross, they kiss it, they believe in it, they hold on to it, and they even kill vampires with it. I don't know what this does to them. Anyhow, and unfortunately some of the Muslims innovated something to mimic them. So now they have their crescent, and they think that it is sacred, and they have it on their minarets, they have it on their masjid as a symbol, and their flags. All of this is not from Islam. This is an innovation. But this is beside the point. So, wearing a cross is an act of Kufr. Whether you believe in it or not, because you're wearing it, and this is an idol. What's in your heart is between you and Allah Azza wa Jal. But we do not say that such an individual is a kafir for wearing it, because there are conditions to be fulfilled, obstacles to be prevented before doing such a thing. And I hope this answers your question."
