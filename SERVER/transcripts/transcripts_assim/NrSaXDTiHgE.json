  "transcript": "I'm dalla says my mom was indoor and I was sitting outside and she told me if anyone comes and asks about her I should say she's not in the house what should I do because it seems like lying our delight is it does not seem like lying at all it is lying see lying is stating something that is not true so you're not being truthful we do you say my mom is not in the house this is a blatant lie so what to do first of all you have to remind your mom with allah azza wajal by telling her mom i love you but you know that lying is a major sin and we should not as muslims lie running away from your problems does not solve them you have to face your problems of course you're not gonna lecture your mom or you get a slap on your face this is not what I meant but you should try to remind her of Allah secondly we have something that is called Maria book and Maria book is something ambiguous that can have double meaning and this saves you from lying by not directly stating a lie so the Prophet for example erase a lot of sarin in one of his expeditions met a man and he asked him for some information about the enemy's army so the man said no I will not tell you until you tell me where from you are so the Prophet said I'll tell you but you told me first so the man gave the information to the Prophet Allah so Sam which helped him figure out the number of the enemy army so he figured out by the number of cameras they slaughter how many people there were so the man said okay now you tell me where are you from the Prophet arizim was at war and at war you cannot be giving your information for free and if he tells the man that we are from Medina the man might go directly to the enemy army and say I met the army you're looking to fight or you're running from or you're pursuing whatever so the Prophet had to give an ambiguous answer without lying so the Prophet said our son we are from water and he left so the man was asking homework what water water usually means a tribe that lives near a water well or a source of water that they're known by it water of this village water of that area water of that city so the message which water and the Prophet did not answer because he already gave him an answer where he was coming from the Prophet meant water meaning semen every human being is created from water from a drop of semen and this is what the Prophet Mentalist autosum but the man understood it differently this is called merit and the Prophet had told us that in using merit you can easily avoid lying so if I were in your shoes most likely my foot is bigger than yours so I'm gonna find difficulty putting them on if someone asks me while I'm at the terrace of the house where's your mom so I would not say she's not home I would say she's not here and this would give the questioner the idea that she's not home but actually I'm meant to say that she is not here in the terrace with me so this is one way of escaping lying but to say she's not home when she is home she's not inside when she's inside this is clearly a lie and this is not permissible and la knows best"
