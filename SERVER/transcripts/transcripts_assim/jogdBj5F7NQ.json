  "title": "Do sins (lying) break one's fast? (She wears tight clothes & doesn't even wear hijab!) assim hakeem",
  "transcript": "Shahid from Norway Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi She does what? She is wearing tight clothes so her body is like expressed. I don't understand. I have a question for a sister. I know you have a question for a sister. What is she doing that you are telling her that is not permissible? She is wearing tight clothes. She is wearing tight clothes. Okay. Yes. And she does not wear hijab as well. So I was wondering now if her fasting valid for that reason or not. The things that break your fast would be eating, drinking, sexual intercourse, ejaculation and the likes. For women menstruation or postnatal bleeding and the likes. But sins do not break your fasting rather reduces the reward. So from the same analogy of yours, Shahid, if someone fasts and he shaves his beard, would we say that his fasting is haram, is not acceptable? You tell me. If someone fasts and watches soap operas or movies or listens to music, is his fast invalid? Now we say go and eat and drink. Of course not. The fast is fast but the reward decreases considerably according to such sins. And I hope this answers your question."
