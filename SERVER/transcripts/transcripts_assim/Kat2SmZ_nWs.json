  "transcript": "Please continue. Okay, my question ties down to the first point or the first question. Yeah It's about the Riyadh aspect of showing off because back home I'm from Kenya alhamdulillah some people say like if you have something good or Allah gives you something good You show it off like you're showing off your the Allah's ni'mah So I want to know how do you differentiate between this or the Riyadh that people can feel when giving out something? And inshallah may Allah increase in beneficial knowledge. Ameen to all our brothers in Kenya Jumbo Jumbo Kareebo and inshallah the best of luck Akhi, what you mentioned showing Allah's ni'mah is not in forms of worship rather in wealth. So you have torn clothes and stinking t-shirt and Allah has blessed you with money. Why don't you shower? Why did you wear perfume? Why did you put? No, no I don't want to show off. No, this is not showing off here You're supposed to show off when a man came to the Prophet as I'm with a big hair That is not tidy and his clothes are dirty and he looks poor. He said do you have money? Said yes, so what kind of money every kind of camels cows sheep? This is when the Prophet said as I'm Allah Loves to see the traces of his favors and blessings upon his servant No, and the guy went in had a haircut had a shower wear new set of clothes and came back. Okay, this is fine in forms of worship if the forms of worship are Fard We have Jumma now. Someone says Oh Salam alaikum. Where are you going? I have some errand to do I want to do this and maybe go to the grocery shop. What are you doing? So I'm hiding my goodies No, no, this is Fard. You have to say I'm going for Fajr prayer I'm going for Jumma. I'm going but if you're going to offer night prayer or fasting Voluntary or giving charity. Yes, he gives with his right hand what his left hand does not know of hiding it So good deeds are different voluntary deeds than Fard. I hope this answers your question inshallah You"
