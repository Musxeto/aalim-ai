  "transcript": "so we know that a believer is like a bird a bird has a head and two wings what is the head for a believer the love of Allah what are the wings that he flies with feeding Allah and hoping Allah so while you are in life like now you have to have these three pillars you have to have the love of Allah if there is any of you who does not have the love of Allah what is he considered to be a disbeliever a kafir because if you chop the head of the bird would you have a bird this is likewise a lot of the Muslims when you talk to them about love or loving Allah Azza WA JAL they say okay I don't love Allah I pray I fast because I'm afraid of his hell and I want to go to his paradise but I don't love Allah so you can this be acceptable it's not even imaginable everyone loves Allah but our love depends on our contemplation and thinking people who do not see accept the empty portion of the glass are pessimistic when you say describe this is half empty is it half empty it is those whose optimistic and they always trust Allah and think positive they would say it is half full so a believer always looks at the good signs and always positive and always trusting Allah as the origin so I had an accident yesterday hamdulillah it could have been worse it could have been much worse and trusting allah azza wajal it is not an option the Prophet says erase also none of you should die except thinking the best of Allah this is an indication of one of the wings in this life scholars say while we're alive and well going to schools and to to work and to places of interest to us when we fly we have to have the fear a little bit more than the hope why they say because it's human nature that we feel lured and tempted in this life so if you have more hope in a less forgiveness you will do more sins isn't that true I've prayed five prayers yesterday on hamdullah and Allah forgives from one prayer to the other this means my ability to do sin is great I think I can do this when I make umbra I'm close to Makkah when I make home but I come back what is the first thing I do I pray to Allah as a Realtor ACCA's because I'm a good believer and my records are clean no I turn on the TV and watch a soap opera or a movie why my records are clean so I am starting all over I think I can afford to sin a little bit this is how Shaitaan comes to you this is exactly how Shaitaan comes you after a form of worship he tells you how many a great man sinned and that is why scholars say maybe a sin would make you enter paradise while a good deed would make you go to hell how is that they said a good deed would make you feel proud of yourself and would give you confidence that alhamdulillah I'm a practicing Muslim Allah loves me which entitles me to do sins or at least to feel arrogant over others yeah you're not like me I'm sure what are you I'm a scholar and I am a person of knowledge all of you are mean nothing your aunt's this good deed made me go to hell because of what's in my heart while that person who sinned he made the sin and after making this thing you see what have I done and he starts to repent ask Allah for forgiveness and feel remorse it's not enough I have to do more so he prays night prayer no no it's not enough I have to recite the Quran I have to go for ombres I have to participate in Dawa I have to give leaflets I have to do this so he keeps on doing good deeds because of that sin and he ends up where and the highest levels of paradise because of a sin so always have your trust in Allah soldier always be positive but when you're alive now always be afraid when you are on your dying bed your fear should be much much less but your hope in unless forgiveness in Allah mercy much be overwhelming because this is the time for thinking well of a larger and trusting allah subhanahu wata'ala as the Prophet says no one should die except thinking the best of Allah Azza WA JAL"
