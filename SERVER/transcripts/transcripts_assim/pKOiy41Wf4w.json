  "transcript": "It's mentioned in surah Zar chapter number 39 verse number 41 that we have revealed to the prophet Muhammad peace be upon him the Quran so that he may instruct the humankind not only the Muslims of the Arabs but the whole of humankind. So the glorious Quran because it is the last and final revelation from Allah subhanana wa ta'ala to the last and final messenger prophet Muhammad peace be upon him. It was not revealed only for the Muslims or the Arabs. It is revealed for the whole of humanity. The glorious Quran is a proclamation to humanity. It is the most positive book in the world. It's a fountain of mercy and wisdom. It's a guide to the erring. It's a warning to the heless. It's an assurance to those in doubt. It's a solace to the suffering and a hope to those in despair. Whenever you have an equipment, normally along with equipment, you get an instruction manual and more complicated the equipment, the more requirement of an instruction manual. For example, if you buy a DVD player, it says if you want to play the DVD, insert the DVD and press the play button. If you want to stop, press the stop button. Don't immerse it in water, it will get spoiled. Don't drop it from a height, it will get damaged. The dos and don'ts of that equipment, that machine is mentioned in an instruction manual. If you allow me to call a human being a machine or equipment, you'll have to agree that the human being is the most complicated machine on the face of this earth. Don't you think it requires an instruction manual? The instruction manual for the human beings, it is a glorious Quran. The dos and don'ts for a human being is mentioned in the last and final revelation the glorious Quran. Allah says in the Quran in surah mulk chapter number 67 verse number two it's Allah who has created death and life to test which of you is good in deeds. So this life that we are leading in this world according to the last and final revelation is a test. We human beings Allah our creator says in the Quran the last and final revelation that this life is a test. Allah has created death and life to test which of you is good in deeds. What is the purpose of our lives? Why are we here? What are we doing? Have we thought about it? Have we thought about that? What are we doing in this world? What is the purpose of our life? Allah says in surah zarat chapter number 51 verse number 56 that we have created the jin and the men not but to worship me. So the main purpose of the human beings according to our creator is to worship Allah subhana wa t'ala. The Arabic word used in the Quran is abd. The word ibada is used coming from the Arabic word ab which means a slave. When we follow the commandments of Allah subhanana wa ta'ala, it means we are doing ibada. If we are doing the things which he has said is compulsory, we are doing ibada. If we abstaining from thing which is haram and prohibited, we are doing ibada. So when we follow the commandments of Allah subhana wa ta'ala, when we pray, we are doing ibada. When we give zakat, we are doing ibada. When we fast, we are doing ibada. When we don't have alcohol, we are doing ibada. When we don't gamble, we are doing ibada. When we don't tell lies, we are doing ibada. So ibada means following the commandments of Allah subhanana wa ta'ala as true servants of Allah subhanana wa ta'ala and the cornerstone of the Islamic faith and of the Quran"
