  "title": "Is Hypnotherapy permissible in Islam? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Fabio says I'm 17 years old and I struggle with anxiety and recently I found out about hypnotherapy and I heard that it helps a lot with mental problems is it Hallel to seek treatment in this way the issue of hypnotism or hypnosis I don't know which one is a noun who cares the issue is controversial now I cannot give you a fatwa on this topic because I was not ever involved in it I did not do my research in it I did not see it maybe you've seen few Clips eclipses here and there but it's just any like in the circus it has no reality to it but if you go to for example the permanent committee of IFTA in Saudi Arabia they said that this is totally prohibited and most likely that they utilize the jinn they have this and that to do with the jinn backing them up and controlling the one hypnotized and making him say things do things sometimes speak in tongues and and and claim to know the unseen well doubt this is from jinn and utilizing jinn is shirk and this is prohibited others say that this is not actually utilizing the jinn but rather it is making the person himself come up with such healing processes or helping in identifying things that were in the past etc and they give an example of the placebo so so the placebo is based on delusion based on convincing yourself that you're being healed and cured when you're not and they gave the example of person who had asthma and he went into a hotel room and in the middle of the night he got an asthma attack so he tried to turn on the lights he couldn't he could not breathe so he started touching the walls and he was suffocating and when he sensed the cold glass he broke it and then started to breathe normally and when he woke up in the morning he discovered that he did not break the glass actually he broke the wall clock but he managed to breathe so they say that this is a power that people are convinced themselves and they say that hypnosis or hypnotism is under this category personally I believe that this is not true and there or this is not part of the means of healing that Allah has prescribed for us whether it is Shari means meaning of healings of Quran of Rokia of honey of copying of black seed etc or the medical and worldly type of healing such as antibiotics surgeries medication so these two are legit when it comes to things that are supernatural or from the other side or something that has no scientific justification this becomes under the prohibited form and I believe that this type is part of it and illogical knows best"
