  "title": "Ruling on self defence - if someone hits me on my face? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question is what is the ring of on self-defense for example if someone punched me multiple time in the face what can I do well in fighting usually it's difficult to control yourself and say oops I'm trying my level best to avoid the face especially if you're trained to strike the face as many boxers are but we should be careful because the prophet sallallahu alaih Al wasallam prohibited us from striking the face so you cannot strike straight into a person's face you can hit the head you can hit the neck the sides the temples but not the face now when a person is in a fight and he's defending himself sometimes it's not possible to make a fraction of a second's choice a decision whoops I'm not going to do this you just do it and then say most likely but try your level best not to do it deliberately and Allah knows best and may Allah protect us from being in such situations"
