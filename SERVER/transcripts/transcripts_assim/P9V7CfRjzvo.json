  "title": "2 Surahs in 1 rakah, same surah in both rakahs and 1 surah more than once in a rakah - Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "brother Wahid says can we recite surah more than once in a locker so if brother Wahid is asking about reciting two sewers in the same raka or more this is without any doubt permissible the hadith where the Prophet is offered night prayer and he began with Al Baqarah then Anissa then Adam Braun in the first raka indicates that this is permissible also the other hadeeth reported in narrated by Bukhari and others where a companion of the Prophet of Islam used to lead his companions in prayer and he would always recite surat alas Allahu Allahu Ahad along side another surah so his companions told him either you recite to Allah had alone or recite the other surah alone why combine them both in the same locker and he told him that this is the way I pray you like it alhamdulillah you don't choose someone else to do the prayer and when they told the prophet alayhi salatu salam about this incident he asked them to go and ask him why do you recite it so the man replied by saying because it has the description of Allah the Almighty and I love it so the Prophet said I am tell him that because of his love to it Allah will admit him to Jenna so the prophet sala approved of him reciting to sewers in one raka then there is no problem but what is the ruling if brother Wahid is asking about reciting the same surah twice reciting it again so if he means in different records again the Sunnah says that this is permissible in an authentic hadith the Prophet eyes of some prayed Fajr prayer once I think it was in Hajj or in Mena and he recited EDA Jules elated Aldo's in Zelda ha serratus izella in the first raka and he repeated it in the second drag huh but again I don't think that this is what Wahid is asking about so most likely what hate is asking about repeating the same surah in the same raka so you recite al-fatiha then you recite Azul Seattle are losing jalaja after you finish it you recite it again it as well directed orders in salah 'what's the ruling on that to my knowledge this is not part of the swing now however it is totally permissible to recite anything of the quran and hence if you recite the same surah again there is no problem because it was proven that the Companions used to pray night prayer repeating the same ayah and also there is a hadith that the prophet alayhi salatu salam prayed once night prayer repeating the same ayah if allah you torment them then they're your servants and if you forgive them then you are the most forgiving most merciful he kept not repeating it so this shows and means that there is no problem in repeating the same suya or the same surah again but this knot is not part of the usual sunnah of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam"
