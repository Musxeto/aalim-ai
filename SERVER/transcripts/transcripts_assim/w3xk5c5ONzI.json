  "title": "Can we give zakat internationally? Zakat to Gaza without knowing if it will reach for sure? assim",
  "transcript": "some SCH have a difference of opinion regarding paying zaka outside the country and even City so if someone lives in Islam for example in Pakistan there are many poor deing people here but they want to give part of their ziga to Palestine people for example but if it doesn't reach due to Israeli forces the donor may not know so is his duty discharged and can you say if that's recommended and any best organization first of all it is an issue of dispute whether zakat can be transferred to another country or it must be spent in the same country and the reason is the Hadith of mu ja may Allah be pleased with him when the prophet sent him from Medina to Yemen to become a judge a teacher and and a and he ordered him to call these people of the book to Islam to do this and to do this and then when he reached zakat he told him and informed them that Allah mandated upon them a percentage on their wealth to be taken from their rich and given to their poor so Scholars looked at this the this Hadith and said this is a clear indication that the zakat should be taken from the rich and given to the poor of the same city the same country and usually this is logical because you cannot be a good Carpenter fixing people's doors with your own door in your house broken you have to begin with your own house other Scholars looked at the Hadith and they said okay read on and don't stop here and if you read on you would find that the companions used to collect the zakat from Yemen distribute some of it there and ship the rest to Medina and in Medina they would allocate it to those who are in need as well and they said this is a clear example that the zakat can be transferred to other countries and towns and cities as long as there is a need for the Muslims I personally support this latter opinion and if we are able to send our zakat money to our brothers and sisters in Palestine in Gaza it has to be done and if you give it to a trustworthy organization to the best of your knowledge and ability what happens to it doesn't matter because Allah has accepted it the moment you gave it to that organization and it your your job is done whether it reaches them or not and Allah Asel Knows Best"
