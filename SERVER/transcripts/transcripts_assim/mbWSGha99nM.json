  "title": "When Zamzam Became Lost (The video you all requested!!!) assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "great events usually are preceded by things that show that these events are about to happen and by far one of the greatest events that ever took place was the birth of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam Prophet Muhammad the mercy to all mankind one of these great events was the rediscovery of The Well of zamzam and if you recall we talked in previous programs about the initiation of The Well of zamzam and by Ishmael and his mother Hazard when they were stranded in the valley of Mecca for one reason or the other the well itself was buried and disappeared and you have to imagine the need for water in the valley of Mecca because there were no Rivers there were no lakes and all the wells that were available were at the outskirts of Mecca and not all the time they could have could find water in them so it was very very difficult for the people of Mecca to get water one day had a dream and in the Stream he he saw someone telling him asking him to dig this well and he woke up not knowing which well and this dream reoccurred four times and at the end this man who was asking him to dig the well said you have to dig The Well of zamzam and he showed him where it was located just before we go into the story who was Abdullah the grandfather of the Prophet the grandfather of the prophet sallallahu alaihi and it may be the leader of tribe of Christ he was one of the most important people in it but again they did not have a specific leader if you recall the people either had crowned Kings such as a of some tribes here or thereby appointed by puppet Kings as we have uh nowadays puppetry genes and so on uh they were appointed by the Persian rulers or by the byzantian rulers or they had a tribe with influential leaders but not Kings not a single particular person so we can say that Abdullah was the chief of the tribe of qurash he was one of the Chiefs but not the chief for the tribe as itself was comprised of different tribes and each tribe had few influential people uh leading them and not ruling them out of respect out of fear out of strength out of wealth there were so many reasons now it may add value to us to know the fathers and the forefathers of the Prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam his name was and it goes on till Adam and this is the agreed upon now it is important for us to know that was the leader of quraish tribe one of the grand grandfathers of the Prophet saws and he had different sons and just before he died he gave all the powers to one of his sons who was not a very good son so his brothers fought with him and each one took part of the leadership of quraish in the sense that they had a a a certain Department if I may say that or division that took care of the Kaaba itself that took care of the building of the mosque of those who come in and present gifts to it were to be kept of the idols so they were known to be said that the protectors and the keepers of the Kaaba Guardians and there was another division which which was responsible for uh the water of zamzam providing water providing food to the pilgrims and the guests and they took great honor in this though they did not have lots of Financial Resources but to the extent that they were willing to borrow so that they would feed the hungry provide water to those who were coming in pilgrimage as it was part of their pride and as we said that they were very proud people and until now the Arabs are known to be very proud people and people would do them real harm once they insult or humiliate them and unfortunately with recent events because of the Arabs departing and being detaching themselves from their religion Islam and from their Traditions as Arabs unfortunately we are ended up with something that it does not relate or resemble those of uh our ancestors so there was a division that was uh in charge of the Kaaba a division was in charge of feeding and providing water to the pilgrims a division that was in charge of trade in securing a commercial relations with the people in the North in the Sham or in Yemen on the south in the west of India in the East with India and in the west west with uh the Abyssinian uh people also there was a fourth division that was in charge of wars and which is similar to the ministry of Defense they were in charge of Defending qurayish and taking care of it and so and on and on when he was about to die he gave all of this to one of his sons and and the other others did not like it so they started disputing and feuding with him so they've distributed it evenly among them now then came enough and then came Hashem when we hear the name now ABD means the servant but Islam we only are able to say the servant off and then one of the attributes of Allah for example and so on and on there are more than 99 attributes and names of Allah the Almighty but when we hear the name is not the name of Allah so it is not abdar so is one of their gods was he one of their idols no he was not do you know who is the brother of hashems and Hashim who is the grandfather of Abdullah the father of the Prophet Muhammad again let us remind the viewers so that they would not lose count he is Muhammad sallallahu the son of Abdullah the son of Abdullah the son of passion okay now Hashim had the brother and this brother was called Hashim was a traitor so he was once trading through the Sham coming off and on off and on and on his way passing by Medina he met a family whom he liked and he proposed to their daughter the father agreed he married a woman from Medina and she got pregnant and she brought this healthy nice child and this child was called either hampt or a a a different other name and and he was called shea butter ham because he had some white hair on his hair while he was young and this is Sheba meaning old and and they say that he was called also because he used to do a lot of good things and people would Praise Him for this so this boy grew up in Medina and while Hashem was traveling on his business trips he died so the boy remained with his mother in Medina after a while just as the boy was growing up and he almost reached the age of puberty and the brother of Hashem went to Medina and so his nephew so he told his mother that I sent him back with me because he to the land of his ancestors to his uncles his cousins his tribes his people so the mother said no way I cannot send him with you he's my child he's my only son so he told her I'm not taking him to a foreign place I'm taking him to the sacred city of Mecca he will be there near the Kaaba where all the pilgrims will come and he will have the highest uh possible uh social status and religious status and so on so the mother gave it some thought and decided to send her son with his uncle and what is was the uncle's name took his nephew and they rode all together to Makkah on the back of his camel the minute they entered matka the people of Mecca saw this boy with Hashem and this is a stranger to them so they thought that ah this is the slave that al-motali bought so immediately they said this is so he kept on telling them people he is not my slave I did not buy him he is my nephew his name is and they insisted on calling him Abdullah and that's how the name was given to him so going back again he wanted to dig The Well of zamzam but the people heard about it they heard from the stories before that there was a well here that gave water endlessly and for one reason the other this well was buried it disappeared and no one knew about it Abdul matali was fortunate enough to get a dream four times in a row telling him dig that well and he kept on asking what well and he woke up wakes up another time a third and the fourth and the fourth time he was told to dig up zamzam we have a short break in sha Allah and after the break we will continue the story of re-digging the will of zamzam [Music] um the prophet saws have informed us that we should not obey no one on the account of disobeying Allah so the superiority is the Allah's command so the husband tells his wife that I want you to check hands with my colleagues with my business partners no even if it leaves the divorce if the husband says to his wife that you have to party with me with partners and so on no you have to take your hijab off now by any means communicate with Allah knows your language and he would be very happy to answer you [Music] and welcome back now we're talking about Abdul muktalib and how he saw in his dreams for four consecutive continuous times someone coming to him and telling him that you have to re-dig the will of zamzam went to the area that he saw in his dreams and he started digging with one of his children because at the time he had only one child so the people of Makkah came to him and said what are you doing because he was one of the most influential people in Mecca wealthy with known to be wise and strong so he told them that I am digging The Well of zamzam and while he was doing that zamzam came out to the surface and it was water all around now imagine the the situation of the people of Makkah they could not get water except from miles and miles at the outskirts of Mecca and they did not have any pipes or Water Systems all what they could do was to get their camels with skin containers big skin containers and fill whatever they can and now in the middle of their City comes this well of pure and and and and and Sweet Water and they don't have to do this anymore to go for three or four hours journey to get this amount of water so they told Abdullah well we should share in this water because it was found in Mecca he told them no way this water is mine I control it and I have the honor he did not want to deprive people from drinking at all they're generous but their generosity was associated with their pride they wanted to have the honor to be controlling this water so whenever someone mentioned the name zamzam it was associated with their tribe and with their ancestors so he told them sorry I found it I saw the dream so it's mine now because Abdullah had only one child meant that he was not strong enough to fight because one man can fight five men ten men but you cannot find fight the whole tribe and you cannot inflict so as much harm as you want because you are a minority so he was overwhelmed by the other tribes and by the other families of quraish and he refused to give away zamzam but he had no uh hope he did not have any other uh solution so the only thing that came up to them was to travel to the north to the Sham District where there were was a fortune teller so it came up to them that okay let's go to this fortune teller and let her draw the lots and then we will know who is to be responsible for for towards them if abdelib had people to support him to back him up to strengthen his position he was enough to have agreed but he had no other choice so they got their Caravan ready and they started traveling up north Northeast where this fortune teller is and usually fortune tellers are not usually all the time they are Aid by the Jinn so this by itself is a major sin and it nullifies Islam when you seek the support of the Unseen of the Jinn and you would like to know the future and no one knows the future except Allah but this was one of the wrong practices that they thought by going to the Jinn by going to fortune tellers that they can determine their Destiny and then there is Magic magic is a different thing see using magic is to change and alter things and magic in the sense of diluting people and giving them Illusions and delusions but it is not transforming uh uh sand into gold there's nothing of this sort there it is not transforming a human being to an animal now this cannot be but Magic by the aid of Jinn is to transform people from one area to the other in the speed of light to uh be able to bring something to you from far away places and you think that they have given it to you this by itself nullifies Islam but Abdullah and those who were with him thought that this is the only way to determine their Destiny and this was very spread in the Arabs at the time before Islam before anyone traveled they used to go to these fortune tellers or priests and tell them to make a choice for them should I go or should I stay and they start doing this drawing of lots to know whether to travel or not whether to associate with so and so in business or not whether to get married or not they never had the decision made they were relying 100 percent on their idols and and this is why it was uh needed for them to start in the belief of Allah and then in their monotheism set off and they went to that fortune teller in the middle of the way it was Desert in the middle of the way and his tribesmen who were with him his cousins and so on and his child were stranded they ran out of water so they felt really thirsty so they went to the other tribes the other families that those that were with them in this Caravan and seeked their assistance they told them give us some water and the other family said listen if we give you some of the water we have few hours down the road we're gonna be stranded and we're going to be thirsty and die no we cannot and and they prevented them from getting the water after a while they were so exhausted and those who were with him thought that this is the end so they just sat down for a while and then said why sit down be brave and proud of yourselves dig your own Graves so the minute you feel that you're going to die out of thirst just get yourself in that grave and others will bury you until the last one and then someone will bury him have dignity and die with pride and honor so they did so with the thirst and and and they were so tired they dug their own Graves and they sat there waiting for death and then it came back to him and said why are we sitting let us ride and maybe we'll find something down on the way instead of sitting helplessly like you know people without any cause or or a reason to live and the minute he got on his camel and the camel left his foot to their surprise water sprang in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the of the desert the minute the other family saw this they knew that this is something from Allah so they said there's no reason for us to continue our journey because we know that you are the chosen one and of course did not deprive them from this water he felt and who those who were with him they filled their water containers and he allowed the other families to fill the same from that well that Allah has given so this by itself was an indication from Allah it's it was a great event that the offsprings of the Abdullah will have an important role in the life of the people of Mecca now remember that Abdullah had only one child at the time and after zamzam was awarded back to him he made an oath on himself to Allah azzojan that if ever he would to have 10 of his offsprings ten strong men of his children then he will Slaughter one of them as sacrifice to Allah no this by itself is very strange and weird is this applicable or acceptable in Islam no no it is not oath or if nether when you want something to happen and you say that okay it's an oath from me to Allah if this thing were to happen I will do this and that this itself is not allowed and it's it's highly unrecommendable for example if a person says if I pass the exam I'm going to pay or I'm going to slaughter a sheep and spread the meat of it to the poor this is not recommendable if someone says if Allah Almighty cures my child from its illness I will Fast two days this is not recommendable simply because it is like bargaining with Allah and this is considered to be money taken away from a stingy person because otherwise if you did not have this thing you're calling or you're asking from Allah you will not have paid or you will not have fasted these days so this by itself in Islam it's it's not recommendable but once you make this oath then you have to fulfill it you have to do it so if you say if Allah um cures my child I will Fast two days and Allah cured your child then you must it's a must it becomes mandatory that you fast these two days providing that you did not give or or make an oath on something that is forbidden for example if someone says makes me pass the exam I will buy a beer to all those I know be with alcohol or I'll buy them Rings it's on the house or yeah if I get a child I'm gonna spread a Cuban cigars to all those I know I know because I'm a happy man this is completely forbidden and if you do this you may not do it uh you may not fulfill your oath so Abdullah because he felt how weak he was on his own he made this oath and the oath was if Allah were to give me 10 strong men as my sons I will sacrifice one of them I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program but insha Allah I promise you that by next time we meet I will tell you whether Abdullah had sacrifice one of his sons or he did not and until then [Music] mm-hmm [Music]"
