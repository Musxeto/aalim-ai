  "title": "Shaving the moustache",
  "transcript": "do men have to shave their mustache can they trim it or leave it and make sure that it does not grow uh below the lips because of the Hadith who doesn't trim the mustache isn't from us what are the rules for this it's an issue of dispute the majority of Scholars say that shaving the mustache is a mutilation when you shave the mustache all together and you only see the skin like some of the Egyptian Brothers uh uh and some of the Syrian Brothers some of the Indian brothers and mainly I think it's the Hani school of thought that uh followers who usually do this this is a mutilation as IM Malik if I'm not mistaken used to say and the Sunnah is like in the Hadith is to trim it and the prophet once saw one of his companions with very big mustache and he brought the U suak and he put it on the upper lip and then he cut what exceeded that s therefore I believe that shaving the mustache is completely uh um it's not completely unacceptable it is a mutilation it looks bad on a on a man and I believe that it is not part of the Sunnah however there are Scholars who do this and they believe that it is part of the Sunnah for example if you look at our sh from Egypt such as such as Muhammad Hassan and the others they all shave their uh mustache and I beg to differ with them and and we don't believe that this is part of the Sunnah but they believe it is part of the Sunnah therefore it's an issue of dispute you should follow the she or the imams you think that they're following the Sunnah and their understanding both of them are following the Sunnah yet one understanding is more authentic and correct than the other so you should follow the that you think uh their understanding is closer to the Sunnah than the others and Allah knows best we'll take uh three more questions inshallah"
