  "title": "Prophet Adam losing Jannah example of calamity assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "It's done by looking at other people's calamities. The best of people are the Prophets. Are you better than the Prophets? So, if you lost your house in the recent crisis by floods, by earthquakes, by financial crisis to a bank, if you lost your house, this is a calamity. But look at what happened to Prophet Adam. He ate from the forbidden fruit. What happened to him? Not only he lost his house, he lost Jannah. He was descended from Jannah to earth and this is why we're all here. So, how do you think he feels? Yes, Allah has forgiven him. Allah has pardoned him. But at what price? If your son is disobedient, if your spouse, and I wouldn't say wife so that the women wouldn't hate me, but they hate me both ways, so what the heck. If your wife is nagging and complaining and always whining and you think that you're the worst of all people being tested by Allah Azza wa Jal."
