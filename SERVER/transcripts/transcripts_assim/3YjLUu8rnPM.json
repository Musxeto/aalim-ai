  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] AC [Music] alhamdulillah in linguistically it means to seek the direction of and or aim to do something legislatively tum is wiping over the face and the hands using pure soil or pure land in a specific fashion with the intention of worshiping Allah so this is a definition legislatively and this is part of the umah of Muhammad sallallahu alaih alh wasallam it's a characteristics a a characteristic of the um of Muhammad why there is an authentic Hadith where the Prophet sallallahu alhi wasallam said I've been given five things that were not given to any of the prophets before me number one I've been supported with fear or awe and also the prophet Alat wasam says this of course this awe or fear over the enemies over the distance of one month so before he approaches them by one month Allah throws the awe and fear on of him and of of of the Muslims and their hearts the enemies of Islam and the prophet saysat and the Earth has been made a place of prostration for prayer that is and a means of purification for me so it's not limited to water if we don't have water then we have the ability ability to use this Earth as a means of purification and this is mentioned in the Quran where Allah says and if the water or if there is no water if you find no water then seek clean Earth and wipe over your face and over your hands with it so this is the way of Performing T when should we use the Earth for as a means of purification well Scholars say that this is when we are unable or not capable when there is no water to use simply I'm in the middle of the desert and I have no water to use and there is no close place where I can get water from what should I do prayer does not have any legitimate reason to skip you have to pray in any condition you can so the concession is you don't have water then you can use tum and this is from Allah's mercy upon us what about if I'm not capable of using water meaning that I have water but I do not have the ability to use it due to my illness so I have eczema I have Burns all over my body doctors said you must not use water at all it is extremely cold and if I use water I'm going to die I know that so what to do in this case alhamdulillah Allah gave us the way out where we can perform as per the Hadith of ab may Allah be pleased with him when the prophet saidat that the pure ground or the clean Earth this is a means of purification even if you don't find water for 10 years so this clean Earth is means of purification for a Muslim even if he cannot find water for 10 years ears but if he finds water let him make it touch his skin meaning immediately you have to perform or and move on some Scholars say that tum can be also performed when it is recommended to be in the state of Purity not mandatory and they quote a Hadith where a man came and gave Salam to the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam he said so the prophet did not answer him until he reached a wall and he struck the wall once wiped his face and his hands and then said and I was not in the state of ritual Purity and I did not want to mention Allah's name in that state so I did what I had done to reply to you so what do we do T with Scholars say that we do tum with any pure substance that uh uh has dust or Earth that has particles which clinge to the hand if one can find it because this is what refers to in the Quran but if this is not possible then you can strike anything that is on Earth whether it's rocks Stones sand because Allah says to fear Allah to the best of your ability but it has to be pure you cannot strike anything that is impure you cannot perform tum with an impure sand that has urine in it or anything that is NIS and the prophet said and the Earth was made for me a place of prayer or prostration and the sand or the soil was made means of purification for me so the scholars say anything that is on the ground anything that is on Earth would qualify even if it's a wall even if it's rocks even if it's a mountain if it's sand if it is um without dust this would also work and the moment you perform tum you are in the state of w you can pray with it one F or more not necessarily for each prayer you have to perform tum no once you perform tum then you can pray as many F or voluntary prayers as you wish before the time of the prayer after the time of the prayer until you are capable or able to use water in this case your tum is broken and Allah Knows Best [Music] [Music] for [Music] for"
