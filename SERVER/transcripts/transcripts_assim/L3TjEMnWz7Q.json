  "transcript": "brother Muhammad from the Philippines so my question check is uh here in our place uh whenever they get asked like how how they are the mostly answered that they are fine inshallah is that the correct statement check or is it permissible there is nothing wrong in attaching insha Allah to your current situation usually insha Allah is associated with things in the future what is not permissible is to associate insha Allah with something in the past like or with facts for example one asks me what's your name and I say awesome insha Allah this is not appropriate because this is my name or someone asks me is this your son and I say yes insha Allah and he says are you doubtful he said no so why do you say inshallah either he's your son or not so if someone asks you how are you and you say out of ambiguity that overall inshallah I'm fine there's nothing wrong in that in this sense inshaallah but if you say I'm fine and you're not 100 fine but generally speaking you are fine all in all with all Allah's favors and blessings that he had bestowed upon you there is nothing wrong in saying I'm fine or I'm fine insha Allah Allah Knows Best foreign"
