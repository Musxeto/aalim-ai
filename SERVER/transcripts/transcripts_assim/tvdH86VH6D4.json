  "transcript": "um I wanted to ask I watched some of your videos where you said that it is permissible for um uh to eat at KFC in McDonald's and non-muslim and um Christian countries and my question is um in for example in KFC and McDonald's they also have um like bacon and like I cannot certainly know whether they cook it in the same oil or not so is it still permissible to eat there if I'm not okay we've addressed this uh issue a lot and we said that when a restaurant serves both Halal and Haram food for the fear of cross-contamination a Muslim must not eat there especially when they don't have a code segregating between the utensils between the frying oil between the gloves because some chains of restaurants have a strict code in even changing the gloves when you are preparing a sandwich that is made of beef or a chicken and between ham or pork so if you go to a general restaurant that serves both you should not eat there and you have to avoid an alhamdulillah in Germany and generally speaking in Europe there are hundreds of Islamic or Muslim restaurants that you can eat with confidence inshallah that the food is halal"
