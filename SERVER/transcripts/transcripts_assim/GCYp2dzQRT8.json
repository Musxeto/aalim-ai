  "transcript": "Nazar from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh a person in my family arbitrarily fixes a certain amount into FD of conventional bank for forthcoming emergence in case of certain afflictions of trial ensuring that rebel Naseer that on top of that gets cleansed off to the poor and needy as a person is frightened that those money will somehow going to spend on the regular needs so could he leverage the benefits of such virtual transaction and if not how should I confront a person without the ruling in diplomatic and humble manner Jazakum Allahu Khairan Wa Jazakum if I understood your question correctly you're asking about a person who deposited his money in a fixed deposit a box or an account that generates interest and he keeps that for emergencies just in case so can he do this the answer is no it's totally prohibited for a Muslim to invest or to deposit his money in a conventional bank that generates Riba this is interest now if you are in a country that does not give you the option of not receiving any such interest for example I think some people tell me that India has no option of current account whatever account you have they will give you interest whether you like it or not if this is the case then you're forced to it you don't have any option but the interest money deposited you have to cleanse your wealth by taking it and giving it to the poor to go intentionally and open a fixed deposit account that generates such money and think that this is permissible to do no this is not permissible and Allah Azzawajal knows best we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back"
