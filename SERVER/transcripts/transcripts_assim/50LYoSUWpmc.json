  "title": "Can car seller or salesperson write quotation for a client to submit to bank for interest based loan",
  "transcript": "so she I asked you about quotation earlier one day and you said that quotation is permissible uh but uh the one I asked for they use it for a very specific reason so I I had to like ask you again uh with the specific details uh the about the car company uh the thing is when someone asks for for them ask them for quotation they they direct it towards the bank like uh in the like they uh in their paper I saw the paper in the paper at the beginning they write to the manager of so and so bank and then they they give the quotation and the and at the end they say that uh we hope that you will find this quotation reasonable for providing so and so so isn't it so is it haram or is it allowed why is it haram because like they are directly mentioning the bank manager they are directly like writing it to the bank manager who should they write it to they're coating work to a bank or they're courting work to a company like they are the one who are selling the car so when uh someone wants to buy the car and they come and say that that uh we need we need loan so you have to give us a quotation so they the the one who will buy the car he he says them I will buy I will get loan from this bank so they uh when they write the quotation at the beginning of the quotation they write the name of the bank like they said the manager of so and so no no this is not permissible because addressing the bank means that they know there will be an interest based loan and they're facilitating it rather they should write on the top to whom may it may concern to whom it may concern make it open and they give the quotation they want to go to the bank they want to go to their father or to their uh friends to show them the quotation this is their problem not yours but writing the name of the bank and addressing and communicating with the bank like this this is not permissible permissible"
