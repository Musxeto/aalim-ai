  "title": "How should I respond when someone praises me? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "as if people praise me for a good deed how am I supposed to respond to them well ask allah azza wajal to conceal your shortcomings and don't be flattered by this some of the people say masha'Allah share you're articulate and the chef says yes yes I am I am indeed and more than what you think of me what is this this is boasting yourself this is thinking too well of yourself no a proper Muslim when he hears others praise him he feels small and the more they praise him he gets smaller he shrinks because only Allah knows my shortcomings only Allah knows my sins and no one knows about it so how can I be happy of people praising me or flattering me when I know my own reality so this is how you should act and you should thank them and say only Allah knows my shortcomings may Allah forgive you and this it would be a shawl appropriate"
