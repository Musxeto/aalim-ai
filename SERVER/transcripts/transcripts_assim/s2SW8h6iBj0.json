  "transcript": "rocket from Bangladesh as we know that we have to fill up the first row in prayer and then the second row and so on and if someone makes a row on his own inspite of having the space to fit in in the existing row his prer is invalid so my question is when a person forms a row on his own when is it considered a legit Ro like is it when another person comes and joins him and what if the person who formed the RO started his prayer before the second person standing besides him if the person starts the prayer in on his own while there is a space in the front row and there's no one next to him his prayer is invalid he has to wait until someone comes and they make a RW okay they will be both yeah uh um on the edge but their prayers are valid because they started together or he has to go and this is what is mandatory upon him and fill the Gap in the uh front row"
