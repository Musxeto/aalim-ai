  "transcript": "[Sheikh: Kazawi.] [Kazawi: I have a \nquestion. Can we have two intentions,   like, for an action? Sheikh: Give examples. \nKazawi: For example, if someone is going to..   let's say he's going to go to the gym and he \nwants to please Allah as the first intention,   and at the same time he wants to get muscles, \nif that's an example.] [Sheikh: Okay.]   Kazawi from Morocco, he says, \n'can we have two intentions?'   The answer is 'Yes' in the sense that, I may do \nsomething that is a worldly matter but I intend,   by doing it, the pleasure of Allah. So, \nsomeone who wakes up at 2 a.m and he's fighting   sleep, because he wants to go to bed, \nit's cozy and he feels comfortable   but, he knows that Allah loves night \nprayer. So in order for him to pray   and get the energy he goes to the kitchen \nand he prepares some coffee, or some tea,   drinks it with the intention of being able \nto pray until Fajr. This coffee, or tea, is   a double sword, or a double-edged thing. First, \nhe's enjoying it, secondly, his intention is   to please Allah by helping him to pray. So he's \nrewarded for drinking that cup of tea or coffee."
