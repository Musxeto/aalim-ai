  "transcript": "Linna dean says can we say that one is a companion of allah azza wajal first of all it is not you who takes companions it's Allah who takes companions so I could say I am a very knowledgeable person I know a lot of people I personally know the president of the this country I know the king of this country this is nothing I know them but they don't know me so there's no point in saying this when you say in claim that you are the companion of Allah you are flattering yourself praising yourself what proof do you have so you don't claim that but Allah may select among his servants someone to be a companion to him or a Halil and this is why the Prophet Isis I'm said that if I were to take a dear friend and a close friend which means Halil I would have taken Abu Bakr but I am the Halil or a man I'm the close ally and friend of allah azza wajal so to us for us to claim that with Allah is inappropriate and not permissible"
