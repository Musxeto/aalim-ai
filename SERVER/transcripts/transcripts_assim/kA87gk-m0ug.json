  "title": "The Excellence of Dhikr: Fortress of the Muslim (Part 1)",
  "transcript": "oh this is the first episode with the grace of allah azzawajal that we will attempt to study a booklet that is so tiny in its size yet it is so huge in its impact and influence over the muslims a small booklet that was written by sheikh s yet translate it to literally tens if not hundreds of languages around the world and it was reprinted in the hundreds of millions of copies the book everybody knows through its distinctive color usually orange or light red or yellow but it's always distinctive you can immediately recognize it and the name is the fortress of the muslim a fortress is a place where you go to in order to protect yourself and guard yourself from the attacks of the enemies and our greatest enemy is satan the devil iblis and the fortress that we were instructed to go and run to is vikr of allah invoking allah remembering allah azzawajal and this booklet allah has given it popularity all over the world so we thought that we will give it a shot although it's clear inshallah it's all vicar it's all remembrance of allah it's all part of the atkar that muslims memorize by heart and it's crystal clear what it means we just thought of studying it with you so that allah would bless our gathering when you listen and watch allah would grant you the reward of those who are remembering him may allah make me and you among those who remember him during the day and the night 24 hours seven days a week this beautiful booklet begins with the chapter which states the excellence of remembrance and the sheikh may allah have mercy on his soul quoted for verses of the quran the first one call allah therefore remember me i'll remember you and be grateful to me and never be ungrateful to me how do we remember allah the best type of remembrance of allah is when your heart coincides with your tongue so what you say whatever pleases allah is considered to be thicker subhanallah alhamdulillah and reciting the quran reading a hadith reminding someone of an incident in the seer all of this is considered to be generally vikr so the rest of it is when the heart coincides with the tongue and if you do this you're at the highest level now there are other types of thicker which is more specific and that is when you hear something about islam and you implement it so now you're doing zikr with your limbs rather than just your tongue and heart you're acting upon it so this is a very huge and wide topic that covers all of our our lives as we will see in sha allah and allah tells us in the quran when you remember him he will remember you how is it possible that allah remembers you when we know that allah does not forget see remembrance can be the opposite of forgetfulness but it also can be the mentioning so allah azzawajal will mention you among the congregation wajal has which of course is composed of the close angels to allah azzawajal like jibril israel and those who carry the throne allah will remember you allah would give you his bounties and blessings all of this when you remember allah the almighty the second ayah allah says you who believe remember allah with much remembrance which indicates that remembering allah is not limited to a specific time of the day or the night rather it's a continuous process and to those who are close to allah it becomes like breathing and by the way this is how the people in paradise may allah make me and you among them will remember allah azzawajal there are no forms of rebada of worship in jannah in paradise there's no prayers there's no fasting there's no hajj there's no zakat the only form of worship is remembering allah and they will be given such remembrance by simply something within their lives as if they are breathing not that it is something that they're intending to do it it becomes like breathing so allah is telling us to remember him much remembrance and this is an instruction we need to know are we complying are we fulfilling allah's order and command to us to us then allah azzawajal says in the following ayah with allah and for men and women who engage much in allah's remembrance for them has allah prepared forgiveness and great reward so one would ask what's the benefit of remembering allah azzawajal forgiveness and great reward and also this ayah indicates a very beautiful point an issue that a lot of the enemies of islam seem to like to revolve around allah azza is highlighting that both men and women will be equal in the reward at the sight of allah so there is no segregation in the sense that men are more rewarded than women rather there is this equality when it comes to forgiveness and great reward whether you're a man or a woman when you remember allah azzawajal this is what awaits you allah says and bring your lord to remembrance in your very soul with humility and remember without loudness in words so don't shout allah is not deaf you don't have to do like so many people remember allah azzawajal and making a scene out of it this is not part of the sunnah generally speaking allah says do this in the morning and evenings and be not of those who are unhateful so there is this instruction from allah azzawajal and there are many verses of the quran by the way that talk about this about the importance of remembering allah about continuing to remember allah azzawajal and we will come to know that in the following hadiths inshallah in the following episodes when we come to see how the greatness and the power of remembering allah azza should impact our lives and how far we are from that role we are expected to be fulfilling this is all the time we have until we meet next time i live in foreign"
