  "transcript": "and finally Marcin says why do people suffer in this world when Allah is the most merciful this is something we cannot answer for we know for certain that Allah is knowledgeable that Allah is merciful that Allah Azza WA JAL is wise and that Allah is powerful and he owns everything so whatever Allah chooses and does this is for a legitimate reason we may know it and we may not not but our belief and conviction makes us accept whatever Allah preordained and to make dua to uplift whatever we are struck with an Allah Azza WA JAL knows best"
