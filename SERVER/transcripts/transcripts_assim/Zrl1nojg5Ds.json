  "transcript": "now they have overburden me to take over the mcing and you know I don't like the abbreviation mcing because it simply means mental case so I would rather prefer program manager um I don't want to take a lot of your time I know we've just had our lunch our bellies are replete and I think so laziness and laxity has started to settle in ourselves so I think we need to refresh ourselves can you just stretch a bit up right left stretch a bit stretch a bit we need to be active as Muslims Believers we need to be vibrant stretch up left if you don't mind just for a second can you just stand up and sit down just for a second stand up and sit down fast fast n n take your seats take your seats without becoming a barrier between me and our marvelous shh may Allah subhanahu wa taala preserve him protect him I don't think he need needs any introduction he's very welln The shikh Who uh conducts uh Huda TV and I think one of the most uh trending of his videos is when someone came up to the phone call and I don't know if it was a woman or a male she asked a question that uh is it allowed for the wife to sing for the husband and shikh amazingly answered that he just killed it he said if you have a beautiful voice definitely or else torturing Muslims is not accepted in Islam so uh we will definitely welcome him without wasting any time ald today's topic requires a workshop one for Vi two days eight hours and one for Dua unfortunately we have only this segment or lecture to try and milk as much benefit as possible and to highlight the issue of has a lot of meanings in the Quran some make it up to 16 different meanings and some make it up to 20 VI in English usually means or it is a noun opposite to forgetfulness so when you read remember something I remember it it's and it also means to preserve it has the meaning of honor it has the meaning of Quran it has the meaning of prayer it has the meaning of Torah the Old Testament mentioned in the Quran so many meanings but when we read the Quran we find that Allah the Almighty orders us to remember him and this is found in Allah's Quran where Allah says oh you who believe remember Allah with much remembrance and exalt him morning and afternoon the biggest problem with people nowadays whether Muslims or non-muslims that they do not acknowledge Allah we are a oneman show I'm Invincible I'm strong I'm independent I don't need anyone I have wealth I have health I have everything I didn't see this gentleman sitting next to me so now I'm going to let make life difficult for you may Allah Grant him the reward imagine that every single word that comes from my mouth he's getting similar credit for it at the side of Allah and this is the beautiful role of VI that whenever you convey it you get the same reward whenever you share the video you you get the same reward VI we are negligent we are ignorant because we don't remember Allah until we need something from him so if I'm in a business I don't need Allah when the business is going bad I need Allah oh Allah pay off my debts oh Allah make my merchandise go quickly oh Allah guide my son oh Allah guide my wife or wives depending oh Allah do this for me do that this is when we need Allah and this is not a true true Muslim a True Believer needs Allah 24/7 with every breath he takes with every step he makes because he knows Allah is giving him the means to survive and to live imagine if Allah Asel deprives us from the blessing of sight and you cannot see the blessing of hearing and that you cannot hear it's all a test from Allah asael this doesn't make you an inferior person or a better person it's a test and Allah is testing you and the period of the test is your lifespan on this Earth the prophet tells us and highlights to us sallallah alaihi Ali wasallam when whenever you hear his name offer salutation because this is one of the best VI the best remembrance of Allah you can do Allah what does he say the prophet saysat whenever you fail to pray night prayer whenever whenever you are stingy from spending money in the cause of Allah whenever you are afraid of meeting the enemy of Allah in the battlefield then you should remember Allah a lot if you fail in these three categories night prayer Jihad and spending in the cause of Allah your only alternative is to remember Allah a lot also a man came to the prophet wasam saying oh prophet of Allah the rules and regulations of Islam are so plenty I'm unable to remember them all so tell me something that I should abide by tell me something that I should hold on to the prophet saidat let your tongue be moist with the remembrance of Allah how are we when we remember Allah if I'm walking from this place to my car what will go in my mind what will be recited by my tongue is it the last song of Justin Bieber is it any local song is it a joke that I remembered and I heard a while ago or is it Subhan Allah alhamdulillah no one on earth can say anything better than these five sentences the prophet said it's okay with either one you begin but how many times do we do this there are plenty and so many benefits of Vick but I'll save it to the workshop inshallah you will find it advertised at at at the at the bottom of the screen one of them the means of Vick when you do it you'll be successful in this life and the Hereafter and this is a promise from Allah when you remember Allah and you often make vick Allah will grant you success in this life without any doubt and in the Hereafter Allah asael says and remember Allah often that you may succeed this is a promise from Allah this is is a promise from Allah if you are on the job if you are at your home when you enter the house and your children are fighting make thck we often have the tendency when one of our children makes a mistake or an error we curse them we swear at them instead of saying may Allah guide you may Allah Asel Rectify your Affairs give them good da no shatan overtakes us when you make VI Allah will remember you not that Allah forgets Allah does not forget a thing so how does Allah remember me the Allah says in the [Music] Quran so remember me and I will remember you you in the sense that Allah would preserve us this is one means of Allah remembering us he will protect us and also he will actually mention us among among his angels now imagine this when you remember Allah Allah remembers you by name may Allah be pleased with him one of the great companions one of the four whom Allah ordered the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam to order the Muslims to learn the Quran from Imagine four companions the prophet ordered us to learn the Quran from one of them [Music] is the prophet came to him and said Allah ordered me to teach you a Surah of the Quran OB broken weeping and crying he said Allah mentioned me my name name and the prophet said yes how would you feel that when you make vick that Allah is mentioning you by name what greater honor could there be we sent letters and we said we sent envoys we sent people to the president to the prime minister to the king to the dignitaries so that they can assign an appointment for us to sit and talk with them you have an open appointment with Allah only if you remember him subhanahu wa ta'ala the prophet saidat wasam whenever you pass by The Gardens of paradise then graze in it go and eat like the cattle do in a farm so they said what are The Gardens of paradise the prophet said the circles of we are at the moment in one of the circles of Allah is mentioning us with the angels do you know the the Unseen no but I know the prophet's so you imagine this now when you're listening to this the prophet said any people who would sit remembering Allah the angels will surround them the angels are surrounding us at the moment and mercy from Allah would be bestowed upon them and the Tranquility the sin will descend upon them you will feel that you have no obligations there is no lecture after my lecture abama can wait until M we have no problem because we are in a mjus of th we remembering Allah and the fourth characteristic Allah will mention them with those above Allah mentions usel one of the benefits of it's the best physical Deeds one can offer VI is physical by the way when you mention Allah with your heart alone this is not sufficient and this is extremely and crucially important for you to know I've seen thousands of Muslims when they pray their Li their lips are sealed and they recite the fat in their heart subb they don't move their lips it's like this their prayer is invalid should I repeat rep their prayer is invalid I've looked everywhere in all the books I could find and lay my hands on to find one single scholar saying that when you recite the fa with your lips sealed it's accepted none of them did this your Vick if you do not move your lips if you do not move your tongue not necessarily audible AUD AUD anyhow my English is not that good so don't pay attention you have to move your lips otherwise Allah will not accept it so it is physical and this is why mu may Allah be pleased with him said that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam last statement that I learned from him when he was asked which among the Deeds are best which among the Deeds are best to Allah is it Jihad is it Hajj is it prayer is it charity the prophet said in this Hadith that mu heard it from the prophet Alat wasam the prophet said to die while your tongue is moist with the remembrance of Allah I remember calling sh bin baz about 30 years ago on the phone and he had two phones in front of him I used to call him every single day to ask questions he doesn't know me and at the time we did not have any mobile phones not even pagers so while his assistant picked my phone and put me on hold I can hear the Sheikh answering the other caller and when he concluded included the phone call by the time he handed him my headset to talk to me I I used every single time I hear the say Subhan until he got the phone then he answered my question Pious people righteous people people of knowledge always remember Allah 24/7 they live on it and they die on it remembering Allah is extremely important for the Tranquility of the heart rarely you may find a True Believer being depressed mental issues or being OCD obsessive compulsive disorder patient yet among the Muslims we found plent we find plenty why because they do not remember Allah their hearts are not filled with the love of Allah we may say it by the tongue but the heart is disattached to that Allah the almighty says in the Quran Hearts I'm am depressed I'm so sad I'm worried about my Provisions I quitted my job and now I'm afraid that I may have to beg for money for myself for my children from my wife I say if you believe in Allah if you remember Allah this cleanses your heart and gives you Tranquility a brother sent me a question just a while ago he said as you've directed me I resign from my job immediate effect because I was working inba in Haram but now I get these Whispers that my children will starve my wife may suffer and I may not be able to pay the rent so is it permissible for me to withdraw my resignation I said we are ignorant because we do not remember Allah does Allah provide for us yes or no after lunch I know that you're asleep I'm not going to ask you to stand up we all have knee problems and back problems and Allah knows but at least reciprocate does Allah provide for us there's no doubt in that just to give you a glimpse I have a University degree so I can work with that inshallah and and get a job what does the animals in the Parks where people go and watch have what kind of degree does Allah provide for them to the animals in the jungles for the birds in the skies for the fish and sea creatures in the oceans for the trillions of insects on Earth Allah provides for each and every one of them don't you fear Allah do you doubt that Allah can provide for you then you have a problem this is why you have depression this is why you don't have full trust in Allah because you have a problem if you remember Allah you are protected with the your in an ocean that is endless that has no Coast that is filled with tribulations and calamities and tests this life is like such an ocean how can I survive the boat is going down how can I survive is my life raft is what will take me to the shores of safety it saves us from Shan it saves us from being heedless and neglectful it saves us from hypocrisy as for saving us from shatan the prophet told usat about a list of instructions Allah ordered y Zar to deliver to the sons of Israel so among them he said Allah ordered me to order you to order you to remember Allah a lot make VI but make that a lot why he says the similitude of this is like a man running away from an enemy pursuing him and they are catching fast to him and all of a sudden he sees a fortress so he gets into the Fortress and locks the doors and he saves himself from the enemy likewise remembering Allah protects you saves you from the devil from Satan from Lucifer from Shan he cannot come to you it is your life raft from negligence from being heedless Allah asael says in the Quran and remember your lord so this is within yourself in humility and in fear without being apparent or loud in speech remember him in the morning and in the evening and do not be among the heedless those who do not remember Allah are among the heedless and above all it's your life raft from being a hypocrite who among you can safely raise his hand and say I am not a hypocrite wow only one the sisters two you in great danger those who have risen their hands you are in great danger a True Believer fears hypocrisy om may Allah be pleased with him he used to go to may Allah be pleased with him man with his father and he says I beg you I ask you by Allah am I one of the the people whom the prophet named to you among the the Hypocrites he said no but I will never ever clear anyone's reputation after you you're the last one we all fear being hypocrite and we must because this fear is the fuel that drives us to Jenna if I don't have this fear and I might I put my gears on the fifth gear and I cruise down the highway then I have a problem then I may be a full-fledged hypocrite listen to the characteristics of Hypocrites mentioned in the Quran chapter number four Allah says indeed the Hypocrites think to deceive Allah but he the almighty is deceiving them when they stand for prayer they stand lazily no not not lazy lazily with laziness huh when we stand to prayer how do we stand when we wake up in F alhamdulillah it's F let's go f is it the way or what's wrong IM prayed a long F today imagine he split it into two doesn't he fear Allah Subhan Allah is this the way we're supposed to go to prayer the Allah says and uh they stand lazily showing themselves to the people they're showing off when they pray in home they pray like from 0 to 60 in 2.5 seconds the new Bugatti but when they pray in the Masjid Toyota Cora from 0 to 100 half an hour there's something wrong in our prayer we don't remember Allah and listen to the last characteristic of the Hypocrites Allah asael says and not remembering Allah except a little and this is how we remember Allah when do we remember Allah I asked one of the brothers when was the last time you said said a couple of days ago I sinned and I said how was the prophet in seeking Allah's forgiveness he says oh people seek Allah's for forgiveness and repent to him for I seek Allah's forgiveness and I Repent to him per day more than 100 times andar says we used to count the prophet in one setting in one Gathering seeking Allah's forgiveness repenting to him more than 70 times so what comes out of the our mouths when we are in Gatherings Malik may Allah have mercy Mery on his soul he's one of the great Poets of the prophet wasam and one of the three who were left behind in the Battle of tabuk he says whoever remembers Allah plenty and a lot he will not be among the Hypocrites Allah says and tells us about one of the greatest virtues of VI what's the conference theme nobody knows a path to J listen to what Allah says and the men who remember Allah often and the women who do so for them Allah has prepared forgiveness and a great reward when you remember Allah you go go to jenah why are you here the food is good she okay but see sincerely who wastes a holiday coming to a conference you could do something else but you come here for a purpose you live for a purpose you avoid a lot of Haram for a purpose you want Jenna we all want Jenna and this is the only way to Jenna to make VI one says beautiful speech but what is this requires another Workshop but we will give it to you free inshallah today VI as stated has a number of meanings may Allah have mercy on his soul quoting he said VI has 16 meanings it can be referring to obedience the remembrance of the tongue the remembrance of the heart it is the information it is Preservation and protection it is greatness it is honor it is goodness it is revelation it is Quran it is the Old Testament or uh uh the Torah it is the preserved tablet it is contemplation it is prayers it can also mean one single prayer and among all there are a list of meanings all in the Quran however Scholars say when we say VI this has two main meanings the first one a lot of us do not know and that is Vick is anything that draws you closer to Allah whether actions prayer fasting whether rhetorics and things that we say Subhan Allah alhamdulillah Dua reciting the Quran or whether it is contemplation by the heart if I just sit by the ocean side and look at the ocean nobody's swimming nobody's in his bathing suits I'm in the private area don't get me wrong say no it's just the the water endless and I think of the creatures inside I think of Allah when a leave of a tree falls it's written in Allah's book it doesn't rotate it doesn't spiral f f fall down except with Allah's knowledge in every single inch when a grain of dust or sand comes blowing through the wind Allah knows each and every one of them this kind of contemplation when you think of it it blows your mind away yet it is part of the Vick the second type which we all know is the vi of the tongue these are specific AAR praising of Allah glorifying Allah things that we say with our tongues at specific times and in a specific situation at a specific location and this is where is the MC the mentally uh the yeah program manager how much time do I have left 10 minutes yeah okay another half an hour inshallah because they delayed me an hour and 15 minutes so I'm entitled for compensation AB is sitting there and we have all night long VI brothers and sisters are made of two types restricted specific and general the restricted type is the one that the prophet Alam taught us to say this restricted type you cannot add nor delete so we know that after Salat we have to say Subhan Allah 33 alhamdulillah 33 Allah abbar 33 and the 100th we say this is prescribed as it is you have to say it not a single one extra sometimes we say give five or 10 more it's extra it's better when you have guests to feed them more than less no it's not like this also of course there are other th after Salat we can do 25 of each we can do 10 without of each and so on likewise the vi we do after Salat so this is restricted we are told to do 100 times whoever does this he gets 100 degrees uh uh lift in Paradise 100 sins are erased 100 Good Deeds registered and this would act as a protection from him for him until it's night time so it is restricted in a way and it's General in another way the second type is the general VI so the prophet says say Subhan allaham in one Hadith say it how many times Subhan allaham how many times 100 times what's the result Allah would forgive all of your previous sins and no one can do better than you except someone who did exactly that and added to it added to it has two meanings either added other good deeds or added more than 100 made it 500 1,000 whatever so this is restricted in 100 but also applicable that you can add to it as you wish now the general vicker you must not restrict it to a certain time situation or a place you can say it whenever you want for example offering salutation to the prophet Alam can we offer salutation to the prophet Alat wasam as much as we can as much as we want yes a thousand times no problem but if you come and restrict they will edit this they will edit this again so if they come if you come and restrict it to something that is not part of the Sunnah this becomes a to offer Salat on the prophet you Wabi guys everything Isam that's logic I'm not a wahhabi I'm not as you claim I follow Quran and Sunnah with understanding of the salaf that's logic what's the ruling on offering salutation of the Prophet highly recommended if I go to the bathroom and I say mamad what are they doing offering salutation no no no no no this is not good why so you have to not restrict it Allah be pleased with him once heard a man sneeze and the man said [Music] alul and he said I when I sneeze say alhamdulillah this is how the prophet taught us but not to sayam this is not the place and this is what will bring us to the comparison between what people are doing today and how they're supposed to be the Muslims as usual they are two extremes and a middle path may Allah make me and all of you among the middle path the path of the Prophet Alat do you know better than him definitely not the majority of Muslims do not remember Allah and if they do they remember Allah by the Tongue not by the heart and this is why after Sal we say how much should I do who cares Allah is counting they answer the mobiles they text and they say Subhan alhamdulillah they don't know what they say and not even that some of the brothers after Salah it's a habit they raise their hands and make Dua and they likewise some clap what are you doing he say this is part of the vi you don't know and they clap Subhan Allah what kind of is this with Tempo no there's nothing as such but their heart is not there it's by the Tongue so some people do not remember Allah a lot of them and when they do they do not feel that they are remembering Allah on the far extreme to that you find people remembering Allah Asel but with Innovation not part of the Prophet alam's way so you find some people after finishing the prayer with prayer beats in their necks necks rounded like six or seven times so they take one two three four and it reaches to the end of the hole what are you doing so making Vick you hear like bees and they say I had the GMC 1994 it used to remember Allah like this when you turn it down say it had big engine it's a big VI of Allah I had to sell it though I bought someone that doesn't anyhow what are you doing some of them and I was watching this on one of the news channel channels about Islam in turkey and they took us to a city and they were like a dozen people swirling going round and round and doing this and I what is this says they're making Vick and I was waiting for the moment for their takeoff because the way they're rotating it appeared like a helicopter going up they didn't they failed to to take off alhamdulillah what is this this is their heart is connected to Allah W their hearts are connected toan do you know better than the prophet Alat some of the brothers say I have this special prayer and okay where is it in the Quran and the Sunnah say Quran andah is oldfashioned we have updated 2017 prayers you will not enter Jah unless you follow the footsteps of the prophet you know better so there are so many things that has to be adhered to and that is never attempt to do any type of Vick or any type of worship unless you have proof from the Quran and the Sunnah and this is why and this is not our topic but let me stick with my topic what's the relationship between and Dua Dua is invoking Allah and it is part of the general meaning of so you remember the general meaning of we said that it is any type of worship that draws you closer to Allah prayer fasting doing good reciting the Quran Etc VI is part Dua is part of it but it is also div divided into two types there is Dua of praising Allah the prophet said the best of is ill so this is clear ill goes side by side but then he says alhamdulillah and the best of Dua is praising Allah the praising Allah is also part of Vick what is the meaning of Theon anyone does anyone know what is Theon then noon you're kidding me it's mentioned in the Quran yunus the prophet of Allah peace and blessing be upon him who was swallowed by the whale and stayed in his belly what was his Dua now we know that Dua means to ask for something what was he asking for in the Dua there's no asking the prophet described this in the Hadith no one says this Dua except Allah would answer him there is no God worthy of being woried except you praise be to you glorified be you I admit I was among the wrongdoers what is the Dua The Scholar say that this is Dua of praising glorification of Allah the second type of Dua is the Dua of request and demand oh Allah forgive me oh Allah provide for me oh Allah pay off my debts oh Allah guide my children oh Allah guide my nagging wife oh Allah do this and do do that so you are asking Allah for something specific so they are interl when you ask Allah Asel to Grant you something you are praising Allah because no one can afford to give you this what you're asking except him subhanahu wa ta'ala and there are so many verses of the Quran and there are a lot of etiquettes when we make Dua that a lot of us are not following we fail to follow the etiquettes of Dua and this is why we don't get our Dua answered imagine someone in the highest level of dun an emperor a king who has everything or his wife what would they ask for Asia one of the four perfect women of Jenna and only four women were perfected as the prophet saidia fa and only four what was the position of assia when she sought Dua to Allah oh Allah build me a house next to you in jenah who does this oh Allah grant me a better model of a car or a better model of a wife or a better model of a husband this guy stinks he doesn't shower he doesn't brush his teeth he smokes his belly is like two kilos in front of him anyhow this is not our topic what do you ask when you ask Allah do you ask for Jenna wholeheartedly but you work work in Haram and you bribe and you steal and you lie and you back bite and you cheat oh Allah grant me J what J what Jen are you asking for you have to rectify your work you have to rectify your act you have to shape up if you want to enter Jenna there are many etiquet I'll I don't have time for them but I'll just list them in a nutshell only supplicate to Allah glorify Allah and praise Him always before you make Dua say do as much as you can to compliment Allah to praise him that he's the rich and you're the poor that he's the aiz and you're the humiliated one that he's the strong and you are the weak one praise Allah offer salutation to the prophet Alam your Dua is blocked it will not reach Allah if you do not offer Salam on the prophet Sall alai wasam preferably face the the raise your hands and this is only in general Dua not in specifics not after Salat in general Dua when time now I want to make Dua I raise my hands and make Dua there's no problem in that repeat it three times think positive and this requires a full lecture people think that uh make Dua that Allah facilitate a new job for you no no no no why he said whenever I make Dua Allah doesn't make it happen serious I know a lot of Muslims like this make Dua that Allah Grant you a good spouse no I've tried Allah before this isur this is thinking negative of Allah Allah says I am wherever my slave thinks of me you think good of Allah you'll find good you think negative of Allah you will get the worst thing you ever dreamt of so you have to think positively Allah if I have an illness in my arm and I want to make Dua or I want to make R I said let's give it a try no when my child is sick I recite fa wholeheartedly he will pass this illness and he will stand inshallah cured not because I have special powers I trust Allah I have a Lord that answers and I think positive of him you have to have your heart there when you make Dua not making Dua and you're watching the TV Barcelona is losing alhamdulillah no you have to make Dua and your heart is attending your food and drink has to be Halal your income has to be Halal if your income is from Haram make Dua from here till f after she Abu sama's lecture it will not be accepted and then you must not hasten she I made Dua and Allah did not answer me yeah how long you've been making Dua for the past two hours Prophet a a prophet of Allah was tested by an illness that made he him lose everything and the recovery came after 18 years so you're saying couple of hours and Allah did not answer you you have to wait because this is a form of your submissiveness to Allah that you make Dua and you are hopeful if it comes this is Grace of Allah if it doesn't it's from my sins and you have to be silent and calm when you make Dua a lot of the Muslims in Haram may Allah grant you all an accepted and when you go to Makkah to TA you find people in groups shouting their heads off Allah is not deaf this is a Hadith the prophet said oh people take it easy for you are not calling someone who's deaf or Far Away by Allah you're calling someone who is close and all hearing subhanahu wa'ta'ala and all responding so don't raise your voice when you supplicate to Allah asael and finally no this is serious huh finally you try your level best that when you make Dua that you make it in times of ease when do we usually make Dua in times of hardship in poverty in illness in calamities now everything is fine alhamdulillah we don't make Dua when you make Dua at times of ease when you remember Allah at times of ease Allah will remember you at times of difficulties then we have the times of response when do we make Dua so that Allah would respond to us and this is about 15 points but she abama is getting his guns ready to shoot me so I ended up here and I asked Allah and I pray to Allah asael that he makes me and you among among those who remember Allah often and Allah Knows Best"
