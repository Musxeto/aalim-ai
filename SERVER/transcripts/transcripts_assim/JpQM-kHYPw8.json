  "transcript": "and save some clarification is needed regarding izakat if a person pays the card for previous years without intending a particular date of the sub in the mind because that date is not clear if an overall rough estimate still okay by taking different dates if this is something this is something between the individual and Allah azzawajal let's assume a person did not pay the cat since Ramadan 2000 so it's now 23 years plus and we count the lunar years not the Gregorian years so it has to be counted in like uh in 14 21 for example Ramadan and he's not sure whether it was Ramadan maybe shawal maybe we tell him this is between you and Allah if you don't know what do you want us to do no no Sheikh you have to tell us what how would I know this is between you and Allah azzawajal so what to do Sheikh if it's in Ramadan and you don't know which month it is just to be safe say it is the beginning of the year it's in Muharram this is nine months earlier okay sue me how would I know so if I say Shaban you would say oh Sheikh this might be a month or two earlier so I say okay says okay this might be a month or two late come on man I don't have time to waste on this this is between you and Allah you want to be safe go safe by going two three four months just to be safe rather than sorry nobody is gonna take you by the hand and say do this and do that without knowledge nobody knows when was the original date and it's not something verbal or written it's between you and Allah you estimate and you act accordingly and I hope this answers the question has he"
