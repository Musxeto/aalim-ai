  "transcript": "says can we pray in the masjid before the congregation if i have a class this is possible but not during the congregation because if you come before the congregation and pray on your own and leave before the congregation that would be accepted but if you're praying during the congregation everybody looking at you would say that you are a raphaeli not from sunnah or there's something wrong with your mind and generally speaking if you're unable to pray with the congregation pray at work or pray at the school or pray at home don't show them that you are not interested in praying with the congregation like this because nobody would understand that you have a class afterwards and allah knows best this is all the time"
