  "transcript": "from the us uh there is this woman she's not a very practicing mother nor does she abide by the hijab but her daughter has me has a lot of interest in the deen and she asks many questions which the mother doesn't have the answers to nor does she feel like she can encourage her daughter to wear the hijab because then it's like she would be a hypocrite so what should she do the mother or the daughter who's asking the mother or the daughter the mother is asking okay from the u.s a mom who's not practicing who's not abiding by the hijab has a daughter that is very inquisitive asking a lot about islam interested in hijab wanting to become a better person the mom is stuck between a rock and a hard place what should i do if i encourage her to do hijab she's gonna backfire on me and say why don't you uh wear the hijab why aren't you practicing so the mom is confused well mom don't be confused one of the greatest blessings of allah is when allah grants you someone of your offspring to guide you to jannah when you die don't you wish that your daughter supplicates day and night that allah expands your grave fills it with light opens a window from paradise to it of course yes you want your daughter you want your son to be always supplicating for you making umrah for you giving charity on your behalf what benefits you while you're in your grave so if you don't prepare them from now they won't do anything for you after your death you have to start from today and by the way each one of us is ordered to do four things we're ordered to enjoin virtue and righteousness and we're ordered to do it so i'll tell people guys you have to pray it's time for maghrib that's good number one but i also have to do it and i have to forbid evil advice guys don't smoke number four i myself must not smoke now if i am weak and i smoke so this is one down three to go does it exempt me from forbidden others from smoking so because i smoke i see my son my daughter my friends smoking i do not advise them i say i can't advise him i smoke myself no then i would have committed two sins rather ice continued to smoke which is a sin by its own but i have to advise them and tell them this is haram what you're doing is sinful so that i would not compile two sins all together so now you should try your level best to advise your daughter to abide by the hijab to practice deen to inquire about islam while confessing to her that i'm a bad person i'm a bad muslim what you're doing is the right thing what i'm doing is totally wrong but pray for me and inshallah you will be doing well"
