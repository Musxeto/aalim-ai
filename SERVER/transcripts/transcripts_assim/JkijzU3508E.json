  "title": "Women Swimming & The Burkini | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "for a woman to go to a swimming pool definitely it's out of the question wearing swimming costumes or swimming suits whether one piece or two pieces this is totally prohibited because the thighs the curves the everything is the whole nine yards is is totally out of order so does this mean a woman does not swim no she can swim but she has to wear something that covers her thighs and and and back and buttocks and properly cover her upper body as well a white t-shirt etc and the bikini they have nowadays which is a little bit infamous me and may not depending on how tight it is but generally speaking it does the job but it covers more than she's supposed to cover she she doesn't have to cover her arms if she's going in a segregated swimming pool that is totally for females so a woman has to preserve her chastity and be careful when going to such places and allah azzawajal knows best"
