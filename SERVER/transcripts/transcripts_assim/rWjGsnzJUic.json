  "transcript": "[Music] says if i eat three times a day and say bismillah and the dua after eating that we say and gets our sins forgiven would that day be better in terms of reward or the day i fast voluntary farooq or you cannot calculate such things with a calculator when you deal with allah azzawajal you don't go to such extents and hypothetically saying okay so if i say bismillah and i eat and then say alhamdulillah so if i eat five meals this means that i've erased my sins five times how about if i eat seven meals small small meals these hypothetical questions are not beneficial fasting one single day takes your face far 70 years away from hellfire the distance of traveling 70 years your face is kept away from hellfire what can be more than that allah says all the deeds of the son of adam is his are his except fasting it's for me and i reward for it what can be better than this so at the end of the day definitely fasting is better than eating three days and saying the dua because at the end of the day when you break your fast you're gonna eat and you're gonna make the dua so it doesn't make any sense at all to compare this to that and allah azza knows best"
