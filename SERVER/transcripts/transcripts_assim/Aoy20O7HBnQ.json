  "transcript": "Mohammed says is wearing glasses that have golden frames or arrows a wristwatch that is electroplated with gold is it permissible for Muslim men usually and this is my understanding and you are more than welcome to correct me if I was wrong electroplated is just a color so for men to wear something that is gold-plated if this outer layer or skin has gold in it real gold it is prohibited so sometimes I may buy a wristwatch there is $10 $50 $100 worth and they say it's gold-plated in its old yellow and shiny if I take it to the jeweler's shop and I say does this have any gold in it and he tests it with some acid or some sort of grinding they do to the metal too and to find out and he says no there's no gold in it it's just a color in this case it's Helen but if it takes parts of it and says yes there is a very Manute amount of gold in it this becomes Haram because men cannot wear anything that has yellow gold real yellow metal gold in it"
