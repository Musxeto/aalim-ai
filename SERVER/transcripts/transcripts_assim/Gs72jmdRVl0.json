  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] AC [Music] alhamdulillah when we come to perform w we spoke about some of the conditions now we talk about the real makco so there are six pillars obligatory parts of woodo to be performed in order for your wood to be valid number one and two and three and four were mentioned in the Quran in chapter 5ah verse number six oh you who believe Allah asael says when you rise to perform prayer wash your faces this is number one so it is the first pillar to be done is to wash the face the face is whatever faces people so don't be obsessed by washing this area between your ear and your uh um what do what do they call them whiskers maybe sideburns so people think that oh I I missed this millimeter so I have to spend like half an hour doing it from rubbing it and underneath the chin no no this is your face whatever faces people just wash it normally and move on and it is included in it rensing your mouth and rensing your nose how do we Rin our mouths you take some water place it in your mouth and turn it right left in your mouth then spit it out and also rinsing your nose so you take little water usually the Sunnah and we will come come to talk to that later on inshallah so I'm not I'm going to skip it here so you take the water and you sniff it up your nostril to the best of your ability without blowing your mind without harming yourself and then you blow it out so this is part of washing the face mandatory or recommended most authentic opinion it is mandatory and part of the woodoo you skip it you're is invalid number two Allah says in the Ayah mentioned uh before uh to wash your forearms to the elbows so this means that we have to wash our arms forearms to the elbows big mistake people do is they skip washing the hands because they washed it in the beginning of the wo this is invalid when you wash your face and rinse your mouth and nose when you want to wash your hands you have to wash them from the tip of your fingers to the elbows you have to wash the whole area so number three to wipe the head and wiping the head is not washing the head and the Sunnah is to go from for front to the back and from the back to the front this is wiping the head oh I left a strand here there is a hair that may not have been wiped this is too extreme just do this and that's enough with wet hands of course and included in wiping the head is to wipe your ears as well because in the Hadith of abdah that the prophet Propet Salli wasallam after uh um washing or wiping the head also in other Hadith the prophet said the ears are from the head meaning it they have to be wiped and wiping them is very uh simple just putting your index finger in the ears and the thumbs from behind your ears and do this and it's done now if if someone has long hair a woman or a man you're obliged only to wipe over your head not the rest of the hair this is not included only the area of the head go back and uh front so what about if I am bold in the sense I don't have any hair well you're obliged to wipe over your head not your hair so so even if you don't have hair you just do this motion again on the from the area that usually the hair grows to the back of the head and coming back up front the fourth pillar is to wash your feet up to the ankles so from your toes up all the way to the ankles the ankles are included and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam made a warning to the Muslims when he said wo to the heels from Hellfire woe to the heels from Hellfire meaning many people wash their toes their feet and neglect the heels at the back of their feet because they're lazy or they don't wash it thoroughly they don't ensure that the water had reached that area and the prophet gave them this warning that be careful so this is how it should be done so these are the these are the four limbs mentioned in Surah 5 Verse 6 we come to the fifth pillar which is the sequence and by the sequence we mean that you wash your face arms wipe your head and then your feet you can't switch you can't say I started with my arms to the elbows then I figured out that I didn't wash my face so then I washed my face and then I went on to wipe my head this is a no-o the Wu is invalid it has to have the sequence number six you have to have what is known as Al and Al is that you try your level best to do it doing it uh uh consecutively so washing the face doing the arms wiping the head washing the feet to the an to up to the ankles these are done in sequence and consecutively if you wash your forearms and before you wipe your head someone knocks on the door so you go and open the door for them and go back to continue this is invalid if you go and answer the phone this Gap invalidates your woodo because it's not in sequence so you have to watch out what about if someone has um an amputated limb part of it so someone's arm is may Allah protect us amputated and he has uh I think it's called prosthetic limb I don't know so when he wants to perform M part of it is covered by this device what to do he has to remove it so that what remains of the limb can be uh washed properly but if it is difficult it's installed in a way that causes a lot of hardship to take off and put back again in this case alhamdulillah Islam is a religion of Simplicity and ease you can wash all the other limbs as usual when it comes to this limb you just wipe over the area that is covered and you're unable to uh take it off to wash likewise those who have crowns in their on their teeth or um they have uh uh what what is called as um you know what dentists do in in in the case of um rensing the mouth if you have dental implants or the likes um or false teeth do I have to take them off this is a lot of hardship and is not practical Scholars say no alhamdulillah having such false teeth or dental implants or uh Dentures all of these do not impact your your rining of the mouth and even if it is easy to take off you're not obliged to do this you can keep them M because it has no impact on the validity of the wo and the justification the jurors give is the Hadith of may Allah be pleased with him who was dismembered and his nose was cut off and chopped off in one of the battles and the prophet ordered him sallallahu alaihi wasallam to have a sort of an implant of a golden nose so it would give his face a structure and the prophet did not order him to take it off whenever he wanted to perform W rather to keep it on and this means that alhamdulillah such things as false teeth or um dental implants are forgiven and pardoned with the grace of of [Music] [Music] Allah [Music] for"
