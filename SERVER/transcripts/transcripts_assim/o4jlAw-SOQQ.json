  "transcript": "is it obligatory to uh to to read the quran with the meaning uh so because uh people nowadays they do not show a lot of info okay importance to the quran uh the meaning of the quran okay i will answer inshallah so azim's question is a frequently asked question i don't know arabic however allah blessed me to be able to recognize the arabic calligraphy and letters so i can read surat al-hakuma but i don't know the meaning so is it a must well there are a number of levels level number one is that you recite the quran and you know the meaning of what you're reciting and this is the highest of all in terms of reward because allah revealed the quran to be pondered upon to be contemplated upon and understood second level is to read the quran in arabic but you don't know the meaning of what you're reading so this is quantity versus quality in a sense so you are rewarded most definitely why because the prophet told us that alahizullah with every single letter allah will reward you 10 good deeds with every single letter a deed will be rewarded multiplied by 10 whether you know that meaning or not so definitely the more you read the quran even if you don't know it this is allah's words subhanahu ta'ala so allah will reward you abundantly the third level sheikh i don't know how to read arabic but i can read the translation and understand and then maybe read the tafsir and understand more and more in depth so that is also rewarding and beneficial but these are the three levels in terms of reward and allah knows best"
