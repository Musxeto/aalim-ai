  "transcript": "oh I was studying pillars and conditions of kalimatology so I would like to know what are the consequences if we miss pillar and condition either deliberately or due to ignorance or due to forgetfulness okay these conditions actually the seven conditions whether it's sincerity or yakin or honesty or Etc these are listed and placed by Scholars of a very high magnitude and level and they try to perfect your Islam to the best of their ability by listing these conditions unfortunately this may backfire to Layman and it does a lot so when Layman read these conditions and they start to contemplate upon them they start doubting their Islam do I have sincerity do I have a honesty and Truth in it do I have acceptance fully to it do I have yaquin do I have do I and then it yeah uh goes out of proportion for us Layman just believe in Allah and avoid anything that goes against it embrace it love it and implement it in your life and that would do the job insha Allah the more you read the Quran and become familiar with it the more you read the Sunnah and get acquainted with it after sometime six months a year when you feel that a man is strong in your heart you can then go to commentary of Scholars about these conditions so that you can relate to your Iman and you will feel that okay now it fits like a glove not now it would be a problem for you and it would open doubts and Whispers of shaytan Without End and Allah Knows Best"
