  "transcript": "Ultima from the Emirates now ready sonam's la barqueta I want to ask a question about their dead yes I have heard that if the person if the person who is dead and his body is very heavy then it is a bad sign for that person and if it is like it's a good sign but I want to know that if the person was suffering from kidney failure and the whole body was full of water the hands and legs were very swollen and heavy before death so is it the same sign for that person also if the body becomes very heavy after death okay any more questions you're welcome okay so sister Fatima is asking about what a lot of the people say that if carrying a body of a deceased when carrying the corpse of a person if it is heavy this means that this is a bad sign and if it is light then this is a good sign this has no foundation of backing it up some would think that if a person is like 400 pounds or someone who is like 180 kilograms in weight this person is fat he's big he's huge so to carry him you have to have strong men to do so sometimes the men themselves say that his body was so light we did not feel anything so this gives the people an impression that maybe the angels helped carrying him but we do not have any concrete evidence to support this therefore it was not mentioned in the Quran or in the Sunnah that the weight of the corpse the weight of the deceased when being carried to his grave has any significance so if it's heavy it means that he is an evil person with bad deeds and if it's light then it is good no I don't personally know anything that backs this up so it doesn't matter whether the people complained from the weight or not what counts is the style of life he led whether he was among the worshippers he used to observe prayers on time he used to avoid Haram this is what counts his reputation among the Muslims they complement him after his death saying that he was a good person this is what counts so Jesus question is there in the door I don't know of any dua that produces such pains and I hope that answers this his question"
