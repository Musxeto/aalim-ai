  "transcript": "uh I want to ask I have twin daughters abha and manal the one is more obedient and always listens to me and the other is a little little bit stubborn and she doesn't listen to me I mean how to deal with her when she see me that I am polite with the other kid or I am listening to other kid and she wants extra love from me but still she's St how to deal with stubbor How old uh they are four years old okay first of all you have to fear Allah a four-year-old child is not a rocket scientist or a nuclear physicist it's a 4year old child with a foure old child's brain so you have to cater for her feet feelings emotions and look at your own hands none of your fingers are alike they're not in the same length so you can't treat both of them just because they're twins in the same identical way now there has to be jealousy especially when they see you treat them differently so you have to add more compassion and love uncondition love to the stubborn one to show her that b beside all what she's doing you still love her and care for her but when she makes a mistake she has to be reprimanded and she has to pay the price so that she would learn not that you deal with the good one and the bad one alike regardless of their mistakes so you have to be diplomatic you have to be compassionate and caring and loving to both of them and be patient because 4 years old is still a child doesn't know what's right and what's wrong it needs to be conditioned to be trained to be uh um taught how to behave and this may take five six more years but it would pay off sweetly inshallah if you decide no I am fed up I've had enough I'm going to treat her as a uh uh um spoiled undisciplined child and the other one I'm going to give her love and care you are destroying her totally and she will grow up to hate everyone around her and to be rebellious all the time and it's your fault may Allah protect us all"
