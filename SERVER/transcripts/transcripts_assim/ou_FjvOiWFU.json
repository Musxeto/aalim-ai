  "transcript": "Benamin from Bosnia. So if a brother swore by Allah that someone said X Y and Zed uh and he thought it was true but uh it turns out that someone said like Z Y and X does this fall under unintentional oaths? Yes, this is an unintentional oath. And to add an extra bit of information, oaths that are about the past, whether you say it truthfully or you lie in it, there is no experation for it. The experation of a broken oath is only for something that you make in the future. wall I will come or wahi I will not eat and then you break your promise or your oath this is what you expect but if you say wahi I don't have a single penny in my pocket and then you discovered that you have money and you did not know there is no experation whether you said this truthfully or you were lying"
