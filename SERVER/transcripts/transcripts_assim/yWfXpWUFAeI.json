  "transcript": "[Music] she says will the pure or good souls meet each other in the barzah this is an issue of dispute among scholars and the most authentic opinion is that it is not backed up by authentic hadees and hence we cannot confirm such a thing but let us take this argument to another level what are the possibilities one that souls meet in the bazaar two they don't meet what impact does either one have on us on our ibadah on us getting closer to allah azzawajal zero so why do we occupy our time and researching over an issue that has no value why do we waste time asking such such questions that would not benefit us yeah it's fun to know that oh my late father will be meeting my late grandmother but without evidence this is fruitless it has no benefit and allah azza knows"
