  "transcript": "he says I live in a non-muslim country so he's referring to Sweden as a non-muslim country and he says that I'd like to invest some money but I don't have this money is it permissible for me to borrow from a conventional bank there and this is a misconception that a lot of the Muslims have they think that by living in non-muslim countries there are number of laws and regulations that are softer than those who live abroad so they consider this country as a non-muslim country and hence non-muslims we can take riba from them give them RIBA we can take their money without fearing being accountable on the day of judgement some even escalate this and say we can kill them we can rob them we can would you be la this is totally out of the question in Islam as sin is a sin you rob from a Muslim or you rob from a non-muslim it's the same therefore it is totally prohibited for you to acquire such an interest-based or a river based loan from the bank whether it is for investment purposes or whether it is for mortgage of your house etc"
