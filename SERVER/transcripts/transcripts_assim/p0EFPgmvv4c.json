  "title": "When I pray Witr with the Imam, he did not sit for 2nd rakat & on 3rd rakat, he did not say Ya Rabbi",
  "transcript": "Haseeb from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh, my question is, so when I prayed with the Imam in Masjid, basically he didn't sit down on the second rakat and he didn't do Atayat. And on the third rakat, he didn't say, the way I was taught, it was basically on the third rakat you say Ya Rabbi, Ya Rabbi, Ya Rabbi, but Sheikh didn't say it. So my question is, can you tell me how to do Wudu step by step? Okay, first of all, whatever your Imam did was the right thing and he's following the Sunnah. And whatever you were taught is not according to the Sunnah. Witr, which is three rakahs, usually, is either prayed two, like Fajr, and then you offer Salam, and then you stand up for the single rakah, so the total is three. Or, you pray them all continuously, as three rakahs, as in the case of Maghrib, but you do not sit in the second rakah for Tashahud. Rather, you sit only in the final rakah. And this is what the Prophet ordered us, Alayhi Salatu Wasalam, not to make it look like Maghrib, and we should not sit in the second rakah. Saying Ya Rabbi, Ya Rabbi, Ya Rabbi, this is an innovation, and not part from the Sunnah, and Allah knows best."
