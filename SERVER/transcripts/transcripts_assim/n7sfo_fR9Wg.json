  "transcript": "Rashid from Sweden Rashid Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Barakatuh I had a Christian ask me that why didn't Allah remove the previous revelations like the Bible to avoid the misconceptions from happening? Wouldn't that mean everyone would follow the last and final revelation, the Qur'an? I do not understand. I did not understand your question. Rashid I had a Christian. Okay. He asked me that why Allah didn't remove previous revelations like the Bible to avoid the misconceptions. So his question is what is the wisdom of revealing the Qur'an as the last revelation while keeping the Old Testament and the New Testament and the different scriptures with different religions. Why didn't Allah take them revealed to him was coming from his mouth not according to those people. So when they see that they have gazillion versions different from one another and they see that the Qur'an is one 15 centuries still one in the same language it was revealed in understood by a native of 400 million living on earth memorized by less than 10, 20 million by heart and they see how miraculous it is they can be tested saying hmm would you want to follow what your forefathers followed which you know and see that is corrupt and not real and it does not hold in terms of authenticity nor in terms of logic or would you follow this Qur'an and Allah knows best."
