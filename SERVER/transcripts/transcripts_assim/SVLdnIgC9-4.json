  "title": "Should I recite Tashahhud, durood, & dua in Imams last rakat if I joined late or sit idle? Assim al",
  "transcript": "from malaysia says that when the imam is sitting for the first tashahood or the second to shahood where i have missed iraq so after he offers the salaam i'm going to stand up to complete my prayer should i recite the tashahud only or also the salutation upon the prophet of salaam ask yourself this question if i were to only recite it to shahud knowing that the imam is going to take like 40 seconds to a minute to complete his own salutations for himself etc until the salaam what will you be doing meanwhile it is not logical for a worshiper to stay idle in salat so looking at the chandeliers and counting this or that or looking at people's feet in front of you if you're not practicing social distancing so this is not at all acceptable you have to do the salutation the dua and make your own dua rather than just sit idle without doing anything likewise for your second question when you are in the first the shahood and you are wiggling your fingers this has been omar's narration and then the imam does not stand up so what do you do you put your finger down and you just watch others or you continue to say allah muhammad though it is not part of the first shahood of the first sitting yes you do continue because you should not sit idle and you should try your level best to um [Music] utilize your time by uh reading the salutation allah azza knows [Music] best you"
