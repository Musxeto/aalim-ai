  "transcript": "to tell you the truth our role in life is to get married this is the utmost important thing in life after ibadan if they are poor Allah will make them Rich from his grace so marriage is highly recommended in Islam it is sufficient that the prophet says when a man gets married he has completed half of his Deen so he should fear Allah in the other half so it's a huge responsibility unfortunately with girls like the song goes girls want to have fun they focus entirely on a job and they may postpone proposals when they're 25 30. what are you doing no no few more years I'm pursuing my career and when I be a manager no I want to be a GM no I want to CEO and by the time they've reached their goal work wise they start looking for proposals and unfortunately they don't get proposals for a wife they get proposals for a nurse because those proposing are over their 60s so they want a nurse not a wife you're too late and unfortunately I have this in my own family my own daughters some of them don't want to get married why I want to pursue my career I can't force them I can give them advice I can preach them but usually a preacher's preaching is not valid in their own homes I have there is males and females who come to me and beg me to speak to their children and I go in for half an hour invitation over dinner I speak to their children and boom mashallah they accept and they're practicing committed and they said to Allah we tried everything in our Arsenal it did not work I call this Daria this female she's a friend of my wife to come and speak to my daughters in half an hour she has wonders and magical tricks and I say to my daughters why don't you listen to me she's my student she said it doesn't sound well if you have a guitar player in your family he doesn't know how to play guitar music is Haram by the way but if you listen to the neighbors guitar player oh he's good because you're used to it therefore I tell you your priority is your matter to life you get proposals The Proposal checks all boxes alhamdulillah get married if he says you can stay and continue your work in education in a Halal job it's a win-win if he says no I'm rich enough to provide for the house you don't have to work then you have to stay home mom you say okay but I have my parents to provide for them said no no you don't you want to repay some of what they had done but this is their job and not something they're making Yani out of generosity it's their job my jobs as a father to give my daughters and to bring everything to them they're trying by the way to give me something back in cash I don't take cash for money I don't take things from my daughters that I live and die to provide for them I would not accept anything from them I don't need help alhamdulillah so you focus on your marital life if it there is something coming if there's nothing coming continue your work continue your job until Allah sends your way someone who checks all the boxes practicing fears Allah not the Mommy's boy and he does all these things but inshallah Allah will make things happen in Allah Knows Best inshallah"
