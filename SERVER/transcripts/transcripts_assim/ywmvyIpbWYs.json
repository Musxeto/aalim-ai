  "transcript": "foreign [Music] my question is if a student want to join a certain College and uh the officials of that college they ask for money in a kind of Bible because most of the time making that placement they release a few students the others now they ask for for money so it won't be that money that they are possible and want to join uh the college is that we are sinful for our praying and if not being then the person will not get a chance to get in that to enjoying that College bribery in Islam is totally prohibited over the table under the table you call it a gift you call it whatever it's all a major sin the prophet said may Allah curse the one who gives a bribe and the one who receives a bribe so in another Hadith and the one who is commissioning so he's the one who is the broker of the deal they're all cursed by Allah azzawajal however when a person is in a corrupt country unfortunately some of the third world countries and maybe higher they run everything through bribes so you go to these countries and you want your own rights that you are entitled to through law and they deprive you from it Scholars say that if you are in need to get your own rights or to prevent harm Afflicted upon you by the um those in charge or in authority unlawfully and without any legitimacy you cannot do that without bribing them here bribing them becomes halal I imported a car from a country and when my car came it fits all the conditions and the standards and everything is legit the paperwork is fine the custom officer simply says you have to give me x y z so that I can sign and clear your car I tried all means possible it seems that the whole system to the prime minister is okay with that so what can I do in this case you can give the bribe without any sin on you now in the case of this University if everyone who is to be admitted to this University has to pay this bribe and there's no way around it and you tried but the officials are corrupt and everyone does not care and your son who or you who is trying to be admitted fits the qualification needed and the level of the grades or the percentage or whatever required and you fit that but you're blocked from entering until you pay right in this case you may do that and Allah Knows Best [Music] and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for Allah foreign"
