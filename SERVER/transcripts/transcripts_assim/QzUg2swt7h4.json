  "transcript": "comment from the philippines he says he repeats his wudu many times why muhammad he says because i hear noises in my stomach but nothing comes out so i'm confused there is a hadith where the prophet has said do not break your prayer until you hear a noise or find an odor smell an odor or a foul smell so he's confused because of this hadith you misunderstood the hadith the hadith was about a person who's doubtful not certain if i'm certain that i passed wind even if there is no smell and no sound it was totally stealth yet i'm certain of it i have to renew my wudu but if i'm doubtful i don't know what to do the prophet says continue in your prayer your wudu is valid till you hear the sound of wind exiting your anus if it did not exit then there is no need for you to perform mudu so you misunderstood the hadith it's not just any sound he was referring to the sound of the wind coming out of a person's back passage and not to the gargling saw a sound in your stomach"
