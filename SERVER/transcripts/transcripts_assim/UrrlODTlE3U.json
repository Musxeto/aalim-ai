  "transcript": "Allah yeah so uh recently that there's this thingy which is uh what you call uh AI chatbot thing uh name check GPT where one can ask a white array of questions on on any topics okay so if a Muslim wanted to ask a question about Islamic Jewish students and and whatever not to check GPT uh is it permissible to do so first of all chat gbt is an um AI app that is not someone who's answering it it's a collection of um millions of knowledge-based information and algorithm makes it easier to detect what you're asking about and figure out what is the most appropriate answer and they give you the answer this is not an individual that is answering your question and hence you cannot ask questions about Islam because like ebene says may Allah have mercy on his soul this knowledge is religion and you must know who you take your religion from the knowledge of tafsir of Quran of Hadith of fatwa of this is Islam this is religion you can't go to Tom Dick or Harry and ask them to answer you it's not permissible you have to know who that individual who's answering your question is what's his reputation was he accredited by Scholars was he refuted by Scholars his track record is clean or he has bumps and uh uh loopholes in what he's saying you just don't look at an individual he looks smart his beard is quite tall he's got him but I forgot mine today and wow this guy is okay or he has a lot of followers on Instagram or on YouTube Etc this is not a criteria that you judge things with so the child gbt is not a trustworthy app or environment to ask questions about your religion nor about your health you wouldn't simply go to them and ask them what medical medicine should I take for the following sentences and you Bismillah go ahead and take them you wouldn't do that you need to ask a real doctor a professional who can diagnose your illness and give you the remedy with the grace of Allah"
