  "title": "Parents don't allow me to wear the niqab or gloves, must I obey them? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um if a parent is not necessarily discouraging but they're um pushing you to not wear the N they're not letting you wear the N at all at all costs and they've removed you from being able to wear gloves and they're telling you to wear the hijab or at least to Luci dress are you sinful if you were to listen okay so this is commonly happening unfortunately in some households the parents do not believe in nikab and do not endorse their daughters wearing the gloves and sometimes they fight and intimidate and threaten so what is to be done this is not a one-size fits so a girl has to look seriously into the consequences the general idea is there is no obedience to anyone in disobeying Allah end of story if they tell you wear many skirts is this Halal you would say oh no way I'm not going to do this even if they slaughter me good what about Maxis no I will not expose my feet what about short sleeves no half sleeves maybe to here so what's the red line that you would say yes or no it's the Shar it's not based on my whims and desires so if your conviction is that wearing the nikab is mandatory which is the most authentic opinion and covering the hands whether with gloves or with your is the most authentic opinion then you have to follow that let's look into the consequences if your father is a tyrant he's a nutcase he's a lunatic would probably harm you or probably do something uh that's illegal or inflict uh uh uh damage in this case you're oppressed and you're compelled to obey within the limits up to necessity so yes may I may have to take off my nikab if I'm with him but if I'm going to school or to work or somewhere else and nobody he's not with me I fully cover so I have to reduce the damage to the best uh amount possible if he's just saying things without carrying them through dogs that bark don't bite so you should not uh uh be intimidated and you should try to remain steadfast and holding your grounds and may Allah make things easy um"
