  "title": "Is it from the Sunnah to say 'Rabana wa lakal hamd' loudly? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Saad from India. Sheikh, I had a question that the masjid I went to here, there was one man who after the Imam said, Sami'un Qahli Man Hamidah, he in a loud voice in every salah says, Rabbana Walakal Hamd, and he says it in a longer version of it but loudly, while all the people stayed silent. So I just wanted to know whether this is from the Sunnah or not. Well, Jazak Allah Khairan. Wa Jazak. If this man is behind the Imam and the microphones are not working, and he's raising his voice so that the people in the sixth or seventh row would be able to follow the Imam, this is called Tabligh. And this is permissible in large congregations. Nowadays with the microphones available, when the Imam says Sami'un Qahli Man Hamidah, the mu'adhin says Rabbana Walakal Hamd. Excuse me, what are you doing? Says I'm relaying the Takbir of the Imam. There's no need, there is a microphone and a speaker in every single corner. Everybody knows what the Imam is saying, you can hear his whispers even. So this is not permissible. Unfortunately, a lot of the people follow the customs, the traditions, they don't follow religion. So don't associate with Islam, with the religion, except what's part of it. Now, most likely this guy is an isolated case. He's just someone who watches the Salat in Haram and he sees what the mu'adhin is doing, and he likes it and he likes his voice, so he raises his voice like that. This is inappropriate. If he's doing it purposely to make people listen to his voice and annoy people, it invalidates his prayer. If he's doing it without paying any attention, sometimes when you're in Ruku' or in Sujood, the guy next to you, like three, four guys down the road, would say Subhan Rabbi La'la, Subhan Rabbi La'la. And what is this guy doing? Why is he raising his voice like this? Some people have OCD. Some people don't feel that they're doing Tasbeeh unless they hear it this loud. Would it invalidate their prayer? No, their prayer is valid. But they're not following the Sunnah and they should not be doing this. This person, this individual who raises his voice like this has to be advised after the Salat. We go to him, a brother, uncle, son, listen, what you're doing is wrong. Imagine if each and every one of us raised his voice like that. Would that be appropriate? Did the companion ever do such a thing? Then, inshallah, he may come back to his senses. And have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And if you're not, you're entitled for one free session. And if you're not, you're entitled for one free session. And if you're not, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it, inshallah, within the following two days or three days. And by Allah's permission, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, by Allah's permission."
