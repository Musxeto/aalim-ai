  "transcript": "um is it considered cheating or is it permissible for someone to go to a country with a lower currency to go for umra or Hajj no this is not cheating if you come for umrah or Hajj from the U.S the rate is extremely high but if you go to Pakistan you'll probably pay half the price there so lots of the U.S citizens go to Pakistan and book their Hajj packages or umrah packages from Pakistan or from India or from their second country and they come and there's no problem and that there's no cheating at all"
