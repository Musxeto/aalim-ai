  "transcript": "from nigeria is it mandatory to recite the fatiha behind the imam this is an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion is the opinion of imam malik may allah have mercy on his soul which was adopted by sheikh listen and many scholars like i think albania and others which says when you are praying in a loud prayer behind an imam his recitation of the fatiha because it's loud is sufficient for you you're exempted you don't have to recite it in such loud raqqas can i recite them you can after he finishes the fatiha if you want to recite it on your own no problem is it mandatory no it's not but in silent raqqa's it's a pillar upon the individual praying behind the imam so i have to it's a must that i recite the fatiha in all raqqa as of lord and asir and in the third rakah of maghrib and the third and fourth rakah of isha it is a must if i don't my raka is invalid"
