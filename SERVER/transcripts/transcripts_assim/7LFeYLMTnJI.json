  "transcript": "shazia says i want to know about surah ayah 80 and 81 why are killed the boy allah knows everything so allah changed the heart of that boy why it's necessary to kill him um please explain first of all al-khadr had three incidents with prophet musa peace be upon them one was with the ship that he made a hole in it two was with the child that he killed three was with the wall that was about to fall and he fixed it in the three incidents when he explained why he did what he had done to moosa peace be upon him if you read the quran in the incident of the boat or the ship he said i wanted to defect it so this was of his own ishti had probably he thought of doing it on his own and that was a good thing because otherwise the soldiers would have confiscated the ship and taken the whole thing by damaging it a little bit they thought it was defected they let it go and the people the poor people got to keep their ship in the incident of the child he used the plural pronoun including himself we wanted that is allah azza and myself so this was a revelation from allah azzawajal and he may have chosen the way on his own but it was revealed to him from allah when it came to the wall he said he said this is i have nothing to do with this it's allah who wanted them to reach puberty and to extract the treasure by themselves so whatever was done was clarified to us now in the case of the child allah created him and allah azzawajal with his infinite knowledge knew what he were capable of doing in the future if he were to live so you would say why didn't allah change it why would allah change it did what his knowledge and his intent intention and will dictate it best it is allah who owns everything and knows everything so allah simply got rid of that boy to substitute his parents with someone who is way better way do more dutiful and obedient and coolness to their hearts and eyes now if you begin to explore the chapter of what if you will never believe in the predestiny good or evil because everything that happens you would object and say why didn't allah do so and so what if so and so happened and this shows that the sixth pillar of the iman has not been fulfilled and this takes you out of the fold of islam six pillars of iman if you don't fulfill them you're not a muslim even if we see you as a muslim we treat you as a muslim on the day of judgement you'll be taken straight to hell angels in his books in his messengers in the day of judgment and in the pre-destiny good or bad so be careful"
