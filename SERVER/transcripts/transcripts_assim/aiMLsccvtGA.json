  "transcript": "while watching the new sighting it felt like a good enlightening this day is alright as the first time always the night with family around a nice meal we're making the one i feel how nice it is to be so neat to those i love of virtues of fasting coming to you live from jeddah saudi arabia we have hadith number nine and this hadith was narrated by sahil assad may allah be pleased with him he says that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said people will always be fine on the right path or following the sunnah as long as they hasten to break their fast in ramadan and this hadith was agreed upon the following hadith hadith number 10 abu hurairah may allah be pleased with him said that the prophet salallahu said allah the most exalted said which means that this is a hadith those among my servants who hasten to break their fast are the most beloved or the most dearest to me and this was reported by atir midi in his sunan if we look at these hadiths and contemplate upon them we find that the prophet ali salatu islam is highlighting the issue of breaking your fast and being uh or doing that as soon as the sun sets and this is the usual question when does a person break his fast and the answer would be as soon as the ring of the sun disappears so if it disappears and you don't see it and it is most likely that it had set then it has set and it's time for you to break your fast now the prophet said people will remain to be fine or uh people will always be fine this means that they are on the right path this means that they are upon the sunnah but what kind of people is he referring to well without any difference of opinion among the scholars he's referring to the muslims so when the prophet says the people will remain to be fine or on the sunnah this means that he is talking about specific type of people and that is the muslims because the non-muslims definitely are not included in this hadith because they don't fast with us ramadan and they don't haste in breaking their fast and this brings us to another issue if a non-muslim fasts will he be rewarded for that and this leads to a third issue or a second issue which is are the non-muslims addressed by the general principles of islam or even by the small details of islam what does that mean we know that non-muslims they are ordered to accept islam and it's not us who is ordering them it is their creator allah orders them to accept islam to revert back to islam because all those who are born they are born muslims do you mean that they pray and fast no no they're born muslims in believing that their will is submitted to allah and they believe in the oneness of allah but their parents have their influence over them so their parents make them christians jews or fight worshipers as the prophet said in the authentic hadith so we do not order them it's allah that orders them to accept islam these are this is the principle of islam but are they also addressed when allah says you have to pray you have to fast you have to give zakat it's an issue of dispute among scholars the most authentic opinion is that they are not addressed by it in this life but they're held accountable for it on the day of judgment so i would not go to a non-muslim and say why aren't you fasting why aren't you paying zakat why aren't you praying with us because even if he fasts and he feels the hunger and the thirst it would not be accepted from him as allah mentioned in chapter 9 that the only reason that what they give in charity would not be accepted by allah azza is that they disbelieved in allah and in his messenger so in this life we don't hold them accountable if they don't pray but they are not ordered to pray and even if they do or even if they were ordered to pray then it would not be accepted because the principle which is the belief in allah and uh the prophet isam as his messenger and servant this is essential for anything to be accepted at the side of allah the almighty so yes they are addressed by the small uh details of the sharia as mentioned in surat al-mudar allah what made you enter hellfire and they say the first justification the first reason that is they say we were not among those who used to pray and we did not feed the poor and we used to talk in things that are not useful or beneficial to us and we used to deny the existence of the day of judgment this fits like a glove to all atheists these are the four reasons that they give for them to enter hell fire on the day of judgment and they give give these reasons while they are in hell and this is uh something that if they had the brains to think if they had the heart to consider they would have reconsidered again so they are addressed by the principles and the details of the sharia the prophet says people will remain to be fine or on the sunnah and this word is used a lot kuntum you are the best of nations given to the world so to be fine to be good to be among the elite this has an origin one of the reasons for this is a gift and a favor and a blessing from allah azza allah chooses whomever he wishes at one point of time allah azza favored the jews the sons of israel but then he deprived them because of their continuous treachery and deceit because of their continuous disbelief allah azza deprived them and stripped them off that privilege and gave it to the nation of muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam and among the reasons of us being the elite we are being the best that as the prophet mentioned allah that we hasten when we break our fast and this is in contrast this is in opposing the jews and the christians because the prophet tells us aslam that they do not hasten when they break their fast i personally don't know how they fast but i believe what the prophet said that islam likewise this is a sign of those who are fine and on the sunnah that they hasten their breakfast they break their fast and they are quick to do that as soon as possible unlike the deviant sects and cults that claim to be muslims and refuse to break their fast once the sun had set and they wait until the stars are visible some of them not all of them this is against the sunnah and it is a sign if we understand the hadith as it is we it is a sign that the people once they do this that is postponed their fast breaking until the stars are visible which means like 10 15 minutes maybe more after the actual sunset this means that they are not fine and they are not upon the sunnah on the contrary they are opening doors of evil and doors of deviation and innovation and the issue of innovation is very important because nowadays you see a lot of the people having misconceptions we are blessed by allah azzawajal and i'm talking about you viewers of huda tv allah has blessed me and you to be upon the sunnah of the prophet no matter how many times people attack you no matter what they say about you you always stand up with your head up high because you have the quran and the sunnah with you so no one can say anything negative about you unfortunately a lot of the expatriates when they go back to their countries they're faced with a lot of the deviant sects who control their people and the first thing they do to these expats who went back home for a vacation or for permanent uh returning back they say that you are wahhabis you are salafis you are deviant and they call them names and subhanallah why do you call people names why don't you look at what they do and judge them accordingly people around the muslim world are so involved in innovation they're so up to their necks with things that go against the quran sunnah by following their lust and desires and they would not follow the proper quran and sunnah and lots of these so called so-called scholars they are dominating their people because they're making a lot of money out of that and that is why they do not want anyone to interfere they do not want anyone to come and change the norm and subhanallah those who accuse us by being wahhabis or by being salafis and and this is not an accusation if this means that we're following the quran sunnah alhamdulillah it's an honor and a privilege but those usually who slander and label people like this are usually either shia or from the deviant sects baha'is or by the sufis who are so extreme in their innovation that they have been blinded and they cannot see the right track and now when we come to the issue of bidha see when i say that postponing breaking your fast until the stars appear this is an innovation one would you know feel a little bit agitated and the word biddah makes people who are not following the sunnah makes them agitated why because it takes them off their comfort zone but if they had knowledge of the quran the sunnah if they applied their logic through the quran and sunnah wallahi they would not have any problem because our religion is the easiest religion around and i'll give you an example there are six things that must be applied so that we can identify whether this thing that i'm doing is it according to the sunnah or am i innovating and these things are very logical i'll give you examples for them now bear witness don't think of me as a wahabi as a salafi as a xyz whatever uh just think of what i'm gonna say analyze it use your logic with your knowledge of the quran and sunnah and see if it clicks or not and then compare apple to apple compare what i say to what your scholars and what your peers and what your leaders say so that they would keep you in their barn and they would not allow you to go out and drink from the main sources of the quran sunnah there are six things one the cause or reason two the type three the how for the quantity five the place six the time very simple let us apply it in the remaining time inshallah and this is applicable in everything you worship allah with a sojourn so the reason what do you mean by the reason what i do has to have a justification so that it would be accepted by allah azza so the reason is very important and it has to be applicable so if someone says what's the ruling on offering salutation to the prophet allah is a great form of worship can i say it like a gazillion time a day no problem the door is open say it as many times as you wish the prophet did not set a limit allah but if i attach it to something that was not used at the time of the prophet salam it becomes an innovation example if i come out of the toilet after answering the call of nature and i say of as the sunnah and then i say muhammad is this applicable if i sneeze and i say alhamdulillah wasallam once and a man sneezed in his presence it says alhamdulillah and i also offer salutation to the prophet but this is not what the prophet taught us allah he told us if one of you sneezes he should praise allah and not to offer salutations to the prophet so the reason here is unaccepted because it was not done at the time of the prophet saws likewise a person who enters his home at four o'clock in the afternoon every single day and he prays two raka's what are you doing he said every day this is my custom that i do not enter my house without praying to raka's this reason is unaccepted the prophet used to enter his house also never ever he prayed these two raka's so you are now innovating so this is the reason number one number two the type what do we mean by the type islam came and told us to do certain things with certain types so we cannot choose something else for example in hajj what is the sacrifice that we slaughter to allah azza it has to be from livestock camels cows or sheep and goat of course so you cannot choose anything else if someone says listen i have a horse and we know that horse meat is halal to eat and this horse costs like the the price of 50 camels so i'd like to sacrifice it for the sake of allah say this is unacceptable and if you do it wouldn't do you anything any good why because the type is essential if someone says okay i'm gonna slaughter one thousand chicken it's much better for the poor muslims than a sheep he said no even if slaughter a million it wouldn't do throwing the pebbles in hajj we know that you have to throw seven pebbles on the jamarat if someone says instead of throwing seven pebbles i'm gonna shoot it with an ak-47 seven bullets that is more harmful for the devil for that i'm shooting if i'm doing that so this is unacceptable because the type is essential so number three the how that is how are you performing it because the way you perform it is essential if you make a new way this is not as acceptable give an example easy if i want to perform wudu and i begin by washing my feet wiping my head washing my face then washing my arms to the elbows is this acceptable definitely not not a single muslim would say that this is acceptable this is an innovation one would say wahabi why are you saying innovation use your logic this is what the prophet this is what allah told us in chapter five surat al-maidah how to wash in the order and this is what the prophet did is you coming in and switching the order this is rejected allah would not accept that from you so the way it is performed is very essential i'll give you another example when making tawa from the kaaba you must have the kaaba to your left but if someone says well i come from the uk and we drive on the other way on the other side of the road so i'm going to keep the kaaba on my right and i'm going to do seven rounds we say you haven't done anything this is rejected and your tawaf is invalid why because the how was not performed as the prophet is al-salam had instructed so this was number three number four is the quantity so you have to abide by the quantity that was prescribed for us don't add anything and don't substract anything so someone says fajr is two raka's and isha are four maghrib is three it's the only odd number raqqa a prayer in in the day so i'm gonna add one so it would be all even and this is rejected allah will not accept this from you someone says okay but when performing wudu instead of doing my limbs three times i'm gonna add one and make it four how's that again this is not permissible why is that because the prophet said assam that you may wash your limbs three times and whoever exceeds that he has committed an act of transgression and he had done something that is bad so the quantity is important if you give something less than what the prophet ordered allah then this would not be accepted from you that was number four number five is the time so you have to abide by the time if someone wants to pray maghrib just before sunset this prayer is invalid why because the time was not uh abided by if someone wants to break his fast half an hour after sunset why just to be safe again this is an innovation the prophet says assam the people will remain to be fine or on the sunnah as long as they hasten to break their fast and you are delaying it without any justification or any reason and there are a number of examples but i'm just igniting your logic i'm just igniting your iman addressing your belief and conviction and your love to the prophet allah why listen to people who deviate you from the straight path and tell you not to follow the prophet allah number six and this is the last thing is the location you cannot do forms of worship except where allah azza allocated them to be done in for example iratikaf seclusion in the last 10 nights of ramadan someone says i would like to make it in my own bedroom like lots of the sisters say i don't want to go to the masjid i'd like to make my atticaf in my bedroom this is not applicable why because allah says that it has to be in the masjid in the mosques a friend of mine says okay in this case i'm going to do it in my prayer hall at my university or i'll do it in the prayer hall in the souk where i work and then again this is not permissible because these are not masjid they can change it into a lecture room or into a showroom anytime a masjid which is designated to be a masjid no one can sell it no one can give it away it is there to stay this is what you can do your erticaf in and so on so these six things if you put your mind to it you will find that a lot of the things that we do fall under the category of bidah and some bid has some innovations nullify your islam it takes you out of the fold of islam so if you believe this person to know the unseen and you go to him to these peers or shamans or whatever and you ask them for the future or for the past and you believe them this nullifies your islam if you go to the graveyard and go to the uh tombs or shrines of deceased and or they call them awliya and you ask them for support or to you seek refuge in them you slaughter to them and you call them other than calling allah this is shirk so where is the wahhabism in it where is the salafi is a minute this is pure islam you can know it from the quran in the sunnah now if you refuse and say well i'd rather follow my forefathers than to follow what i'm listening to then you have a big problem because this is exactly what the disbelievers said when the prophet came to them are installation with the quran and with the sunnah so use your logic get out of the box think of out of the box and see what allah wants from you go back purify your tawheed purify your happida go back to the quran and sunnah don't listen to people don't let them play with you like this you're not a football you have to search and find out what allah wants from you and every single time when you want to do something ask yourself did my prophet do it did his companions do it did the prophet alaihis instruct me to do something similar so that i can compare apple to apple or is this something that is innovative though it looks fine it looks nice but i'm still gonna do it though the prophet didn't do it then you have to ask yourself this question what is wrong in saying allah musa muhammad after sneezing there's nothing wrong in that yes there is if the prophet didn't do it do you claim that you know more than the prophet allah if you do then you're a kafir he says no no i don't know more than the prophet definitely he knows better than me but maybe he knew that it's a good thing to offer salutation after sneezing but he didn't teach us he conceived that and kept it for himself then this is another uh act of uh blasphemy because you are accusing the prophet of refraining from delivering the message of allah and delivering this knowledge to us so this is something that was out of the of context but insha allah there is benefit in it for you these six things try to memorize them understand their examples and apply them to your life to know whether you are doing buddha or not what are these things once again one you have to look at the reason two you have to look at how the type what type is it is it com complying with the sunnah or not three you have to look at how it was done or performed number four you have to look at the quantity number five you have to have to look at the time and finally number six you have to look at the location so the prophet tells us that the people will remain fine as long as they hasten in breaking their fast the other hadith the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam says that allah the most exalted said so this is a hadith and allah says those among my servants who hasten to break their fast so this is a instruction and encouragement to break your fast and to be hastened to haste in it allah says are the most beloved or dearest to me so what do we understand from this we understand that allah azza loves so this is one of allah's beautiful attributes and there are people who say no allah does not love may allah forgive us all how is that allah says in the quran those who repent and those who purify themselves in this hadith allah loves those who hasten to break their fast so many verbs in the quran and the sunnah that affirms the fact the attribute that allah loves and with a lord that loves us and we love him we are alhamdulillah in good hands so we have to say that uh and and believe firmly that allah azzawajal loves and allah subhanahu ta'ala is beloved also in the hadith when allah the uh the most high and exalted said means that allah azza talks and speaks and anyone who claims that allah does not speak or does not talk he's a kafir he's not a muslim because allah azzawajal spoke to moses and moses heard what allah had said allah spoke the quran and the quran is allah's word and that is why in chapter 9 allah says that when one of the uh idol worshipers seeks refuge refuge in you give him his refuge and shelter and give him time to hear the word of allah the speech of allah so allah azzawajal speaks and allah azzawajal talks and we have to believe in that because those who do not believe like the deviant sects around us they are not considered to be muslims because they are denying one of allah's attributes allah and and speaking is one of allah's um attributes that are related to actions meaning that allah speaks whenever he wishes and this is an action of allah azza and the idea is that we believe in all of allah's beautiful names and attributes as allah has told us about without twisting their meaning without trying to divert the meaning into something else or giving a similitude to it or saying that it is not what was intended altogether all of this is not part of a sunnah we have a short break and after that we will receive your questions with the grace of allah so stay tuned my i have two questions okay uh my first question is my mother has passed away can i do umbra on behalf of her and me as well at the same time okay second question the second question is a flavoring contains six percent alcohol can i use that in my food what is it a flavoring yeah a flavoring contains six percent of alcohol uh can i use that uh in my food okay i will answer you inshallah uh umbilal's question first question was about her mother who had passed away may allah have mercy on her soul and she is asking can i make umrah for her and myself at the same umrah the answer is no um can be only performed on behalf of one person at a time so you can do that for uh her and then do it for yourself or vasa versa is from sudan well i think we've lost uh aziz uh the second question of uh ombilal she says that flavoring that has six percent of uh alcohol can we use this the percentage is not of a big factor that determines whether yes or no to use what determines whether it's yes or no to use is the intoxication and most likely this six percent is negligible first of all second of all while using it when flavoring the six percent probably would evaporate and not have any effect none whatsoever so it seems that inshallah this is permissible from saudi hello yes sheikh i want to know about zohar salah because my teacher said to me two rakats kindly explain me how many please please my second question is shaykh yes my second question is whenever i pray my small brother he he is 19 months old he disturbed me lot so i have to repeat my salah again very good questions and we have uh najib from saudi hello uh i have a question regarding as you told about innovation six types yes so the fourth time you said quantity i just want to ask you one question that like every year for zakah i know that it is 2.5 percentage okay for gold and for uh even money so when i calculated on the car 2.5 then if the total is for example a 850 or 930 like that i keep it round figure like 1000 for the safe side so is it count as a innovation in the quantity uh level like you said that you should not uh change the quantity for anything i don't change the 2.5 percent but only on the total i keep it uh like if it is 9 30 or 950 i keep it 5000. i will i understand uh can i perform an umbra on behalf of my wife was pregnant uh and she is four months pregnant and she was really willing to go on umrah but she is not in the condition for mumrah is am i eligible to do that or she has to call up i will answer you inshallah thank you okay we have uh aliyah from saudi arabia and ah yeah i i take it that she is a girl and for the questions she's saying that the teacher says that has to be prayed in the following sequence so is this correct and the answer is no this is not correct the issue of making afford prayer in such a sequence is wrong a lot of the subcontinent people muslims they say that risha is so so number it is for raqqa fart then uh then three raka witter so it has to be played like uh nine raka's some add four before and six here and there and this is wrong asia is for raqqa that's it is for raqqa that is it now if you want to follow the sunnah you would say that pray for raqqa of the as far mandatory obligatory as a pillar of islam but the sunnah is to pray four raka's before it two by two this is the sunnah and then two raka's afterwards these are six rakaats for these are sunnah which means that the prophet was always assalam doing it if you would like to add something that is voluntary more you can add another two raka's afterwards so it becomes four after and four before and allah azza knows best isa from nigeria i apologize listen to me from the telephone page hello yes listen to me from the telephone and mute your tv okay my question is i have a chef in my country he gave me this dua that i should do in the middle of the night i don't know how good it is he said um he said i should do it one thousand one hundred and eleven each night okay how much how much 111 thank you you're welcome uh saeed from fajr cruise raqqa was given to prophet muhammad sallam because of the other salam prayed two rakats when he is asking for forgiveness and there was a hurt for the cause like that uh other prophets like i don't remember the names uh exactly uh like that i heard yes okay i will answer your question and the second question is we have hamza from saudi arabia yes hamza i have a answering question yes my first question is in a day friday when we go before go on we take a bus and it is enough but or i have to take again udu okay my second question is regarding to suratul moment if a person has a even if she is not his wife or what does it mean okay my third question is if a person slaughter an animal god our ship and that person is a mushrik and his detention is only for foot the white is not he mentioned a last name is it permissible to it's that food if your answer is yes as we know i say it doesn't accept any form of vada from a mushrik and the word bismillah by itself a form of ibadah even if you say bismillah that is considered he didn't say that and we are open to eating a dead animal and your answer is no it doesn't contradict with the quran what what the one is after urination and other things is compulsory and obligatory for us muslims but other religions non-muslims hindus christians and other religions it's not mandatory for them so and the number second thing is that they eat all the prohibited things which for example pork and other haram elements which are prohibited for muslims they eat or and consume all that so keeping these things in view can we keep a non-muslim a helper at home a part-time who will help us in kitchen and everything at home is it allowed for us to keep non-muslim helpers at home for kitchens and other things keeping this in view that this sahara and eating things for non-muslims which are allowed for them prohibited for us and ablution washing after urination and all i am not i understand i understand okay last question from saudi arabia okay and then my second question is there's some people doing apart from sweating igrahim apart from society there are another people do you slack in five days like the five year which i didn't understand okay i will answer the question okay we will not take your questions for a while so that i can finish this insha allah and then if there is enough time i will take more questions alia from saudi arabia we've answered uh her question her second question is her 19 month old brother who comes and disrupts her prayer is her prayer valid yes as long as you continue to pray and you face the qibla your prayer is still valid nadjia from saudi arabia she says does it fall under bidha if my zakat is 2.5 over my gold or silver but it's like 930 real so i make it even and say it's a thousand reals no it's not a bad this is charity and it's it's for the good for uh the muslims and the poor if you said no my zakat is three percent i will not give it percent and you tell people that it is three percent it's best for the poor then it becomes a bit but you acknowledge that is 2.5 and you add a little bit more this is uh uh permissible insha allah another saheed from saudi arabia says his wife is four month pregnant and she wants to go for umrah but it's crowded and he is afraid for her so can he make umbra on her behalf the answer is no inshaallah once she gives birth and she is fit she can go and take her own um ashley from nigeria she says her sheikh says that you should wake up in the middle of the night and say for a thousand times 111 so it's one one one one that's a very special number you have to say the ayah where allah speaks to musa in surat maryam to grant him few things allah says you have been given what you have asked for so hershey tells her to recite this 1111 times my advice to you asia is to dump your chair and never go to him never ask him anything because this is a total innovation one thousand one hundred eleven why not one thousand one hundred and ten yeah where did you get this figure from and whoever told you that this is part of the sunnah to supplicate this sheikh of yours is definitely uh uh has some haywire uh and and and he's not upon the sunnah so just ignore him and never go to him again said from saudi arabia says he heard some shaykh in pakistan or in let's say india say that fajr prayers were given to our prophet as two raka's and i've heard this from one of the deviant sheikhs who yeah he's very famous on youtube and he had a problem with the airplane going to his country and and people try to do this whatever no problem he i heard him say this it's on youtube he says that you know why we pray to raka's because allah azzawajal gave it to our prophet salam when he was in the seventh heaven okay do you know why we pray for raka's said well that's that's why not five why not three he said because when noah's ark set uh uh you know the water was there and and he was saved among those with him allah gave him he prayed for raqqa as gratitude so we are praying for raka's following okay do you know why we pray asar for raqqas said no i don't he said because ibrahim when he was ordered to slaughter his son ismail and then allah saved him and got this ram as a sacrifice allah azzawajal made ibrahim prayed for raka's and that's why you're following him sorry i apologize fajr is not because uh given to our prophet it was because adam when adam peace be upon him repented he prayed these two rakats and allah made them obligatory and he goes on to maghrib and he goes on to isha all of this is nonsense all of this is baloney where do these people get their sources from this is not in the quran or in the sunnah but they captivate the layman they captivate those followers of theirs with such bogus stuff that is made up it has nothing to do with the quran or with the sunnah but they embezzle people they take the money they get rich out of it and that's why uh you should be aware from such people the second question was what's the ruling on clipping your fingernails and cutting your hair when you're fasting this is totally permissible hamza from saudi arabia says if i perform russell for jummah and i go do i have to repeat my wudu if you did not perform your wudu yes you do wudu has to be done in sequence face arms head and feet except if you are performing a major bath from a major impurity so if you were in a sexual impurity and then you're performing russell of janaba this suffices you from performing wudu but if you're washing because of jummah or because you want to cool down or you want to wash and clean yourself this has nothing to do with sexual impurity or with the major impurity in in this case yes you have to make a new wudu he doesn't understand the verse that says that those who preserve their private parts except from their wives and what their right hand possesses so he's asking is it islamic said that says yes in islam when you have a concubine when you have a slave woman then it is your right to have a sexual relationship and this is for her favor no religion other than islam has this it is found in the previous religions go and read the bible i'm not asking you to go to do that but if ask those who know the bible old testament and the new testament it's there concubines are slaves and they're sold and bought like animals because they are captive of war they're prisoners of war in islam it honors them in the sense that when a woman conceives from her master she cannot be sold she cannot be inherited she becomes free because of what she had conceived so this is a form of honoring them and the topic is quite long i'm not going to go into it if his third question if a man who is a mushrik who is a disbeliever slaughters a sheep and he says bismillah can we eat from it the answer is no why because we can only eat from what a muslim slaughters or from what the people of the book slaughter so a jew or a christian we can eat from their slaughtering and a muslim we can eat from his slaughtering if any of the three said something other than the name of allah bismillah his slaughtering is not accepted when we cannot eat from that meat if he slaughtered and i didn't i do not know whether he said bismillah or something else then the default is that i can still eat but if someone who's not a christian or jew and not a muslim and he says bismillah and he slaughters his slaughter is a dead meat um maryam from saudi arabia says that we know that purity is mandatory upon muslims what's the ruling on having maids or we having helpers who are not muslim and we know that when they urinate they do not wash and etc well this is the same with every non-muslim so if a christian comes and wants to shake hands with me would i refrain and say um sorry i don't know if you washed your hand or not no this is ridiculous you shake hands with them you touch them they touch the utensils they cook in the house they clean and we don't deem them we don't consider them to be impure physically unless there is something that is visible something that is an impurity that i can see other than that no it is totally permissible to uh get in touch with them yeah from saudi arabia and we can have a couple of questions so if we have callers on the line please uh receive the calls yakub from saudi arabia says that my wife is back in ghana can i perform umrah on her behalf the answer is no those who are alive and capable you cannot perform umrah on their behalf maybe inshallah in five ten years time you'll have enough money to bring her over and she makes her own umbra and if she doesn't then it is not mandatory upon her but the scholars differ whether if someone is chronically ill like someone who's like 90 years old and he's unable to come and definitely won't be able to come in the future can i or can can't i inshallah it's something that can be done he's asking about salat al-fat but before going to that aisha from saudi arabia yes i have a question yes in ramadan is it is it going to break the fast if somebody takes injection to relief from pain and self like volterrine yes egyptian okay is that an alcohol is uh an innovative form of offering salutation to the prophet alaihis islam and it's used a lot in sudan and it's used like by the tifa or the sect and so on and they they say it and they do this when they do it and all of this is clear-cut innovation as they call it salat it is the prayer that opens what's closed and this is totally uh prohibited and an innovation oh mariam from saudi and thank you thank you very much for clearing this point that we don't have to hello yes yes so maria i'm listening uh thank you very much for this clearing this point that we don't have to consider them impure unless we see something uh impure physically uh we can see by eyes okay so that point it is clear that we can shake hands and we can touch them everything but what about this like she's coming as a part-time helper to my house what i know i don't know what she ate at her home she might have eaten pork and came to my house and she will cook as long as you don't know maryam as long as you don't know then you're not held accountable now if i come to your house how would you know that i did not eat pork or i did not drink wine or whatever you just because i'm a muslim you cannot assume anything good and then assume bad things about non-muslims so by contemplating any doubts we have it has no place in uh islam okay and then we have uh tariq from kuwait and he's maybe the last questioner yes what is yes my friend go ahead the first question is can i fast still if i am a small boy and my second question is i can i pray tarawih for eight rakats or 20 records okay aisha is asking from saudi arabia on the ruling of um injection that relieves pain so probably she's referring to valtterine or the likes that reduces your fever and vascular ivs or whatever if it's an injection that does this only this is permissible but if it is an injection taken with an iv where it has some gil glucose or whatever substances that are nourishing then it breaks your fast but normal voltarein shot would not affect your fasting from insha'allah says i'm a young boy should i fast answer if you can fast yes my friend you want allah to be happy you want allah to be pleased with you so by doing this as long as you are fit and capable and strong your voice mashallah sounds like you're a big man so if this is the case yes you have to fast try your level best and show your family that you are capable of doing inshallah and allah would reward you for that not only that allah would reward you and your parents for that as for uh prayer is it 8 or 20 the sunnah is to pray at 11 raka's this is what the prophet used to do but he never limited it so to say that no you should not add for more than 11 this is wrong because there are a hadith from abbas and ayasha malay pleased with them all that the prophet isam prayed 13 rakahs and the hadith of the nomad of the bedouin who came and asked about talawi about night prayer the prophet said as islam night prayer is 2 2 2 and if you fear fajr make quitter of one rakah so the prophet told him about the format and that is two after salam then two and you don't pray four in a row etc and the prophet did not tell him but do not exceed 11. and he's a nomad he's a bad one he's asking a question then he's off to his desert with a possibility of not returning back so the prophet ali sasam would not have given the man an answer that he needed more clarification otherwise he would have told him that listen but do not exceed 11 which means that the number is open the sky is the limit so you want to pray eight and then three raka's with her go ahead you want to follow the two holy mosques by praying 20 rakah and three raka's witter go ahead you want to add and add to that like 40 rakahs 60 the sky is the limit and this is up to you i'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today and until we meet you saturday because tomorrow is friday and friday friday i'm off alhamdulillah thank god it's friday not the restaurant but the day uh so hopefully inshallah we'll meet you on saturday same time until then while watching the new moon it felt like a good enlightening this day is so bright as the first time we has tonight with family around the nice meal we're making one i feel how nice it is to be so neat to those i love whenever we think of ramadan all the good things that we need to do and plan it's not always easy but we'll do the best we can"
