  "transcript": "the bond that is between the spouses is a very strong one as described by Allah and this bond is so strong that it is not to be forgotten even if divorce takes place or a spouse dies leaving the other one behind the prophet Alat was among those who honored people's memory who would never forget a favor when the Battle of bad concluded and there were prisoners of Wars he said if alut were alive and he interceded for these stinky prisoners I would have set them free for his sake now remember Al mutam was a cafir and he's dead but he did something in Mecca when the prophet came back from thif beaten up tired exhausted and the people of were trying to kill him stood up and said Muhammad is in my protection he honored the prophet wasam though he was against his religion but he honored him and the prophet never forgot that for him likewise the prophet never forgot what his wife Khadijah did for him so he always remembered her with goodness and he always said Khadijah she was this she was that and Allah granted me children from her because none of his wives had a child from himat I know some would say what about Maria the Coptic Maria is not a wife she's a concubine this is why we did not mention her last class in the list of wives of the Prophet because she was not his wife rather she was a concubine a gift from the ruler of the copics in Egypt now the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam loved Khadijah and always me remembered her with goodness to the extent thata may Allah be pleased with her said I was never jealous over any of the prophet's wives more than I was jealous from Khadijah and I have never seen her in my life but because the prophet Alam used to frequently remember her and mention her name sometimes he would even slaughter a sheep and divide it and he would ask these parts of the sheep to be sent to khadijah's friends and relatives and once I said and I complained oh prophet of Allah as if there was no woman other than Khadijah in this world and the prophet said she was this she was that and he started to mention her attributes and I had not had a child except from her and this is is why she would refrain from mentioning khadijah's name with anything negative so that she would not upset the prophet and the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam as a form of reward and a showing of his appreciation and gratitude to Khadijah the prophet never took his his second wife over Khadijah until she died so he remained sallallahu alaihi wasallam with Khadijah for 25 years and refusing to marry or to take a second wife and this shows you that the prophet's marriage of women was not driven by desire or lust as some of the enemies of Islam may say he married Khadijah who was older than him when he was 25 years of age and he stayed with this older woman until he was 50 until she died and if he had this huge desire and lust for women that was uncontrollable if he was someone who wanted to fool around with women sallallahu alaih wasallam he would have done that at at the prime of his youth but no he was not that type that these enemies of Islam may try to portray and they would fail repeatedly in doing so sallallah alai wasam"
