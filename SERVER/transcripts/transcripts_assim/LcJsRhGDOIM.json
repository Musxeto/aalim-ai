  "transcript": "uh rashad from tunisia all you see it is a woman begging in front of the massage speaking with the syrian accent pretending that she is a refugee and she has been decided for years and now she's doing it with her children uh can i post up in the facebook group warning people against them or is it considered as the second is warning from a beggar who is a professional claiming that she is a refugee and taking people's money unlawfully by begging so is it permissible to expose her on facebook i would say that this is not a natural thing to do and posting a photograph of a woman is haram whether she's an imposter or not secondly this was not done in a large scale among the muslims and thirdly you would give her more publicity by doing this and a lot of the people do heinous things for publicity so i would recommend that you may warn the people if the masjid not necessarily the globe on a facebook post"
