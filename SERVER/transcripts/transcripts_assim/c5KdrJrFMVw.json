  "transcript": "[Questioner]: Uh, Mubashar or Mubshaar Ali,\nWhat is the difference between 'Zibiah' and 'Halal'? Can we eat halal when it's not zibiah? I think by zibiah he means 'dhabīḥah'. And dhabīḥah means 'slaughtered animal'. So, a slaughtered animal is not halāl to\neat all the time. It depends on the person who has slaughtered\nit. So if a Muslim, a Christian or a Jew slaughtered\nan animal, this is a dhabīḥah and it is halal. So, halāl itself is a description that is\nthe opposite of harām. So halāl is permissible - harām is prohibited\nand forbidden. But people nowadays describe the meat as halāl. Meaning it was slaughtered by a Muslim, Jew\nor a Christian. And any animal that is slaughtered by other\nthan Muslim, Jew or Christian, it is non-halāl, it's non-dhabīḥah for us. It's meat that we cannot consume."
