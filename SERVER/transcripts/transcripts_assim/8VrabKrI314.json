  "transcript": "Medina from Germany Alum alikum Salam um I was asked if a person finds traces of feces after performing and Salah was the valid and does the person only have to repeat the prayer there traces of pieces were they big pieces of mass of stool y or or just the color um I like I was asked so I don't know like I could not answer you until you know because the companions may Allah be pleased with them after passing sto and defecating the vast majority of them used to clean themselves by wiping with hard substance such as tissues or at their time they had Stones rarely they would use water which meant that there will still remain some minute traces that cannot be wiped off totally using Stones this trace or these remaining traces are negligible and pardoned by Islam so if this is the case then herul was valid but if it is a chunk of sto something that is big and something that has mass to it then the the rul was not valid because she did not uh ensure the water reaching everywhere and Allah Knows Best"
