  "transcript": "uh my question is if one does not remember which dates or the history year the gold jewelry reaches Nissan um in order to pay the uh the zakats for a certain number of past years is it advisable to pick any date for every year for example the first or 27th of Ramadan and does it have to be the same dates for all the years as that the zakat needs to be calculated for or is it advisable to pick the day with the highest rates of gold for each previous year as the rate of gold changes every day first of all we have to determine the number of years that we want to go back to so if you say 10 years in this case we go in the lunar calendar year 14 34. we are in the year 1444. so 10 years ago it was 1434. we then have to estimate which month was it so maybe it was which is a 12th month which means that I've skipped 11 months of the whole lunar year but then I'm doubtful said no no that's too late 11th month Ramadan the ninth um if you reach a particular month take a month or two earlier just to be safe and since you've designated that particular month in the year 1434 you move on the year after the same month and do this to the rest of your lives that this date of this month I have to evaluate the gold I have and give 2.5 percent every year so in year 1434 the gold used to cost so much my zakat was this much in year 14 35 it went down my my gold zakat is this 36 37 and and so forth you estimate and we have a chart that tells us exactly how much the rate of the gold was at these uh on on these years and dates so alhamdulillah you can solve this problem easily yours"
