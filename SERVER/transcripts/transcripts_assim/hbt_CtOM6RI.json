  "title": "Is wiping the face after dua in Witr authentic or an innovation? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um my question is regarding the with their prayer so um in congregation when the imam prays with the prayer and he recites the dua after the imam says they wipe their face with their hands after the imam restarts the door it is innovation okay so wiping the face after the dura is an issue of dispute and the reason is that the hadith that is found is extremely weak and not authentic and this is why ibn abdul bar one of the great scholars of al-maliki school used to say wiping the face after the dua is only done by the ignorant people who have no knowledge so it is not part of the sunnah to make it those who do it we don't usually comment on it because they are following a a weak hadith hadith and some schools may allow following weak hadiths when there is no no relationship between the issues or haram as they call it and this is their preference so be it but the most authentic opinion that this is not from the sunnah at all"
