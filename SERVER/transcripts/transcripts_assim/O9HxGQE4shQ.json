  "transcript": "foreign he said when the human being dies his deed will stop except for three an ongoing charity beneficial knowledge or a righteous child you know the prayer that prays for who prays for him now I'm wondering if someone for the sake of you know seeking knowledge or sharing beneficial knowledge if someone is not a teacher of Islamic knowledge but he teaches for example ESO you know English what's that it's it's English for speakers of all the languages okay so if this helped the students in their lives in the in the future uh would that can would that be considered as a beneficial knowledge first of all okay I got your question first of all Scholars say mainly whenever knowledge is referred to in the Quran or in the Sunnah it's related to Islamic knowledge so anything related to Islamic Sciences such as stefsir Hadith Etc this is part of the knowledge that is highly praised in Quran and the Sunnah nevertheless if a person teaches beneficial knowledge with the right intention so a medical doctor who has done researches that would benefit the human that would benefit humanity and people are benefiting from it and he has students and he's conveying his knowledge to them with the right intention to help Muslims and Islam and promote Islam definitely this would be ongoing and um a continuous charity of for him is it equivalent or similar to Islamic knowledge no but alhamdulillah Allah is most uh gracious most generous and he would not let your efforts go uh uh to waste"
