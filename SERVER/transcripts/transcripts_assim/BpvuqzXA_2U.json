  "title": "Ruling on saying Tashahhud multiple times when catching the imam in the 2nd Rakat | Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "hail says he has a confusion in regards to a person who catches the imam in the second rakah so if he sits into shahud which is the follower's first rakah but it's the imam's second rakah he will make one to shahood then the imam would stand up for the third it's his second then the imam would sit for the fourth it's his third and he does a second to this follower when the imam offers salam he stands up for this fourth rakah and he sits for the final to shahad so he has done three what's the problem in that he sometimes can do for the shahood now no problem in doing that none whatsoever because his priority when joining the imam is to follow him so he followed the imam he did to the shahood his last rakah he has to end it with the shahada salutation upon the prophet salam so he has to sit for a third or a fourth it does not matter inshallah"
