  "title": "Does Punishment of Grave mean Eternal Torment in Hell? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "people can be tormented in their graves and in the day of judgment taken to paradise people can be tormented in their graves and in the day of judgment still go to hell hellfire for some time and then admit it out and admit it to jenna people can not be punished in their graves they have no punishment in their grace but on that age of judgment when they're held accountable for their sins they are thrown in hell fire for some time and then admitted to jenna so these two are not always related the torment of the grave and the torment in hellfire they can be separate so they that person would be uh tormented in his grave would it be for eternity in hell fire it depends usually it's not because he prayed now he was misunderstanding he was negligent he was lazy his prayer is invalid but does that take him out of the fold of islam this is something in allah's hands and allah knows best you"
