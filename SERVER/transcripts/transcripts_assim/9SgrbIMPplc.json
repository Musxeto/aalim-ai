  "transcript": "[Music] says when a man sins and says oh Allah I have sinned and I know that you forgive the sins so Allah forgive me Allah replies my servant acknowledged the fact that he had sinned and he acknowledges the fact that I forgive the sins I forgive his sins so the man does a sin again and he says the same thing and Allah says the same thing the third time likewise the fourth time Allah says my servant acknowledges that I forgive sins let him do whatever he wishes for I have forgiven his sins now the scholars commented on this Hadith now this is not a card lanch that you do whatever okay this is the case alhamdulillah let's go to the nightclubs before Ramadan no this means that as long as you have the remorse in your heart after every time you sin even if you sin 1,000 times Allah will forgive you but a person who has ill intent and he says I'm ask for your forgiveness tomorrow I'm going Allah knows that Allah will burn him into hell and that is why may Allah have mercy on his soul his companions came to him and said oh she we sin and ask Allah for forgiveness and then we sin and ask Allah for forgiveness and then we sin and then we're ashamed so many times we sin and ask for forgiveness so we do not ask for forgiveness at all they said exactly what Shan wants from you the more you sin the more you ask Allah for for forgiveness and that is why Shan said I've burnt the humans with sins I've burnt them with sins they burnt me with seeking forgiveness they've burnt me completely so as long as you brother we weak come on we are not even the companions sinned may Allah be pleased with them Malik committed fornication he was executed as experation for that another woman who committed fornication was pregnant and was killed to be purified she's the one who's asking for it she stole money and the prophet chopped her hand and then she became one of the best companions Pious companions as the one who used to make fun and and jokes to the prophet he's he's he's known as the he used to make lots of things to make the prophet laugh yeah and among the things he he used to do he used to go to the market and sees something said this is nice how much is this he says uh uh 200 quid so okay I'll buy it come and collect the money from the Masjid he takes it go goes to the prophet oh prophet of Allah I brought this as a gift for you thank you excellent five minutes later the man comes where's my money he says take it from him from the prophet and the prophet laughs he gives it to him and himself this this this brother or this companion may Allah be pleased with him once was in an expedition with Abu Bakr and there was another companion who was responsible for rationing the food so n was hungry so said come on give me something to eat I'm hungry said no rationing the food means that I cannot give you more than your portion he said listen you better give me what I want I'm going to put you in trouble he said do whatever you wish okay n man goes to the market and he sees three bed ones he says who wants to buy a slave my strong slave I'll sell it to him and very cheaply so they come and say we'll buy buy him from you he says no no no no you guys don't you look weak no we're not weak we're strong no no you look weak he's going to shout and say I'm not a slave I'm a free man you're going to believe him no no no I'm not going to sell him to you so no no no no we know these FS just show us the slave and he took the money and he went back to the camp and he said he goes to slave so they captured the man and the man said listen he's he's making a joke on you it's a trick he's lying I'm a free man and said he told us he told us and they took him as they were taking him Abu Bakr comes may Allah be pleased with him and he said what's this he said this man said so and so and so and he paid them the money back the companions stayed one full year laughing their heads off whenever they remember they just you know fall and laughing may Allah be pleased with him had one shortcoming he was addicted he was an alcoholic and every time he drinks he is caught so they said look at him being brought as a dog and punished like this the prophet heard this said do not say this what the man is an alcoholic so many times he's brought forward and he's being punished for that he said the prophet of Allah s wasallam by Allah I testify that this man loves Allah and loves his Prophet never ever look down at any Muslim even if he's sinful he might be kissing the feet of his mother every single night which makes him better than you at the side of Allah I don't know so I never look down at anyone and I never look up at anyone all what I see like the Sal used to say when I see a youngster I say mallah he's better than me he made little mistakes and Sins not like me and when I ever see an elderly I said mallah he's better than me he had committed so many good uh he performed so many good forms of worship and Good Deeds while I have so little so I always look down at myself and Allah for"
