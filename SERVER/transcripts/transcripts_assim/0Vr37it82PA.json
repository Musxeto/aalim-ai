  "transcript": "He would go with it. Once the Abyssinians were playing with their swords and spears in the masjid. A form of training. A form of, let's say, dancing, but it's training actually. And the Prophet ﷺ was watching them. Aisha came from behind, from inside her house, and the Prophet ﷺ said, Would you like to watch? And she said, Yes. He wouldn't say, No, go hide, don't look, don't watch, don't do this, don't do that, like so many of us may do, prohibiting what is permissible, just to be safe. No, no, to be safe, don't do this, without any knowledge. The Prophet ﷺ said to her, Come. She placed her chin on his shoulder and kept on watching. And after a while the Prophet ﷺ said, Had you had enough? And she said, No, no, no, I'd like to watch more. And the Prophet would leave her."
