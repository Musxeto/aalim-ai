  "transcript": "question for today is we know that everyone can be a Sheikh so what is uh and we should also continue to seek knowledge all the time but what is the fundamental knowledge that every Muslim should know every average Layman should know this requires a full-fledged lecture there isn't a specific branch of science that this is a must rather there is a minimal requirement which your Islam cannot be verified and valid without so to know the basics of the five pillars of Islam the basics what are they the shahada establishing prayer fasting zakat and Hajj to know the six pillars of Iman which without you're not a Muslim they believe in Allah azzawajal the day of judgment the Angels the uh the prophets and Messengers and the scriptures and the Divine decree whether good or bad so this is a branch of Akida but without establishing five daily prayers you're not a Muslim so you have to know how to pray and you can't know how to pray without knowing how to perform mudu and in order to perform model you have to know what is Purity and impurities not Jason pahir and what are the containers carrying the basics I'm not talking about technicalities I'm talking about the basics that without you can't be a Muslim you have to know how to fast because Ramadan is approaching so you have to know what nullify is your fasting and how your fasting should be the intention these are the basics bare minimum of knowledge that you are required to know which is something you can have in a crash course over the duration of a day or two maybe less the other type of communal obligations this is not mandatory upon you but if you want to become a Sheikh or a student of knowledge then you have to focus bit by bit to gain more higher levels of Akida of ferc of osulk of tafsir of Hadith Etc and this goes gradually insha Allah"
