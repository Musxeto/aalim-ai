  "title": "Is female circumcision permissible",
  "transcript": "fatum uh sends us a question and she says is female circumcision permissible and whether it was done during the time of the Prophet Alat wasam the most authentic opinion of Scholars is that circumcision is part of human nature and it is something that is natural and part of nature as in the Hadith of the Prophet Alat wasam meaning that this is the original way that Allah has created people to have and that is to clip their nails to uh shave or trim their mustaches to uh remove the pubic hair to pluck the armpit hair and to have circumcision however the scholars agree that male circum decision is mandatory and hundreds of medical reports support this this does not concern us as Muslims whether medical reports support or disagree because we as Muslims submit our will to Allah and whatever the prophet tells us some we follow whether the uh uh medical reports support or disagrees and rejects so male circumcision is mandatory as for female circumcision Scholars differed and the most authentic opinion is that it is recommended and it's a Sunnah if you do it Allah will reward you if you don't Allah will not punish you and it depends on the country and the location and it's also depends on the surgeon operating this if he's not knowledgeable if he does not have the experience is forbidden for you to do this and it differs as I said from cold countries to warm countries on and on the need of doing this some do not need it some may require it but at the end of the day it would not be fair to say that it's not part of the Sunnah or to claim that it is forbidden to do it because the authentic Hadith or number of hadiths prove that this was practiced at the time of the Prophet Alam and the prophet gave guidelines to those who are operating by not exceeding the limit and overdoing it and also by not leaving it as it is as this would not be suitable and is it advisable to do or not it's recommended depending that you trust the one who's doing it is operating it and there is need for it and by not exceeding the measurement and the amount prescribed to us by the prophet Alat wasam"
