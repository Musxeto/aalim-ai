  "transcript": "Momina says, Are females rewarded less for the same good deeds as compared to males? The answer is yes. Allah Azza Wa Jal has given women an equal share to what men have while giving the men an extra edge for them being guardians of women and protectors and obliged to provide for their womenfolk. So they have an edge. In few matters of Shari'ah, there is a difference. So women are not obliged to do Jihad and fight in the cause of Allah. Their Jihad is their Hajj and Umrah. They are not obliged to reconcile between tribes and pay money. They are not obliged to provide for their families as this is the man's role in inheritance. In some cases, a woman is getting half what a man is. And in also testimonies, when they're becoming witnesses, the testimony of a man is equivalent to the testimony of two women in some cases. Other than that, when it comes to fasting, praying, forms of worship, they're equal. Allah says that whoever performs righteousness, whether male or female, and they are, he or she, a believing person, believing in the oneness of Allah on Islam, then they will be compensated and rewarded in this life with content and reward and also in the hereafter. So this clearly states that women and men are equal when it comes to their forms of worship and good deeds and Allah Azawajal knows best."
