  "transcript": "sh I have a question regarding the present days uh it's not a must for everybody to become a scholar if somebody wants to work as a full-time di is it a must for him to become a scholar or what should be the minimum amount of knowledge he should acquire at the same time uh in the present days uh who who who gets more priority at or a scholar first of all the word is something that is new in the sense it is not an occupation every Muslim is a by default Allah Almighty says in the Holy Quran who is better in in uh rhetoric which means in Arabic there is no one better than those who call to Allah so the word as an occupation was not there at the time uh except recently and unfortunately nowadays because the people have so much uh uh little knowledge of Islam that you find people who are full-fledged in the sense that people who do not have knowledge like us for example we are not Scholars we are not knowledgeable in Islam to the extent to uh uh be considered anything however people look at us nowaday as dies or students of knowledge and you would find people not working not doing anything or lectures and giving conferen and workshops not because they are good in knowledge because they are the best around and this shows you how these people to give da and to while they themselves need to learn more and more and more about Islam so your question is scholar definitely a scholar A is anyone anyone on the street any person uh uh fixing tires for example can be a DI when someone comes to him and tells him to uh uh change the tires or to align them and he's smoking and this brother says smoking is Haram you know that this is not something that pleases Allah he's doing da it's not dawa is not limited to holding a mic and standing on the podium and and and this is not da per se this is part of it so many great di are nobody to us but they are one of the greatest at the sight of Allah those who fill up their car trunks with literature and leaflets and go on wherever they meet non-muslims they give them the uh necessary pamphlets in their language with a big smile uh telling them what to do and where to visit so that they can learn more about Islam and leave Allah knows how many people accepted Islam through them so um to go back to your question if I still remember it that a is not an occupation but these recent times because of the knowledge is so little with the people they have uh accepted people to be uh a full-time Di and to give them whatever knowledge possible that would increase their Iman and get them closer to Allah and I hope this answers your question"
