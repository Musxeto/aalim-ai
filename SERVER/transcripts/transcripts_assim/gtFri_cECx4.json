  "transcript": "foreign hmm last time we met we talked about the re-digging of zamzam well and one would ask what is the importance of zamzam well what's so special about zamzam that people are making so much fuzz about and wanting to control it and to have the honor of giving access to it to the people zamzam is a sacred water it is sacred water in the sense that the blessing of allah azza is in zamzam our prophet told us a lot about zamzam and we believe in this holy water in the sense that it has characteristics that other water does not have there was a hadith in sahih muslim and this hadith was narrated by abuzar al rafari may allah be pleased with him he was from the village of rivar and they used to loot people and hijack things and they were without any objective they just lived their day without knowing what to do tells us about himself as being worshipping allah azzawajal praying to allah three years before the prophet salallahu was sent to mankind and those who asked him how did you pray who did you pray to i prayed to allah i knew that there was a creator to this universe so what did you do he said i just prayed to whatever direction i can face i just prayed to allah to guide me his mother and his brother anis traveled after a problem took place between them and their uncle and they left and anees the brother of abu dharr went to mecca and came back telling his brother that i heard of a man and i that worships the same god you worship so he told him what was it he told him they say that he is asabi he is an unbeliever of the idols they call him asabi and this was a capital a crime that needed punishment so abu dharr went to mecca and he went in secrecy he did not want to announce his presence to the people as he was investigating this so-called prophet and the minute he went into the masjid to the haram he saw a man and he went and whispered in his ear and he told him what's the news about this sabe this man who abandoned worshipping the idols this is the only thing he said so it was not very uh obvious he's just asking he's a stranger and the minute this man heard this he shouted in the whole masjid this is looking for the sabe this one is looking for the sabbah which means that he's a follower and immediately everyone picked whatever they could bones or stones and they threw him and beat the hell out of him until he fainted and he was covered with blood and an hour or two later he was left to die because he's a stranger they they had no problem in killing people they had no problem in attacking us especially strangers who had no support or backup or any uh family to uh protect them so he woke up three or four hours later he went to the well of zamzam and he washed the blood off and he took hiding for a whole month he just he hide it in the kaabah and in the surrounding area for a whole month he says about himself that i did not have anything to eat for a whole month except the water of zamzam now this is incredible because one would say you cannot live on water alone we say yes but zamzam is not water alone and this is why i mentioned this story to tell you that zem zam water is a sacred water prophet salallahu sallam told us that the water of zamzam is food to whomever feeds on it and it's a to whomever seeks cure in it and this has been practiced alhamdulillah by most muslims by myself by everybody else we find it to be cure to a lot of the diseases if you have an infection if you have problems you just take water of zamzam and drink as much as possible and you will be cured especially in uh protecting our children and curing those who have bad spells magic on them uh evil eye envy whatever we tell them bring the water of zamzam recite the fact blow in it the the last chapters of the quran three chapters of the quran ayat al-kursiy and then drink of it and wash the area that hurts and you suffer of and insha allah you will find the the cure in the water of zamzam okay but the most important to believe in allah the who cues this this is by default because what made you go to zamzam definitely it's the sunnah yes and the sunnah comes from allah azzawajal and by no doubt everything a muslim does is in in accordance with its his belief that allah is the one that cures yes and for example as muslims we believe that honey is a form of medicine and researchers are revealing to us that it is indeed one of the greatest cures of of of diseases yet if someone takes honey believing that honey by itself cures but it's not allah this is shirk jesus is associating someone else with allah azza no you have to take honey and you have to believe that allah azzawajal is the one that cures you have to get married in order to have children but you have to believe that it is allah the almighty that grants you and gives you these children coming back to our story again abdul muttalib already was given the control over zamzamoter but after what after they almost died and perished in the desert after he was overwhelmed by the other families he felt weak and vulnerable so he made an oath to allah did he see a dream like ishmael like abraham or a dream regarding did he know about the story about abraham and ishmael of course everyone knew about this story but he made this oath in order for him to get what he wants his main objective was to get those strong men his sons beside him to protect him and defend him yes so he was willing to have nine to sacrifice the tenth so he had he had uh the intention to do this but he was not doing this as a form of worship he just wanted to get the nine uh sons of his he made this oath but he did not forget about it and allah azzawajal gave him the ten strong healthy sons of his own and when the tenth was born and reaching the age of puberty and they all became strong men beside him he told them that now is the time and i have to fulfill my oath to my lord the people the family of quraish came to him and said come on you cannot do this all of you your children are wise and strong men we respect them we are willing to do whatever you want but don't do this they are begging him not to kill one of his children though they are not related to him but they respect abdul muttalib they honor him and at the same time they do not want to see one of his children killed abdul muttalib did not retreat he said i made an oath and i have to protect my word to my lord one of them has to die so the people of quraish said no way you cannot do this and they wanted to prevent him even by force so as a compromise they told him let us go to a priest again to a fortune teller again and seek her assistance fortune teller was the solution for our problems at the time yes it was indeed the solution of all problems and unfortunately even nowadays we have presidents that have fortune tellers telling them what to do whether to go into war or not we have uh influential people rich people seeking their knowledge and they don't have any knowledge it's just that man by nature wants to be led wants someone to give him the direction so that he would relieve himself from responsibility so if you come to me and say do this though i i'm not determined and i don't want to do it but i'm willing to do it so if it fails i'm going to blame you for that and if it goes through well i'm going to take all the credit for it so they went to this fortune teller and this fortune teller told him that there is a solution out and that is that we should draw the lots and see whether it says kill one of your children or give ten camels as sacrifice but before that took place and i forgot to mention this drew the lot to select which one of his children to kill and it was abdullah the father of our prophet muhammad ali who was chosen to be sacrificed and he was the most beloved son to his father abdul muttalib so now the problem is it's doubled because it's not one of his sons only but one of the most beloved sons to himself so they went to this fortune teller and this fortune teller told them you have to draw the lots to know which one to choose and so they did it's a kind of pulse to a lot it's a kind of pulse or it's kind of straws it's some of it has or or arrows that says you do this or you do that just to choose from it what uh uh the the decision was to be made i think we have a short break and afterwards inshaallah we will continue with the story of sacrificing one of abdul muttalib's sons so be with us we will be right back uh the prophet saws have informed us that we should not obey no one on the account of disobeying allah so the superiority is to allah's command so the husband tells his wife that i want you to check hands with my colleagues with my business partners no even if it leaves the divorce if the husband says to his wife that you have to party with me with partners and so on no you have to take your hijab off now knows your language and he will be very happy to answer your god just before the break we uh discussed how abdul muttalib and the people of mecca were in dispute regarding sacrificing one of his sons and the chosen one was abdullah the father of our messenger and when they went to this priest or fortune teller they were told that there is a way out and that is that you choose ask the gods to choose between slaughtering abdullah or ten camels as sacrifice instead so they drew the lots and it was said sacrifice abdullah so they added another 10 and again sacrifice abdullah and another 10 and another 10 and until they reached 100 camels and that was indeed a fortune and when they reached the number 100 then the lots told them that okay sacrifice the camels and abdullah was spared and he did so why camels especially camels to the arabs are the most valuable animal uh around at the time and in the holy quran allah tells us to look at how great and magnificent the camels are how where they were created and i believe that though we are living in the age of airplanes uh fast trains and transportation and mobiles and so on computer internet yet we did not do the camels is justice because allah did not mention the camel in the quran without any legitimate reason if researchers looked into how the camels are created into their characteristics and specialties i believe that they will find wonders and wonders of allah otherwise allah would not have told us to look into how the camels were created among all animals he only specif specifically chose the camel for us to observe and to research so i believe that we did not do the camel its justice by not looking into it but i believe that there will come people and scientists to look into this uh problem and this is called the desert ship the cameras it is called the the the ship of the desert or whatever because it can live and travel in the desert like no other animal can and it's equipped with so many things in indeed it's a four wheel drive animal you know it has its it provisions in it it has it's it's water and and food and it can go on for seven or ten days without feeding and and subhanallah there are so many things in camels so abdullah was spared and the camels were sacrificed to their idols and claiming to be to allah the almighty and why was that that was to prove to the people of mecca that allah azza has spared abdullah in order for something that is so high and important and that is to be able uh for muhammad sallallahu sallam to be born from the offsprings of abdullah marrying the mother of the prophet sallam then muhammad sallallahu alaihi sallam is called the behind the son of the two that is exactly precisely how he is called he the prophet sallam said about himself that i am the son of the two slaughtered ones though they were not slaughtered the first one was ishmael ishmael when allah as we mentioned in an earlier program allah has instructed him revealed to him that he must slaughter his son ishmael and just as he was about to do that allah gave him this huge ram to slaughter and said and this is what all the muslims do every single year in the festival or in the aid of and they sacrifice a sheep a ram or a cow or a camel this is also acceptable sacrificing a she a camel or a cow suffice seven people but sacrificing one sheep is enough for one person and his family those who whom he support and we do this and it's it's very strange you you have people defending the animal animal rights association you have bb coming every uh now and then saying that muslims are barbaric they're killing uh animals they're uh uh slaughtering animals and no one defends the humans themselves we have humans being sacrificed like sheep in chechnya and and in palestine and here and there and nobody stands up and say this is against human rights but when you slaughter sheep and you feed on these sheep people come and say islam is a barbaric religion it sheds a light and it does this and it does that this is the sunnah and we may never divert from it so non-muslims also slaughtered animals to eat to feed some of them yes they eat animals but unfortunately uh the majority do not slaughter they either kill the animal by hitting it on the head with a hammer or by stinging it or by injecting it or by electrifying it and all of these these forms of of killing makes the animal unlawful for us to kill as muslims we can only eat the meat of an animal that was slaughtered by a muslim a jew or a christian if these two conditions were not fulfilled then we may not eat this animal and this leads us to another problem which is not within the seerah that one should be careful of the meat he eats especially if he's not living in muslim countries it's not enough for you to go and to a restaurant in a country where you know that it the rules and regulations of that country that you may not slaughter there are countries in europe that forbids slaughtering animals they say you have to kill the animal first by hitting it with a hammer on the head smashing its skull once it's dead then you may start cutting the meat now this is called meta dead animal we're not allowed to eat from it but we sacrifice animals every year in hajj because this is the doing of abraham of ishmael of our prophet muhammad and this is the least painful a procedure to be followed with animals and this is what the the i don't know the uh it's not the physicians uh it's the doctor's responsible of animals uh they have a word for that uh veteranians or something something like this yeah the vets uh so they say by slaughtering an animal though it is shaking and trembling it does not feel anything because you have cut the spinal cord and they are senseless they don't have any sense this is the easiest way the most humane way to kill an animal not like hitting it on the head or electrifying it where it's in pain and misery all the time and again diverting from our main topic islam is the most humane religion and practice to with animals the prophet salallahu tells us that whenever you want to slaughter an animal you have to sharpen your knife it is a sin to slaughter your animal with a dull knife though you're going to kill it eventually but the pain the torture is forbidden and again the prophet tells us that he once saw a man and he the man was slaughtering a sheep in the range while the other sheep were watching in front of other sheep so the prophet was furious and angry with him and he told him do you want to kill the sheep twice don't you fear allah azza whenever you want to slaughter a sheep slaughter it in isolation from the others so that they do not feel the pain they are animals this is what we think these sheep are animals yet the prophet told us that they have feelings and you may not do this with the animal in front of the others and a religion like this does it promote slaughtering captives does it promote kidnapping and killing people indiscriminately does it promote bombing terrorist attacks no definitely not so who's ever doing this definitely does not know our prophets does not know our religion and definitely is not a proper muslim he is really mercy to mankind that is our prophet he is the mercy to mankind and we will get to this insha allah later on but just as an example the prophet sallam once saw a camel and the camel was weeping and the prophet sallam by allah empowering him got to understand what the camel was saying and he was furious and he said who's the owner of this camel the man says i'm the owner of the camel o prophet of allah why aren't you feeding him why are why are you carrying so much on him fear allah be aware that allah azza will punish you as you punish this camel this is the mercy not to mankind not to the jinn he is the mercy to all who was sent to all mankind and to the jinn and to every one on this planet so coming back to our uh uh uh uh zamzam uh and he abdullah the father of prophet sallam was spared because of the sacrifice of this 100 camels and nowadays the blood money you know what the blood money is if someone kills someone by mistake or kills him deliberately then those the the family of the victim have the right either to ask for blood money or to ask for execution the blood money is estimated in 100 camels the value of 100 camels i'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program so inshallah until we meet next time"
