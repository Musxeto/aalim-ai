  "transcript": "Bycotting people is the easiest thing in the world and this is not the answer to your problems. It's very easy. I don't speak to my uncle, I don't call my cousins, I don't communicate with my brother or my sister. Why? Because they did something offensive, they smoked in my presence, they said an inappropriate joke, they don't respect this and that. No, no, no. This is not the way. Boycotting has rules and regulations and only when, again, measuring by the consequence. If I boycott, would this bring them back to Islam and back to their senses? Yes. Go ahead. If not, then no. Don't do it. So what to do with them? We told you symptoms and the chronic illness. What to do? Don't treat the symptoms by giving Panadol, Panadol, Panadol. Nothing's going to change except temporarily. Rather go for the kill. Go for the illness itself. Elevate their Iman, let them love you, let them respect you, let them believe in you and little by little they will quit these things, the haram things, Inshallah."
