  "title": "They could hear crying noises from her room after her death?",
  "transcript": "Musaad from Germany. He says about a tale that, people circulate\nabout a girl who used to read Qur'an in her room who passed away. And her parents hear things crying in her\nroom and they brought a \"Mawlana\", and the Mawlana said 'oh, no problem. This was angels crying for her death and not\nbeing able to read the Qur'an.' So he's asking, is this true that the angels\ncry? This is a fabrication. This is most likely their imagination or the\njinn. And this \"Mawlana\", they should've brought\na Ghostbuster instead. What is he talking about? Does he have a machine and he just sits there\nand scans the room and 'so, oops, yep, that's an angel, that's an angel and they're crying..' What is this? How can you even attribute such a description\nthat the angels \"Cry\" without having any evidence from the Qur'an or the sunnah. These so called \"Mawlana\", they make a lot\nof bucks, they make a lot of money because, they feed on people's ignorance like this. This is most likely either the jinn or their\nimagination. And they should not pay any attention to it. Read Surah Al-Baqarah in that room or in that\nhouse and in sha Allah it will go away."
