  "title": "Was Sheeth (Seth) a Prophet & are stories about him true (Stories VS Quran & Sunnah) assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so Shake um I've been watching countless videos on a particular Prophet named sheep or Seth waslamic preachers like Mufti menk and others have spoken about how during the prophet set's time shaytan came and manufactured the world's first instruments essentially and also about how the prophet said received 50 Chronicles out of the 104 that have been sent to mankind by God they also mentioned how partying and Cena originated as forms of fitna during the time of the Prophet Seth now Sheikh this is personally one of my favorite prophetic stories but I'm not sure if these stories are authentic I know that the prophet set isn't mentioned in the Quran and that he really isn't mentioning the Hadith as far as I know so my question to you is should we as Muslims consider these stories true either though to my limited knowledge we don't really have the Quran and Sunnah confirming that most of this stuff really did happen during the prophet says time there are so many stories stories and fables about prophets and messengers of Allah azzawajal Muslims our religion is not about stories our religion is about Quran and Sunnah and there is a very tiny window it's very small where the Prophet told us whatever you hear from the tales of the sons of Israel from the Jews through the old scriptures and they don't go against Quran and Sunnah don't believe them and don't label them as false just keep them as they are but don't take any rulings from them it's just a story now this is a very tiny window which may make 1.01 percent nowadays people are so engaged in such stories and tales and you never know they love dragons and they love Sorcerers this is why they watch all of these novels and and movies about them but they are not related to Islam so whether Seth is um a prophet or not to my knowledge I don't know so I would say that I believe in all prophets and Messengers generally speaking but those who are not mentioned in the Quran and Sunnah I would not go out of my way to say that Danielle for example is a messenger or Prophet because I don't know yosha is not a prophet because I don't know we don't have a confirmed evidence backing it up and therefore as a Muslim I believe that whatever benefits us is found in the Quran Sunnah anything else is elective is not mandatory so we don't spend time and build uh uh castles of sand over stories that are not authentic or do not have any credibility so I advise you to ignore all these stories and focus on learning your religion and the Seer of the prophet wasallam"
