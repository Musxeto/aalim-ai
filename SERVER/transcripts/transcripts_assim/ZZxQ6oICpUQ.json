  "transcript": "beginning. This life we're in, what is it? It is merely a test. Allah Azza Wa Jal has created us on earth to test us. Didn't Allah say in Surat Al-Mulk, Surat Tabarak, a Surah of 30 ayah. Each and every individual of us, I hope, recites it before going to bed. We memorize it by heart. Every Muslim memorizes it by heart. Why? Because the Prophet ï·º told us that whoever memorize it will not be tormented in the grave. Ya Allah, 30 ayahs, three zero, very simple. Every single night you and I read it, definitely. So in the ayah number two, Allah says, Alladhi khalaqal mawta walhayata liyabuluwakum ayyukum ahsanu amala. And we ponder upon Allah's beautiful words. What does it say? Because it's addressed to us. Allah is not talking to animals. Allah is not talking to fish or birds. Allah is talking to you and me. So what is He telling us? He's telling us who has created death and life that He may test you. Which of you is best in deed? Who among you is best in what they do? So all what you see in life and death is a test."
