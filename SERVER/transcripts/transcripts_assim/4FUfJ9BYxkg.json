  "transcript": "should I have a man about him al-hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen Salaam Salaam Baalak our lobbying oscillate I mean nabina muhammad in equality he was happy as me a mother do assalamualaikum warahmatullahi overlock Otto last time we stopped at the ruling on war gains the war booty known as al ranima what the Muslim army gains from the enemy after being defeated so we have a battle or a number of battles and then we get to win their homes their furnitures their gold and silver everything what to do with this Allah tells us in the Quran that we should divide this as mentioned in surah Anfal if I'm not mistaken chapter 8 it is chapter 8 verse 41 Allah says acknowledge walamu animal on him to know that one-fifth of whatever spoils you may acquire in war is for Allah and the messenger and for the near of kin the orphans the needy and the travelers in need this is referring to 1/5 so if we gather the spoils and the gains of war one-fifth of it must be isolated this 1/5 is mentioned in ayah 41 how to distribute it so it is for Allah the messenger the neat next-of-kin the orphans the needy and the travelers in need and the other 4/5 of the gains of war or spoils of war which is 80% this has to be divided by the soldiers who participated in the battle itself and doing of such was illustrated in the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam the prophet alayhi salat wa salam after the Battle of Haber that was on the seventh year of hijra he divided the 4/5 of the gains the remaining the 80% and he gave one share to foot soldiers and he gave three shares for a night or a horse rider one share for him similar to the foot soldier and two shares for his horse because a person on the back of a horse has more superiority and strength and power than a foot soldier so this is how the Prophet divided Italia sort of set up and so had Allah the prophet said in an authentic hadith my provision he said my provision was made under the shade of swords meaning that fighting in the cause of Allah despite the fact that we were ordered to do it to please Allah and to make a las worth the highest yet there is gain for the soldiers and the Muslims in this life if they were to win so for us it's a win-win situation you die you go to paradise for eternity this is what counts you live you get a share and booties and the spoils and the gains of war which would be more than handsome for you and for your family but what about if the Muslims gained something without a fight so there are times that you can have a war where the Muslims themselves do not engage in physical fight either because the enemy is so terrified they surrender or they flee and leave behind these gains whatever the Muslims win without a fight this is not called ranima in arabic it's called al faith and ll faith has a different distribution due to the fact that the Muslims did not put up a fight to gain it so there was no struggle or threat on them and al fey is given to the Muslim ruler to distribute it according to what he thinks is best for the community so the Muslim ruler may think that we should buy more arms shields weaponry to help the Muslim army advance one would say no we would utilize it to give for the community service paving roads building math building schools and hospitals so this is for the Muslim ruler to decide where to put it now sometimes Muslims may feel a bit weak or have the need to have a truce and they cannot fight anymore so the concept of a truce is found in Islam when the Muslim community is in a state of weakness or they're not prepared to fight or for some other valid reason such as the hope to be able to advocate Islam to those whom they are about to fight if this is the case then they may resort to a truce so that they can regain their strength pre strategize and plan better allah says in the quran if they incline to peace that is the disbelievers the enemies of islam then incline you to it as well surah Anfal verse 61 who in general is an occasional aha and this was done by the prophet alayhi salatu salam some people due to their ignorance may reject us and this is a decision that only the Muslim ruler can take is not for any Tom Dick or Harry it's not for the layman but unfortunately now everybody is a Muslim ruler as they say all Chiefs and no Indians so if you go to the Wild West you will find all them people are Chiefs smoking their pipes giving decisions giving orders but no Red Indians to go and actually fight this is the Muslims unfortunate reality the Muslims all give ideas deep theories we should do this we should do that when it is way above their paced pay grade this is not their job this responsibility was given only to the Muslim ruler and that's why we have deviant sects how are H people without knowledge who reject whatever Muslim ruler decides who always object to whatever he says who always believe in the conspiracy theory so the ruler says I see we need to have a truce with our enemies and they should know let's fight are you crazy he's the Muslim ruler not only that sometimes they go the extra mile and they decide to fight the Muslim ruler accuse him hang accusing him of being captured of being a tyrant of being this or that failing to see the consequences of their choices eight nine ten years ago we had something that people called the Arab Spring revolutions started erupting in one country after the other in the Muslim world all objecting to their tyrant ruler few weeks earlier they had a house there people slept in homes they had three meals on the table they had medical care and hospitals they went to best schools and universities they were able to travel and maybe migrate to other countries to work and gain and earn money in short they had a life look at what's happening now in such countries look at Libya look at Syria look at Yemen and the list goes on ask any Muslim do you like today's situation or 10 years ago he would say I would sacrifice half of my children just to go back ten years ago at least we were human beings at least we had a life but now it's so unfortunate Rama so when the decision is given to the public as they call democracy it only brings ruin to their country not that democracy brought this but the lack of leadership whenever you read bail and you want to overthrow the government this what is what happens the same thing with the governor ruler who says that we need to have a truce to regain our strength until restructure our forces so that we will be in a stronger position and you have people objecting to that said no no no this is not permissible this is Haram you are a traitor and then they start to give takfeer and then all chaos takes place the prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam who underwent many battles with the idol worshipers the battle of better the Battle of hood where 70 of his closest companions were martyred among them was most abnormal the first messenger of the prophets is awesome to go to Medina and convey his lamp to them his own uncle Hammond's ahem Abdul Muttalib was martyred and so many others and they tried to besiege Medina for a whole month they surrounded it they gathered more than 10,000 soldiers with the Kabul collaboration of the jews of banu karela and they tried to annihilate Islam and the Muslims and Allah defeated them so after all of this on the day of hudaibiya when the Prophet came with approximately 1400 worshipers wearing harm wanting to make ombres and go back not having arms of battle the idol worshipers blocked them and refused them entering and it was it was a stalemate and then they came to negotiate a deal so the Prophet signed alehissalaam a treaty with them that there won't be any fighting for 10 years and that would be their peace treaty a truce for 10 years and it contained conditions that all Muslims thought were unfair among them that you go back to Medina do not complete your Umrah you come next year and you stay only for three days not not anymore and if anyone from Mecca comes to you as a Muslim you must return him back but if any Muslim apostatized and goes back to Mecca as a captor as a disbeliever the people of Quraysh should not and must not return him back but they are allowed to keep him the Muslims thought that this was totally unfair yet the Prophet told them that this was a laws decision and ruling so if the Prophet had done this array salatu was-salam then definitely it should be accepted by others such a treaty which the Imam conduct s-- with the enemy is binding for every single Muslim in the community no one can revoke it no one can cancel it as they must honor it as Muslims Allah says in the Quran so long as they are true to you be true to them so you cannot revoke it or break it Allah says believers o you who believe be true to your contracts oh who will report the Muslims don't cheat don't betray don't lie so it is not permissible to go back on your commitment violating the truce or such a treaty is totally prohibited but if they violated it if they resort to fighting us or to supporting our enemy or if they resorted to killing Muslims taking their property then such an agreement or treaty becomes invalid Allah says in the Quran and if they break their oaths after their treaty and defame your religion then fight the leaders of disbelief for indeed there are no oaths sacred to them fight them that they might cease chapter 9 verse number 12 surah 2 Toba now if they violate the treaty it is not permissible for us to just break it unless the violation is crystal clear if we suspect that they're about to break it and we sense in intention from their side in this case you have the right to break such a treaty only after giving them a notice a heads-up so that they won't be able to accuse you of betraying them and going back on your word and look how honorable jihad and fighting is in Islam people would think that no I should take advantage of their being unaware of me attacking them but not in Islam Allah says in the Quran if you have reason to fear from a people betrayal throw their treaty back to them putting you on equal terms indeed Allah does not like the traitors so you have to give them heads up so that they won't have the disadvantage of not knowing what is about to come it is not permissible for Muslims to fight the other party before they have been notified of the obligation of the treaty rules of engagement and Islam is very crystal clear and no one can say anything negative about it alhamdulillah now we move on to the other section in the book which should conclude the talk about jihad and the chapter about jihad and this is vim and jizya these are two things that are frequently mentioned in books so they mystically the Arabic term of them means a pledge a security or a warranty the village means that people are allowed to stay on Muslim lands and they have a contract so that Muslims would not ever harm them or do anything for them or against them but they must abide by the Islamic sharia which applies to them the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam whenever he sent an army to fight in the cause of allah the prophet elisha son would always tell the leader to call them first to Islam and if they accept what you're calling them for so be it leave them and move us there Muslims they're like us there's nothing for me to do here but if they do not accept Islam after you have showed them how beautiful it is in this case tell them that you have an alternative which is a taxation that you must give known as jizya and if they refuse then ask them to get ready for war because that would be the final and third alternative so if a person who's living on Muslims lands accepts these rules and regulations he has to pay the jizya he does not have to change his religion he can remain to practice his religion without any problem as long as he's doing it privately and not in public he can live his own life as he wishes no one would force him to do anything other than that the Islamic rules apply it applies when it comes to financial transactions and it also applies when the Islamic panel law is required so they're living on our soils they're not allowed to deal in RIBA in interest they have to do transactions according to Islamic halal rules they sell they buy but they don't lend others with usually with River this is totally prohibited in Islam so financial transactions must apply to their transactions and must be Islamic transactions well which does not include any loss by the way but interest unfortunately is the backbone of capitalism which leads only to Wars poverty and extortion the second venue that they must respect and Islamic rules must be applied is when it comes to the implementation of the Sharia law so if they kill someone they don't have the right to say according to our religion we have to throw him in jail know if you kill someone then you either executed or you pay ransom blood money or the people of the disease of the victim forgive you there's nothing more than that if a person drinks intoxicants in his home gets wasted in his home and nobody knows about him no problem this is something between you and your Lord but if he comes out and people see him drunk and he's caught then he has to be flogged 80 lashes whether it is halal in his religion or not doing it publicly is not permissible other than that religious beliefs worship family matters including marriage and divorce this is left for the Vimy his community his religion to be practice this is something of their own they are more than welcome to do it we have no problem in that finally we come to the last point before the last which is pledge of security the pledge of security is known as a cuddle Amman so if someone comes from abroad he's not have hidden me he's not sitting in our land inhabiting it living like us and paying the Jews yet he's someone who's coming for a specific period of time and for a specific reason like businessmen like workers on visa temporary visa like doctors like engineers who come first a specific task after finishing it they go in this case this pledge ensures their safety and ensures the security of their life and property to be safe for that specified period and such a pledge of security can be common and can't be private the common part is the one that was issued by the Muslim ruler so the Muslim ruler issues a security pledge for doctors to come for two years contract renewal renewable and for a group of engineers to come and work for a year or so and for this and for that this is something that is common given by the Muslim ruler there is a pledge of security given by the individuals any individual any Muslim and this is to announce that mr. tom is in my security I have given him the pledge of security so no one would stand in his way or abuse him or do any form of transgression because he is under my protection and this was done at the time of the Prophet as a salam in the conquest of Mecca when his female cousin the sister of Ali bin Abi Talib she gave the pledge of security to one of her in-laws and Ali rejected that refused that he said no and he wanted to do something against that person so when she announced it and the Prophet heard that he said we have given security to the one whom you had given security for all on Hanna and he clarified this alehsalaam that the weakest among the Muslims have the same powers and as the strongest of them when it comes to terms of Pledge of Allegiance now the validity of the Pledge of security this has to be for a period of time and for the purpose of Dawa as much as possible Allah says in the Quran if any one of the idol turds seek asylum with you grant him protection so that he may hear the word of Allah that is the Quran and then convey him to his place of safety that is because they are people who lack knowledge so the purpose of such a pledge of security can vary but you have to include this in it which is to give them the ability to learn about Islam and to find out more about this beautiful religion with this we conclude the chapter that deals with jihad and hopefully next Monday we will start the chapter that deals with transactions which many many people always get confusion in and inshallah we will try to eliminate such confusion as much as possible now we have the questions that were collected and there are many I doubt we can finish them but we'll give it a shot inshallah ABAB rahim says what is the ruling on reciting the Quran from a phone while praying taraweeh prayer or the Koran while praying taraweeh prayer or 200 a series this is totally permissible mother Aisha may Allah be pleased with her used to have one of her slaves leading the taraweeh reading from a Mustafa so if you read your tell away from the phone there is no problem in that none whatsoever if you hold that must have itself there's no problem and if you continue to read outside of taraweeh from a different book or a different mobile again there is no problem in that lyric says is the hadith authentic and if yes how to understand it we have been informed from her ok the narration narration that a man came to the prophet Ali thought of Salaam to embrace Islam with the condition or making a condition not to pray except two prayers per day and it was accepted from him reported by mahidol Muslim this hadith caused a lot of confusion among the Muslims one hadith stating that this man says I will not pray five times a day I'll pray only to fight two times a day and the Prophet accepted that other hadith people came and said we will not pray at all and we will not perform jihad but everything else we will accept it and the Prophet said if they become Muslim they will pray and they will perform jihad others said that we don't want to give the cat so these hadith were confusing because some scholars say that this is permissible as it is part of gradually calling people to Islam such as in the case someone comes to me and says chef I mentioned this in Islam but I am addicted to drugs and I can't leave drugs as a Muslim I would say embrace Islam and inshallah through time you will be able to kick this habit others would say no either you took take the full package or leave the full package and this is wrong we have to call people gradually some scholars say said that yes we have to call people gradually but this is not calling them gradually these are putting hurdles in front of accepting Islam as a whole not stating that they have weaknesses but they are rejecting the concept of Islam so this is not accepted and the most acceptable interpretation for this hadith is that the one who accepted it was the Prophet isosa he is the one who said once they are Muslim they will pray they will perform jihad they will give zakat and this cannot happen except to someone who's getting revelation from Allah because this is from the unseen besides when the Prophet sent more Adam in a javelin may Allah be pleased with him to Yemen he told him tell them that Allah has obliged them to pray 5 prayers a day if they accept this then tell him tell them that Allah has put a percentage on their wealth taken from the Pope from the rich and given to the poor so the prophet kept on saying if they accept this then tell them which means that it's a it's a package deal they have to accept it so the most authentic opinion is that if someone today comes and says I will accept Islam but I will not fast from about we tell them that this is not acceptable so it is not permissible for someone to pick and choose though other scholars said accept it from him because the Islam is valid and the condition is invalid and once he accepts this to him and he says okay I'm not fasting tell him if you don't fast we're gonna chop your head off because you're not a Muslim this is not fair this is not part of fulfilling your commitment he says I'll accept Islam but I thought I will not fast Ramadan cuz I don't believe in it to say sorry either take it all or leave it off if he says I'm addicted to drugs I said okay but you have to acknowledges is prohibited and you have to try your level best to leave it but til then you're still a perfectly good Muslim and Allah social knows best hassling says women who pray at home is it recommended to pray the relative of the world silent as far the answer is all rotted whether of fetcher law or matte lip or Isha they're all read silently whether in homes or in nashit whether by women or by men Muhammad says which do I should we have to recite after finishing the whole Quran there is no dawn after finishing the whole Quran and dua of star we have to recite before eating there is no prescribed dhikr for that what is prescribed is the dates are in front of me the water is in front of me I it's it's a miniature - for Adan and Mallory for sunset I make duaa not prescribed you just make a door for me and he says or after taking a bite now after I break my fast and drink water it is soon that to say the Habad AMA Wachtel Little Lulu with her battle as your insha'Allah and you'll find this in the fortress of Muslim rush it says since all gold shops are closed how to calculate the cut present selling rate well you can give an estimate of last year's zakat and give it and once the shops are opened again you can go and estimate your gold if it's more give the difference if it's less than hamdulillah what you have given was an extra was saw the hustlin says after the first shot the hell Lulu that's in hatch I'm in Muharram I made the first alone can a woman wear her gloves and Nevada says yes everything is permissible except intimacy with the spouse Latifah or Latif says it's for and knowledge from knowledge of Allah I mean is Quran knowledge of Allah how do you serious Latif the Quran is from Allah whose knowledge can it be from definitely it is from Allah is knowledge and it is the speech of Allah Subhanahu WA Ta'ala Abu Ibrahim says when should we break the fast five minutes before margaret's Allah and when exactly should we stop eating for the hood you must stop eating for sure once the dawn breaks so either you can physically see that if you are in the wilderness or in a deserted area no lights of three no large buildings and you look at the east it's dark dark dark then you see a white thread like in the horizon then this is the break of dawn you should stop and you should pray immediately or afterwards Thatcher you cannot eat now that's it but if you don't have this privilege and all what you have is the advance of the message then the moment that says Allah Akbar you stop eating and you may start to create and Allah knows best as for did I say you should start eating or stop eating no if the event of fire is called you must stop eating and it is time for you to pray fire if you wish as for sunset the same applies if you're by the shore and you see the sunsets once the ring of the Sun disappears you can start to eat even the Adhan is not cold but if you don't have this luxury in this case you have to depend on the other end the moment that I then says Allah walk about you can eat and you may start to pray afterwards fatima says explain this hadith please a slave of Allah may utter the word which pleases Allah without giving it much importance and because of that Allah will raise him to degrees of reward a slave of Allah may utter a word carelessly which displeases Allah without thinking of its gravity and because of that he will be thrown into hell fire these words are words of pleasing Allah or displeasing Allah so you might be in a gathering and someone says that I love to sin I love to watch Haram and you give him an advice and you say that people must not look at things that anger Allah people must seek Allah's pleasure because our life on earth is limited and our time is coming approaching soon and subhanAllah Allah opens that person's heart to words he repents his Excellus forgiveness he becomes righteous and practicing Muslim you didn't pay any attention for that good word it elevates your status in paradise another person someone tells him something and he rejects it and he said yes Ali but Allah says in the Quran and he while is reciting the Quran he said listen to this nonsense he just waved his hand and said a couple of words these words are sufficient to throw him in hell for a very long long time and this is what is meant by the hadith Archaea says is the hadith that the angels won't record for the sin of the sense of a person who repented before six hours is this only for minor sins or major this is for both the Angels uplift the pen they do not register your sin for six hours if you happen to repent be remorseful ask Allah for forgiveness they will not record it otherwise they will write it down Ezra says is it true that women need to needs the constant or the canoe the consent of Guardian in her first marriage but after she if she's divorced and wants to marry second time she does not need the consent and can go ahead with the marriage answer's no this is totally false the Prophet said adding his salatu was-salam there is no marriage between brackets valid except with a guardian and two male witnesses so this means that if a woman marries without the approval in the consent of her guardian such a marriage would not be accepted in Allah so Allah knows best Norma Racal empty we are we allowed well we allow to someone sink specially month of Ramadhan Christian people even the nose month of Ramadan they don't care should I tell them something or just leave them I don't understand your English with all due respect but if you're intending to say that during the month of Ramadan Christian people play music loudly and sing which disturbs us Muslims can we address them or should we leave them alone this depends on the country you're living in if you're living in their own country in America this is not logical if you talk to them they will shrug their shoulders and not pay attention to you but these countries have laws so if the law of the country states that they are not allowed to annoy their neighbors like this and disturb them you can call the police and let them talk with them habiba says if I'm praying taraweeh opium can I continue my recitation of the Quran from where I stopped when I am not praying while holding the most half or reading it from a mobile I say yes we address this question before the so Allah said angels do not enter a house where there is an image or a picture or a dog I'm not having images in my room but others have for example or that is my friends cause we are sharing three rooms apartment does that mean that the angels is not in my room also know if your room has no images then you are not sharing that punishment with them so they man earth man says is there any relationship between the believer and the non-believer yonni I don't know what do you mean by relation if a brother is a Muslim and his sibling is a non-muslim is there any relation between them yes there is Brotherhood there are siblings if a man is a Muslim and his wife is a Christian is there any relationship between them yes there is marriage so I'm not sure of what you meant by your question for Hannah says and for her name is for Hannah man this is not permissible to have the name of a man like this it has to be under Rahman so change your name can I say is their father Institute when praying Sunnah or any voluntary salat you can say that in any fault or any voluntary prayer Institute you can ask Allah for forgiveness Mohammed Samaha says I have a question to marry a believing woman that is Muslim woman you don't love and this believing woman that is kafir which one is better in the sight of Allah definitely that was the moment whether you love her or not if you don't love her don't marry her look for our another Muslim woman who you accept but marrying a disbelieving woman even if you love her this is not something that is the best thing for a Muslim to do specially if he gets or has children from her any time she could divorce him and take the children and convert them to her own religion handin says how does the time in Bursa passed is it similar to ours is it 100 years going to feel like 100 years or is it going to feel like few moments I have no idea I haven't tried it yet but what Allah mentioned in the Quran that when they're asked about their life on earth they would say it was merely a moment or half of that half a day maybe so this is regarding their life in on earth but in the byrsa we don't know whether they're feel the passing of time or not and this is something that would not benefit us a lot above Allison Sega can Erica be done during Ramadan or any time no it can be done anytime but the normies and the Sunnah is to make it during the last 10 nights of ramadan however it was authentic that omar vowed my only reason to make one ehtekaf in harem of Mecca and that was not in Ramadan and the Prophet ordered him to fulfill his vow MD mam new regime is it permissible if the people joining congregation prayer and they are standing 1 2 3 metres away from one another this is called social distancing and it was introduced by some scholars to be practiced in messages and unfortunately it is also practiced in Mecca at the moment in a harem not by those scholars and those who pray behind the email but and isolated group most likely done for as a PR stunt who's standing far away from one another they are workers in the Haram they are security guards and the so like so my own opinion is that this is not permissible this is an innovation and it will not work our religion is based on more than this so either change our religion or change our perception of such mythical precautions I think that this is an innovation and it's prohibited but we are followers of or anandasana and those who interpret them to us who have knowledge so we are not scholars we convey the message of the scholars to the people until now I did not see concrete evidence from real scholars approving it so if real scholars like Sheikh Saleh elbows an or a ship the cream layer or share a Brahmin Barack come with fatwas say stating that this is okay then we will follow and say ok till that time I think it is not wise and I think it is an innovation in our religion and this is unfortunate in so many Muslim world Muslim countries we have tied the camel but have we trusted Allah you know the hadith a man came instead of prophet of Allah my camel is outside should I tie it to a tree so it would not run away or should I trust Allah the prophet said tie it and trust Allah so now we have tied the camel we have taken all medical precautions social distancing lockdown washing your hands thoroughly wearing face masks but staying away from anyone who has the symptoms --is two three months then what did we trust Allah Zoey what do you mean we've locked down messages no Fridays the Muslim ruler tells us that this is a necessity we comply and follow we have no problem in that but what should I do with the rest of the religion which states that if a person comes from travel we hug him what should we do when it comes to doing rupiah or recycling before going to sleep and blowing in our hands and washing our face and bodies should we go and wash our hands again what to do when I'm reciting ropey over someone who's possessed or has jinn or evil eye or black magic or envy and I have to dry spit on them oh you have to do that from behind the facemask what to do when I have a pimple or someone has a wound and part of my heritage of my Dean in Bihari and elsewhere the hadith is highly authentic that the Prophet showed us what to do when someone has a wound or a pimple that we soak art finger with our saliva and take it touch from the soil of the earth and say bismillah have Obinna three at or below our Dina maria pia paulina shiva osaka mina and put it on that wound what would the doctor say huh where's the social distancing the doctors say that even cupping is not healthy it's bad it's this that so now I'm at the fork of the road should I follow the medical doctors or follow my religion now we have to be wise and try to make a win-win situation but to claim that praying a meter or two apart would save you from coronavirus or from copied 19 what about the grounds what about the air is airborne and the fatalities of such an illness are not so high any normal illness can kill far more than what cognate 19 has killed so at the moment I would say that pray home rather than pray in such weird format until the scholars say the word and Allah knows best Kuto santo says with due respect what if you fight the non-believers to death would you gain any reward from Allah or if you're killed during the fight would you gain any word from Allah of course if you fight in a legitimate war under the flagship of a Muslim leader and you fight disbelieving army if you die you go straight to general and the award is so huge I don't have time to mention it the things that Allah gives someone who was martyred in the cause of Allah array smile says can we pay the cat to your own brother if he is in need and he is for if you brother that if your brother is a Muslim and he's needy or poor and there is no possibility for you to inherit him in this case if he if he were to die in this case yes you can give him the cat and you will be rewarded twice Louis says what about if you don't pray the five normal times is it a sin it is indeed a major sin and if a person does not pray at all he's not a Muslim anymore so if a person prays on and off he is committing a major sin and he's in great danger because this is a sign of hypocrisy but if he does not pray at all then he's not a Muslim anymore Mohammed says that says I'm from Kerala India I want to know if it's okay to eat the pre-dawn meal the city after the failure than is given and stopped after two to three minutes since one wakes up late the answer is no the moment you eat something after the event has started that day is not valid anymore for you and you have to make it up the final question is from the man I met he says I want to know when to stop eating at the time of support we've mentioned this before so I hope this answers your questions and until we meet next Monday I leave you fear Manila Westham alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
