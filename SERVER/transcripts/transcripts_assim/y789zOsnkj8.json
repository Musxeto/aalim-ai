  "title": "Can Allah Create Something that is All Hearing, All Seeing, & All Knowing",
  "transcript": "a friend of mine told me that allah is all hearing all knowing all housing so he can see here and know everything and he asks that can allah create a creature that can see here and know everything okay i will answer inshallah from bangladesh he says allah azza is all hearing all seeing so can allah create some thing that is all hating all seeing first of all there are no limits of allah's powers but allah's powers are related to what is possible because it is not logical to speak about the impossible so someone comes to you and says can allah create something that he himself cannot cannot carry can allah himself create a god and some people say that allah can do so many things but i know many things allah cannot do this is totally inappropriate you must never ever say such a statement because this is disrespecting allah yes i know your intention is good and you meant to address the atheists that allah cannot do the impossible things that are not related because for example if one would say allah cannot create another god because if he creates another god then he's not a god or the one who he created cannot be a god there can only be one god but this is totally impermissible to say i know many things that allah cannot create because these things are related to the impossible and allah's ability is to what is possible to speak about something that is tall and short something that is fat and thin something that is existing and not existing these are nonsense so first of all don't talk about allah like this second of allah all is capable of creating some of his creation who may share some partial of his attributes for example allah is ever living are we ever living no we're about to die but when we resurrect it and we enter paradise allah makes the inhabitants of hell and and paradise ever living immortal living forever why because their life is existing because of allah's life not because they are ever living by themselves the moment allah azza stops providing them with it they'll die so this is something totally different between what's one of allah's attributes that cannot be shared and when allah wants to share some of his common name it's not the same attribute allah's life is unlike any other life but it may confuse people that i'm alive allah is alive so this is common no the name is common and allah azza makes us eternal in paradise insha allah this is not because we are eternal by nature rather it is dependent on allah azza himself you"
