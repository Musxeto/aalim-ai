  "transcript": "Adadev from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh, I would like to ask that, so my name Adidev, it is one of the names of the Hindu god Shiva. I'm a revert Muslim from a Hindu family. I practice Islam in private because my mom is quite Islamophobic so my parents don't know that I am a Muslim and I would like to ask if my name is considered shirk because it is one of the names of the god Shiva in Hinduism. When I grow up must I change my name? Yes, if your name, your first name, is a name of a god in Hindu, you have to change this whenever you are able to do this. Change it to Abdullah or to any good name Inshallah."
