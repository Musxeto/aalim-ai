  "transcript": "Abdullah from Canada shikh I saw one of your videos where you said that if I'm uh where you said that if I'm praying Salah at home it's okay to just move my tongue during the Salah without any audible noise my question is can the same be applied for thear after each Salah okay the ruling is Abdullah when the prophet Sall Al wasallam was asked that make me accompany you in Jenna by one of his companions so he said your tongue must be moist with remembering Allah from this Hadith and others Scholars concluded that in order for our recitation for our Vick for our uh whatever we worshiping Allah by we have to move our lips and tongue articulating whatever we want to say silently as if we're saying it loudly now one would argue and say okay what happens if I were to keep my lips sealed and think in my head Subhan Allah alhamdulillah so my lips are sealed and I'm thinking of it wouldn't I be rewarded for that if I'm praying and I recite the fa in prayer for example and I keep my lips sealed wouldn't my prayer be valid the vast majority of Scholars say that your prayer is invalid whoa why I recited the fat in my head they say because this is like scanning it's not actual reading some say and argue but this doesn't make any sense Allah knows what goes in my heart we say this is true but don't try to come up with excuses lame excuses without any proof or justification from the Quran or from the Sunnah and I'll counter your logic by saying if my lips are sealed and I think of evil thoughts or I desire sins and I fantasize about them would I be sinful you will jump and say no the prophet saidham Allah has forgiven my um for whatever intrusive thoughts that cross their minds as long as they don't speak about it or act upon it and I did not speak about it and I did not act upon it so Allah would forgive it the same thing goes for positive or for Vick or for recitation of the Quran if you don't move your lips and tongue Allah will not accept that and Allah Knows Best"
