  "transcript": "my sister has married a non-muslim guy must we maintain ties of kinship with her or completely cut her off from our lives well first of all your sister by marrying a non-muslim this is one of two either she believes that it is permissible to marry a non-muslim despite the clear verses in the quran that prohibits it despite the hadiths of the prophet isaiah that prohibits it despite the consensus of all muslim scholars who say that this is invalid in its prohibited and it's sinful if she insists that this is a legitimate marriage she is an apostate she's a disbeliever even if she prays and fasts and goes for hajj she's a disbeliever for rejecting the quran the sunnah and the consensus of scholars so such a person you should not be in contact with unless you feel that if i pay her a visit or two maybe i can soften her heart and return her back to islam but if she's adamant if she's defiant then she's bad news cut her off don't communicate with her or she knows that what she's doing is sinful but she loves the guy and she knows that her marriage is invalid and whatever children she gets are born out of wedlock and that she's committing a major sin and heinous sin in this case she is a sinful muslim and you have to weigh the pros and cons of staying in contact or not because most likely if you stay in contact without normalizing the relationships without inviting her adulterous boyfriend who she says is her husband without having any contact with him if you think that being in contact with her would isha allah be beneficial then you should do that and allah knows best and the final question"
