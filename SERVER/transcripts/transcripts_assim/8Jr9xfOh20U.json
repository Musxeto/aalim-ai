  "transcript": "uh my question is sheikha that I read somewhere that if a woman claims that she was raped and she's not able to come up with the four Witnesses and so and and she gets the punishment according to uh if she's made or not slogging or spawning is this a true or not is this hypothetical or a case that is existing uh I have read that it's like so probably like a hypothetical scenario okay well what's the what's the reason so usually this is what happens people post something that's hypothetical and then all of a sudden we have two teams two parties one defending the opinion and the other bashing Islam and saying bad things about Islam and the original person who posted this is getting all the sins why did you ask such a question nothing serious I just thought of you know steering the water a little bit and and doing this and watching what happens so watch out not to open the Pandora box watch out not to open something that would be fitna for others now because you've posted the question already whether you get the synth or not this is not to me to uh state but I'll answer you a woman comes forward stating that this man has raped me so the forensic uh um services or whatever the police or come and investigate medical reports they she has been violated and raped do we have any DNA proofs Etc we may we may not now to the Muslim judge I have a woman with medical reports or without claiming that this individual has raped her I bring this individual and say did you should know but she said you did he says no and by the way she took two million dollars from me did you take two million dollars from him she says no said well touche so it's her word against his why would I believe her when she's accusing someone and this one we don't have evidences so what evidences do you want Sheikh we need four male Witnesses to testify and and say that we've witnessed it this is not possible Sheikh okay then we need him to confess he's not going to confess so how would I allow this to happen and accuse this innocent man who could be innocent and he could not okay we have DNA test that proves that he committed something like that in this case the Muslim judge puts him in jail uh tries to pressure him until he confesses or put him in jail indefinitely six 10 years 20 years because we have DNA tests but DNA test is not sufficient evidence to Stone him to death or to flog him a hundred lashes these are circumstantial evidences but if there is no DNA and there is no proof except her word against his they he has the right to say Sheikh she slandered me I'm an honest law-abiding citizen I am the Imam of the Masjid I have children I have a wife I have a family and she accused me out of thin air no evidence is nothing no Witnesses in this case this woman who claimed something and could not prove it would be flogged 80 lashes for her slandering an innocent person but she was raped that's what you say prove it to me I can't come to someone who claims that your father raped her and do this process and you wouldn't even accept it oh my father doesn't do any such thing just because a random person came and accused him of that I hope this makes sense"
