  "transcript": "alaykum we are from hanafi sect now when we read any Hadith from or Muslim so do we follow it or stick to our way of we are puzzled as we read that we must be part of the same uh part of some sect for example way of sitting in different in Salat and many more they give lots of importance to and say it is very important please guide us thank you this is a very common question you see being part of a sect and actually the word sect is incorrect the sect isah and they are the majority of Muslims hanafi is not a sect Shafi is not a sect H and Maliki are not a sect they are schools of thought so being part of the school of thought of hanafi is acceptable however a person is so ignorant about Islam he knows nothing about Arabic and he has no uh ability to distinguish between what is right and what is wrong and hence he is following his Imam or he is following uh someone who is teaching him in this case is not so easy for me to go and say to him if you read a Hadith in bukari you have to follow it though it is authentic but we don't know if this Hadith was abrogated or not we don't know if this Hadith is general and there are specific ific uh uh evidences that make an exception so for a person who is a Layman and a complete ignorant in Islamic laws and and and and Sciences we would say that this would be acceptable unless it's something that is Crystal Clear to anyone who can understand it but for those who have some knowledge like the uh uh brother or the sister ask this question it appear that he or she has the ability to distinguish to ask questions to clarify things in this case no it is not permissible for you to follow your school of thought blindly and say yeah I know I can read the evidence from the Quran and it's obvious that what I'm doing is wrong but still I'm going to follow my Imam I'm going to follow my school of thought so that my people would not go against me no this is wrong you have to follow the authentic Hadith that it was said by the prophet now having said that this does not mean you because for example as you've mentioned in prayer there are diff things in prayer that the hanfi school is not following the Sunnah however it is still a Sunnah meaning that if I don't follow I'm not sinful so if in the hanfi school you put your right hand over your left hand under your belly or on your belly button now this is against the Sunnah the Sunnah is to put the right hand over the left on the chest this is the authentic had but if you don't want to follow the Sunnah and you want to follow your maab you are not sinful because even if you don't put your right hand over the left altar in prayer and just put them on your sides your prayer is valid so you have to distinguish and you have to differentiate between acts that are mandatory your M tells you something but for example uh the Sunnah is contradictory to it and it's an issue that is mandatory in this case no you have to follow the Sunnah you have to follow the Hadith and go against your maab because your maab your school of thought is wrong but when it comes to recommended things or voluntary things that do not not involve sin so whether you do it or not you're not sinful it's up to you to follow the uh school of thought or to follow the Hadith though I would always go with the Hadith"
