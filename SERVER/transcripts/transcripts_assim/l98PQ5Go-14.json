  "transcript": "ask and to get an interest based loan whether for studying or for any other reason this is totally prohibited it is one of the major sins the prophet Alat wasam said may Allah curse the person who consumes that is that receives the riba so he's the lender and the person that gives the riba so he's the borrower and the person that registers the riba so he's the Clerk or the bank official or whoever does this and the two witnesses who witness this contract these are not being paid for what they do they're just doing it voluntary the prophet said all of these are the same in their curse not one is more than the other they're all equal which is one of the major sins in Islam so definitely you're not entitled and you're not permitted to take this loan whether to study in UK universities or elsewhere and it would be even worse if you take the loan to go and study Quran in Arabic so you're using Haram money to do this and you're cheating the government and you are claiming while you're lying that you're going to use the the loan to study in the UK when you actually intend to lie uh uh by doing this so this is totally prohibited and it's not permissible"
