  "transcript": "oh another beautiful dua if you frequently say it allah would pay off your debts and this dua we have already explained before in hadith number 100 and 21 so you can refer to it back again insha'allah the hadith goes as follows i take refuge in you from anxiety and sorrow and we said that that it translates to what worries you in the future and what griefs you in the past weakness and laziness and we said there in hadith 1 21 weakness is not the appropriate word the appropriate word would be incapacity or inability and laziness miserliness and cowardice the burden of debts and this is why it's good for paying off your debts because you're seeking refuge in allah from the burden of debts and from being overpowered by men and the following chapter chapter 42 supplication for one afflicted by whispering in prayer or recitation aha so i get this all the time people say while praying i get the whispers of shaytan to think oh i have to buy this after i finish prayer oh i forgot my car keys oh i think the doors of the house were not properly locked all these whispers come into your head what to do well the prophet alice islam advised us may allah be pleased with him by saying to him that is from shaytan and spit to your left side three times so while praying you say and you do this so looking to your left specifically if possible to the uh underneath your left foot that would be permissible during prayer because this helps you regain your concentration back again chapter 43 supplication for one whose affairs have become difficult so many times in life we may face this we may suffer we may apply for different jobs and nothing happens we ask allah azzawajal for help so what's the appropriate way to ask allah to make our affairs easy a beautiful dua oh allah there is no ease except in that which you have made easy do you have any doubt does any muslim have any doubt that whatever allah makes easy will become easy no so you acknowledge this and you say it to believe in it oh allah there is no ease except in that which you may you have made easy and you make the the difficulty if you wish easy so when you do this when you ask allah for this allah will facilitate things for you and above all you will feel the tranquility filling up your heart and you will not be so stressed you will not have anxiety attacks or panic attacks what am i gonna do how am i gonna pay the rent chill cool down you've done all what you can do leave the rest to allah azzawajal by saying the dua and having total confidence and belief in him subhanallah okay then we move on to the following hadith and this chapter deals with what to say when a person has committed the sin and for all of us this is a good thing to do this is a an excellent thing to do hadith any servant who commits his sin and as a result performs evolution prays two units of prayer that is to rakaas and then seeks allah's forgiveness allah would forgive him this is known as salatu tawba the prayer of repentance and this is a beautiful way of asking allah for forgiveness now do i have to do this for every sin no usually when you repent generally speaking from all previous sins you offer this once not every single day if you happen to commit and use sin then yes you go ahead and offer these two rakhas after uh performing evolution etc and you ask allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala to forgive you by offering uh these prayers or these two rakaas and seeking allah's forgiveness as the wajal chapter 45 supplications for expelling the devil and his whispers so what is it to do when we want to expel the whispers of shaytan number two you have to call the evan come again you have to call the evan because there is an authentic hadith where the prophet alaihis salat wasam tells us that the adhan helps to ward off the devils and by the way there's another authentic hadith whenever you're scared whenever you're alone wherever you're at the wilderness and you fear the jinn or the devils and you're intimidated by them that you call the advan and this is an authentic hadith as well so all of these things are part of means and ways to expel the devils and the prophet told us allah that when shaytan when iblis hears the adhan he runs while passing wind afraid of what is happening which is the adhan that almost burns it or him out what else hadith 143 recitation of the quran and the authentic words of remembrance and supplications so when you build this high wall in front of you with the recitation the continuous recitation of the quran of ayatul kursi of the last three kuls and you observe your atkar frequently this is what happens shaytan cannot climb up this wall that you had built with the quran and with the atkar and cannot penetrate this wall and hence you will be protected this is all the time we have until we meet next time i live foreign [Music]"
