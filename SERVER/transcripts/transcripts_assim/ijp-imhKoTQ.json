  "transcript": "say it asks what is the Islamic opinion regarding marital rape if it is punishable crime or not if it is what should be the punishment now this is a weird question to tell you the truth but it's fair it's a question let us first of all look at the terminology is it a crime or not the answer is it is not a crime in certain countries and it's a crime in other countries so here we're not talking about is it prohibited in Islam or is it Halong we're talking as a crime something that goes against the law of the country if you go and visit the FBI page it says that before 73 1973 it was not a crime and in 1993 some states incriminated it and there are other states I think 13 of them they do not consider it as a felony or something punishable by law some say it needs counseling some says that has to be reported within 30 days etc we could care less what they say as Muslims what's the ruling on this first of all Islamic Lee it is a sin because in Islam allah azza wajal stated in Surat Annisa chapter 4 washi Rahul Nabil Marouf that you have to treat them with kindness and such an intimate relationship has to be consensual it cannot be forced so if a man uses force and forces himself and if this is associated by beating or the use of force then he's sinful for doing this for harming a Muslim and not any just Muslim his beloved spouse but it is is it something punishable by law there is no there are major sins in Islam there are far greater than this and they're not punishable by law so for example being disobedient or disrespectful to the parents this is pookal valli dane this is one of the greatest major sins ever however there is no prescribed punishment for it in law and there is nothing written down that you have to flog or you have to imprison or you have to do this or that but this doesn't mean it's not a sin so what is known as marital rape is sinful but it's not a crime to be punished it to be punishable by law and this is something that people it's almost impossible to prove it's so intimate between the spouses that is done behind closed doors how can a woman prove this most women who do not want to stay married to their husbands they would falsify claims and accuse their husbands of doing this or that and we all know that this is not true"
