  "title": "Wasn't sure if I read Fatiha in prayer or not so repeated it, do I do sujood as sahu assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so I was praying and then um I got the doubt whether I read fa or not and then I was still standing and then I decided to read faat and then I was planning to do sud sah at the end um but I didn't know the ruling whether I should do because I've repeated or I've said the f while standing I didn't go to so how many times do you make such doubts um right now no no no in prayer in prayer how often do you get these doubts that you miss something this thought was like some time ago so so alhamdulillah it's once in a blue moon correct at that time yeah correct then the answer is repeating the fa for doubting whether you've recited it or not does not require so if you did not offer then you're clean and fine and there's nothing wrong with your prayer"
