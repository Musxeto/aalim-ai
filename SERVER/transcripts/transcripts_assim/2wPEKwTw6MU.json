  "transcript": "\"Mabrook says: \"Who are the Ibadiyya?\" The Ibadiyya is a faction of al-Khawarij. It is one of the seventy-two sects that the\nProphet, aleyhi salatu wa salam, warned us from, dividing into. They follow the Khawarij, but they are a softer\ncopy of the hardcore Khawarij. And this what called Imam Ibn Taymiyyah, may\nAllah have mercy on his soul, to describe them as being the 'gay' part of the Khawarij. \"They're so gay compared to the Khawarij who\ngives Takfir and they do have bloodshed.\" They are close in... the attributes of Allah\nAzza wa Jal - to the Mu'tazila. So they deny a lot of Allah's attributes. They have their own misinterpretation when\nit comes to the scale, and to the Sirāt and the things related to Yawm al-Qiyamah - The\nDay of Judgement. They also believe that, those who commit major\nsins are Kāfir, like the Khawarij, but they.. it is permissible to marry them. So they believe \"Who are not from the ibadiyyas\nlike us, they can marry from us and they can inherit from us. But we will be in hellfire forever.\" And.. they have so many weird things. They believe that the Qur'ān is created and\nit's not one of Allah's attributes. They believe that it is impossible to see\nAllah in paradise. So, it's a deviant cult and a lot of the Scholars\nsay that, \"You must not pray behind them\", as the prayer would not be accepted And Allah knows best.\""
