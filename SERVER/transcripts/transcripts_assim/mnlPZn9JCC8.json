  "transcript": "uh thank you adam for having me and i have a question maybe out of topic as a young person sometimes the spirit of learning religion and doing good is very high yet and however at some point this spirit suddenly dropped drastically we call it a procrastination i think and um uh please give your advice uh so that when this phase of the demoralization occurs we can continue to worship and avoid the disobedience thank you jesus [Music] this is human nature my friend adam we are humans and allah in the quran the prophet in the sunnah and all say that iman fluctuates it goes up and it goes down so one day you wake up in the morning feeling that oh i'm so full of iman i can conquer the whole world and one day you wake up and say i'm so full of bs i don't know if i'm a muslim or i'm not why is this because iman increases with good deeds and iman decreases with bad deeds and the muslims nowadays unfortunately are so into sins that they don't notice every one of us allah looks practicing you don't know what goes in his heart i do a lot of counseling alhamdulillah and i sit with muslims you'll be shocked when you see the amount of practicing muslims who watch pornography how is it possible you will be shocked to see the amount of practicing nikabi women who flirt with non-men in their workplace with their cousins and this shows you that the muslims have a big problem when they do not walk the talk they have a dual personality dr jekyll and mr hyde so now we are attending a lecture we are increasing our iman we're trying to get closer to allah after this one hour how do you feel oh bagos bhagos masha'allah very good i am alhamdulillah excellent what is the time oh now it's nine o'clock uh it's nine maybe ten in the evening okay we finished the lecture what should we do um let's watch netflix what oh no no no let's watch a soap opera maybe avengers what are you doing you were just close to allah he said come on this is part of the balance what are you crazy you didn't listen to the lecture you have to have one hour for allah one hour for shaytan and this is why we have a problem when i travel to kuala lumpur sometimes you know out of curiosity i turn on the tv and i see some variety shows and i was shocked once to see a woman from indonesia which is the land of my grandfather i'm from indonesia originally so i see a woman from indonesia wearing the full hijab masha'allah and carrying a guitar playing in front of a panel of men and singing and everybody's martial happy and what is this she's a hijabi woman singing and dancing in front of nan maha men where is islam no this is the balance sheikh no no this is not the balance this is the 72 sects unfortunately this is not the way of the prophet is this is not the way of the quran and the sunnah so your imbalance and feeling of iman and then going down wanting to learn the religion and to be a scholar in a day and all of a sudden you feel that you're a hypocrite this imbalance comes from sins when you don't have the right companions and most people i talk to who are seemingly practicing when you ask them do you have righteous friends says no who do you have he said well i listen to your lectures sheikh he said okay zakallah but my lectures are not enough i have to be with you we have to walk to the masjid together we have to sit half an hour and speak and check on you and see and hear from what you have to say and do so i can evaluate and say okay watch out i can sense that you have bad things growing in your heart but when you listen to my lectures or to someone else's lectures and after two three hours you gain knowledge but then spend another two or three hours watching youtube or instagram or snapchat or spend your time on twitter and social media your iman takes a plunge it dives down so you need to fix it nobody can fix it up for you no one can come and hold your hand and say like children come come i'll drag you with me you have to seek allah's help and you have to draw the line before it's too late and allah you"
