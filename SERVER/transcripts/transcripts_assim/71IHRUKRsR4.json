  "title": "Can I ask Allah to marry me to a righteous, beautiful and RICH Wife? Assim Al Hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Tea from UK. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. Brilliant. What it was, I wanted to know, I know we as men have to be the providers for females that we marry, Alhamdulillah. Say if we're not in a position to do that, we're trying to find employment but we fear the fitna of being single. Is it transgression? Is it allowed to make du'a to Allah to ask for say a righteous, beautiful, rich spouse or is that too far, going too far? Thank you. It is permissible to ask for such a spouse but whatever she gives you, whatever rent she pays, whatever food she buys, this is a debt upon you. Who would label himself as a real man and accept his wife to pay the rent or to do the groceries or to chip the expenses? I have so many counseling sessions with women who complain of being married to such, I wouldn't call men, I would call males because they're not men. To be an actual man, you have to be the guardian and the provider as per the ayah number 34 in Surat An-Nisa. Otherwise, you would be a gold digger. So instead of asking Allah for a rich, beautiful, righteous, pious woman, ask Allah to grant you a better job so that you become a real man and Allah Azzawajal knows best."
