  "transcript": "I've come to know there the marriage proposal with one boy and with the girl very near to me the boy 3 everything we read the proposed the girls part that is proposed the boy they said we have to perform the nikah as persona you know no party is nothing you have to pay ahead in advance all these things in a few 100% suna he agreed his father agreed everybody that they came down to see the girl mothers with the boy and sister they thinking that they will do the engagement the boy was on the impression that the mother will you know put the ring on the girls high so all of a sudden they were eating then all of a sudden they get up and polished this I will give you replied tomorrow when you call this would be obsequious tick we will go to our country and come back and let you know later on they they told my daughter wanted living near them does that be sorry we don't want you don't want a girl who do a job who do niqab we want a girl open with mix getting mixed gathering this thing ducting but the boy was sharp-eyed mother mother blackmailed the boy of her own sons either you choose the girl or me one of them the ball but the ball was very pious very religious he preferred district of one he was hunting long time he liked this girl everything but mother said no you choose the girl or boy mother is it ha or not what the mother has done okay any more questions barakallahu Yakima this is a common situation where the mother interferes in the selection of the spouse of her son Abu Yussef tells us about a scenario where the family of the boy come they come to see the girl and they were thinking that at least a pre-engagement would take place after this meeting but the mother and the boy left and then they traveled back to their country only to inform them that the mother did not like what she saw not in terms of beauty or the name of the family but rather because the girl was practicing and insisting on not having a mixed marriage and insisting not taking off her hijab in front of her in-laws who are not Maha so the mother rejected the proposal however the son whose righteous and practicing and following the Sunnah he's insisting on marrying the girl because she has what he likes she needs he needs a woman who understands his religious needs and has the same wavelength of his so he's insisting on that so the mother is telling him no problem choose between her and me so now the boy is asking what can I do well I hail Karim it is difficult to answer such a question because it's not one size that fits all it depends whether you are financially independent or not because if you're not this means that the woman you're going to marry must live with you in your parents house in a joint family as the case in the subcontinent which I am totally against and I have tons of emails of complaints and problems that usually end in divorce because of this men don't fear Allah so JAL forced their wives to live with his parents and serve them and serve his sisters and their families and the kids as if he's marrying a mate and then he complains that his wife wants a separate house it is her right in Islam okay in other religions maybe it's not her right but a Muslim in Euro Muslim this is his/her god-given right so if you're not financially independent you cannot marry someone that your mother is not on good terms with because you will be stuck between a rock and a hard place every single day in the morning and afternoon in the evening there will be fights and they will knock your head to the ground the mother and the wife she did this she did that she said this she said that and what will you do develop high cholesterol levels high blood pressure diabetes probably have angina and a heart attack and Allah knows what will happen to you at an early age so this is what's happening in most cases however if you are financially independent and seriously you found the woman that you would inshallah be happy with you as a man do not require the approval of your father and your mother I'm not encouraging you to disobey them but you are the one who's getting married not them so if your mom says I don't want you to marry her why I'm the one who's getting married I'm not going to make it marry your niece I'm not gonna marry your cousin or your relative I'm gonna marry the woman that I think that would make me happy and so many times the parents themselves are an obstacle a good boy a good girl they would make a good match the mother comes and says no no she's not she's not good for my my son the father says I need to interview the girl okay what do you mean you need to interview the girl your boy is a grown up he's a man till now you're interfering in his affairs he may not know how to select he is getting married not you she's not a muharram to you he's allowed in Islam to meet her and to talk to her you not yet they assist and so many good proposals are interrupted because of the interference of the parents so if you are the boy is financially independent be diplomatic be dutiful be obedient to your parents but marry the one you think is good if her parents are willing to accept and may Allah make it easy for all Muslims"
