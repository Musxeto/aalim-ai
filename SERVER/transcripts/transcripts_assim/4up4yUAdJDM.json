  "title": "How to keep my Iman high while living in non practicing country (feel weak at times) Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "yesterday actually i'm living in a non-practicing country here everything is like western culture i'm trying my level best to lower my gears and follow syria so sometimes there comes thoughts into my mind like how they are enjoying their lives and here i have red lines sometimes i become weak sometimes my iman is at peak and yes whenever i am asking you a question my iman gets boosted so i need your few advices and motivations so that i will be steadfast on my dean again and again and again brother faizan as we always reiterate this life is a test and each one of us is tested according to what is a test for him when a rich man is filthy rich seeing others being rich is not a test because he's already got everything when a healthy person is fit and strong seeing other sportsmen or athletes is not a test for him because he can compete with them the test is when you look up to that test and you feel tested so a person who's sick sees healthy people as a test for himself a person who's weak sees strong people as a test for himself a person who's poor sees anyone with little money or cash more privileged than himself and likewise when you have weak iman you are tempted by what other people may have and you don't and this is why allah strengthens our iman and the only way to strengthen your iman is by abiding by the quran is by following the sunnah is by remaining on the straight path allah azzawajal ordered his prophet so many places in the quran to remain steadfast on deen to lower his gaze and not to look at what allah has favored others with and the prophet did exactly that and that was the main reason for him to remain steadfast otherwise he would have gone astray and allah said that in the quran had it not been for our favor upon you in making you steadfast otherwise you would have probably leaned a bit towards them and allah told him don't send your gaze looking at what they possess in their hands what we have tested them with in this dunya and this is how a believer should be look at yourself falling into the swamps the swamps of sins is very easy everybody can sin do you think it's difficult to get a glass of intoxicants or a bottle and get wasted what does it cost you 50 100 150 dollars and you can get wasted and drunk like everybody else is it difficult to smoke a joint or to do crack or to take a shot of any type of haram drugs all of these things are possible but why don't we do it because we fear allah azza a woman wearing the hijab wearing the burkhor wearing the nikab covering her beauty she might be a bombshell she might be a knockout and everybody would praise her and gives her thumbs up for her looks and for her beauty and for charm but she does not do that why it's not difficult take it off but she's doing it for the sake of allah this is why allah commanded allah praised those who are patient in this dunya and told us that those who are patient will be rewarded without account on the day of judgment so remains that fast on islam trust allah azzawajal and be confident in what he had promised you and above all always choose your companions those whom you hang out with select the best of the best the righteous and practicing and you will be in safe hands in sha allah"
