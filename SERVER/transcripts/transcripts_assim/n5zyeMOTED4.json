  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] AC [Music] alhamdulillah so uh very important part of the chapter that deals with Purity is Purity itself and we mean by that Al now Abu linguistically it is stemmed from a word that deals with brightness of the face beauty cleanliness Etc but legis or let me rephrase that legislatively it deals with washing with water or using water to wash the four limbs mentioned in the Quran in chapter five and these are the face the arms wiping the head washing the feet to the ankles as we will come to mention inshallah in a specific fashion with the intention of worshiping Allah so doing it in that form without intention is invalid doing it in a different form with the intention of evolution is invalid as well what is the ruling of it it is a condition one of the conditions of prayer and the condition is the the thing that comes before a form of worship so I can perform wo but I may not pray my woodo is valid but if I pray without performing woodo my prayer is inval valid because the condition was not fulfilled and it is needed for such rituals such as prayer and there's a difference of opinion among among Juds and Scholars whether it is a condition and mandatory for people who are performing ta around the Kaa or holding a copy of the Quran Al mus it's an issue of dispute as we will come to learn inshallah Allah the almighty says in the Quran oh you who believe when you rise to perform prayer wash your face and your forearms to the elbows and wipe over your heads and wash your feet to the ankles and this is in chapter 5 verse number six Surah Al now in order for w to be valid these conditions are required number one Islam so if a non-muslim performs Wu it wouldn't be valid number two being of sound mind so if a person who's insane performs wo this doesn't count number three having reached the age of discernment meaning being able to recognize things yes you're not an adult but you're of an age of seven or eight years of age where you can differentiate between good and bad so that this would be a valid uh um W for you number four having intention someone who goes and comes out from the toilet and then finding his limbs wet and he did not have any intention of Performing wo but he did it automatically this is this doesn't count because the prophet saidat that Deeds or actions are but by intentions so if you don't have an attention this doesn't count for you number five one of the most important conditions is that the water you're performing woodoo with with must be pure so if the woodoo is NIS or there's an impurity you cannot perform woo with that and finally number six to remove anything that may prevent water from reaching the skin such as wax dough paint nail polish Etc now this brings us to a frequently asked questions do dye you know things that people dye their hair with creams or lotions do they prevent water from reaching the skin well we have to look if these things have a mass a physical Mass like something that constitutes a layer in this case this layer prevents the water from reaching the skin underneath it and this means that such a barrier invalidates the woodoo and hence you have to make sure that there is no such barrier on your limbs when making woodu a painter for example on his break he goes to perform wo and there are paint patches on his arm and we know that this this paint is a physical mass that prevents water from reaching his skin the wood would not be valid until he removes that layer remember there's a difference between a layer and a color so if I have a pen and I like do this this is a pen and if I do this I'm not going to do this so that my wife wouldn't question me why are you doing this like children but if if I just write a line on my hand would that line be a barrier for wo no because this is a color there is no Mass to it this is is different than when I have a a patch of paint or if if someone has nail polish or if there is um something else that prevents water from reaching uh underneath another benefit that we may need is Muslims sometimes after performing woodo they're hesitant from drying their limbs and they think that this is not permissible why because there's a Hadith where the mother of the Believers the wife of the Prophet said after the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam performed W I brought him a towel and he shook his hands like this and did not take it so some Scholars said that it's not permissible to dry your limbs with a towel but there is no evidence in this the prophet may have rejected the towel because he was hot he needed the water to cool down or because there there was something that he didn't disliked in the towel itself or for any other reason but there is nothing in Islam that prevents you or that inates that it's disliked to dry your limbs uh afterwards now um another uh important issue that we may need to point out to is that performing woodo is mandatory if you want to pray so this as a subse as a consequence means that to remove any thing that constitutes a barrier from for water to reach the limbs must be removed as well so if a person performed wood and after praying discovers that he has nail polish or that he has a barrier that prevented water from reaching his limbs it is not sufficient to shrug your shoulders and say okay I didn't know alhamdulillah my prayer is valid no because the condition of prayer which is performed bu was not fulfilled and this means that your prayer is invalid so you have to go and remove that barrier and go and renew your woodoo and pray once again so what's the ruling for a sister who puts on fake nails and she wants to pray and perform W can she do that first of all all the most authentic opinion is that wearing fake nails is not permissible because first it's fake and for fake people two it's changing the natural creation of Allah three we ordered to clip nails and you install and and and and put these fake nails doesn't make any sense so Scholars say that this is a n it's a barrier from uh uh for water from reaching your natural nails and hence the woodo would not be valid you have to remove them and perform W again and the same thing applies to wearing fake eyelashes the same reason in addition to it is Pro prohibited because the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam cursed those who wear hair extensions and this is part of hair extensions as well in addition to the fact that it is a barrier that prevents water from reaching the natural eyelashes alongside other uh uh reasons as well and nail polish with we've talked about that um what about if someone has hair implants someone who's bold and this is a defect so he has hair implants well he can wipe over his hair implant without any problem insh
