  "transcript": "last time we spoke about three ay that the author began chapter 1 with and now we move on to Ayah number four or the Lo the fourth location mentioned Allah Asel says worship Allah and join none with him in worship and this Ayah is inah it's a long ay where Allah talks about 10 different things commands that we must obey and do but what we are concerned most with is the beginning and the introduction of this Ayah Allah says worship Allah and join none with him in worship so this is a clear instruction do not associate others with Allah whether they are prophets and Messengers you must not worship them you must not call them you must not sacrifice for them whether they are peers or what they are they call aah whether they are places or different locations all of such associ ations with Allah is considered to be major sh it's considered to be associating others with Allah which nullifies a person Islam totally and the fifth location is a long Ayah which is actually three ayas and this is mentioned inah and again we will only mention the beginning of it and you can refer to it later on if you wish on your uh uh own time and paste Allah says say oh Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam come I will recite what your lord has prohibited you from so now Allah is telling commanding his Messenger to call the people that he will recite to them what Allah has prohibited upon them so what's the first thing that comes into our list the prophet Allah says join not anything in worship with him so the first thing Allah commands us to not do is to not join any thing or anyone in worship with Allah the almighty and the AY goes go go on and these ayats are 151 and 153 of chapter number six beautiful commands extremely important to the extent that the following Hadith with us was stated by Abdullah Mas we know abdah Mas is the companion of the prophet and he said may Allah be pleased with him whoever wishes to ass certain the very will of the Prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam on which the prophet has put his seal let him read the statement of Allah say oh Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam come I will recite what your lord has prohibited you from join not anything in worship with him up till and verily this is my Straight Path so now abdah may Allah be pleased with him tells us that this is the will of the Prophet that he has his seal on but actually the prophet did not leave such a willat and he did not have a seal on this is a form of emphasis put by Abdullah Mas to highlight that the message of the Prophet wasam was based on these commands not to worship any other than Allah and also to uh be dutiful to the parents and uh and to the rest of the a the instructions of the ayas that Allah mentioned and it is extremely um essential for us to learn about these things and to implement them and after that the compiler brought the of the Prophet the Hadith of mu which is one of the greatest Hadith in our religion because it highlights the rights of Allah upon us his servants and it also gives us a bonus that Allah only Asel made upon himself and that is the right of the servant over their lord though he is our lord and there are no rights for us none whatsoever but this is a bonus this is a favor and blessing from Allah that he bestowed upon us his poor slaves and servants what is the Hadith what is the rights this is inshallah what we will try to learn when we meet next time so until then I leave you bar"
