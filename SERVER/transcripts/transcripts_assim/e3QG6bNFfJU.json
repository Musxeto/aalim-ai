  "title": "Sinful for following ambiguous opinions (Hanafi contradictions with certain hadiths)? assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "Karram from Pakistan. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. As you guide people not to cherry pick but follow someone they trust. If a woman has access to limited scholars and she comes across a scholar originally from India, Kashmir, but residing in Saudi Arabia. Sheikh, he was a student of Sheikh Rabi Al-Mutkhali and been guiding this woman and knows her situation for a very long time. However, the problem is since the woman has read enough material on Islam QA and your videos too, some of the opinions seems too wrong to follow which deviates her trust. For example, he said if a person has anxiety with the crowded situation, we have gotten Hajj done on behalf of many people and this is doable. Plus, he thinks we cannot say that namaz offered at Hanafi, Zuhr time or Isha after midnight or without covering feet would be invalid. A person cannot be a hundred percent right but since these are major matters to be concerned about, would she be sinful if she knows she's following an ambiguous opinion she read something else about? First of all, this is an issue that a person has to be clear when looking into it. That is, a layman does not have the tools that enable him to distinguish whether this is right or wrong. This is why we say a layman must find a particular individual, preferably among those who can advise him, and give him live advice. If not, then among those who have passed away and they are trusted not to deviate because they're dead. And this individual is ordered to follow this person whom he trusts his knowledge, his religious commitment, his track record. Why do I say track record? Because there are so many scholars and students of knowledge and da'is who keep on flipping and changing all their colours and their affiliations according to the highest bid'r, may Allah protect us. And there are those who are consistent, who've always been saying the same things according to the Qur'an and the Sunnah. So their understanding is quite clear. If you find someone that falls under this category, you should follow them all the way. Now, if you come to find through crystal clear evidence that this particular thing that this scholar said is not correct, because no one is infallible, the Prophet ï·º is, but normal people are not. So you tend to follow the correct opinion and authentic opinion based on the Qur'an and Sunnah, despite the fact that this scholar you follow, or you've been following all the time, said otherwise. There's no problem in that because you're following the dalil. You're following what is authentic. And it's crystal clear that Allah will ask you about on the Day of Judgment. You're not ordered to follow this scholar blindly, and if he says, Simon says, throw yourself in the ocean and you do this. No, this is not Islam. You follow him within reason, as long as you still trust that his opinion is in accordance to the Qur'an and the Sunnah. But once you discover that it is not, then there's an obligation upon you to do follow the Qur'an and Sunnah, and I hope this answers your question. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days, and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
