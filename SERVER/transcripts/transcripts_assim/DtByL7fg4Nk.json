  "transcript": "[Music] part of the morning and evening something that is so easy yet so huge in reward the prophet Alam taught us to say Subhan Allah glory be to Allah and praise be to to him or as translated in some other books how perfect Allah is and I Praise Him 100 times it takes less than three minutes Subhan allaham Subhan allaham Subhan allaham yet the reward is so huge that Allah erases your sins even if they were as many as the foam of the ocean or the Seas it doesn't take much time but who Among Us is successful ful to be guided by Allah into saying it the following Hadith Hadith number 92 we've we've been through this Hadith but we have to read it to say none has the right to be worshiped except Allah alone without any partner to him belongs all sovereignty and praise and he is over all things omnipotent now to say it 10 times in the morning in the evening and the she says say it one time if you're lazy and this is not from the Hadith but generally speaking saying it once saying it 10 saying it 100 saying it a thousand it is for your own benefit as 93 illustrates and explains that saying the same Hadith we're not going to read it again but to say it a 100 times now if you manage to say it a 100 times in the morning in the evening Allah would raise you 100 levels in Jenna and he raised 100 sins and reward you 100 good deeds and that would be equivalent to freeing 10 slaves the reward of freeing setting free 10 slaves who doesn't want this reward yeah it's going to take you like 7 Minutes 6 minutes but then what all the blessing would be in your day all the reward would be restored for you on the day of judgment there will be Baraka in your life if you only believe and this is our problem people if you tell them invest this amount of money you'll get this much return they will go for it but if you tell them invest few minutes in doing Vick in the morning and the evening I'm I'm I'm sleepy I have work to do I have to study I have to do this and that and Subhan Allah the only one laughing is Satan when you follow his instructions and obey his orders part of the beautiful duas that the prophet taught usat and this Hadith the following Hadith which is 94 was narrated by mother people say what her name is j one of the beautiful names and by the way this name was chosen by the prophet because her original name was B the righteous one and the prophet used to change names that had self-praise in them so he changed her name from to and one of my daughters' name is j and whenever I tell people that her name is j as when registering or going to the hospital people say why why so horrible name because they don't know that this is the mother of the Believers the wife of the Prophet The Prophet went to fer prayer early and came after the sun had risen while mother Jia was on her position making Vick so approximately an hour and a half maybe a little bit less so when the prophet entered the house he said I said a number of phrases a number of words that are more in the weight of the scale than what all what you have said while sitting this hour and a half what was these words the prophet taught us to say in the morning sub how perfect Allah is and I praise him by the number of his creation and his pleasure and by the weight of his throne and the ink of his words and the Sunnah is to say these phrases or words three times in the morning not in the evening and it's an issue of dispute but this is the most authentic opinion so imagine this is number this is description this is weight the ink of his words which has no end this incubates all of the previous three saying this is a form of exaggeration meaning that I'm saying how perfect Allah is I'm saying glorify be Allah and praise be to him without an end because the number of his creation is not known to us the pleasure of himself is endless the weight of his throne is beyond beyond our imagination and the ink that is used to write his instruction and commands and orders are endless so I am praising Allah I'm glorifying Allah to that extent also in the morning there's a beautiful Dua and we've been through this so I'm not going to repeat it again Allah the prophet saidat oh Allah I ask you for knowledge which is beneficial and sustenance which is good and deeds which are accept acceptable and we say this in the morning as part of thear notice this is the first thing I do in the beginning of my day I don't go to the gym I don't spend time preparing for work etc I mentally prepare my soul for all what that it needs in all what it needs trust confidence Reliance in Allah the almighty to express my poverty to Allah the almighty to seek his help and guidance and this is your road map throughout your whole entire life not only in the beginning of the day but throughout your whole entire life m [Music]"
