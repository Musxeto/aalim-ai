  "title": "When my parents do something wrong I go & research about it to give them dawah, is this ocd? #assim",
  "transcript": "um I wanted to ask um is it okay um for me to um for example I see my family um do things that there's some doubt in it and they are negligent about it but then I go and research about it or ask you and come back with an answer is that okay for me to do that's OCD no it's see o c d is when you keep on derailing yourself from the straight path due to these Whispers and thoughts if you see your family doing something wrong and you research it not to police them or supervise them rather to give them what gets them closer to Allah and you present this to them in a diplomatic and kind and respectful way this is not not part of your OCD this is a good thing to do I always see things that I don't have knowledge of I research it I look into it I ask Scholars and I learn about it and then share it with others but the issue is you always judge your actions and what you say by the consequences so if I before saying something or doing something if I anticipate that if I say or or do this thing it would cause more harm than good I refrain but if I feel that they're fine with it they'll accept it they're they'll even ask questions and I attribute what I'm saying to them to a scholar to a to a book of to Islam Q&A and show them the evidence and I know that they're fine with it then you should go ahead and do it and Allah Knows Best"
