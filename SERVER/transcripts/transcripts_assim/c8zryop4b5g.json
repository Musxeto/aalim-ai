  "title": "Are we to assume only bad people die in all calamities due to a Hadith I heard",
  "transcript": "uh wasim from india uh i think i have very quick uh questions like uh i heard somewhere like i did read but i'm not finding the exact reference but there's a uh what i read was uh before a calamity uh in two angels came to maybe uh the wife of uh ibrahim alaihissalam maybe they informed there's gonna be a calamity i don't know the prophet or the messenger but i heard this uh there will be a and the the wife said like uh my son is in that place but uh and the angel said that he has been informed something like that so my question is before a telemetry uh are we to assume that all the when calamity happens only bad people die but nowadays we see a lot of tsunamis earthquakes and even bomb blast even innocent style so when a calamity occurs in those instances all the people died who were bad but in in our time a lot of good people also died waseem from india he says there's a hadith where he doesn't know where he read it or who it was about how would i know i've never heard of a hadith where two angels come to a why a prophet's wife telling her about a punishment or wrath of allah to fall on an area and she says my son is there and they say we have told him there is nothing as such to my knowledge so it's not any uh related to go and and talk about the rest of the question"
