  "transcript": "second question which is about said far I am upon your pledge and promise that I promise not to send and to fulfill my dues and obligations to the best of my ability this is not an oath this is saying that I am doing my level best to the best of my ability it's like saying wallahi I will not do this insha Allah so saying insha Allah means that you're not obliged to fulfill such an oath because you made a condition and saying to the best of my ability is also stating a similar condition Knows Best"
