  "transcript": "to grant him a job now he has a job but he's lagging in prayer so what to do this is your tester every one of us has his own test your test is would you prioritize your islam over your job or the opposite most likely there is no conflict between your job and islam the conflict is in here when you're secure when you have a paycheck at the end of the month when you don't have to worry about paying the rent and about borrowing money this is when shaytan overwhelms you with thinking that i'm rich i'm independent i don't need anybody but when you were poor and needy and jobless you needed allah so you went running to him praying invoking praying on time having your heart filled with iman this is an indication that you've lost and that you have failed your test you are in great danger what to do go to your job but prioritize your prayers your atkar your quran your dua and let it always come first and everything else come comes afterwards"
