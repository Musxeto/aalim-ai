  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Greece basically I have a question so whenever I see \nlike someone let's say I see a very beautiful   car on the streets but and I don't say I don't \nwant to say mashallah because that person like   he doesn't he doesn't have a beard you know \nhe's doing maybe he's putting music out loud   he's blasting it so I don't know if I should say \nmashallah on the car because maybe it might be   insulting to Allah I don't know you know okay \nso what [ __ ]is asking if there is something   that I like should I say Allahuma baarik though \nthat person might be indulging in different   types of sins the answer is of course you're not \nsaying Allahuma Baarik to him blasting the music   or shaving the beard or being with a gorgeous uh \na non hijabi woman or being this or that you're   saying Allahuma Baarik to a car so this is by \nitself to protect and block your evil eye from   affecting it his sins are his own business \nit's none of my business and the concept of   trying to filter people and to label them and \nto classify them whether they're righteous no   they're bad they're sinful they're Hypocrites \nthey're non-muslims they're Muslims before doing   such things is not a the right way of living \nand dealing with others and Allah Knows Best and have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford it \nthat's good for you if you cannot you're entitled   for one free session and this is for everybody \nif they can affirm by Allah that they cannot   afford it because they're poor I'll give them \none free session without a problem a full half   an hour so come to me and let's speak about \nit inshallah within the following two days   or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for All"
