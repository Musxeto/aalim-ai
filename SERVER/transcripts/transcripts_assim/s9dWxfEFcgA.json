  "transcript": "going back to beer not all beer is haram so we have beer that is prohibited and they have beer that is hella how do we judge we do that through the end result if we have a beer that is called non-alcoholic and it has 0.3 or 0.5% alcohol in it doctors and professionals say that if you consume a six-pack it would not intoxicate you hence it is holid because the profit gave us the parameters Ali Saleh - Salam of what is halal and what is Haram when he said in an authentic hadith whatever intoxicates in large quantities then little of it is Harlan so if someone drinks a glass of champagne and he's not intoxicated he does not have the right to say it's halal for me I'm just a social drinker they were throwing a toast so I just drank half a glass and it did not intoxicating said okey if you drag a few drank or if you were to drink a large quantities of it like 5 or 6 glasses would you become intoxicated definitely I'd become wasted in this case a drop of it one single drop is haram for you this is the measurement tool that the Prophet gave us a taste Allah - Salam"
