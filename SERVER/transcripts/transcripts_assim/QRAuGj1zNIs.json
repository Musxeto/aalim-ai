  "transcript": "ordin from the uk he says if a person commits the act of apostasy through abandoning prayer how can he come back to islam if he does not have the remorse well if he accepts islam again and becomes a muslim and praise what was before is gone because he now has started a new chapter by accepting islam and praying so the remorse over his kuffar has nothing to do with accepting islam nevertheless abandoning prayer as we've stated over and over again is not an act of apostasy generally speaking unless a person practically refuses to pray not a single sajdah even when threatened by the muslim ruler or by the muslim judge to be executed after being imprisoned and he's still adamant defiant not willing to budge and he says i'm not going to pray i believe in the prayer but i'm not going to pray this person if he reaches that level and then he's executed he is a kafir he's not washed nor shrouded nor buried like muslims he's thrown in a pit and buried as a kafir cannot be inherited but when we talk about general concept of an individual that we know see when we talk generally we say yes whoever abandons prayer is kafir but when we want to pinpoint a person this particular individual who doesn't pray in front of us we cannot say that he's a kafir because there are conditions to be fulfilled maybe he prays when we don't see him maybe he prays on and off maybe he has a misinterpretation that he has in his mind thinking that it is not mandatory to pray you never know so we don't go and make someone kafir individually specific person without fulfilling the conditions and this is usually done by scholars or by the muslim imam that is the muslim judge the ruler now having said that it is not at all appropriate to label people for us but i'm assuming this is a general question what is the role of remorse in accept accepting the repentance it is a major role without remorse your repentance is not accepted so if a person apostatized and he went or came back to islam he doesn't require remorse because he was a kafir all what he requires is to embrace islam and start fresh and all these years that have passed him without the remorse they are not counted but if he committed a sin he's been fornicating for a couple of years and now he repented and now he's married and he's happily married he goes to work but he doesn't find the remorse over the two years of fornication his repentance is not accepted in the sense that he will be held accountable for it until he gets this burning feeling in his heart the fear of allah azza and of his torment over that heinous sins that he had committed if he cannot find it i feel sorry for him and he'll feel sorry later on down the line he has to plant it he has to fake it until it becomes real and allah knows best"
