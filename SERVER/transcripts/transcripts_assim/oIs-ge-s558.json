  "transcript": "there is a beautiful hadith and in this hadith there are so many benefits we can obtain but we don't have enough time okay try your best trade I'll do that don't rush me I'm too old I can do it so fast inaudible cosine and the hadith is in sahih al-bukhari he says that the people of Yemen came to the prophet alayhi salat wa salam accepting Islam and the Prophet praised them complimented them and said to them that i give you the glad tidings of allah's forgiveness so they said ok prophet of allah we accepted but we have a question how did this thing begin look at this question the arabs speak few words but to the point how did this thing begin life universe earth heavens so many things around us beyond our understanding how did it all begin now the prophet alayhi salatu salam is the one authorized to answer so he did not tell them you should not ask such questions fear Allah because he's the one who gives answers so he says to them there was nothing but Allah and his throne was over the water and he wrote everything in the book and created the heavens and the earth . now this hadith tells you about the origin of everything all humans animals insects birds living creatures everything in this universe acknowledge that there is only one allah la ilaha illa huwa god they call him God though God is not a Las name we do not usually as Muslims you god but we say it because maybe none Muslims would listen and they said what is Allah so everything acknowledges the existence of Allah has the origin and this is the challenge that Allah gives to atheists when you see an atheist he would say there's no God ok fair enough let's look at you Allah says in the Quran or were they created by nothing or were they the creation of themselves you are one of two either vacuum created you you were nothing and boom you exist or you created yourself which one is it any atheist would say hmmm vacuum cannot create so no vacuum cannot create and I did not create myself so I'm in a dilemma now what is the answer it is a large the Virgin who created us this hadith tells you there was nothing but Allah in another another authentic narration there was nothing before Allah in another narration there was nothing with Allah so the only thing that is independent the only thing that can exist by itself is Allah the Almighty"
