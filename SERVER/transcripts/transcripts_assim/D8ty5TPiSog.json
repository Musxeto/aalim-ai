  "transcript": "Abdul Kareem from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa'alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. How are you doing Sheikh? Doing well. Sheikh, I asked, I talked to you a couple of weeks ago about a business I was starting on a cleaning business but I didn't, was not clear enough, sorry about that. Basically I'm not doing cleaning, I'm hiring like a different company, like a contractor who I don't have no control over except by giving them a job to clean. But is, am I sinful if they end up being halal with someone and I don't know about it? Is that, is that sinful? No, it's not sinful. As long as the scope of work is halal, then you're not sinful for the little details. And by the way, you're not sinful if all of them were clean-shaven. This is their sin and their mistake. It has nothing to do with their work."
