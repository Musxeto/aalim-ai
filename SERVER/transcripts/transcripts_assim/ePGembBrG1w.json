  "transcript": "retirement and i gave it to the bank and every month i am getting money from it is it halal what do you mean by taking money from the bank do you mean that no not from bank i mean from the company of retirement okay so you're talking about provident funds after retirement so yes profit did they take from your salary a portion of it or it's just a bonus gift yes it's a bonus i get money from company after retirement and i gave to a bank and now i am getting every month why do you give the bank profit so you are investing and depositing in fixed uh time the time deposit uh account so that you generate uh profit yes okay i will answer inshallah uh abdullah from pakistan he asked a question about a provident fund or retirement fund so his question was a little bit ambiguous but at the end of the day the result is clear whether the company gives you retirement money or gives you end of service indemnity or gives you a bonus a lump sum bonus regardless where this money came from if you take it and deposit it in a bank and the bank generates profit to you this is riba as long as the bank is a interest-based bank a conventional bank so you put in the time deposit or fixed deposit um account for six months or one year and it generates percent or ten percent and mashallah this is easy money i have my capital stored there's no pr a possibility of losing and they generate this riba this is totally prohibited it's riba if it's an islamic bank a real practicing islamic bank with a sharia board that overlooks the transactions of the bank not a sharia board that meets once every two weeks for a couple of hours and they signed resolutions and they leave without knowing whether this is implemented or not and they come at the end of the year and take a million or two as bonus from the bank no this is not a real proper islamic back there has to be a department that follows these resolutions and ensure implementing them in the transactions of the back if this is the case then yes putting your money for them to invest and give you return which is not fixed it's not a fixed amount of dollars or euros that they're giving you every month rather it fluctuates according to the profits and there is a possibility of losing though it's very rare there's no problem in that and this is halal"
