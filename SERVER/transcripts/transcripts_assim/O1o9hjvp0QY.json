  "transcript": "Muhammad from Malaysia Hello Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaikumussalam How are you? Alhamdulillah First of all, I am your biggest air conditioner Masha Allah, may Allah promote you to a central air conditioner Shukran Jazila for having me today May Allah bless you for all your good deeds And may Allah give you the highest level of Jannah Ameen, and you as well What can I do for you? If we don't, does the prayer invalid?
