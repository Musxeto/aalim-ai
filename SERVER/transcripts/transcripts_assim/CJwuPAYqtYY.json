  "title": "Burning chilli to ward off evil eye, Sacrificing animal at doorstep when entering new house, shirk?",
  "transcript": "so uh the burning of chilies to remove evil eye if is halal or Haram or is it sh and some people hang aloe vera and many other things to protect protect them from black magic and everything else so is believing in this sh or is anything no doing of such kind sh burning of chili or spreading salt and black pepper and Curry spices to word of Jin or evil eye or black magic all of this is nonsense it is not mentioned in the Quran it is not mentioned in the authentic Sunnah of the Prophet Alam and none of the companions had done this so such a practice in my own view acts as a person believes in superstitions and not only that it acts as if they are offering sacrifice to the Jin maybe the Jin love Chili's and they like it burnt I don't know so there is no point in burning it or using mustard gas or the likes toward of Jin because we have no evidence or proof neither from the Quran nor from the Sunnah that this is an effective way of a legitimate way to ward off Jin and black magic hence it is an innovation it's part of the Superstition and if it is made as a form of sacrifice then it's shik as in some places when they build a new house before they enter it they slaughter a sheep or a goat at the doorsteps and they put the blood on the doorsteps seeking Barak this is a sacrifice to the Jin so that they would not haunt their house and cause any problems for them and this is sh may Allah protect us all"
