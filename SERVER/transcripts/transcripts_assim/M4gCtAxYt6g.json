  "transcript": "Amirul from Malaysia Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Ya Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh How are you Sheikh? I'm fine Alhamdulillah Mashallah Sheikh, there is a hadith in Sunan Abu Dawud where it says that Oh Amrah, I indeed I ask you for your love and the love of those who you love and for the action that will cause me to attain your love Oh Amrah, make your love more beloved to me than myself my family and cold water Can you explain what it means by cold water? Baha'u'llah Wafeequm Wafeequm Barakallah Cold water is something that people enjoy in hot weather even in normal weather and the opposite of cold water is hot water so when you're thirsty and someone presents you with something that's hot you don't feel that this is the best thing to consume but you would love to drink a cold drink and cold water is the best to quench your thirst so this is what is meant by the hadith and Allah knows best For more information visit www.fema.org"
