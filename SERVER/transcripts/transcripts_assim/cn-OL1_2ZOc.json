  "transcript": "Khan from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh When we say there is a Ijma' what does it mean? Does it include only Ahlul Sunnah or also the Ahlul Bidah and maybe the Shia? Okay Jazak Allah Khair Wa Jazakum Ijma' is consensus which means the agreement of all Muslims whose Ijma' counts in a specific period of time it can continue and it can be discontinued it doesn't matter as long as in one era all the Muslims for example at the time of the companions if all the companions agreed upon something and later on in the Tabi'een era or afterwards hundreds of years they differed it doesn't matter the Ijma' was conducted and complete at that particular period whose Ijma' counts are those who are part of Ahlul Sunnah wal Jama'ah and all other sects are not included so we can't include Al-Mu'tazila or Al-Khawarij or Al-Jahmiya we can't include the Rafida or the Shia because they don't count and their opinion has no weight in the Ijma' which was mentioned in a number of places in the Qur'an in the Sunnah as in Surah An-Nisa Allah mentioned that he follows he goes against the Sunnah and he follows other than the way of the believers so the believers here is referring to Ahlul Sunnah wal Jama'ah not necessarily to be 100 percent following the Salafi or Al-Hadith although they can be Hanafi they can be Shafi'i they can be Maliki what counts is the Aqeedah that their Aqeedah is according to Ahlul Sunnah wal Jama'ah and they do not follow the deviant Aqeedahs of other sects and Allah Azzawajal knows best. you"
