  "transcript": "hey while we're alive and well going to schools and to to work and to places of interest to us when we fly we have to have the fear a little bit more than the hope why they say because it's human nature that we feel lured and tempted in this life so if you have more hope in a las forgiveness you will do more since isn't that true I've prayed five prayers yesterday al hamd allah and allah forgives from one prayer to the other this means my ability to do sin is great I think I can do this when I'm a chrome bruh I'm close to Makkah when I make on where I come back what is the first thing I do I pray to Allah aerial tour occurs because I'm a good believer in my records are clean no I turn on the TV and watch a soap opera or a movie why my records are clean so I am starting all over I think I can afford to sin a little bit this is how Shaitaan comes to you this is exactly how Shaitaan comes you after a form of worship he tells you I'm denier a great man sin and that is why scholars say maybe a sin would make you enter paradise while a good deed would make you go to hell how is that they said a good deed would make you feel proud of yourself and would give you confidence that alhamdulillah Emma practicing Muslim Allah loves me which entitles me to do since or at least to feel arrogant over others yeah you're not like me I'm chef what are you I'm a scholar amadai I'm a person of knowledge all of you are doing nothing your aunt's this good deed made me go to hell because of what's in my heart while that person who sinned he in the sin and after making this thing Yasuo more what have I done and he starts to repent ask Allah for forgiveness and feel remorse it's not enough I have to do more so he prays night prayer no no it's not enough i have to recite the Quran I have to go for ombres I have to participate in that way I have to give leaflets I have to do this so he keeps on doing good deeds because of that sin and he ends up where the highest levels of paradise because of a sin so always have your trust in Allah soldier always be positive but when you're alive now always be afraid when you are on your dying bed your fear should be much much less but your hope in unless forgiveness in a las mercy much be overwhelming because this is the time for thinking well of a larger and testing Allah Subhanahu what I as the Prophet says no one should die except thinking the best of Allah as they were gentlemen ok now I thought I don't know if you're going to benefit from this or not just for the sake of argument what's the ruling on seeking medicine seeking a healing for one of our illnesses is it mandatory is it permissible is it something up to you to do or not what do you think it is sooner always no one would say mandatory always know what is it permissible no so handle whatever you ask a question say it's an issue of dispute among scholars call us any time someone asks you a question say ok it's an issue of disputed scholars and you're saying that I think it's correct but seriously speaking what is the ruling on me taking the medicine when I feel sick scholars say that if taking this medicine if not if not taking this medicine means i'm going to die because one hundred percent the medication cures my illness and I don't take it I'm sinful so first of all if you have one hundred percent confidence that it would cure your illness with the grace of Allah of course or you have ninety percent confidence so it's most likely you must take the medication it's a must the Prophet says Alison today without a la seek healing and medication and treatment for your illness this is an instruction scholars say that if taking this medication most likely would cure my illness but my illness is not fatal is not something that's going to kill me so if I don't take it I'm not going to die but if I take it it's going to cure my illness so if I leave it then it is highly recommended that you take it it's not mandatory I've mentioned how many points to first one if I take it I'm going to get better if I don't I'm going to die what's the rolling you must it's mandatory to if I take it I'm going to get better if I don't I'm not going to die it is recommended to take it it's highly recommended to take it but if you don't take it you're not sinful yes I don't want to get healing the third is when it's equal there is a possibility that if I take it I'm going to get better but it's not a hundred percent it's 5050 like most of surgeries today if you let the doctor tell you well I you have a 50-50 success what would you do scholars say it is best for you not to take it but unfortunately because we love this dunya if the doctor tells us that there is a ten percent success rate we're going we take it ok there is ninety percent risk of not being successful so I have to get better I have to go back to my sports I have to go back to my family so this now you know you know the percentage likewise you can apply this to cancer patients you can apply this to heart disease patients some of them they tell you a lie okay we have a procedure we would put something in your artery and you would feel good how what's the success rate it's a it's ninety percent okay you have to do this but sometimes the doctor says we have to have an open heart surgery and we have to change for arteries for you and malaya the success rate is yanny fifty percent sixty percent don't do it and I am shocked when I see people who are in their 80s and they're undergoing heart surgery how long you want to live seriously come on eight years old tell us get ready get your rug prayer rug and pray on and sit on it until death comes to you you're dying not that I'm telling you don't live no live but live with the vision that you're going to die any second now don't live forever and I'm not saying that people should want to die now the longer you live the higher you go in Paradise ishalla imagine I am a very optimistic person but I do not cherish living a lot and I've lived a long life much alive enjoyed every single day of it I don't have any other desires to come a las am told but I'm very positive yet something to remind you of the value of living on earth Paul had nobody lemme allah be pleased with him do you not have nabila I've raise your hands has anybody heard of talha one two three four okay we have people enthusiastic you I think I did okay I'm not going to ask any questions well have nobody lays one of the ten heaven bound of the Prophet Aristotle sinem he said and the authentic hadith that two men came from a village called Bella it's in Harrison close to her about Iran Afghanistan in the region and they embraced Islam they were brothers and they went for jihad one of them was martyred he died in the cause of Allah and his brother lived after him for a whole year in medina and then he died talha says I saw in a vision I was dreaming I was asleep and I saw in my dream that the three of us these two men and myself were at the gates of paradise and the gates of paradise were opened and someone came and said you come in and the one who died last but the martyr was admitted first and after a while the gates of paradise were opened and they admitted the second one the martyr and he said I wanted to go in before it was too late and they said no no no it's not your time yet and he woke up so he spoke to the people they said well I ahi yesterday I saw this in this and the people were astonished and they started speaking and this reached the Prophet Alice for some so the Prophet gathered them said what's wrong with you prophet of allah he was martyred he was Shaheed and yet the guy who died on his bed a year after was admitted to paradise before him how is that he said the prophetess m Subhan Allah he died one year afterwards how many prostrations did he offer how many times he prayed how many days he fasted how many money how much money did he spend in the cause of allah by allah what's between him and the martyr in paradise as the distance between the heavens and the earth so this is an encouragement for you to live more because the more you live the more good deeds you do yeah imagine how many times you say in the days of Hanuman ham de la barra la la la how to put a level up how many times and you've got palm trees planted the more you say this you got bricks of silver and gold you've got this and this in paradise all waiting for you well someone who's your brother who's your friend who died 20 years ago is deprived of this so I'm not asking you to have a death wish no I'm just telling you to look at your life evaluate it value it and utilize it to what benefits you before we continue now we've said about 12 1 which is trusting a lot so agile and having a positive way of thinking and number two also we spoke about being balanced between fear and hope the Prophet Ali salatu salam visited a man from Ansar and he asked him and this is a frequent habit of the Prophet Adam and we will come to this later on a sharma he asked him how do you find yourself when you go to visit someone who's sick what would his answer be the majority well I have got this pain in my left part of the stomach and my body's aching and I have a headache I can't see properly and the wife is nagging and the money is short and might be fired from my job and the car is not working properly and subhanAllah most of the muslims are like this do you know sure that an idea will add yet you Bob how you all know it in it there is a verse in in sauna you're up be he like a nude what is the meaning of Knut anyone okay even though doesn't notice by the way kanode means the man who only notices the bad things and neglects the blessing in the good things Knut and this is a feature greatly noticed in women nevertheless men have a great portion of it yet the prophetess Sam singled out this feature in women saying that this admits them to hell more than anyone else because they should be grateful to their husbands unfortunately they're not they're always complaining and whenever they see they see something wrong they say we have never seen anything good from you are women like this those who have their wives with them add hazard they would not know you don't know you know unfortunately as a husband than a man myself I tell you we also have this but Allah as I jail made the punishment on women more than on us because we have more reasons for being punished other than this women there this is there a job description it's very little but our responsibilities as an HR I'm speaking again as an HR as the responsibilities as accountability we have so much so many other things that this is negligible compared to the other in the lasagna the rugby he like a nude Muslims now would you ask someone how are you or what you hear is complaining okay well i i'm i'm having my doubts about my job they might sack me the car is not working i'm unable to pay the storms of the house and of the furniture honor the car and the wife is nagging the kids are spoiled and the daughter I don't know what's wrong with her my mother always hates me and she prefers my brother's over me but hamdillah have dinner for you haven't left anything I you haven't left anything and then you say hamdillah so we have a big problem that has to be addressed and that is that we should always be grateful this man the Prophet visited him at a salsa how do you find yourself What did he say he did not complain of his illnesses he said o prophet of Allah I fear my sins and I hope in or I have a great hope in Allah's mercy this is how i feel myself and he's on his dying bed and the Prophet said I sent by Allah in this situation these two feelings whenever they are in the heart of a believer in the heart of the Muslim Allah would give him what he hopes for and would protect him from what he fears and may Allah's I shall give us what we hope for and protects us from what we fear subhanAllah on the dying bed these are the true moments that reveal what's in your heart Colossus over game is over for now and this what shows on what you say and no matter how bad you feel no matter how painful your calamity or your illness is you must not ever wish for death because this is not permissible to ask Allah to make your day I know a lot of Muslims do like this I know a lot of women unfortunately in my family they don't know English that good so I can speak freely I have relatives of my women old when they are frustrated with their children children what would they say may Allah make me die miyama kill me a key or the octave what are you doing and when they come down she's known I was just something I say on the tongue alonzo gel has times during the day would where he would respond to your supplication beware the Prophet says do not supplicate against yourself your family your wealth your servants because there is a time when you supplicate and Allah would answer this and this is tested we have one of the days in Saudi his name is Abdullah ban Emma have you ever heard of him this guy is telling hit us his story he said I used to skip school with my friends and go to a swimming pool go to you know a place where we gathered the guys only and play and have a smoke eat and my father used to smell my my my clothes and find smoke cigarettes so he told me do not smoke and he forbade me from smoking I was 16 17 years old and once out of the blue I was smoking and he saw me and he said may Allah break her neck this is any normal in Saudi in Arabs I like selig of attack well normal he said on that day I went with my friends to a swimming pool and I jumped to the swimming pool to swim like usual I didn't know that the water was very low and I hit my head in the pavement and it broke my neck and since that day he's paralyzed neck down until today he is a die he goes in his wheelchair unable to do anything except moving his head talking he goes to masjid and goes to places because of what of course his father afterwards cried endless nights but it's gone you were ready set it and it's recorded and that is why Allah tells us the Prophet tells us that some whenever you pray night prayer pray as long as you're awake if you feel sleepy immediately stop and go to bed why he said because there is a possibility that you want to go to supplicate for yourself ask Allah for forgiveness and because of your sleepiness you curse yourself instead and it would be recorded you said it in it will be recorded so the Prophet tells us do not wish for death no matter how bad it is and if you must supplicate then you say oh Allah keep me alive as long as living is best for me and take my life if death is better for me are we done and clear with this inshallah okay are you feeling asleep you're sure well I'm feeling see right number four for a personalized dying bed you're dying even if you feel sick or ill and people people are visiting you you should be afraid that you may die so the first thing that you have to among the first things that you have to do is to give the rights back to its lawful owners and we have a lot of rights upon us one simple example do you know I don't know the atoms have this a lot I don't know about the nun Arabs when you marry someone you give her the dowry right I know in India day take the dowry from them it's very lucrative to be a man in India but it's haram you're not allowed as a Muslim to take a penny from your wife yeah he be a man do be a mean seriously if she is giving me money who's the man so this is not our topic in Arabia we have the dowry that a man gives to his wife sometimes we give a small portion and write in the contract that there is a bulkier portion to be given later on this is that this is not related to divorce a lot of people think that yes this that the balance I have to pay if I divorce her if I don't know this is her god-given right you have to give her the full amount so a lot of the people neglect this not knowing that because it said that the wife has to pay the cat over this every single year so if it's a 50,000 derham written in the contract to be paid later every year she has to give 2.5% over this 50,000 dirham why because said that he has to pay it for you if he's refusing it's a different issue we're not going to go into zaka issue maybe in the Q&A if you wish I could create this a little bit but there are lots of rights upon us that we don't give to people I'm renting in a house it's been six years I haven't gave given the landowner owner his money y-yeah sure he's kind in its okay its okay i buy six cards as a Saudi I by six cards from different car dealers in installments I take the cards and I sell them in cash and those agencies coming to claim their monies in allocating I'm a Saudi don't assume if you can and it goes in courts and so on so if you're dying these are rights and you have to give these rights back to their lawful owners not only that the Prophet tells us that is some that whenever there is something between you and your brother you have to clarify it in this life you have to clean it in this life so if I've back bitten you well he this brother of ours is is very fact why doesn't he do diet he's very short what does it people do pull-ups or something maybe he gets toe and this woman is so ugly look at her makeup she looks like Barbie on that guy is doing this backbiting so the Prophet tells us that if there's anything wrong between me and my brother I have to clean it in this life why because on the day of judgment there is no dear ham there's no real but I did they're having dinner but there I'm here so it's only good deeds and bad deeds and the Prophet says I had ruin a man emu Fliss do you know who is the one who does not have a penny the book they said a man who does not have money didn't know and much less is the one who comes on the day of judgment with prayer fasting and charity but in this life he has bitten he has not bitten beaten this person he has taken this person's money he has a back bitten someone he has shed the blood of someone else so on the day of judgment Alonzo Gee would take from his good deeds and give to each one who him whom he has transgressed against and if his good deeds are finished but he still has a lot of balance he would take from their bad deeds and they would put on him and he would be thrown on help so the prophet alayhi salatu salam instructs us to clean our account in this life before it is too late number 5 if I'm on my dying bed I have to prepare my will and actually my will should have been prepared long before the prophet alayhi salatu salam ads in the hadith of a banal or may allah be pleased with him said it is one of the obligations upon a muslim not to have two nights pass over him without his will written down by his head even our mark may allah be pleased with the man with his father he said that not a single night passed since i had heard this hadith without having my will ready one would say if he I don't have anything what should I do in my will well the writing of a will is complicated because your will has to have all the lights your rights upon people and their rights upon you so if I would like to write my will today what would i say i gave brother abdullah fifty thousand dirhams to work in business with to invest nobody from my family usually meant don't tell their wives anything especially about financial stuff and this is a good advice yeah they don't tell your wife anything about your finance whatever she needs you give her but don't tell her about your income don't tell her about your savings don't tell her about anything and she also must not tell her husband about this i have gazillion phone calls from men and from women in Saudi about this problem men abusing their wives taking their money building houses with their income with their income and with their savings and after the house is finished it is mine in my name I get married again this happens this is the normal scenario and likewise the women when they know that the husband earns so much and much out of their interest and love to their husbands they want more so I need to change the furniture I need to go to Geneva for two-week summer vacation I need to change the car I need some jewelry I have a wedding to attend a need a dress I need this or that so it's always best to leave the finance separate so that Shaitaan would not come in now have the life you and your wife are on common terms and you are very well together it's a different story I'm talking about generally speaking so that Shaitaan would not come in your will has to display these rights after your death so you would write I have 50,000 with Mohamed he's investing it I took 10,000 from my mother and my friend gave me 70,000 I'm paying two thousand every month as in installments I have the car I have this so all financial aspects should be covered now put it in an envelope seal it put it in a safe place so that no one would find it however if you change your will you must write that this will erase is whatever comes before it because it's out of practice people come to us when their loved one has died with three wheels with his signature each one contradicting the other is there is no date so one says do this and that's it don't do this it's I said well if you want do it if you want don't want don't do it which one to choose to you always whenever you write a will let it state that this abrogates whatever came before it and always clear that the date of the will and you are allowed financially to write a will of one-third of your wealth anymore no any less preferably sad whenever Kozma will be pleased with him when he was ill and he had one daughter so the Prophet came to visit him and he thought that he's going to die but of course we know that he did not die and he lived after the Prophet Alice awesome so he said no prophet of allah i have only one daughter I don't have any offspring I don't have any boys and I have money what is the share of the daughter in the inheritance one-third half it is half it's mentioned in surah an-nisa inheritance is one of the sciences that are the first to go so if someone dies and he has a wife a daughter and a brother how do we divide this the wife gets 18 the daughter gets half and the rest goes to the brother Danny you know this of course and now so he said o prophet of Allah I'm going to die so can I have a will of two-thirds of what I have the Prophet said no said half the profits is known said one-third the Prophet said yes and one-third is too much even a bad says Nelly be pleased with him and that is why i recommend that whenever you write a will it does not exceed one quarter though it is permissible to have one-third but it's best to have one quarter because the Prophet said that is no Sam one-third is permissible but it is a lot so a quarter would be a much better choice for him so you can do this can I have write a will for someone who would inherit me can I write a will to my father and say one third of my inheritance would be would go to my father no the Prophet said that some la wassailia tell you are if there is no will to someone who is inheriting so I cannot write any portion of my money of my wealth to my son to my daughter to my wife to my mother to my father they they are all inheriting by default but can I write one third of my money to my cousin yes to my neighbor yes you can write one set of your wealth to your chick I'll be more than happy to accept that so this is permissible but you cannot give any part of your wealth as a will to someone who is in editing you the so nice to have two witnesses of course nowadays in writing and proving or sealing it this also does this I think tomorrow we would have the brother the legal person to talk to you about the aspects of dying maybe you could ask him about how to authenticate a will here we move on to number nine we've we've gone through this number ten it is not permissible to be unfair or unjust in giving your inheritance or in right sorry that is in writing your will how would someone be unfair in writing his will in Saudi I don't know about you guys in Saudi we have a problem with our in-laws benefiting from the money we let we leave behind so a lot of the men would probably be unfair in the will to deprive their daughters husbands from benefiting so if I have daughters and they're married I've worked all of my life to gain this wealth of mine if I die portion of it would go to my daughter and hence their husbands would benefit from it and therefore i scratch them off my will and this is for a lot of the Muslims would do something to deprive their wives and that is why in Islamic law if a man on his dying bed divorces his wife his divorce is cancelled why because well why are you divorcing area you've been with her for 40 days for 40 years don't remind me I'm dying now and this is the only way I can get even without her punching me back so I'm dying she she she she holds his handle my love you dying don't leave miss if you're divorced he dies so the scholars say no no no no this divorce is not applicable she inherits and she's still his wife why is he doing this he is doing this to harm her and the Prophet is awesome forbade from this harming people number one other are some people would exaggerate and write more for example we have people having three or four sons the biggest son the oldest son is running the business of the father and the father loves him the the remaining three are useless to him so when he dies he writes in his will that half of the company belongs to my son this is not permissible being fair is essential in Islam because Islam is built and based on fairness I have two sons can I give one a gift and not give the other one an equal amount of gift apathy do you do this a lot yes if your son if you have four sons and one of them is the highest in grades and the fur it comes in the first place in his school and the rest are normal do you give him something to honor him yes right you buy him a bicycle and the other three you don't buy them anything is this fair no it's not is it haram yes it's how long you can't give any of your children gift and you have to be equal in them it's different when you're supporting them or you are giving symptom something to live by I have four children one in the University one in the high school and one the last one is then it is in elementary school the one in the university has a car so I give him pocket money 50 dirhams for example the one that goes to 11 to the school I give him for their humps it's more than enough is this being fair no no this has nothing to do with fairness this has to do with what is needy their need but when I give them gifts for eight I by the oldest one in the university a watch worth of two thousand dirhams and the one in the elementary a bicycle worth 200 dirham accept it no this is Harlem a gift you have to be equal likewise if you have two wives or more one needs a caesarean operation for delivery I pay twenty thousand dirhams the one is natural delivery three thousand dirhams does she call for the balance give me the seventeen thousand in cash no this is something different"
