  "transcript": "from bosnia he says what's the ruling of the prayer on those who offer salam with the imam and this is the vast majority of hanafi's again the moment the imam says immediately give salam with him and if he pauses like for three four seconds they have a problem because they're waiting for him to go to the left this is wrong the sunnah is for the imam to say salaam on the right then assalamu alaikum warahmatullah only when he finishes allah then you start to give your salam to the right and then to the left but if a person does this with the imam his prayer is valid he has done a makru act doing what the imam is doing at the same time is makru doing it before the imam invalidates your prayer doing it after the imam is according to the sunnah"
