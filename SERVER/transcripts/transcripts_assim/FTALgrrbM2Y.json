  "transcript": "Maisha from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. So my question is when I use social media I try to post Islamic posts most of the times but sometimes a lot of video comes where I might think the editing is not so well or the presenting is not well such as recently I saw a video where someone instantly died saying the Shahada but the way they put text or emojis on it I felt should I share this or not or sometimes I feel the Quran recitation is not clear so the thought comes that if I don't share it I might be disrespecting Islam so is it kufr or not? First of all, first of all Maisha is it mandatory to share it yes or no? No Sheikh. And how would it be kufr? See the most important thing for us to avoid OCD because this is how Shaytan whispers in our ears, inflating little things. The most important thing is to have our thought process clear. Ask simple questions. Is it mandatory any person dumping stuff on me and says if you don't share it you will face the consequences on the day of judgment? I don't forgive you if you don't share it. Who are you to forgive or not to forgive? The heck with you, I don't care. So as long as you've just stated clearly and you know this from your own pure nature that it's not mandatory for me to share whatever people dump on me, in this case if the quality is not good or if you think that it is inappropriate, delete it without any sin let alone kufr."
