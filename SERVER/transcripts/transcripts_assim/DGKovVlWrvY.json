  "title": "Does swallowing saliva (from the lips) that has come out of one's mouth break fast? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "if a person is fasting and more saliva is running in his mouth and if he's talking or reciting quran some of his saliva is reaching out of his mouth and less on his lips so what is will his passing be broken if he swallow the saliva that was done on his lip now many people ask this question and they give a description that when you imagine it you feel grossed with it so as if you're drooling and saliva is coming in rivers and you just go and eat them and lick them out this is gross man what is this it's a single tiny drop of your saliva that may come to your lips and you do this and it's gone so the scholars have different opinion as usual in everything some schools of thought say that this has gone outside of your mouth so licking your lip would be a form of getting something inside which was not inside so it breaks your um fasting other scholars say that no if it's like a thread like it's very thin it's very negligible and you lick your lips it does not impact your fasting and this is the most logical uh opinion as there is no clear-cut answer to it but this is not my biggest problem my biggest problem is with those who have ocd who overthink i know people who call me and they say they keep on spitting their saliva it's in their mouth they keep on spitting all day long and you can imagine how dry their mouths are and how bad this is for them physically and medically but this is nothing wrong in swallowing your own saliva it's inside of your body when you make wudu and you spit what's in your mouth wouldn't they there a little residue of the water what are you gonna do bring a vacuum cleaner put it in your mouth to suck everything in it this is illogical so such overthinking and exaggeration is ways of shaytaan to mess up with your head so there's nothing wrong and it does not impact your fasting inshallah"
