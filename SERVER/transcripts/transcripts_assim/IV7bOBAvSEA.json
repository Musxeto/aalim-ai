  "title": "Photo Filters on social media - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "as an says I want to know whether adding filters to pictures on social media or elsewhere is it permissible or not changing one's self into an animal or changing the background setting or adding a nonliving object to the photo itself this is something that the Muslims have been tested with and as the Prophet said early in salat wa salaam that the muslims they will come a time where the muslims follow the footsteps of the disbelievers to the smallest details even if they would to enter if they were to enter a desert lizards hole they would follow them so the people said o prophet of allah do you mean the Jews and the Christians and the Prophet said yes in a generation who then meaning yes definitely the Muslims nowadays are trying to copy to imitate whatever the Jews and Christians do due to their influence due to their grip on media it's a form of brainwash so the Muslims watch their media watch their movies watch their TV series whatever and they are affected by it negatively because these Muslims don't have something to abide by they don't have any pride in their religion in the sense that they're not that proud of being Muslims and some of them is even ashamed of being called a Muslim and this shows you how ignorant these people aren't coming back to our topic with the new social media apps whether it's Facebook Twitter snapchat Instagram you name it they've got it the Muslims have been the first to board the boat and use these mediums and unfortunately it's not for the goodness of Islam or for their own benefit it's just to show off now they have these filters and to make a long story short using these filters is dependent first of all if you use filters that make you look like a pig or a dog then or an animal this is Hera because this is changing the creation of Allah Allah created you in the best of form and you degrade yourself to that form this is not logical people say I share we're just kidding around with just joking ok you don't joke with her on stuff like when two people drink water and they use their glasses and said say it to one another Cheers Oh bottoms up what are you doing this is imitating the Kafar when they drink their whiskey or wine or beer or whatever this is not permissible this is not adequate for you as a Muslim to do so now they put these filters this is Haram if the filters are like flowers and halos etc this is okay any unliving object added to the picture this is okay changing the background there is no problem in that but when it comes to photoshop so if someone makes these touches on the photograph so that he removes the pimples if there are any darkens his hair widen his eyes makes something to his skin now this is creating other than the creation of a large solution because you're doing something that is not what Allah has created you are adding something to it and this is not permissible when it comes to photographs and series I have not tried this once in my life and I I feel insulted if someone would try to do this to me because Allah has created man in the best of form and we don't need these silly things to add anything to you except to make others mock you and laugh at you"
