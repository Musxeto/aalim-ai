  "transcript": "ali says i'm a jobless i am jobless at the moment if i get a job in the company through some person like he will share my cv with them and ask them to hire me by using his personal connections is it allowed or not this practice is commonly used and some may call it good intercession because all what he's doing he's not bribing anyone he's using his connections with the upper management to recommend me so this may fall under the ayah where allah says within what translates to whoever intercedes for a good cause will have a share there is reward therefrom and whoever intercedes for an evil cause will have a portion that is a burden there from which means that intercession in islam is highly recommended providing it leads to goodness and there's no haram involved someone who was oppressed and people took his money came to me and says i need you to come with me and speak to the oppressor so that he would return my money so i intercede and i go to the man and say come on you know you're a good person you fear allah you don't want allah's wrath on you on the day of judgement give the man his money back and the man gives him his money do i get reward of course i get to work from allah so is talking to the ceo about my cousin looking for a job part of this if my cousin is qualified and he exceeds the job requirement and there are no people who are better than him in line for that position then this is permissible and there's no problem in that what do you mean there's no one else in line sometimes there is a long raw of people applying i can't use my connections to make my cousin jump all of these people and get the job this is unfair and not not permissible but if the ceo doesn't have such a role and he invents a job for this cousin of mine which would benefit their company and my cousin is well qualified for it there is no problem in that and allah knows best you"
