  "title": "Who is allowed to lead the prayer, what are the characteristics of the Imam? | Sh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "sake from bangladesh yeah so sheikh we prayed the namaz in congregation with my father and my uncles and grandfather together so in there can you please tell me what qualities should an imam have like uh should the imam have beard and how the clothes should be can we just wear normal t-shirts for being an imam and can a 20 year old lead a prayer while some other person is present like some older person is present for example if my uncle is there and if i am like i'm 20 years old and my uncle is like 32. so can i lead the prayer okay from bangladesh he says what are the characteristics of the imam i pray sometimes with my father grandfather and uncles so what are the characteristics of imam does he have to have a beard what about his clothes should they be above his ankle i'm 20 years of age can i lead first of all all what you're saying is i wouldn't say superficial rather it is not tackling the core of the problem the characteristics of the imam generally speaking is that he has to be the one who memorizes the quran most so if you 20 years of age and your father grandfather and uncles don't memorize the quran and you memorize more than them you should lead generally speaking however we have a hadith that overrides this and the hadith states that no one is allowed to lead the owner of the house without his permission so if if my grandfather is there my father is there my uncles are there whose house is it it's my father house then your father leads even if he only knows how to recite the fatiha that's it he doesn't memorize memorize anything of the quran he's the one obliged and entitled to lead unless he wavers his right and he authorizes anyone he wishes so this is the default secondly having a beard or not is definitely part of the obligation upon all men to have it and to grow it or actually to leave it not to shave it not to shorten it this is an obligation it's not a sunnah like many people say that oh it's a sunnah so i can shave it if it were a sunnah i would have shaven it uh years ago but this is mandatory this is obligatory if you shave it you're sinful full stop but it does not constitute a reason or a barrier from a person to read a prayer someone who memorizes the quran wants to lead and you get dozens of people with beer said no no no come back come back you can't pray why i memorize the full quran oh because you're not following the sunnah it's true i'm not following the sunnah but this does not mean that i shouldn't pray yes we cannot appoint him as a regular permanent imam because this is a different ballgame and it depends on the administration of the masjid it depends on the board of the masjid it depends on the country that has these rules and regulations but generally speaking if we are in the desert if we are in the airport someone wants to lead and he says that i memorize the whole quran be my guest so i hope this answers your question"
