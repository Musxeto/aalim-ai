  "transcript": "sh is it permissible to make a donation to a mixed gender School in Bangladesh considering that most educational centers and workplaces in the country have a mixed environment especially sh I'm talking about a school how students are 5 to 12 years of age and take each of their class in a mixed classroom jaakum first of all the donation itself is not targeting the mixing of the genders and the mixing of the gender is a byproduct of the original purpose the donation is to help and escalate the educational process which no one disputes that it is a necessity especially in our developing countries therefore if there is a school that is segregated and they're following the Shar it is the best to focus and to uh uh direct all of your donations to it or to them but if there is there aren't such schools and this is the best available in this case inshallah your donations would be accepted because it as I said earlier it's not directed to the free mixing rather it is directed to the educational uh process and Allah Knows Best"
