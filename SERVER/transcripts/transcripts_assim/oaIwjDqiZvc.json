  "title": "A sheikh claims that Allah comes to his dreams & talks to him, is it possible? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign speaks to him in his dreams or he has a connection with Allah I believe he's telling latent lies but on the on the Islam key website or it says that it is possible for some righteous people that Allah may speak to them in their dreams so my question is that is it possible for someone to get Visions or some dreams from Allah that can that that are actually from Allah or to them in their dreams or they for they can frequently see something that is of the future in the dream is it possible or is it just um randomly that happens sometimes that was my questions this happened with a former president who said God came to me and told me to invade this country and they invaded the whole country and killed millions of Muslims was he telling the truth you tell me course not who came to him in his dream Satan without any doubt now this Sheikh who says Allah comes to me and talks to me in a dream any righteous person any person with credibility would be scared to the bones of saying such a statement that he doesn't want to show up up excuse me that he doesn't want to show off and he does not want people to think highly of him and he would keep it with him to the Grave okay why did the prophet say that Allah came to him to me well the prophet is talking about a revelation this is he boasting about it of course not but imagine if I come on live TV and I say God came to me and told me this and that and I should do this and that and the the solution for people's problem in this country or that is so and so what would people think of me the Die Hard fans would say we should build the shrine on his grave the haters would kill me first and then bury me and then build a shrine on me to Stone nobody who's righteous in his right mind would go and say such things to people usually so in our times such a person who does say such things I would say that he's a big imposter he's not righteous he's not a man of knowledge or of uh uh right piety and Deen now is it possible that Allah can come and speak to you in your dreams it is possible but can you be certain the answer is no and most likely this is Satan messing up with your head so if the vision you saw was positive and was Good Vibes and nice things and Glad Tidings feel good about it don't talk to anybody about it you don't know if it's right or it's from the Devil Himself and if it's wrong alhamdulillah you kept a lead on it and Satan went uh defeated without achieving his goals and Allah Knows Best"
