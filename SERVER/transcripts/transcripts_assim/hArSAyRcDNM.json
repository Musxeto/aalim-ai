  "transcript": "foreign [Music] ER from India can you please explain how to wash the leg in with the pouring water over it I'm thinking the water has reached most of the parts of the leg enough because it's specifically takes a bit more time for me to watch the link it is totally unacceptable and inappropriate for me to put my leg up here my stretching ability is not as it used to be no stretching anymore so I I'll probably have a cramp or pull a muscle but if this is my foot little water in my hand washing my foot like this with the water would do most of us think that we have to overwhelm the water under the tap water we have to overwhelm our foot under the tap water so we open the tap and we just put the foot and twist it and do this and do this and do this and probably lose a couple of gallons in the process and this is not from the Sunnah at all the prophet Prophet is Assam used to perform wudu with something equivalent to this the whole limbs including the two feet so just putting this much water and doing this rubbing with that water you would say oh Sheikh but it covered only this the underneath node is still wet it will cover the underneath and the sides and between the uh toes well enough inshallah this is sufficient now doing it three times is part of the Sunnah so if you need another scoop and to do it repeat it that would definitely be more than sufficient and Allah Knows Best"
