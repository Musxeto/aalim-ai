  "transcript": "is totally wrong he's asking about the beard he some people tell him shave it and once you shave it it grows uh in a better form the way it looks it's not nice a Allah did not tell you to make your beard big a prophet never said that you have to put fertilizers and irrigate it and do this so that becomes you know really huge no the prophet simply sayam honor it meaning always Cal it and make it look presentable and leave it as it is so if it's only few hairs here and there leave it Allah does not want you to grow it this big but it is not permissible for you to trim it and this is the most authentic opinion of scholar and it's not permissible for you to shorten it and if there was a way that was permissible to shorten it I would have done that and I would have relieved myself from people saying why don't you cut it short it's too long uh why don't you braid it why they make all kinds of fun and joke well let them do what they do I do what I do following the prophet Alam and I've got the evidences to prove that and I pray to Allah that this might uh intercede for me on the day of judgment Maha from Saudi Arabia he's saying"
