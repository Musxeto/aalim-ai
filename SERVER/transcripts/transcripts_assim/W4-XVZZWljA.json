  "transcript": "despite water being available if someone prefers to only um clean himself with toilet tissue after urinating um does he purify himself fully or not there is no difference of opinion among Scholars that using water is the best in terms of cleansing oneself after answering the call of nature however also it is a agreed upon the vast majority of Scholars that the companions may Allah be pleased with them at the time of the Prophet alham though they had water yet a lot of them preferred using hard substances such as stones or rocks rather than water due to its scarc scarcity I don't know now Sumi uh it was scarce and hence it was not that easy or accessible though the it was available so Scholars say there is no problem at all even in the times we live in where it's easier to get water if someone doesn't want to use water and insists on using tissue papers there's no problem in that and his Purity is full and complete"
