  "transcript": "unas from Germany we have some problems witha time where I live so on the one hand what should we do if AA is reached after Islamic midnight must be then pray on the spot or can we delay it so long as it's so long as it's before F time I've addressed this issue before Unice and I told you that you have to follow the imams and the scholars of your country in what they say m is identified by Sunset is identified when the redness in the west where the sun had set disappears once it disappears this means that it is is time and regardless in extreme times when midnight is clashing with the disappearance of the redness of the Twilight we have to give precedent to The Disappearance of the redness of the Twilight and Allah Knows Best"
