  "title": "Must I change my name after reverting to islam? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh sh uh I want to ask uh I just uh revert to Islam and my name uh before this my family give my name Jonah is from from the Bible which is uh Prophet unus so I just want to ask if is it uh uh recommended to me to change my name to unus or I can keep my English name no you can't keep your English name without any problem inshallah if you wish to keep it you can keep it if you wish to change it so that you make everyone know that you're a Muslim because typically speaking when you come to me and say my name is Jonah I said okay this is a Christian this is the first thing thing that comes into my mind and when you said alaykum I said because no he's a Muslim but has a Christian name and those who came to the prophet Alam he did not change their names unless their names were bad and they most of them kept their original Nam so there's no problem in keeping your name if I wear in your shoes living in Malaysia most likely I would have changed it into a Muslim name so that I would avoid any ambiguity or misunderstanding but it's not mandatory and Allah Knows Best"
