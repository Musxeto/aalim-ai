  "title": "Can we cut a strand of hair from Eyebrows? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "going back to imran's question imran says can we cut the hair from eyebrows that is long and coming in our eyes first of all the authentic hadith which abdullah i haven't mastered may allah be pleased with him narrated and it's elsewhere that the prophet has some cursed two types of women a hairdresser that plucks the the hair of the eyebrows and the customer the woman who allows her to do that to her to beautify her in such a fashion so there's no difference of opinion that plucking the eyebrows is prohibited in islam the hadith is crystal clear now the difference of opinion is in cutting with scissors because linguistically this does not fall under plucking which is to pluck however the majority of scholars say that this falls under plucking by default because the norm is to pluck to cut it with scissors is rare but it falls under the same category of changing the creation of allah azza and this is why the majority of scholars say that plucking shaving cutting short all of this is not um permissible to do now the exception is if a strand of hair is too long to the extent that it may enter in your eye or impair your vision and this happens sometimes you find only one single hair coming down to your eye and maybe poking you or coming uh in front of you so that it impairs your vision if this is the case then you may cut this off this specific hair due to the necessity and due to the harm that it is causing you"
