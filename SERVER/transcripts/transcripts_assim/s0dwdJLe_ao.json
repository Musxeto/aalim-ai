  "transcript": "foreign [Music] there's nothing wrong in that what is wrong is to take whatever you study for granted because you're understanding might be a little bit off track but in 85 90 of what you read you understand it as it is which is good it is wrong for people to say no no don't study don't study don't read books on your own because you'll be misguided this is not true you have to do your due diligence by reading such books but at the same time in parallel to that whenever you find something that is ambiguous or not clear you should check it out with the scholars although the students of knowledge so that they would clarify it to you so that you ensure that what sticks in your head is the most authentic opinion of Scholars and I hope this answers your question"
