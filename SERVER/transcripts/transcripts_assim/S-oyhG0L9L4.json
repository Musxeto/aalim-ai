  "transcript": "Shu'aib from India? Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. Sheikh, what's the ruling on answering Barak Salam or sending salutation for Prophet Muhammad ï·º while we hear his name or while we hear Durood, while we are doing our Adhkar or reciting Quran? So should we complete our Adhkar or Quran or should we stop in between and answer back and then continue? If someone offers salutation upon the Prophet ï·º when you're not engaged with that individual, so you're focused on your Quran or on your Adhkar and someone randomly says, Allahumma salli wa sallim ala Muhammad, you're not obliged to interrupt your own Adhkar and Quran to offer salutation. But if you are in a gathering or you're speaking with the brother and he offers salutation upon the Prophet ï·º and you hear that, it is a highly recommended thing for you to do so that you would not be stingy or miserly as the Prophet had mentioned and described a person ï·º who hears his name and does not offer salutation. And Allah knows best."
