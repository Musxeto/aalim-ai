  "title": "Is it Sunnah to pray Sunnah of Fajr at HOME, & if pray Sunnah at home, do I pray Tahhiyatul Masjid",
  "transcript": "who pray before forgiving uh so i don't know someone said that the sunnah is to play it in your home before going to the mosque so i don't know whether it is so and if i pray it at home before going to the mosque do i still pray to raqqa ask the greeting of the masjid when i enter the mosque or do i wait to pray the sunnah in the mosque i will that's my question from nigeria he has a confusion of sunnah fajr and a lot of the people have a confusion of this and i'll try to clarify it to you the sunnah is to pray two raka's before the ford of fajr the sunnah is to pray these two raka's at home because the prophet said alaihis the best prayer of an individual is in his home except the fart so the third must be prayed in the masjid the sunnah the best and highest reward is to pray it at home and the prophet always prayed surnatel at home thirdly the prophet said allah that it is not permissible to pray between the adhan of fajr and the fajr except the two raka's of sunnah meaning that i have no right to pray two or four or six voluntary prayers because i don't have anything to do between adhama of fajr this is prohibited fourthly if i follow the sunnah and pray at home and then go to the masjid what should i do if i sit down i'm sinful because the prophet said assalam if you enter the message do not sit until you pray two raka's and if i pray two raka's i'm afraid that i may fall under the prohibition of praying between adhan and akama of fajr more than the turakaza fajr of sunnah what to do the scholars say no you are instructed to pray before sitting down because this is not voluntary this is mandatory so you prayed so i hope this clarifies things for you noor you"
