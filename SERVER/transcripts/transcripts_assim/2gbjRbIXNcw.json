  "transcript": "Khan. Khan from India. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Are health conditions like urine incontinence, gas incontinence, ijtihadah or breastfeeding legitimate reasons for combining prayers? Also there might be many other similar problems. So in such cases can a person do his own ijtihad as to combine prayers or not? Jazakallahu Khairan. Akhi, the combination or the combining of prayers is up to a person's ijtihad. If there is a real hardship upon the individual, Allah has given him the concession to combine between Dhuhr and Asr or between Maghreb and Isha. And this is to ease people's life. And the only one who could judge you is Allah. So you don't want to mess up things with Allah Azza Wa Jal and come on the Day of Judgment and say, well I did this and Allah tells you, no you shouldn't. You could have had a very clear time to pray without having urine incontinence or this or that. A woman breastfeeding, come on, what is this? She can breastfeed her child but she's not doing this 24 hours, seven days a week. There are times that the child sleeps, there are times that she has to wean the child and condition and train the child not to eat at specific times for her to sleep, for the child to fix his sleeping patterns and the like. So this is again between you and Allah and Allah Azza Wa Jal knows best."
