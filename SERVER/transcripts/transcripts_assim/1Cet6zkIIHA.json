  "title": "Will Allah punish a person twice for his sins, in dunya & also on day of judgement? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so after from india says we know that allah is more generous than to punish a person twice for his sin so we know that if a person was punished for his sin through a prescribed punishment in this life allah would not punish him on the day of judgment so if i slander someone and that person takes me to court and the court flogs me 80 lashes we're done we're even on the day of judgment i'm not going to be punished for that but if he does not take me to court or he doesn't know that i had slandered him on the day of judgment allah will punish me for what i had done so likewise if a person kills and murders another we know that there are three things for the heirs of the deceased of the victim to choose from one is an eye for an eye they choose the execution of the murderer to blood money so they agree to take the blood money which is the value of a hundred camels and let him go three to forgive him for the sake of allah so now the question is if the heirs forgave the dece the the murderer for the sake of allah will allah punish him on the day of judgment the answer is no and the reason is because one of three choices is given to the heirs of the victim and they chose to forgive so allah azzawajal would forgive him as well and allah knows best buhari you"
