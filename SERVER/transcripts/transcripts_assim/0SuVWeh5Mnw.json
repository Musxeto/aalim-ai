  "title": "Do we need to wear a cap or kufi in salah? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "and in FASS says do we need to wear a cap cover took or cover our head when doing salah for men this is not part of the sunnah wearing a cap wearing a headdress this is a cultural thing i've seen a lot of the brothers wearing nothing on their heads the minute they enter a message they take a handkerchief or they take a skullcap and they wear it for salah this is an innovation for this particular reason it's an innovation but if you wear such as my traditional head cover throughout the whole day in this case there is no problem in that insha'Allah"
