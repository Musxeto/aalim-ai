  "title": "Is having two contracts in one permissible in Islam? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I wanted to ask can we have two contracts in one for example someone buys a house and they also agree he also agrees to rent the house to a company like guaranteed rent is this allowed who's selling you the house and who's the one who is uh renting it from you the company is the same so the company is the same so as if there is a sort of conflict of interest because the company is selling you the house and renting it from you at the same time in order to get the cash money but remain living in it some Scholars say that these are two contracts in one and this is invalid other Scholars say that in terms of transactions selling and buying and renting everything is halal till proven otherwise so if I buy a property that's worth a million pounds and I think it's worthwhile the value of the property is a million pounds now the tenant to be is the owner of the property but they don't want to leave their property they need the money so they're willing to rent it for five years until they can settle something else outside or at least they're emotionally detached from the property so they insist we're selling it to you for a million pound but we'll rent it for the next five years for 50 000 pounds a year there's nothing wrong in that if I'm okay with buying the property and renting it for five years there's no problem in that and Allah Knows Best"
