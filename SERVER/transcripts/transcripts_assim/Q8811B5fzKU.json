  "title": "Feeding leftovers to animals rather than humans - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "the first one is about people who take natural protein so they don't go to creatine or they don't go to uh these powders that they uh take to enhance their power while working out which is not very healthy in my own opinion so he goes for natural thing eggs and he consumes six eggs he takes the white of the egg of four and the rest the yolk i think they call it he gives it to cats so he's not feeling good about this and he's asking is this permissible feeding animals is permissible as long as there is no one who can eat this as long as there is no one you can cook it and present it to feeding it to animals totally halal but i would highly advise you to cook the remaining part which you're not using and feed it to the poor there are hundreds of poor people in your country who would love an egg sandwich with some ketchup and uh tomatoes and if you give it to them you give you get more reward than giving it to the cat and allah knows best"
