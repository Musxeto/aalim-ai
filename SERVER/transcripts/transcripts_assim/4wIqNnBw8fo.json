  "transcript": "okay go ahead thank you so how to say no to people I mean when friends or people how to do what how to say no to people I mean how to deny people I mean when friends or family or other people invite us in Haram things like birthdays parties trips or movies how should we deny if we nicely or hesitant please say no they will force us and take us with them if we strictly or directly say no they will label us as a rude or arrogant fool so what is the correct way to say no without hurting their feelings or angering them you have to lose two choices either to answer their invitation and accept what they're asking you to do or to deny if you accept what they're asking you to do which is Haram they will be happy but Allah azzawajal will be angry with you and will torment you in this life and in your grave and in the Hereafter why because you obeyed the people and disobeyed Allah the prophet said Allah whoever seeks Allah's pleasure by displeasing the people Allah would be pleased with him and he of the almighty will make the people pleased with him but whoever seeks the pleasure of the people by displeasing and disobeying Allah Allah will be angry with him and he will make the people angry with him as well so if you answer them you will be cursed by Allah azzojan the second choice is If you deny them if you say no they will label you as wahhabi they will label you as extremists they will so what there's no problem in that as long as Allah is pleased with you however you have to improvise you have to be diplomatic and know how to say no sometimes people are just waiting for you to give them evidences from the Quran and Sunnah to attack you don't give them this option once a an old man asked me he was my Superior he was my Headmaster when I used to teach it in high school and he said in front of men they're all you know locals and they're all educated PhD holders Masters they all know the religion but they're not practicing so he wanted to make fun why don't you trim or shave your beard he said I immediately said because my wife would kill me and the guy was shocked he was in his 60s he said how is that I said because if I do this she knows I'm going to take a second wife the guy posed for five minutes and he broke in laughter he said well you're a genie you know how to take yourself out of trouble this is not me this is Allah's guidance I could have said no charam because it's the Sunnah the prophet ordered us not to shave it he ordered us to go against the Jews and the Christian blah blah blah he knows all of this he wanted to score a point I didn't give him the chance with the grace of Allah you also have to learn how to be diplomatic to beat around the bush especially with people who are anticipating to attack or to say hurtful things to you be a diplomatic and answered in a diplomatic way insha Allah"
