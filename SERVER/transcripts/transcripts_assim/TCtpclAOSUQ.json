  "transcript": "foreign from Ireland I wanted to ask and I noticed am I watching the detergent that I used to clean my clothes contain like animal products like enzymes or anionic surpicons so I was wondering like is there still a Halal for me to use it now these um animal products found in detergents can be something like glycerin or gelatin or unzeems or whatever they call them and we don't know if it's Halal or Haram the default is this is not something I'm eating this is not something I am certain of it being nudges or impure and whenever things get really really tight and tough in Islam Islam makes it easy and widens it and when things are so loose and white Islam tightens it just as a check and balance so the default is soap detergents toothpaste and the likes are all Halal until proven otherwise if we don't have proof we can not just shoot from the hip and say well I heard or I read in an article or someone said online that it is Haram no this is not the way it's done the way it's done is everything is halal until I have strong proof and evidence that it is not Halal or not pure and in this case we have to uh work accordingly [Music] and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah thank you foreign"
