  "title": "Do I have to pray in Musallah (Prayer Hall) if congregation is held & Must I pray Tahiyatul Masjid",
  "transcript": "from the uk says there is a muslim is a prayer hall a prayer room which is not a masjid it's a place that is temporarily used as a masjid so he says we have one in our building so would i be obliged to pray the answer would be either this or go to the message and pray but if there are no messages in the vicinity and the jummah the congregation is done in that prayer room the answer is yes it is mandatory upon you to join them now the second question would be should i pray to raka of masjid the greeting of the masjid before sitting down the answer is no you don't have to do that because these two raka's are only to be offered in a masjid this prayer hall can be easily shifted into a wedding hole or maybe sold as a canteen or a shop so it's not a full-fledged masjid forever it's not an endowment as a masjid so it does not require to pray to raka's his second"
