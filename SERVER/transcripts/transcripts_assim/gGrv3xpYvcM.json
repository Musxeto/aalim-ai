  "transcript": "Bally from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Don't scold me for praising please. I just wish I could explain to you how much you helped me in my dark times. I was really depressed and broken and then Allah sent you. Just thank you and I want to tell you that I am not your fan. I am a whole air conditioner of yours now. So may Allah bless you. May Allah bless you, reward you and may Allah give you everything your heart desires. And may Allah give you lots of hayat because we need you. Barakallah Fikumsalam. What's your question? My question is whenever any debating topic comes, you said this and any other sheikh said the opposite. So I go like Sheikh Asim said this so this must be the right answer. So is this correct to be a blind follower of any sheikhs and how can I fix this? Okay, first of all, it is totally wrong to be a blind follower of any person on earth other than the Prophet Muhammad Alayhi Salatu Wassalam. No one is infallible except the Prophet Salallahu Alaihi Wasallam. Not even the companions may Allah be pleased with them. Not Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, Ali, let alone sheikh so and so or scholar so and so. So number one is no one is to be followed blindly. Regardless of who they are except the Prophet Muhammad Alayhi Salatu Wassalam. Second of all, when people differ, so scholar so and so and scholar so and so. How do we evaluate which one is saying the truth or which one is more authentic or closer to the truth than the other? Is it through their biceps, the size of it or is it by the many followers on Instagram or on YouTube or on whatever? Of course not. Allah Azza wa Jal made a very clear way to determine which scholar is right and which scholar is not. When Allah says, فَإِن تَنَازَعْتُمْ فِي شَيْءٍ فَرُدُّوهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَالرَّسُولِ If you ever differed or argued or disputed over an issue, refer it back to Allah and to the Messenger Alayhi Salatu Wassalam if you believe in Allah and the Day of Judgment. How do we refer it back to Allah and to the Prophet Alayhi Salatu Wassalam? By referring it back to the Qur'an and to the Sunnah. And this is why in so many places, in our families, in our communities, we are plagued by blind following the scholars or the schools of thought. Sometimes disputes happen in the same house when a brother fights with his father or with his siblings or a sister fights with her mother because they blindly follow a particular school of thought. And you come and say, Shaykh Asim said, who in the heck is Shaykh Asim? Let him go to wherever he wants, who is he? And they're right. So if you say Shaykh so and so, Shaykh so and so, they will say, okay we have also Shaykh so and so and Shaykh so and so. Why don't you follow them? Is it the size of the biceps? Is it the number of the followers? Is it the tone of their skin? No, it is by Qur'an and Sunnah and this is why we tell you, don't take from me or him, take from the Qur'an and Sunnah. Whenever we say something, we should back it up by Qala Allah Qala Nabi Alayhi Salatu Wassalam. So when you speak to them, don't say to them, Shaykh so and so said, because they will counter that by saying, well Shaykh so and so said something different. Rather say to them, Allah says in the Qur'an or the Prophet Muhammad Alayhi Salatu Wassalam said in Sahih Al Bukhari. This would shut them off totally because what can they do to refute what you're saying? If they don't know any verse of the Qur'an or authentic hadith that can counter it, they're lost. They have to raise the white flag and say, we surrender, we believe and follow. Or they would be questioning their Islam because they rather follow Tom, Dick or Harry rather than follow Qala Allah Qala Rasool Alayhi Salatu Wassalam. Rather than following the Qur'an and the Sunnah which is a grave mistake and a sin. So this is the best way of talking to people and Allah knows best."
