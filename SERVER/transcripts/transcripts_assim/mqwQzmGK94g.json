  "transcript": "[Music] the prophet muslim told us to speak good or remain silent but how do i do that without being rude and giving the impression that i'm too proud to speak to people i will answer inshallah from bangladesh he says the hadith whoever believes in allah on the day of judgment must say something that is good or refrain from speaking he says how can we implement this hadith without be without being considered as rude or arrogant answer is very easy when there is a requirement for you to speak if it's going to be something that is good then say it if you can't say that which is good at least be diplomatic and say something that is polite but if you see something that is haram and you're expected to praise it or to endorse it or not to say anything that would not be part of this hadith because whoever believes in allah in the day of judgment must stay good and saying good is to forbid evil part of saying something that is good is to prevent evil and say that this is haram fear allah they will take it as arrogant they will take it as rude no problem because you are implementing the sharia and you're following it rather than your whims and desires you"
