  "transcript": "and welcome to our thursday class and it was supposed to be our ninth class studying the islamic faith but um inshallah we will devote the whole segment today's class to answering some of the questions that we have received from you on facebook so sania says i want to know whether it is halal to fill the gap between the teeth the gap between the teeth we don't have any hadith that restricts it except the hadith of even masroad may allah be pleased with him and it's in the sahih and it's a well known hadith where he tells us how the prophet isalam cursed a number of women for mutilating and changing the creation of allah such as those who are tattoo artists and those who they practice their art on so both the recipient and the doer are cursed by allah azzawajal and cursed by the prophet he also cursed those who their hair with other hair those who do it the hairdressers and the those who it's done to the clients among those the prophet salallahu salaam cursed those who file their teeth this means that they make a gap between their teeth as it was a sign of beauty in the past that you have a gap between the front two teeth so they used to file and the prophet allah followed cursing those who do this by saying those who do this gapping or filing to their teeth so that they would look more beautiful and they change the creation of allah this is how allah created you changing it permanently like this would be curse-worthy and as we see from sanya's question she's saying about filling the gap not making one and usually if there is a gap in the teeth nowadays this is considered to be an abnormality however we have to go to the dentists and we have to ask normal people if such a normal gap is a deformity or it's a normal thing and the vast majority of people would say it's a normal thing it may be somewhat different say that this is more beautiful than filling it up and hence that would be prohibited because it's changing and altering the creation of allah however if a dentist or dentists or specialists said that such a gap is bad for your teeth it allows cavity to grow it uh brings plaque or plaque or whatever they call it and it may store food in it etc so filling it up is the correct procedure in this case this is totally permissible insha'allah madiha says i had my breakfast while i was fasting voluntary fast after two hours i remember my fast i continued fasting thereafter is my fast valid or i need to make it up again the prophet said allah is whoever eats or drinks while fasting out of forgetfulness allah has given him food and drink what does that mean it means that this is a gift from allah to anyone who is fasting and eats or drinks out of forgetfulness this does not mean if i see someone fasting and he's drinking or eating it doesn't mean that i should leave him alone because allah is feeding him and providing him with drinks no i have to enjoy virtue and righteousness and forbid evil and vice by telling him you are fasting so that he would refrain therefore um this is not affecting your fasting this is totally okay insha'allah muntaha says i have a question and to make a long story short her father-in-law gave her a portion from his house as a mahal a dowry and now he has sold the house without her permission which means that he also sold her portion of the house and he is blackmailing his son his son and telling them that he would not give them a penny the son is obedient doesn't want to hurt his father's feelings but at the same time he borrowed that is the father from his son 380 rupees lack rupees and used it without telling her husband and spending the money of the house on his new wife and children what does islam say about such a problem first of all this father in law of yours has committed a grave sin by depriving you of your and muslims when they promise they fulfill hypocrites when they promise they break this portion of the house which was allocated as a maha it's your right to claim it so let's assume that at the time of selling the house it costed let's say ten thousand dollars the portion that is yours this is a debt that he is supposed to give to you and actually the debt is on your husband because he is the one obliged to give you the maha so if he failed to deliver the maha due to his father's betrayal and dishonesty then it remains with your husband to give it to you whenever it's possible or for you to forgive your husband that your father-in-law is a cheater and a liar and he's a crook but now you're faced with a problem either to take him and your husband to court demanding your right or to act wisely and especially when your husband is a good man to separate your financials from your father-in-law totally so you advise your husband that you require the mahar from him and that he has to pay more attention in the future to his family to his wife and children's rights rather than squandering and spending off his wealth on his father who is a spendthrift and does not fear allah azzawajal and allah knows best madiha again says the sealed nectar by safiyodeen mubarak fury is it authentic the answer is the books of seerah are not all 100 percent authentic as in the case of the books of hadith for example so when you say is bukhari authentic is muslim authentic i said yeah no doubt in that however the books of tafsir the books of sira these books due to the fact that they collect a lot of narrations and they do not implement the rules of schools or scholars of hadith therefore you may find things that are authentic things that are not however in general the sealed nectar order is a well accepted book in syria and to my knowledge it won the award of king faisal's award for service of islam and it is among the wildly accepted books of seerah for being concise and at the same time for having uh mostly authentic narrations and and and stories in it therefore insha'allah i would be safe in saying that yes you can go ahead and read it yusuf sadiq says how to reply to non-muslims when they say assalamu alaikum should used to come to greet him and say assalamu alaikum they alter the salaam they will say walaikum and the prophet isam prohibited us from initiating salam so we may never say to a non-muslim assalamu alaikum but if they say to us and they start by saying we may reply by saying full stop and this is the most authentic opinion though there are difference of opinions among scholars but this is the most authentic and closest to the sunnah of the [Music] says if parents are forcing daughter for huller is that valid by court first of all the issues of divorce and hudder the parents of both sides have no say in it so the father of the wife has no say in demanding divorce or for his daughter this is something between a man and his wife so the question doesn't make any sense if parents are forcing daughter is that valid by court the answer is no unless the daughter goes and demands huller in front of the judge without any indication that he's she's being forced by her parents the judge is a human being he sees a woman coming and demanding from her husband he does his due diligence talks to the husband talks to the girl try to reconcile but she's adamant and insisting on her how would he know that she's forced there's no possibility so if she applies for her and is granted it she has no right to come after one month and say judge i was forced prove that to us and he can't accept what she's saying without any proof there is and we spoke about this before in some of our courses and we said that claiming that a person is forced to divorce or to do something haram or to break an oath the claim of being forced has to be real and genuine otherwise it won't be accepted for example a person claims that he was forced to divorce his wife that's why he divorced her we say how were you divorced and he replies by saying someone said to me if you don't divorce your wife i'm gonna throw rocks on you so the judge says did he have rocks around him he said no was he capable of throwing rocks no he's so thin he cannot carry rocks so why did you divorce he forced me no this is not acceptable someone says my wife forced me to divorce her she said if you don't divorce me tomorrow i'm going to throw myself in the river this divorce is invalid actually the divorce if taking place is valid why he wasn't forced she threatened to throw herself in the river tomorrow yeah tomorrow not today so this is not a krahon muleji this is not forced [Music] or pressured forcing or i don't know what have you that doesn't leave you any room to maneuver someone has a knife to your neck if you don't divorce i'm gonna slash your throat this is real threat a woman on the tenth floor hanging from the balcony or threatening to throw herself from the window i know that she would do such a thing this is a valid force or a valid excuse to do whatever you want and it doesn't take effect therefore if the daughter was not forced as i've explained to ask for her then the is valid if she was forced by real threat genuine threat that is going to happen inevitably in this case the holler is not valid but she has to clarify all of this to the judge janna says the question is not clear sheikh always say bismillah when you start do work that's why shaytan stay away for from you how about the money if you count also must say bismillah i don't think she's asked she's telling me she's asking me is that we should say bismillah before start any word no this is not true we don't say bismillah before everything we do however sometimes scholars say it is recommended to begin things by saying bismillah halal things but it's not mandatory definitely and likewise when counting money you don't say this because it's not from the sunnah but if you say it there is no harm in doing it unless you think it's a form of worship you're getting closer to allah with now for those who complain i've seen few cases like this where people living in a room on their own nobody's in the house nobody has access to the house in their living room in their own cupboards or dresser they place money and come back five minutes later to find it gone and i know close people to me i know one of the well-known daddies here in jeddah and she's in her 60s she's a very good highly decorated student of knowledge that she would suffer from this every other day and she had lost literally tens of thousands of reels and she's gone crazy she says i don't know what's happening and i told her that this is jin so she says i recite that baccarat i recite this i i observe math card but they steal the money sometimes they return some of it and sometimes i don't keep any cash in my house i simply take it downstairs to my daughter's house or to my neighbor's house and keep all my money with there and everything is fine only when i put it in my purse in my purse in my dresser or in my bedroom it's gone so i recommended her to say bismillah whenever she places it and with the grace of allah it stops it stopped and only every blue moon that returns and she says i forgot to save smith so bismillah is something that we begin things with not as mandatory but rather as asking allah for blessing of things and again it's not a form of worship meaning that it's a sunnah but the prophet encouraged us to say bismillah in almost generally speaking things that we do so i believe that it is not mandatory but if you say it that would be good inshallah [Music] is it har is it prohibited to use iron ornaments for both men and women there are many hair clips and pins which are of iron should we also not use them the answer is no there is no problem in that insha allah and to my recollection the hadith where the prophet has prohibited an iron ring saying that this is the ornament of the people of hell i believe that this is not authentic hadith or it was abrogated because in the other hadith when the man wanted to marry a woman who proposed to the prophet and the prophet isam rejected her the man said let me marry her if you don't want her so he asked him whether he had any financial assets to provide as a maha as a dowry and in the end the prophet said go and look even for a ring made of iron which means that the hadith it is the ornament of the people of hell is not authentic or at least aggregated and one was best zade zubair says is there any delil for reciting basmala before any surah someone told me that there is no delhi that basmati and this is enough first of all making bold statements like this is very easy if this individual is a highly decorated scholar of islam we would say okay maybe let's look into it but when you look that saying bismillah in the schools of thought is normal accepted some say it's mandatory some say it's not some say it is part of al-fatiha and some say it is not and the most authentic opinion is that i know some of the people are saying what is your basement the best man is saying bismillah [Music] this is how the muslims refer to these phrases as a form of shortening them so basmallah the most authentic opinion is that it's a separate ayah of its own dividing between surahs with the exception of surah 8 and 9 suratul and far and sword other than that every single surah peace be upon him was corresponding with sheba the queen of i think her name is sheba the queen of yemen so to come and claim that besmella is uh um not to be recited before the surah this is outrageous there are a hadith related to ibn abbas may allah be pleased with a man with his father and some say it is that the prophet that we the companions did not know that or the prophet did not know us and that the surah has finished until bismillah was recited when being revealed that this to announce the beginning of a new surah i'm not sure of how authentic this had this narration is but it is well known in the books of jurors of islam scholars of islam and hence it is sufficient for us to open the mushaf the quran and find bismillah in every beginning of the surah so for someone to come up with a bold claim that this is not part of the surah or it's not part of the quran and we don't have to recite it we just say audible regime this is outrageous unless may allah be pleased with them said i prayed behind the prophet and they all began their recitation in salat with alhamdulillah while acknowledging that bismillah is to be recited before and allah knows best and she says will the pure or good souls meet each other in the barzah this is an issue of dispute among scholars and the most authentic opinion is that it is not backed up by authentic hadees and hence we cannot confirm such a thing but let us take this argument to another level what are the possibilities one that souls meet in the bazaar two they don't meet what impact does either one have on us on our ibadah on us getting closer to allah zero so why do we occupy our time and researching over an issue that has no value why do we waste time asking such such questions that would not benefit us yeah it's fun to know that oh my late father will be meeting my late grandmother but without evidence this is fruitless it has no benefit allah please what is the ruling on countries that are not using sharia but are both muslims and christians on the day of judgment will all the ummah go to hell fire as claimed by one scholar and if so what is the way out well this is the core reason we are studying the islamic faith the apida so that we understand our apida well and throughout through what we had studied earlier and through the um course of the islamic work we have done we learned that it is not for individuals to grade and label people whether they are among the people of hell or heaven so what you're saying is that there is a scholar who claims that all of the ummah will go to hell definitely this quote-unquote so-called scholar is not a scholar he's a deviant person and he is most likely from al-khawarijj who label muslims as kafir and who claim that such muslims will be abiding in hell for eternity what kind of audacity this person has to just say the whole ummah will be in hell now the issue of implementing sharia this is one of the most important rulings in islam the ruling is for allah the legislation is for allah azzawajal and whoever legislates with other than what allah has revealed then he is among the cafe as mentioned in chapter 5 verse 44 45 and 47. yet this is an issue of great dispute among scholars whether it is koffer dunakovr majorco for minor or it is an act of apostasy that if a person does it automatically he's bound to hell and he's exiting the fold of islam this is what we will come to discuss inshaallah later on as we are progressing in the islamic faith course where we spoke about what the author said the first two of the things that nullifies a person's islam we will come insha allah hopefully on monday to discuss and to explain the difference of opinion among scholars when it comes to legislation legislating other than with sharia law which would insha allah hopefully benefit all of us but in general there is a difference between legislating and ruling and by being a citizen who has no power to object or reject so there are the legislators those who come and say halal to something that goes against sharia so they are overriding sharia law overriding allah's law this is one category then we have the rulers who would implement such legislations regardless whether they are okay with it they've ordered it they don't know about it this is something different we can't paint with the same brush it's different when someone says no no this man-made law is better than allah's law this is kufrin you don't have to be a rocket scientist but someone says i believe that allah's law is supreme ultimate and this man man made law is junk but what can i do i'm forced to implement it otherwise i'll be kicked out of office i'll be this i'll be that this is separate and the third category is us when someone says to us simon says do this we know it's haram we know it's against sharia but we can't rebel we can't reject or object so the least we could do is not to obey not to confront but not to obey unless we come to the lease of the two evils so committing the least of the two evils this is judgmental it depends on the issue but generally speaking what this so-called scholar said is totally bogus and no one can just simply paint with the same brush every category of the society and put them all in hell uh rina tony says is this rewarding to give money to beggars it may encourage them begging does islam like this serve first of all beggars the vast majority of them are professionals so the recommendation is not to give them because this would only make them grow in number and make them more professional however if someone gives any beggar whether professional or not money is he rewarded answers yes because this is his intention okay i found this on the web for who are the dancers yes check it out is talking to you siri this is weird it shows you how good apple is so if you give a beggar money this is according to your intention there's no problem in doing it because you're dealing with allah and this is why we have a lot of similar cases in sharia where a person is rewarded according to his intention for example the prophet said while asap no nomidium peace be upon him jesus christ was walking he saw a man stealing so he caught him red-handed and he said to him you stole and the man said well law he i didn't steal like every other burglar would do they would swear lying theresa peace be upon him said i believe in allah because you took an oath in the name of allah you swore i believe in allah and i falsify my eyes i will accuse my eyes that i did not see what i thought i saw and he let him go and the prophet also ruled the case similar to that when a man went to the masjid and found someone sitting by the masjid door before fajr thinking that he's a beggar so he took money and gave it to him and then discovered that this man was his own son so he said to him give me back my money i didn't intend it to you i wanted to give it for charity and the son said well i'm poor and i'm deserving of the money and i got it i'm not to give it back to you so they both went to the prophet saw and this is a clear indication that taking your father taking your mother to court to demand your rights is not part of being undutiful this is my god-given right so many people ask me our father died and mother is refusing to sell the house and divide the inheritance she says when i die you do whatever you want so what shall we do we need the money i say take her to court they say oh it's being undutiful and being not a good son no this is your god-given right this is what courts are made for your mother's judgment is impaired it's wrong it's on islamic anyhow so the two went to the prophet and the father said oh prophet of allah i gave money as a charity but put it in the wrong place and the boy said o prophet of allah i got charity that i am deserving for so the prophet said alas islam to the man what you have given in charity is registered as charity and what you have taken as a poor person is accepted you keep the money and your charity is registered what does this tell you it tells you that the intention is important if your intention is to please allah azza even if this man might be a a professional beggar and there's a possibility that he is really needy in this case there's no sin on you and this is totally legit uh afrina but this question is gone faiza said says if someone i helped once financially keeps coming to me again and again for different needs shall i continue helping her in my capacity or can i excuse politely this is totally up to you it is as described earlier what you do for the sake of allah is for the sake of allah you'll be rewarded for that but if you are inclined that this person is using you and you've seen evidences that she's using the money for things that are not as she said in this case you have all the right to apologize diplomatically and not give her anything the biggest fear i have is that you continue to give while doubtful in your heart and maybe snapping one day and spoiling everything that you've done by saying didn't i give you so much why are you abusing my money why are you asking me every time you ask me i give you allahu akbar this is a catastrophe you should not give her anything if you're going to reach that level because this is known as al-men and it is one of the major sins in islam the prophet said three will never enter jannah and allah would not speak to him not look at them and not have mercy upon them the one who has his garment or trousers below his ankle and al-manan the one who always goes to the people who he had helped in the past and remind them of his help didn't i give you this and that didn't i help you admit your child in school then this is a major sin so um i would say it is up to you totally if you feel that she's sincere and she's in need and she thinks well of you then allah has made you made her a door and a gate for you to janna the more you help her you enter gentlemen because she's needy but if you're inclined that she's lying or using you well you fooled me once shame on you you fool me twice shame on me kinza says some people say you shouldn't take a black cat as a pet because black cats are evil and they're sometimes jin and all is it uh is it true or something else about black cats not okay there is nothing in the sharia that says that black cats uh are prohibited or haram there's nothing in the quran or sunnah that states that they are some scholars like evan taymi if i re if i remember correctly said that black cats might be gin but not all of them or not most of them the possibility when a gin would uh transform or appear in the shape of another animal or a cat that it would be black but there's no evidence supporting this there so therefore there's nothing wrong in taking a black cat as a pet uh then this question is from i don't know who uh for what type of illness is rookia done i mean for spiritual illness or can be done for physical illness like any disease cancer infertility hiv bh hbv and any of the like such rupiah can be done to any physical or mental or spiritual illness rupiah is a form of healing so it is a set of verses of the quran prophets hadith or general dua that has a good meaning this is what's rocky so it's good for cancer it's good for your throat ache if you're infected with corona may allah protect us all you can do rakia and it will help it is helpful from black magic evil eye envy gin possession depression anxiety panic attacks the whole nine yards because it is throwing everything in your possession to allah azzawajal expressing your poverty and humility seeking his healing and cure through these verses of the quran and the good words and allah knows best says can you please kindly clarify a dua which is authentic to recite inside my salah allahumma i also would like to know if randomly just simply making simple dura saying or on every thought of my deceased father can it be said or does it become innovation first of all the dua of umar is not a sunnah so this is a random dua that rumor may have said may allah be pleased with him and if the narration is authentic people were wondering how could he be martyred in the cause of allah in madina and die in medina because there are no wars within the vicinity and when he was stabbed by and died in medina they understood the manifestation of the dua nevertheless you can ask allah azzawajal during your salat whatever you want you have debts ask allah to pay off your debts you have illnesses in your in your body ask allah to cure them you fear something ask allah to protect you you wish for something as allah to grant you and whenever you remember your parents and you say there's nothing wrong in that that's a general dua and it said mentioned in the quran and there's no innovation in that and if you maintain saving saying this dua again there is nothing wrong in that as well and allah azzawajal knows best says i'm asking what are the some of its importance this is a highly recommended sunnah the prophet says every child born is depending on his apika some may translate mor as mortgaged or pawned so every child that is born is dependent on his because his would entitle him to intercede if he dies as an as an infant he will intercede for his parents in jannah and this is a highly recommended sunnah that the prophet has did himself for his grandson al-hasan when he slaughtered two rams on behalf of al-hassan and he instructed us to do that on the seventh day of the child's birth to name the child on the seventh day to circumcise the boy male child and to shave the head of the newborn whether girl or boy and weigh the hair that was shaved and give the equivalent of its weight in silver in charity so all of these are part of the recommended things to do and allah azza knows best mahboob says is my prayer valid if i do not elongate in surat al-fatiha this has no impact on the validity of your fatiha or your prayer so if i say that's it prayer is valid the most best way of saying it is to say it with tajweed [Music] but this is not mandatory so say ball lean that's it it does the job zed zubair says how did the prophet salaam fought hypocrites well we know that the prophet allah fight the hypocrites with the sword like disbelievers because the hypocrites pretend to be muslims while inside they're none muslims however as muslims the prophet is our role model he gave us the way not to treat the hypocrites so if it were to him he would have killed them all because they are disbelievers but he didn't because he is giving us a lesson such hypocrites who pretend to be muslims we can only deal with them with what shows to us so they pretend to be muslims we take that as it is as face value what is in their heart is up to their lord as they to hold them to account nevertheless the prophet salam fought the hypocrites by showing us their characteristics their signs what they're well known of how they behave and he told us to be aware of how they act so that we don't fall in the same category allah described them to us in the quran clearly lazy when they pray they never remember allah except seldomly they are neither to the believers nor to the disbelievers and they're in between they plot they betray they break promises they do a lot of things so these were all ways of fighting them once you know them you can be aware from them and you can protect yourself and iman from falling into their category so scholars say that we can only fight the hypocrites by rhetoric by exposing them by showing the whole world and this is nowadays extremely needed because the hypocrites now are not individuals they are countries they are institutions they are people that are backed by the media and they have influence everywhere and you can see when someone does a sin and we are all sinful but you can see when someone is a hypocrite in trying to undermine islam sides with the jews and the christians against the muslims prefers their festivals takes part in their religious rituals whether they're hindus or christians or jews and they participate with them if this is not hypocrisy what is so you have to expose such people and this is how we fight the hypocrites says i've heard a fatwa that if a person starts a nephili act of worship there is nothing prayer or fasting and doesn't finish that act then it is wagib it is mandatory for that person to complete it later on meaning that he has to make it up is there any evidence the answer is no this is not true especially with fasting and praying because the prophet alaihis said to us that when a person is fasting and he's invited to a meal he may eat meaning break his fast or he may make dua it's according to his wish and the scholars all agree that a person fasting voluntary fast is his own commander whether to continue or to break it prayer is the same thing voluntary now hajj is different because once you assume haram and you begin in your umrah or in your hajj there's no going back you have to complete it and if you break it by intercourse or something like that it is mandatory for you to make it up the following year but this is a different story and my question is why when i'm going to do salat i feel anxious please answer bin you need to go to a psychiatrist you need to sit and analyze yourself i don't know you and i don't know why would a person feel anxious before going to salat there are gazillion reasons you may be afraid of the dark and you're praying a place that is dark you may be afraid that you'll nullify your prayer maybe you all have your incontinence or uh um you've continuously passed gas maybe you have so many sins and you're afraid of meeting allah i have no idea whatever the reason is no one can say why except you so you need to sit with a psychiatrist or with a counselor who would listen and ask you various questions and then you may find the answer and allah knows best says if i mistakenly pray prayer one hour before it's time is my prayer valid i don't know what safri is so let us assume that it is one of the five daily prayers if you pray them an hour before its time the prayer is invalid if you pray one minute before the event the prayer is still invalid says has a number of questions number one if a sister who has never been married wakes up at fajr time and sees vaginal discharge and is confused whether this is from what dream or it is natural discharge what should she do nothing the default is that she did not have an external emission this is the default so we would not go to saying that this is seamen unless there is evidence so if it's the normal amount of vaginal discharges then this is vaginal discharge but if you find a lot of it which is unusual then this is most likely to be nocturnal emission or many and you have to make also number two the dua of intimacy is it to be said by the man only the answer is yes the wife is not to say it because this is not from the sun and salvation number three does the jinn and the angels that stay with me know my thoughts in my mind or or my intentions the answer is yes allah has given them this ability fatima afrin says if we find a torn back note if we find a torn back note in our wallet which can't be returned to the owner who gave it to us is it permissible to bend and buy things without telling the shopkeeper about the tear this is a banknote some banknotes has serial number if this is torn usually this is worthless because the bank itself would not take it but sometimes the torn is so little shops don't prefer it but it is totally fine in banks in transactions if it is the first then it is totally prohibited to do this so that the shopkeeper would not see the torn and he would be fooled like you were fooled and buying it this is cheating and it's halal but if it's not something that is rejected it's totally legit and accepted there's no problem in doing that even if the shopkeeper does not like it this is his problem because it's still a valid currency actor says a person if a person sometimes feels lazy or feel like have to do recommended voluntary prayers etc like it or not whether he likes it or not to earn rewards as it misses tranquility sometimes is it a sign of hypocrisy if i understand your question correctly you're saying that if i pray anticipating the reward but i don't like it so i'm doing it because i'm forced to doing it in anticipation of the reward and i i lack tranquility in it different to a person who loves it and he does it out of conviction and he loves allah et cetera am i sinful is it a sign of hypocrisy nothing is no it's a sign of weakness of a man because we know that the hadith of the prophet has said that the jannah is surrounded by hateful things and hell fire is surrounded by desires so these hateful things people by nature find them difficult to wake up early in the morning after only a couple hours of sleep and to walk to the masjid when it's cold or when it's too hot and may you may not find the taste and the beauty of that but this is not a sign of hypocrisy because you're doing it for the sake of allah as which he had taught to al-hassan hadith which the son of allah came to his grandfather when he was like seven eight years of age asking him to teach him eduardo all of this is not related to the prophet saw and hence abiding by the sunnah is far better but if you do the other one there's no problem in sha allah and allah knows best finally afrina khalida says can i recite any of my favorite verses of the quran before i make dua to allah in mesut the answer is no it is prohibited to recite the quran in sujud or the only exception is if the dua you're making in sujud is from the quran so if i'm in sujud and i would like to recite the fatiha this is totally haram if i'd like to recite quran totally totally but if i want to recite rabbana habla name [Music] so reciting quran is totally prohibited making dua from the quran is totally legit and allah azzawajal knows best this is all the time we have and until we meet next monday i leave you here what's up foreign"
