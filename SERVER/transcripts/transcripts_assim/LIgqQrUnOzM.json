  "title": "Ruling on using Kohl (Surma) for men & women - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "for ad from bangladesh what's the ruling on using surma or eyeliners there are hadiths that recommend using an ith mid which is a type of kohl to be applied and it has medical benefits i've never used it myself i'm afraid that i will throw up if i put anything this is why i don't even wear contact lenses because i'm i can't stand the concept of putting my finger in my eyes for no legitimate reason but wearing it is permissible it's not part of the sunnah but it is permissible part of the sunnah because it has medical benefits not religious benefits some scholars said that men must refrain from doing that because it makes them more beautiful and handsome i don't see any harm in men wearing it nowadays it depends on the cultural aspect if an imam or a man wears it and he stands out in a crowd then this is a little bit weird he should not do that publicly but if it's the norm if he wears it for medical reasons and people know that and they accept it i don't think i don't think or see anything wrong in that and allah knows best providing that women try their level best to conceal it and not to beautify their eyes especially if they're wearing the nikab and people can see this kohl and which makes their eyes more beautiful they should try to conceal that and allah knows best you"
