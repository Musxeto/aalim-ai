  "transcript": "Abrar from Bangladesh Wa Jazak. Akhi, this is a big problem because what you've mentioned clearly indicates that you have already fallen into the traps of shaytan and you have a lot of the characteristics found in hypocrites. However, the good news is that you still have some characteristics of believers and this is the fight that you are going through at the moment. Whenever you abandon Salat, you're already one of shaytan's soldiers. Even if you abandon one Salat, you've already become one of his devout followers. Shaytan is very happy with you, he's very pleased, he'll reward you with all types of depression, anxiety and panic. But the bad news is Allah is angry with you whenever you obey and please shaytan. Whenever you think negatively of Allah, you're committing a very major sin because Allah says, I am as my servant thinks of me. So if you think negatively of Allah, Allah will deal with you in such a fashion. And if you think positively of Allah, Allah Azzawajal is most merciful, most forgiving, most compassionate. He would treat you in means that would blow your mind away with his kindness and generosity. So it's up to you what to choose. May Allah make us steadfast on Islam."
