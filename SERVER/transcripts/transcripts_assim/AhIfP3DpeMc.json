  "transcript": "his second question is that he is unable to recite the Quran after fajar as it used to be a habit of his he prays in the Masjid though the message is a bit far but he at hamdullah takes the effort and goes there first of all reciting the Quran is not limited to before or after the Salah of the prayer you can recite the Quran 24/7 you have no limitation for that now if you make it as a habit this is up to you but if now you are unable to finish your portion your daily portion of the Quran due to work or due to that feature is late and you have to leave the Masjid afterwards immediately to for work in this case you have to reschedule your daily portion either you pray it in tahajud either you pray it after the horizontal and Risha or before either you go to the masjid early before the event and once the event is given from the event time till the Akama time there is about 10 to 15 sometimes in some cases 20 minutes which is sufficient for you to finish the Quran once every week if you keep on reading it throughout this period so insha'Allah you have to reschedule at that"
