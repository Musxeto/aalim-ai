  "transcript": "says that he stepped on something once and he removed it with his other foot and then when he went to make wudu he cleaned it thoroughly only to find out later that this was the dung or the droppings of a lizard so should he repeat the prayer or not the answer is no you should not repeat the prayer because washing it does the job first of all second of all it's an issue of dispute whether lizard droppings and dung is nejis or not and those who say it is najis because a lizard is not a an insect or a small type of a creature that has no soul or blood in it it is a big piece of of ins a reptile sort of so they say that okay the droppings of a roach a cockroach or ants or or a fly these are negligible but what about the droppings of mice the droppings of lizards whom we are ordered to kill of course they're nudges but what to do when we have so many of them here we come back to a general rule that whenever things get really tight and narrow islam comes and makes it wide and easy therefore the scholars say that due to the fact that we cannot prevent this from happening in our houses the interaction that mice and lizard in some countries is so overwhelming that you you cannot get rid of them no matter what you do this causes a lot of hardship to people and due to the fact that there is hardship then islam makes it easy and says this is negligible once you cannot get rid of it likewise with cats cats are animals they're not pure to us their urine and dropping is nudges yet due to the fact that they come in our homes and their our pets and they uh come and go the prophet once saw a cat alai and he uh um tilted the uh the bucket or the glass for it to drink from so the companions were sort of shocked why is why is he doing this because they had the notion that this is a najis animal so the prophet said it is okay because this animal is among those that welds among you likewise a donkey for example and this is an issue of dispute among scholars whether the sweat of a donkey is nejus or not because we know the dung and the urine of your donkeys are totally nudges impure but what about the saliva what about the sweat so scholars say that we have no other option but to live with donkeys i'm not referring to any of our relatives but i'm talking about the animal back then they used to need donkeys in commuting in carrying things so they had to mix with it a lot and therefore the burden the hardship of making anything touched by it nudges was uplifted and it was okay so i hope this answers your question nadeem"
