  "title": "Is it permissible to walk hand in hand with my wife and show affection in public? - Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "it's permissible because he's holding her hand and she's holding his hand and they are man and wife but one should not do something that would provoke feelings in the hearts of six people now if he is to hold her hand to help her walk come to stairs or so he would guide her this is okay but if it's holding her hand and just walking down the street goes to each other maybe I say maybe this would not look very nice to someone who has illness in his heart maybe someone who is weak in a man would think negatively about the woman he is holding her hand and maybe he would fantasize things therefore scholars say that this is not supposed to be done in public holding your wife's hand should be done in places where people don't see you because imagine I say no it's okay you can hold your wife's hand while you're walking in the soup or in the supermarket and another one comes and says okay what about if I put my hand around my wife shoulder or by my wife's hip you know and draw her closer to me and we're walking side by side she's my wife but yet she's with wife but you should be respectful and you should protect the feelings of the others as well and there is no reason there is no legitimate acceptable reason for you to do this just because you love your wife if you want to love your wife love her as much as you want between the four doors of your of your room between our behind closed doors but doing it in public this raises a lot of question marks and Allah knows"
