  "transcript": "Sam from Canada. There's a trend unfortunately where people put the hijab over they try to style it or make it uh you know they use it as a form of adornment to and try to enhance the attraction the public. Is this a form of mockery or does it fall under TBA? No, no, no. This is this is not at all a form of mockery of Islam. Mockery of Islam is to make fun of the salat. So for example, I'm praying and I make fun of salat and I do things to make people laugh and I'm making fun of salat. This is kufur. But someone who grows a beard and then he shaves, not shaves it, he trims it and he makes it look so beautiful and he fades it from some sides so that it looks modern. Is he mocking Islam? No. He's sinning. He wants to look more beautiful, more charming. So he thinks a woman who knows that the purpose of hijab is to cover up. So she says, \"I'm covering my head. I'm covering my neck. I'm covering my bosoms. I'm covering my shoulders. But there's no problem in wearing a hat and putting some uh sparkly things and wearing it in a certain uh uh way that makes me a bit attractive. This is big time sinful, but it's not mocking of Islam."
