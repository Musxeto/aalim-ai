  "transcript": "now a lot of people find it best for their concentration to pray while closing their eyes and to know whether this is prible or not to know if this is good or not we have to refer to the Sunnah did the prophet wasam ever prayed with his eyes closed the answer is no one would say how how do you know well because it is part of religion and if the prophet had ever done this it would have been reported To Us by the companions therefore we can rest assure and be certain that the prophet had never prayed with his eyes closed therefore if I do this for something that came up and not regularly this is permissible what do I mean by this for example if I'm praying and all of a sudden uh my child or someone's else child comes in front of me and starts to make faces and this happened while I was praying once in the Masjid and two of the elderly men next to me burst into laughter in the middle of the prayer and after the prayer we discovered that the son of the Imam who was about four or five years old who was sitting in front of them because he was a child all of a sudden he decided to start make faces and he started making these weird faces the two men one of them was 60 years old and the other was 45 years old they could not you know tolerate this and they broke into laughter so if this is the case then yes this is something that is not occasionally happening so it is okay to close your eyes while praying but to do this throughout the prayer no this is not permissible and it is simulating the sufis who usually do such things and Allah Knows Best"
