  "transcript": "afay isn't being a Muslim telling the truth always no matter the cost I like that Muslims do and say according to the result and the consequence of what they do and say meaning if I'm going to do or say something that has bad repercussion and make things far worse Islam tells me stop I'll give you an example in the Quran Allah says in a crystal clear Ayah do not insult the idols that they worship come on insulting the idols is a good thing because it's false it doesn't have anything to do but why Allah says do not insult the idols they worship so they would not insult Allah unjustly so the consequence is what is far dire and serious though insulting the idols is good but if it's going to cause them insulting Islam and insulting Allah refrain this is what you do if I'm going to say the truth or if I'm going to do something that is good what is the consequence it's going to cause someone to die it's going to cause a whole village to be annihilated no stop keep it to yourself but if it's going to cause something good go ahead I don't know if this makes sense or no I understand I understand sorry don't personalize things because when you personalize things it makes the advice watered down so even if I was about to accept your advice when someone WS it down and makes fun of itan is going to make me rejected and not accepted watch out again father figure"
