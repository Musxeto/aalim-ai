  "title": "..will be thrown in hell so his intestines comes out...one who forbade evil but did it himself assim",
  "transcript": "it's been a while how have you been being great alhamdulillah how can I help you so um the prophet said and I quote a man will be brought on the day of resurrection and thrown into the Hellfire so that his intestines will come out and he will go around like a donkey goes around a millstone the people of Hellfire will gather around him and ask oh and so what is wrong with you didn't you used to order us to do good deeds and forbid us to do bad Deeds he will then reply yes I used to order you to do good deeds but I did not do them myself and I used to forbid you to do bad Deeds yes I used to commit them myself and quote Shake is this specific type of punishment reserved for monics or is this reserved for believers who had Faith but were hypocritical in the sense that they didn't practice what they preached this Hadith is known as theith of May Allah be pleased with him and with his father and the Hadith is referring to an individual who is a Muslim so it appears to all of us and the Hadith does not specify whether he's a hypocrite or not but most likely he is a Muslim yet due to the fact that he used to forbid evil yet do it himself and inforce righteousness and and virtue and not do it himself it implies that he was closer to being a hypocrite than an actual sinner because such a punishment is for those who do not walk the talk may Allah forgive us all it's for those who order people and pretend to be righteous while they are deep down through evil and hypocrites each one of us is ordered to do four things to do righteousness and virtue and to order people to do righteousness and virtue so you're ordered to do it and to enforce it you're ordered also to stay away from Vice and sin and you're ordered to forbid Vice and sin if you were to short to fall short from doing one of these four this does not justify you skipping the rest because of that so if I smoke may Allah forbid that this is vice and a sin just because I smoke does not mean I see my son or my friend smoking and not preventing him and prohibiting him from doing so because then I would have committed two felonies two sins so if I smoke that's a sin on me but if I see someone else smoking I have to forbid that so that it would be only one sin that is registered and not two if I do this wouldn't I be falling under the Hadith of us about the one who has uh his intestines uh uh coming out and uh running around it the answer is no because a True Believer it can't be perfect we all have a shortcom and flaws but the Hadith is indicative of a person that does this as a lifestyle like so many unfortunately officials or uh preachers or imams who you can tell and classify as Hypocrites they don't walk the talk talk they mix with women they do Haram things they attend Haram events and yet when they speak they speak like righteous people but you know that they don't walk the talk and you can see this fits them as a glove may Allah protect us all and we all have our flaws and shortcomings but this is different from someone who lives that kind of life and still pretend to be righteous and still in insists to lead the prayer whenever he goes to a Masjid or a gathering thinking that he's the best of all may Allah have mercy upon us all"
