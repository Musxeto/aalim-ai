  "title": "Can we slaughter an animal with no teeth for Qurbani / Udhiya? #Assim #assimalhakeem assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "can we sacrifice an animal that has no teeth or must they have at least two the Hadith where the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam told us not to sacrifice a defected sacrifice an animal he mentioned that it should not be oneeyed it should not be limping can't walk properly it shouldn't be too sick it shouldn't be too thin in the sense that it's chronically too thin there's no meat in it and the scholars looked into these defects and said most likely these defects hamper the feeding process of this animal so it cannot feed well it cannot compete with other animals in grazing or seeing what's good and what's bad and this is why it's so sick and it's not fit to be sacrificed now if there is a Ram or a goat or a sheep that lost all its teeth there's nothing in the Hadith that prevents us from sacrificing it however most likely if it doesn't have any teeth it won't be able to graze and to eat properly and that's would most likely make it too thin so that it would not qualify but if there is no defect in it and it has enough meat and it's a normal uh animal that can be sacrificed then this is permissible and Allah Asel Knows Best"
