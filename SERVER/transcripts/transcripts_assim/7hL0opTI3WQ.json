  "title": "Heraclius:If he was here I would wash his feet & drink the water Heraclius & Prophet's message Assim",
  "transcript": "let's go back to this now this is historical people can go reference this check it up heracles now so this is this was a ruler at that time so he's exposed to islam he's exposed to the last and final messenger sent to mankind prophet muhammed peace and blessings be upon him who often says the brother to jesus moses abraham know all the proceeding messengers he didn't come with anything different he came with the same message worship the one and only creator that heavens and earth the creator not his creation and he's exposed to it so he's saying you know he's testing the waters now and he sees that this is the truth he said what'd he say he said if i was with him i'd wash his feet and drink the water hold on hold on this is really deep for people who admire historical figures like alexander the great and you know uh they watch many of these movies uh braveheart and many of these people out there you know some are even fictional but now heracles this is a real this is not someone from the movies no no the guy gathered all of his priests and monks and head of church and ordered his guards to lock the door and he recited to them the stories and he recited to them some of the verses on uh isa peace be upon him jesus christ and his mother and his miraculous birth and the priests and monks started crying until their beards were were wet christians these are christians crying now because they're hearing the quran they are hearing the quran and miraculous heracles is setting up this meeting now now so after that after he saw them being so emotionally moved by the truth of the quran he said to them so what do you think should we follow him so he just was testing the water in a in a positive way they immediately overturned because their love of power and love of wealth kicked in she said and they started rebelling against him no we will not do this and so much chaos and shouting and disturbance and he knew this this is why he locked the door from the inside so he said no no no calm down calm down i was just testing your iman if you're real believers or not and everything went back to normal so when this reached the prophet sallallahu salaam he said in arabic oh this wretched person he was favoring his wealth and power over islam that's why he would not give it up wow this was unlike unlike the reaction of the persian leader who torn the letter of the prophet and rejected even to reply to him because uh hercules gave the the messenger who came a gift and a concubine and some jewelry back to the prophet's son as a form of honor respect he gave he showed some respect to the level to the level shake of he said i want people to imagine this he said if i was with him i would wash his feet and drink that water yes out of because all christians know of the one that prophet isa prophet jesus peace be upon him gave the glad tidings of his coming and they knew that there was someone coming to fix the world and jesus christ said this in the bible and he said that he'll come after me he will speak not from his own self but he would speak from uh um i'm not a biblical historian so i i'm not zac at night either so you go ahead and check it out can you get them on the phone real quick i wish i wish i seriously i can't but not at the moment so um you find evidences that are beyond doubt that they knew there was some someone coming and we know who this someone is and we can see it through his track record just open your eyes what do people hate about islam there are those who have in it in uh enmity against islam like some european countries without naming them even when the european council came yesterday with an ad showing a woman without hijab half picture and a woman with hijab half picture to show the integrity the um how cultures blend in europe because muslims are a great portion of the population europe it's an ad a woman with no hijab and a woman with hijab they blend them in so half of the girl is without and half is with what happened this european country came up front and said no this is totally unacceptable we object because this denies the christian and the jewish heritage of europe they have hatred to hijab anything that respects women they have a problem with if a woman comes out with a bikini or wearing a thumb good for you that's the thing that's what we like to see they have no fear no bashfulness no shyness they hate islam full stop so you with a beard cut it you wear hijab take it off when corona came people started wearing the mask they they were shocked what can we do they're wearing their head legally they couldn't do anything about it but when it's out of your conviction out of your belief out of your religion no we have a problem so these are great examples for morgan freeman or whoever else doesn't matter the message is open for every everyone uh now you mentioned the persian king you struck an example a contrast here when he and this also now look if someone wants to see if the quran is from the creator of the heavens and earth they want to take a scientific analytical approach they will see that this is indeed from the crate the proof is overwhelming but then you see these small details that are there that are just you know mind-blowing like this example that you were going to give with the persian king there was a prediction in there you can say something that was going to happen and can you go ahead and talk about this when those messengers came and then the prophet muhammad peace and blessings be upon him what did he predict or say something that's going to happen in the future that they didn't even know until like what a month's journey or several weeks journey when the messengers came and they told the prophet and he told the prophet it was one messenger and he told the prophet that this is what the persian emperor did he torn your letter unlike what happened with the christians who honored it and sent with the gift what was in the letter what was the letter about for people that i don't know what's in the letter the letter was simply stating that peace be upon those who follow the guidance of allah azzawajal come to islam and you will be rewarded for yourself and for all those who follow you and if you do not accept islam the message of allah which is to believe in monetism which to believe that the prophet muhammad is the messenger of allah then you shall be punished for your sins and the sins of those who follow you so it's a call to islam it's an invitation with sent with an an a messenger so he out of arrogance out of pride he tore it up and sent the messenger back when the messenger came back to the prophet saw and told him the prophet said two words he said may allah tear his kingdom and on that particular day which the muslims came to know a month or so later when the news came on particular night this emperor was killed and he had no male offspring so his daughter took his position in leading the country which led it to go downhill and we all know how they were conquered by the muslims"
