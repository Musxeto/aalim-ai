  "title": "If we forget 2 say takbeer of movement & say it after reaching pillar Is salah valid assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "well my question is um the mandatory acts in Salah like Allahu Akbar yeah the ascari you say between the pillars if you forget to say when you're coming from example and you remember it once you're standing and erect do you have to say it or it makes a difference no you have to say it now of course you're wrong in saying it after you've reached the pillar because these are known as techbiratul in tecal that is to move from one pillar to the other so it should be done between the two pillars so if I'm in the standing position want to go to sujood I should say Allahu Akbar not Allahu Akbar then move and not after reaching the sujood and saying Allahu Akbar so it has to be in between if I forgot and I reach already the sujood position a lot of the scholars say that prayer is invalid some say this is sinful and the most authentic opinion inshallah is that due to necessity of or ignorance or forgetfulness this is valid once you say it it does the job in Allah Knows Best"
