  "title": "How to get Authentic Knowledge of Islam, there are too many opinions & I get confused",
  "transcript": "knowledge of islam because there are so many books i find where many things are misinterpreted when i ask this to other scholars so one says something other people say something and so on and i get so confused so how can we know that it's authentic or not okay i would probably have a long way for you and a short way the long way is difficult but it tastes good and that is by you doing your due diligence learning islam for your own self to be capable of identifying what is right and what is wrong so you have to learn arabic and be fluent in it you have to learn the quran and study it and read the tafsir you have to learn learn and the different schools of thought you have to learn you have to learn different sciences of islam so that you would become a highly decorated student of knowledge which may take you like five or six years but at the end you will cruise nicely down the highway because you have the ability to listen to shaykh so and so and say the hadith his coding is wrong how do you know i've researched i have my books my references i've did this i did not oh masha'allah you're knowledgeable the short road which the vast majority of muslims usually take because it's easy it's trouble-free and because they're lazy is to select one scholar that you trust that you accept their level of knowledge and that you would as they say take them to the bank because you trust them so much that you're ready to face allah on the day of judgement and say oh allah i'm a layman i'm ignorant i have no knowledge but this sheikh is well known he's reputable and he's not controversial and scholars approve of him and he has logic teachings according to the quran and the sunnah he never brings something out of his own head and he doesn't change color he's consistent so i followed him this would help you and relieve you from stress and from the long way but of course the long way is better and sweeter because it makes you in control rather than being a follower and allah knows best you"
