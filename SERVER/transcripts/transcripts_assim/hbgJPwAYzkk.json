  "transcript": "a way of life a way of life a way of life brothers and sisters in islam welcome to a new episode yet not the first nor the last on the discussion of marriage and we dealt in the last episode with a few critical points in regards to what to look for when trying to find the spouse or the person whom you intend to spend the rest of your life with if allah wills that and i believe that there are some many other qualities which we have not had the chance to address so why don't we begin with the most relevant one to the previous topic the prophet was asked as in the hadith of mercantilism we please with him a man approached him instead of prophet of allah i found a beautiful woman of good lineage but she does not bear children she does not conceive so can i marry her and the prophet said no and we spoke about this hadith before and the man repeated the question twice and thrice and the prophet continues to give a negative reply and then he said o people marry the one who is loving caring and fertile for i will be proud with you or by you on the day of judgment i will boast of your numbers and be proud of that on day of judgement so here the prophet is mentioning some two qualities that one should look in a woman she has to be loving caring and she has to be fertile now for loving and caring this has nothing to do with religion right in the sense that it doesn't have to do with her religious commitment so the personality comes here and it is manifested in her being loving and caring i remember one of my daughters may allah bless her soul she was the most loving and caring of my children to the extent that when she was young even when she was 17 years of age she was once responsible for a school gathering and there was this child that lost his mother it was about like three four years of age and the child was crying my daughter stood next to the child crying with her look because she couldn't take it a woman saw my daughter doing this and she immediately came and proposed for her son she said this is equality and i need in my daughter-in-law of course needless to say my my daughter abdullah is halfway then she is students of knowledge and she's all of this and she's married and she is taking care of her children of her husband and they love each other this is one of the qualities so you should thoroughly investigate whether you're marrying a sister or a sister is being proposed to by a brother both have to investigate thoroughly these little things that people usually neglect because no i want someone who is only religious and i don't care about anything else or i want someone who's only beautiful you know the topic of the of the fertility i don't want to go down there but just uh just a point about that because then that's something very sensitive to the sisters right and it's not in her hands it's in the hands of allah wa ta'ala so i think maybe if you can clarify you know put some context behind does that mean that if a woman is not fertile that khalas that you know men should avoid her and stuff like that it's very this point was addressed actually before but here what the prophet sallam is saying that he said so first of all this is the prophetic advice what should we do take it or leave it that's number one i'm talking to the muslim this is a piece of advice from from the one who is mercy for mankind so he's telling you do this he's giving you a piece yeah i got your point i'm elaborating this he is saying those who are prolific and he mentioned why he mentioned that i want your number i want you to outnumber the other nations on the day of resurrection so this is a wish from the prophet salallahu needs to be fulfilled and anyone loves the prophet he loves also to fulfill the prophet's wish so the scholars they address this issue how can i know that she's going to be prolific as you mentioned she's a virgin she's not married before so they said here hereditary plays vital role sometimes if you see her mother if you see her sisters if you see masha'allah all of them they had children which is this is very important sometimes it is there in the gene of the family they don't wear children it is there and you want to have children so you saw her sisters masha'allah they have many children so most probably okay they are exceptional most probably he is going to be like them so that's how you figure out that he is going to be insha allah prolific and giving children etc and the word which is this with it actually it is this affection and love which is really very important ingredient for the marital life the love i believe that was thinking from the other point of view which is okay if i'm not fertile if a woman i don't conceive i was married once or twice and i allah azzawajal will did that i don't have children does this mean that i'll stay and remain unmarried forever no no it didn't mean that because let's say that a man mashallah has many children and now he's looking for a peace of mind okay he is always having headache at home okay he has a lot of children so he can marry a sister who is barren what's wrong with that if you also if you look at the wives of the prophet salallahu i mean it's a test everybody gets tested in their own way and of course we feel with the sisters who may be barren yet that would be her test in life and for others their children are the test in life it's a fitness for for the family so the mercy of allah is there for those with children and those without children we have to bear in mind that the objective and goal of marriage in islam is to have children children that is one of the objectives of the marriage in islam in the first place other qualities which we should look for well a number of qualities were mentioned in the hadith of the prophet they remember something the the man who came to the prophet sallam and said i proposed a woman from among the amsah he said did you see her he said go and have a look because the answer there are problems with that which means the look here is important okay go and look and see that maybe he has a problem with her eye then this is going to affect your marital life later on so from the beginning go and choose the partner that you feel that that's why the prophet salallahu said among the the qualities of the woman and this is the hadith that i was just going to quote so you will have right yeah it's not elaboration the hadith is crystal clear the prophet was asked which woman are the best and the prophet summarized it by saying it is the woman who when you look at her pleases you and when you address her or instruct her she obeys you and when you leave her or travel away she preserves you and your absence and herself and in your wealth the first is that pleases you when you look at her this doesn't mean that she has to be a not a bombshell this doesn't mean that she has to be miss universe on the contrary even miss universe in three four days once you are acquainted with her she becomes like anyone else even if you go to leaders and heads of states who had beautiful wives yet they did not feel that this beauty prevents them from cheating with an intern with the cigar or whatever so beauty is not as we see it you can everyone this is my conviction every woman is beautiful every single woman is beautiful regardless of what you may think but it depends on the angle how you look at her yeah you may get married to someone who is very regular or low on the scale of in matters of beauty but masha allah she takes care of herself she has a beautiful smile that comforts you and this is what is meant in the hadith when you look at her she pleases you she's always taking care of herself wearing nice clothes even if she's not beautiful but she has the the spirit of a beautiful woman secondly she obeys you when you instruct her in this obedience is essential and i know that probably in the west there are two captains of the boat and it will sink this may not because nowadays there's only one captain but it's not that mad anymore i i wanted to give some advice for the because i know we're doing these these uh programs focused on you know the male and and looking to get married inshallah later on we're going to talk about the female just so the sisters know that this is not just all attacks there's something sure a reminder i want to give to the brothers and that is that a lot of their um images of beauty that they see on the magazines and whatnot is not actually a real human being yes photoshopped as they say and and manipulate it so that woman that they see in the magazine doesn't exist and it's very hard for them to to let this go so then when they go to the sister uh to get married he sees an unphotoshopped version and then he can't find his ideal mate and i just want to remind the brothers that you know to not make those standards i have a sort of uh a rule for the brothers looking to get married i say brother listen it's like this you know if you when you go to see the sister and what you need to think is you know is this someone i can look at you know martial she's you know pleasing to my eye and it's like i went to see your sister once especially when you wake up i want to no this is exactly actually that's the if you wake up in the morning next to her it's like alhamdulillah you know you can see yeah it's not that just like we promised and stay tuned we'll be right back of inshallah welcome back so um as i had assumed and i don't know the unsenior that there's anyone here but what you were gonna say was gonna bring about some replies and so it may not happen that the girl looks ends up looking like her mother sometimes it is sometimes it isn't but i think the point being is that i think we'll agree that brothers we also mentioned this previously have a very high expectation that's based upon a totally artificial concept of beauty that doesn't actually exist brothers need to get real about you know the the sister you're marrying as a real human being have a realistic expectation if she's pleasant to you alhamdulillah it's enough you know i mean if she fits those criteria and she's got dean and she's loving and she's you know this brother said to me okay there's this sister martial she has all the good qualities in the deen you know she's this sister is fantastic i i'd love to marry a sister like that she just doesn't look nice to me i'm saying what's wrong no no i need someone to look like and he mentioned the particular movie star i said you know brother i'll tell you what said okay i can almost guarantee you if i bought this movie star in front of you with hijab yeah without her makeup and her lights and cameras and action yeah and i said marshall is a sister for you said no no she's not really good enough because if you saw her in the real flesh you'd probably think no no this is not what i want and this is the it's a real problem until then now the brother's not married you know it's a it's a real issue you know subhanallah this just reminded me now about a piece of advice was giving from abdullah umar to her son said we want to marry a woman just think with the way when she gets up how she would look in the morning she gets up so in other words you should not be deceived by these looks when you when you see them and you we mentioned that among the qualities that obedience to the husband and unfortunately we are living in a time that something had had happened to the muslim mentality or mindset it's modernism okay it's being invaded so that a woman looks that obeying the husband i'm not a slave they receive it or this how they conceive it here i would like to share with my sisters in particular and the brothers one of the beautiful hadith of the prophet sallallahu and this is a beautiful hadith the prophet saying that when a woman prays the five players which is the minimum requirements okay fire player and fast ramadan and protects herself maintains her chastity and fourth obeys her husband what's the reward it will be said to her on the day of resurrection the day of qiyama enter the jannah enter the jannah through any one of the eight gates subhanallah that's the privilege of abu bakr allah yes it's not this it's not for the men it is for the woman all the gates are telling her coming you can't enter through this gate so obeying your husband you are obeying allah this is how you look to it it is an act of ibadah you are getting closer to allah because the one who told you to obey your husband is allah subhanahu ta'ala upon the tongue of his prophet sallallahu alaihi and the obedience obedience has to be governed now of course you know i've seen there's a brother and inshallah he's married now but he had the big long criteria the whole list that we're going through he had the whole list maybe you shared it with him before so he goes around giving the list to everybody and and he tells brothers you know tell your wife if you've seen this person before like a woman like this so one sister she says oh i know a sister like this and she said yeah mashallah and then what's her name she said she's called and then another brother said because it's like you don't find a woman with all of this another brother said i did find this woman he said but when i went and found out she was looking for a prophet in return because a lot of brothers they delude themselves they have the list they have the list but they're losers and we say she should obey the husband sometimes this guy's mentality it's like he's not even like he doesn't have he doesn't have his guidance and what is he actually doing and i've seen this in the west that a lot of the men need to um step up and be more manly and actually know how to drive and move things forward so i think the issue is a lot more complex than just telling the women just listen to whatever your husband says no it doesn't mean that yeah we are telling this brothers this takes us back to square one we are saying obeying allah regarding your husband we are going to talk about the sisters and the rights of the sisters and that the brother is sometimes they maybe they have memorized only this particular hadith they know it the hadith about the rights of the woman they don't know them so here we are trying to teach our sisters and brothers and educate them and give everyone his due right and i think for all the sisters i mean i think really you know the sisters out there listening this is the hadith of the prophet sallallahu alaihi this is not the prophet this is not someone speaking from his desires yes this is not someone coming up with philosophy this is not someone you know who's done some you know psychological study that needs still needs verification no this is knowledge from allah and i think the important thing here is for a sister listening to think okay what can i learn from this number one it's important to look beautiful to for my husband so allah is telling and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasabi is in the women yes he's saying men look for this and this but it's also a message for the sisters it's a message for them look this is how the man is look this is how the man is he's like this so they should know that you know it's important to your husband that you look beautiful and that when he sees you he's pleased so do your best to be like that why obey the husband this is something important it's interesting in the west that there are many men looking for women from the philippines from east asia why why if you look at the thing is because they are so they just can't handle the modern western woman who you know who wears the pants as they say right they're looking for someone who is you know who is exactly she you know she has those meek qualities and so i think that there's something important it tells us something about the nature of the man as well and the importance of you know they always talk about the male ego yes the male has an ego what's wrong with if you pander to it a little bit let him have his uh say and listen to what he has to say that's important to him that's what gives a man significance that's how a man gets significance in that way so hamdullah give him that space you know and giving that space is all part of not only pleasing your husband but actually in many ways it helps to make society a much more restful place many important dimensions too he has to be just he shouldn't become a dictator and take advantage and you don't obey him in disobedience to allah i want to put a point in just uh you know just the statement when we say the hadith is clear or remember who said this hadith it's little misleading because we take the quran as a whole and we take the sunnah as all we put it together so if somebody just takes one hadith and says the hadith is clear like that's almost like a sign of ignorance because if it's like if you have a deck of cards somebody said oh i know this is like i got this you have to see everything you have to see the whole picture see brother muhammad this then takes us to the beginning which is we are saying that we are muslim i always take you back again okay this is that we are muslims that's why here we even this point that we took a long time but it needs actually to be to be clarified that we are muslims okay so allah is telling this prophet sallallahu assalam is telling this okay and he is addressing both men and women so everyone has to do his part okay so because at the end of the day this life is short transient allah is going to end this life we are going to die we're going to meet him so so it's an act of worship if you may allow me and in a nutshell what you've said is correct 100 you cannot come to a hadith or a verse and extract it out of context and say this is it you have to look at the holistic and the truth like it's so clear but but to be able to say you're not allowed to take this hadith out of context you have to bring some other evidence to prove that what the hadith was mentioned all of evidences are correct and authentic so when we come to the issue of obedience we have to agree that a woman must obey her husband but what is the uh parameters of disobedience if a husband says to his wife stand on your right foot for an hour on the corner simon says this is not obedience no one in islam would say yes sister you have to obey your husband you have to stay on your right foot standing up for an hour no one says this so what kind of obedience are we looking for the obedience that falls within the parameters given to the husband sheikh how do you explain the hadith and i think it's in tabarani and as far as i know it's an authentic narration sheikh muhammad won't let me take it out of context he can correct me where the the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said if you and i don't remember the colors of the mountains but the prophet said if your husband says climb up the red mountain and go down and climb up the green mountain and go down and climb up the blue mountain and go down if you can do it you should do it i do not believe it's authentic i have never heard of it well there's there are other narrations to that but there is authentic narration but which is authentic narration when a woman came and this shows actually the the graveness of the man's rights upon the woman really that his rights are too much upon her when just imagine this and this is the one who is talking is the prophet is a girl came and said said o prophet of allah what are the husbands like and he said salla sallam if imagine he this is the picture that he he gave her tell us the picture and we will elaborate on it inshallah in the next episode that he said if he got wounds all over his body and all these wounds are oozing with pus and she licks all these wounds with her tongue that will not fulfill the rights of the husband did the prophet sallam meant it did he mean it literally of course not no but what he wants the the message to teach us that you try your best you try your best because in the other hadith he is your heaven and he's your health which means if you please him and humans should not feel much allah okay because we are going to balance it when we talk in sha allah about that it's in the next episode and i want to just like drop the little point before we go to the next episode and that is that the man is taking these things he's taking these hadith and he's like this is my right hand so the blame on those brothers whom needs to be educated okay and we'll talk about that we'll try to educate them inshallah in the very next episode a way of life"
