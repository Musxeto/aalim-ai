  "transcript": "we live in the west and so we don't hear the aan from the mosque we have an automated aan clock in our house and I wanted to know is it permissible for us to respond to that and listen to it as it were the real aan from the Masjid the answer is no so many times people make the mistake and think that whenever I hear an aan I have to say exactly as he says and then say the Dua that we all know but this is not actual because this person who is offering the aan is not there he's not real this is something that was recorded therefore this is not a proper aan and you may not say behind himb Etc you have to say this only when you're hearing it from radio and it's live so this is a person live doing the Adan or when you hear it from a Masjid from a mosque where the MU is doing it of course at the present time the other issue is that a lot of the Muslims in the west Depend and rely on these alarm clocks to notify them of the time of prayer so is this permissible the answer is it depends if uh you you think that it is accurate and you've made your research and people told you yes this alarm clock is giving aan on the right time it is permissible for you to follow it give it a buffer zone it's just to be on the safe side otherwise no you are requested to look and try to observe it other than that you do not uh uh pray unless you are certain that the time is due so so many people pray 15 minutes before time this is not permissible their prayer is not accepted and Allah would not accept it uh for them they have to pray on time to be on uh uh the correct thing of doing it because Allah says in the Quran verily that prayer was mandated on particular particular timings upon the Believers so you cannot pray one minute before the Salah and this is an a crucial point when people depend entirely and blindly on these alarm clocks not uh trying to know exactly whether it is time for prayer or not I believe that this is all the time we have so until we meet next time bar"
