  "transcript": "[Music] I have exams during Ramadan and I become extremely tired while fasting can I miss a fast for a day or two and keep them up later will I be sinful first of all to become tired due to an exam come on give me a break I know pregnant women in their seventh and eighth month of pregnancy and they fast and they manage it why is it to be tired sitting there with a paper and a pen and answering the questions this is ridiculous Muslims used to go to war while they were in the state of fighting though Allah has given them the permission not to fast and you are complaining and whining for a couple of hours you sit this is totally prohibited it is unacceptable none whatsoever to skip days of Ramadan with the justification of studying or going through an exam this is totally unacceptable am i sinful definitely you are sinful big time fasting Ramadan is a fault it's a pillar of Islam you can't simply just skip it and justify this by saying I have an exam it has no impact rather as we've stated so many times before the blessing comes from Allah the Baraka comes from Allah the strength comes from Allah if you are on good terms with Allah Allah would help you and support you well llahi among the biggest losers are those who neglect unlost duties so they don't fast and they go to their exams and they get bad grades or they fail what have you gained you've lost the dunya and you've lost the other so trust Allah depend on him and have full reliance on him go to the exam with positive Shiva T that Allah would give you the strength and inshallah you'll do well [Music] [Applause]"
