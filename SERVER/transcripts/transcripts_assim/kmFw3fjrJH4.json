  "title": "Is it ok to curse a Disbeliever Ruler that oppresses Muslims? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "he asked a question which is irrelevant to us that none the disbelievers rulers or some disbelievers may oppress muslims so can we curse them if they are not muslims they are cursed by default so there is no need for you to go there whether they are prison muslims or not for failing to accept islam they will abide in hellfire for eternity this is not my word this is the quran if they heard about islam if they heard about islam a quran if they heard about monetism if they heard about the prophet islam and they rejected all of that they said no we want to abide by all religion this religion of yours is not good for us this is their choice we are told our prophet tells us haslam that they will be abiding in hell for eternity will never ever leave it for eternity so cursing them is not a treat of is not a characteristic of muslims the prophet said islam a muslim is not a one who slaunders nor curses nor uses profanity or abusive language a real mean a real believer so this is the prophet's teaching to us so we should not go down to this level of cursing people but sometimes we meet people who curse would we say it to them don't do that if they ask us our opinion we tell them if they want to keep on cursing this is up to them it doesn't harm me the bit it's making dua is making dua wrong is it an offense is it a crime the prophet said allah the worst of your leaders are the ones who curse you and you curse them and the best of your leaders and he's referring to muslims are those who pray for you and you pray for them this is how you identify whether a leader is just fair and kind to his people or not of the beat of the streets what they say about him or them so it is best for a muslim to refrain from such cursing and to avoid going this low in allah you"
