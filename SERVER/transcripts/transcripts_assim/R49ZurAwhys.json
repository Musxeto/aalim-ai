  "transcript": "all right Sheikh um these questions say that you spoke about being sincere totally to Allah it is is it permissible to record videos and show to the public when we are doing charity because the donation we receive are from public I don't understand the question is it okay for her to you know uh when they go for charity to make videos and make uh pictures and they share with the public because the public actually gave them the money okay yeah I believe that videoing poor people or people in need and using their footage to draw money from the rich and make them feel sorry for how poor they are that this is degrading and humiliating Allah tested me with poverty I am in need I am a poor Muslim but this doesn't mean that it's allowed for you to go and do whatever you want to do with my picture and my footage like that this is Haram so some people say okay what about if we take that permission of course they will give you their permission because they want your money so it's like forcing them to concede to accept when they are in deep need of it this is not fair it's not fair for people to go and shoot for example um in Syria houses that are burnt or uh destroyed and and poor people outside who've lost their loved ones crying and weeping and we video that just to show them the atrocities that are taking place these people have honor and dignity and we should not do this or use that and Allah"
