  "title": "Are the Sunnah prayers 'Must' for the validity of the five daily prayers?! Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "of the sunnah prayer usually when we say sunnah prayer we are referring to what is known in arabic as a relative and these are twelve Rakas mentioned in the hadith of them habiba and others may allah be pleased with them where the Prophet said as some whoever observes twelve records per day and night Allah would build him a house in Jannah so two rakahs before fajar fall occurs before lahore two Rakas after the whole two records after Malik and two occurs after Asia these are 12 records you observe them Allah so John would build you a house in Jannah is it a house per day or for the whole lifetime most likely it is observing it so you have to maintain observing it throughout your life now in the subcontinent India Pakistan Bangladesh etc masha'Allah as a Saudi I envy them because they install and the children the love of this sooner however they goes a little bit to the extreme to the extent that they feel it is mandatory and that their prayer of the is not valid if they don't pray the four before and the two after and this is extreme yes to bring your children to value these Sooners that's that's one of the best things you can do and I am envious whenever I see the people from that subcontinent especially the children observing these prayers and I wish my kids would do the same as well however we have to strike the right and correct balance the Prophet item when he was approached by a nomad and he said is asking about Islam so he told him among what he asked in the long hadith tell me about prayer so the prophet of allah told him that there are five daily prayers per day and night and the man said anything else and the Prophet said no unless you would like to add something voluntarily so if you want to volunteer and offer these not obligatory prayers that's good the man said by Allah I will not add a single thing to it and the Prophet said if you want to look at someone fronting from the inhabitants of paradise look at this man which means that the sunnah prayers are not mandatory they are not obligatory so if you pray only the five fault daily prayers that's sufficient however you lose a great deal of reward because our prayers are not perfect and they need to be completed and the shortcomings need to be addressed and this is done by offering the twelve records of the student as for the vision your friend's grandmother saw"
