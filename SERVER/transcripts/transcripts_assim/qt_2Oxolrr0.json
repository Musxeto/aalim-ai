  "transcript": "a brother says what if I urinate between my hustle do I have to start from the beginning again first of all we have to differentiate between performing hustle and performing Woodill performing woudl is a continuous process so if you start with washing the face turning the water in your mouth and rinsing your nose washing your arms and the elbows wiping over your head and your ears washing your right foot to the ankles while you were washing your left foot you passed wind this is a whole unit your rule is broken it's no good it's invalid you have to begin from the start from the beginning Russell on the other hand is different because Russell was mandated due to ejaculation intercourse or menses so once you begin the process of whistle you are actually uplifting the major ritual impurity which is either janaba or Hyatt or NEFAs now if you urinate during this process during performing Russell this has no impact on your whistle it has impact on your woudl hence after you finish your whistle you must perform mudal if you want to prefer to pray afterwards if there is no time if you're going to bed for example and you're performing whistle after having intercourse with your wife and during the process you urinate and then you finish your whistle and move on you don't have to perform modal because you're not gonna pray but if you want to pray you must perform a waddle because by urinating your major ritual impurity has been uplifted there's no problem because of the hustle but you your your minor ritual impurity is still on because of your urinating"
