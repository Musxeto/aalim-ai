  "transcript": "him to help then they have a problem Allah instructs an angel to come but in the format of a human being which tells you how precious and valuable humans are to Allah Allah is honoring them in making this angel look like a human being and he's the judge so he rules that measure the distance between his own Village and the village of the righteous people he was going to and to whatever he's closer he belongs to it so they start measuring and it is the mercy of the one and only Allah Asel Allah instructs the good Village to come closer and he instructs the bad Village to go a bit further and when they measure it they find him closer to the good Village and Allah instructs them to take his soul to Paradise this is Allah's Mercy the almighty this is the change that we inflict upon ourselves it is positive change it is change that is recommended by Islam but on the other hand there is change that we must not follow or do and Islam condemns it for example if a person who's a Muslim decides that he would like to change his religion is this accepted definitely not this is known to be an act of apostasy it is worse than treason and if a person betrays his country he would be faced with a capital punishment he would be executed this is worse than betraying your country you're betraying Allah the almighty the prophet sallallahu alaihi Al wasallam also feared the change of the heart so many times we may wake up in the morning and Feel So Strong full of Iman full of belief in Allah Asel that we can spread Islam to the whole of human Humanity we're so positive and sometimes we wake up in the morning feeling so depressed so bad so down that we doubt are we Muslim or not that is why the prophet used to supplicate a lot to Allah by saying oh Allah the one who turns Hearts over make our hearts steadfast in ADH Heering to your religion this is what he used to supplicate not once not twice most of the time and that is why the companions may Allah be pleased with him ask him oh prophet of Allah are you afraid why do you always say this and he used to say that the hearts are between two of Allah's fingers and he flips them as he will Wishes the almighty and that is why we should be afraid and if we look at a lot of well not a lot at some of the practicing Muslims how they had changed if you look at some of the diis some of the scholars some a minority whom had changed their manhaj their methodology their way of thinking after they were steadfast on the religion they started to compromise they started to give in they started to retreat bit by bit either for fame and this Burns people Fame and Glory Burns people changes the heart before he was famous he was a good practicing Muslim mashallah following the Sunnah once he became famous he changed he flipped he started giving in and surrendering and retreating he's going back either because of fame or because of wealth and they always follow the highest bidder or because of desires and whims they are weak so in order to justify their weakness they twist the verses and the hadiths we've seen this a lot unfortunately and this is all due to the flipping and twisting of hearts and that is why we are afraid a proper Muslim is always afraid and he prays to Allah oh Allah don't let me turn back on my heels don't let me Retreat make me steadfast on the right path as you wish and desire among the changes that Islam fights and rejects are the changes of Satan Satan is working his best to change our nature our which Allah has created all mankind with if you look at any child that is born he is Born On Believing in the the Oneness of Allah he is born on the nature of monism so if this child was to be left alone on an island he would become worshiping Allah not knowing how to pray not knowing how to fast because this comes through Revelation but he knows that there is only one Creator and that is Allah the almighty this is the nature that Shan that Satan is playing with and changing as in the Hadith of the Prophet Alat wasam any newborn child is born on Islam and his parents make him a Christian a Jew or a fire worshipper so it's the parents it's the environment that changes this F and this is all the handiwork of Shan Allah the almighty tells us verily and this is Satan speaking verily I will mislead them and surely I will arose in them false desires and certainly I will order them to Slit the ears of cattle and indeed I will order them to change the nature created by Allah and whoever takes Satan as a w instead of Allah has surely suffered a manifest loss so this this is the handiwork of Satan as Allah tells us in the Quran explore the options option match the qualities assure the success success what happens at schools or more specifically what happens inside the the classroom the classroom the classroom good qualities of classrooms interactive challenging collaborative distributive Focus student centered let's together examine the quality of Education that is provided to our children to judge this quality precisely join me on P TV join Dr MDU Muhammad in teaching at school every Sunday Tuesday and Thursday at 6:00 p.m. Saudi Arabia and 7 p.m. UA on peace TV where truth is hidden and misleading quotations create confusion where truth is hidden lack of knowledge and wisdom cause upheaval and commotion where truth is headed manipulate scriptures and twisted facts emerge this very hidden truth creates false propaganda meim chaos disorder and turmoil in our lives and the world order but is there anyone with courage and [Music] wisdom what is the truth and who has the courage to expose [Music] it because it's your right to know the truth watch truth Prevail and lies perish in Truth Exposed by Dr Zakir Nik next on peace TV the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam cursed a number of women who follow Satan the prophet saysat wasam Allah has cursed the women who do tattoos and those who ask for tattoos to be done look around you how many people do tattoos nowadays in the west we have lots of people tattooing themselves and this is definitely a sign of Satan's handiwork the prophet saysat wasam those who ask for their eyebrows to be plucked eyebrows to be plucked how many women among the Muslim women pluck their eyebrows this Hadith isn't it is beyond doubt it is a sin let me rephrase that it is a major sin to pluck the eyebrows even if it were to please the husband it is forbidden and it is a sin the prophet goes on to say sallallah Ali wasallam and the women ask for their teeth to be filed for the purpose of beautification changing the creation of Allah if a woman goes and gets her teeth filed so that it would leave spaces and gaps that was at the time of the Prophet Alam means of beautification and he justified this by saying changing the creation of Allah therefore change can be positive and it can be negative for example Allah condemned people who refused to change by saying and similarly we sent not a Warner before you Muhammad sallallahu alaih wasallam to any town but the luxurious ones the people with the money the luxurious ones among them said we found a our fathers following a certain way and religion and we will indeed follow their footsteps this is condemned by Allah and we have a lot of Muslims like this when you tell them Allah says in the Quran so and so or the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam says so and so they refuse to follow and they say well my Sheikh my IM my Guru my forefathers used to worship Allah in this way I will follow it we say brother I'm quoting a verse from the Quran Allah revealed this Quran for you the prophet said sallallahu alaihi wasallam this Hadith for you said yes I know but I will not change I'll die like this I'd rather follow my grandfather I'd rather follow the Imam of the Masjid who I I give 20% of my income what are you doing are you a Muslim do you say or this IM is my and he is the one who's leading into Paradise this is a condemnation from Allah to those who refuse to change but what kind of change the positive change change in accordance to the Quran and the Sunnah are you worshiping Allah or you worshiping your IM your mhab your forefathers this is what every Muslim should think about Allah the almighty also prais and complimented people for not changing in the first verse he condemned them because they refuse to change and in here he Praises others for not changing or altering what they were believing in Allah says among the Believers are men who have been true to their Covenant with Allah of them some have fulfilled their obligations that is they have died as Martyrs and some of them are still waiting but they have never changed in the least and Scholars say that this verse and the likes of it were revealed in may Allah be pleased with him and also in the uncle of anbn Malik who missed the Battle of Badr because the prophet went to the Battle of Badr sallallahu alaihi wasallam thinking that it was not a battle with the kufar it was only a caravan that he wanted to take an abduct but when he reached there and he found that it was an Army he engaged with them and Allah grant them Victory did not go with the prophet Alam because the prophet did not instruct them and order them to go he said whoever was ready let him come and who's not ready stay so when he knew of that battle he felt really sorry and depressed and he said by Allah if the prophet will have another war with the disbelievers by Allah he will see how I perform and that was it he did not say a single word after that and when it was the Battle of on the third year of Hijra a year later he went and fought he did not speak met him and he said anas where are you going that was before the battle he said I smell Paradise from Beyond I can smell it I can feel it I'm going there ANB Malik says that after the battle was over they looked for him and could not find him and finally they found a mutilated body with 80 Strokes of spear sword Arrow 80 plus in his body only his sister recognized him by his fingers they could not recognize him at all and they say that this verse among the Believers are men who have been true to their Covenant with Allah of them some have fulfilled their obligations that is some have been martyred they say an is one of them there is of course a form of change that all Muslims should refrain and abstain from you should stay away from it and this is something that undermines Islam this is known as B Innovation the prophet sallallahu alaih Al wasallam told us that I will be the first one to reach the pool I'll be the first one to reach there and whenever my umah come whenever any person of my umah comes I will give him a drink from his hand from The Prophet's handam I pray to Allah that he grants us this honor and that we drink from his hand sallallah alaih wasallam and then the prophet says I see people of my umah coming but the angels are pushing them back so I say oh Lord Allah umtiti they are my Nations and the prophet Alat wasam is answered by saying you do not know what they have innovated after you and that is why they're being rejected they have innovated so many things in your religion that does not qualify them to come and drink from your hand and the prophet saysat wasam destruction and doom befalls on those who innovate after me Innovation is a very serious thing the prophet warned us and he said that whoever innovates in my religion in the religion of Islam this is rejected Allah will not accept it from him a musri A disbeliever can repent by asking Allah for forgiveness and he becomes a Muslim a sinful person person repents he knows that he's doing something wrong so he repents an innovator never repents why because he thinks he's doing something correct that's why he would never ever repent and you try this we have lots and lots of innovators in Islam if Allah wants to guide them they would think and realize the truth from falsehood but if not no matter how long you talk to them it will never ever be fruitful and that is why we always instruct people when you talk when you advise when you debate when you have a dialogue with anyone who is an innovator never ever say scholar so and so said and Scholar so and so said always get them back to the [Music] basics am this is what Allah will ask us about on the day of judgment Allah will not tell us on the day of judgment what did Sheikh so and so say what did Imam Ahmed say what did Imam shafii say what did Abu hanifah say what did Malik say Allah will not ask us about this Allah will ask us only about the Quran I said in the holy book of Quran so and so why didn't you do it my prophet am said so and so why didn't you follow it oh Allah I followed this Imam I followed this Sheikh I had a problem I had a question there were so many TV satellites channels so I clicked on this one and he gave me a fatwa I took it do you know this Sheikh no do you know his upbringing no is he following Sunnah or not no but he comes on TV Subhan Allah anyone who comes on TV becomes a Sheikh we have singers we have dancers we have actors they're all sheh you are instructed to follow the Quran and the Sunnah and not to follow humans who make mistakes humans who change as we've just mentioned it's easy to change but the Quran and Sunnah never change follow them and inshallah you will know the concept of change that Allah asael approves of and you will refrain from the change that Allah asael does not [Music] [Music] approve [Music] oh [Music] oh"
