  "title": "If I don't move index finger during Tashahhud & do not look at my finger, is my prayer valid",
  "transcript": "Fahim from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi So Sheikh I heard the hadith that we should move or shake the index finger and look at it while Tashaud. However during Tashaud I look at the place of prostrations and I don't move or raise index finger because I am not used to do that. So in the last Tashaud when I recite At-Tahiyyat Allahumma Salliwala Muhammad, Allahumma Inni Jalanto Nafsi and Allahumma Inni A'udhu Bikamin Could you please specifically tell me that in these four parts is there anything wrong if I look at the place of prostrations and what's the recommended sunnah to look at in each of this part and should we move or shake finger until saying Salam? Why don't you add three more questions Akhi just to make it half a dozen maybe that would make it easier. We said only one question. Anyhow the hadith of Wael ibn Hujur may Allah be pleased with him that the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam used to point with his index finger moving it making dua with it. The hadith of Abdullah ibn Zubair may Allah be pleased with him and with his father says that he used to point his index finger and not move it. So the scholars took the first hadith to be evidence that this companion saw something the other one did not see. Either way it's a sunnah. So if a person does not raise his finger at all, he just keeps his hand like this, the prayer is totally valid and correct. If he does this and moves it throughout the prayer according to the hadith of Wael ibn Hujur may Allah be pleased with him, then he is doing the sunnah. If he looks at his index finger throughout the sitting position, he is doing the sunnah. If he doesn't, he looks at the spot of his prostration, no problem. The prayer is still valid. These things are sunnah. If you do it, you'll get more reward. If you don't do it, your prayer is valid and you're not sinful if you skip it for any reason, and Allah knows best."
