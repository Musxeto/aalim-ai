  "title": "Should we say the intention(Niyyah) for Umrah & Hajj verbally or make it in our heart?-Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "do we say the intention of umrah and hajj verbally or is it sufficient to make it by heart now the reason of this confusion that a lot of the Muslims have is that they hear the majority of schools of thought stating that intentions place is in the heart and it is an innovation to verbally say it while in the Shaffer school of thought for example they say that it is Sunnah to verbally say it so if I want to pray I say I intend to prayer Asia prayer today Saturday the 25th of November or whatever the Imams name is so-and-so and he is like 6 foot tall and so they give like a manifest of what they are to do of course this is not right they say how dare you say it's not right it is there in a school of thought that is respected and I say definitely I respect the school of thought of the Schaffer email hub and it is one of the greatest meth labs in school of thought around however never ever the Prophet s awesome has pronounced the intention so no you're making a mistake I'm gonna catch you in this one the Prophet did uh tur the intention when did he add the intention this is what we will find out don't dodge the question you claim that the Prophet s Tom had never uttered the intention well he did when he performed Hajj when he said Lebec allahumma Rome rotten WA Hajin so this is uttering the intention and the majority of scholars say that no you misunderstood this this is not an utterance of intention because I've just said it does this mean I have to take off my clothes and wear my alarm lebec allahumma labbayk allahumma Hajj I've repeated so many times do I have the answers no there is a difference between the intention and the talbiya and the only form of worship that you utter something like this is Hajj or Umrah and this is known as tell VA it's not known as intention so if someone goes of his home traveling to make room bruh to Mecca and when he passes by the mere part he takes off his clothes he wears his mom he praised the two raka of soon natal lover for example or for woudl and he makes the intention with his heart that now I'm in the state of a farm if someone comes to put some perfume on me I would refrain because I'm wearing and he forgot to say labbayk allahumma hemara when he reaches Mecca do we say oops you did not make your intention go back to the male part no saying it is part of the Sunnah but it is not part of the NIA itself and that is why the Nia is in the heart when you want to go to the bathroom do you say in your heart or verbally I intend to go to the bathroom I have a 101 or 102 no when you want to eat the Brioni plate in front of you do say I intend to eat the Brioni with chicken or stop for Allah it is Brioni with meat no you just simply go bismillah eat the intention is in the heart and so on with all forms of bad we have Abdul Rahman from Saudi"
