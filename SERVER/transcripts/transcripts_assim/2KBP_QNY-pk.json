  "transcript": "Saudi Arabia he says that in India there is the practice of chanting after the congregational PR prayer Allah so is this practice from the Sunnah in India and elsewhere whatever you see being practiced by maanas or so-called sh or imams or Scholars you cannot take that for granted because we know that there are so many deviants around who do not follow the Quran and the Sunnah and unfortunately in your country there is a big problem now I've seen a debate couple of days ago where a panel made of non-muslims and they brought one so-called Muslim and they were attacking a celebrity a great dii of Islam and they're bashing him and saying that he is an extremist he's a wahhabi he's a salafi he calls for this he calls for that all are lies definitely big blatant lies so the commentator was coming and saying that Islam is not like this Islam is not stoning Islam is not allowing so and so so he was listing Jihad stoning um he says oppression of women um having the non-muslims as second class Etc all of these things that some are correct in Islam and some are controversial but you have to explain it so he was attacking this di by listing all of these things and then he gave the microphone to one of them grave worshippers supposed to be a Muslim representing Muslims and defending Islam he neglected all of these lies about Islam and he said yes yes yes Islam came here by the socalled sheh so and so Imam so and so and he is neglecting the attack on Islam accepting all the lies being said about Islam only to promote his grave worshipping beliefs what a shame when someone said sells his religion his Islam for a very cheap price so you have a problem with SOC called maanas or called d uh Scholars grave worshippers who take money from people they're being rich from the poor giving them salvation giving them Jenna so they claim if you follow me don't follow him don't follow that we as Muslims we do not buy this we say okay follow Islam follow the Quran don't follow me don't follow Muhammad Salah don't follow XYZ follow Quran and Sunnah if we go against Quran and Sunnah ditch us throw us in the garbage we have no problem with that we defend the Quran and the Sunnah of the Prophet Alam so coming back to your question you ask yourself did the prophet ever do such an act after Salat s alhi wasallam would he turn around and face the Companions and say what is this come on have some sense said no no no the prophet did not do this he didn't want to praise himself did Abu Bakr do it did Omar do it did Ali all the companions may Allah be pleased with them none of them did it so in a nutshell this is an innovation"
