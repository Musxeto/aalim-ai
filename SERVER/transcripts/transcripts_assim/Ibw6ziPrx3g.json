  "transcript": "and uh in siram from australia my question was that if the prophet's name is mentioned during the hotbar um are we allowed to send salawat on him or is this considered as talking during the hotbar okay i will answer inshallah in sram from australia he says if we hear the name of the prophet isalam during the friday sermon should we offer salutation the answer is yes but you're not going to say muhammad and make a scene out of it you're just going to say it without verbalizing it by just saying that's it whispering it to yourself there's nothing wrong in that and it's not speaking inshallah and by the way it's like saying i mean when the imam makes do of course we don't raise our hands but we say i mean and and this is not considered to be talking"
