  "title": "If a man does not pray in the masjid, are his prayers invalid? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "a lot of the Muslims after hearing this may jump to conclusion and say in this case a man who does not pray in the masjid is not a proper Muslim and his prayer is invalid and answer is no there is a difference there is a difference between your prayer being valid and your sinful at the same time from your prayer being invalid so those who pray in their homes though they are next to the Masjid indeed they are sinful but they're still Muslims and their prayers are valid but they will be held accountable for not complying with the instruction of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam"
