  "transcript": "a brother says can jinn commit intimacy with a woman when the husband does not say the prior dua can ajin make her pregnant can the jinn have intimacy this is from the unseen when we have no evidence from the quran or from the sunnah that backs it up there is a that imam mujahid says this is possible but this is not from the quran or the sunnah and he's not from the companions to give that verdict of his or her opinion of his any um verification or any strength can ajin make her pregnant the answer is definitely not this is totally uh not possible they are two different species and that would open the door for any woman to come and after fornicating or committing adultery she's pregnant she says well ajin impregnated her this is not acceptable now the dua is bismillah that a man says before being intimate with his wife so this is the most authentic opinion and allah knows best"
