  "transcript": "sh we have a lot of apps today where we can transfer money from one country to another country for example if I want to transfer 101 uh to Pakistan it will change automatically to I think it's around 3,000 rupees um sometime it can take a couple of seconds to transfer sometime a couple of minutes sometime a couple of hours um but the original amount is respected so even after a couple of hours and the currency rate has changed it will still respect the original amount uh is this allowed or not first of all in transactions of gold silver or monetary Bank notes or currency it has to be simultaneous now with banks and these apps that are trusted and they to take the same ruling of Banks and financial institution institutions that are backed by the uh Central Bank and they're trusted what happens is that you buy or exchange the currency and you agree to that and then you authorize them to transfer it to the the desired destination so the first transaction was done simultaneously Â£10 equivalent to 3,000 rupees agreed boom done now I'm asking them to transfer it to uh laor Pakistan so they do this either instantaneously or they may take a day or two depending on their procedures weekends and the likes there's no problem in that none whatsoever inshallah"
