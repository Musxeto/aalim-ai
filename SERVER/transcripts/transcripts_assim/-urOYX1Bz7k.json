  "title": "Teacher made joke about Allah creating heavens, earth in 6 days I laughed Is it kufr assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "was attending a lecture on Evolution and teacher was teaching about the origin of universe he was explaining a theory which was based on Bible uh like he stated that all the life forms were created in six days now what happened is that after saying this as I believe he is uh somewhat not religious what he said is that uh like after this like he in a mocking way he said that you know why these uh were created in six days because uh like britishers have a custom that on the seventh day it is Sunday so so like he moed basically I laughed at that moment and I did know that the like this Theory had some similarity with the Quran like was it kuer and will have to do redo the prayers and take a whle it is without doubt known to every Muslim that Allah created the heavens and the Earth in six days and it's mentioned in the Quran as it's mentioned in the Bible with a little bit of a Twist now if someone mocked this fact without doubt this is an act of apostasy and kufur because he's mocking a Divine fact and something about Allah if a person does this out of ignorance not knowing that this is a fact like in your case you did not know that that Allah created the heavens and the Earth in six days and you laughed because of that this is not kufur kufur requires conviction and knowledge and if you did not know about it Allah's Mercy would be sufficient inshallah that it would incubate you and Allah would forgive you for your ignorance but you have to be careful next time and learn your religion better than that"
