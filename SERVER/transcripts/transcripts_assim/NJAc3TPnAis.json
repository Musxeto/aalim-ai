  "transcript": "second question for um abdan from RI she's asking about uh dying the hair in black and I couldn't understand her question uh because mallah she was like doing 160 mil per hour um but I if I understand her qu uh uh correctly she's asking about a person who is Young like 20 25 years of age and all of a sudden his hair goes white whether he was frightened or uh for some genetic reasons and the poor guy instead of being 20 or 25 years of age he looks like as if he's 50 so in this case is it permissible to uh um dye his hair in black and the answer is yes why because this is removing an abnormality in Islam normal if if if someone my age comes and says listen I have some white hair and I'd like to Dy it in Black because I'm interested in getting married again uh this would not be permissible why because this is the natural color of the hair at this stage of age if someone comes to me and he's like 35 or 34 years of age and he wants to dye his hair in Black because he said that I'm still young the answer is no someone who's like 17 and 20 maybe 25 yes this is an abnormality and you are entitled to dye your hair in Black if you are able to dye it in other colors than black like dark brown that would be even uh better just to be on the safe side"
