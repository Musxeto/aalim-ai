  "transcript": "people they I hear like you have to not eat 15 20 minutes before fuder because it's safer um but it's just like a Sunnah that they they don't eat 20 15 minutes 15 20 minutes before fuder something sooner or is okay to eat like two minutes before fuder you are allowed to eat and drink and do whatever you want until the Break of Dawn this is what's mentioned in the Quran what so many ignorant people do when they print the calendar of the whole prayer time of Ramadan you would see then then and 15 minutes later why is this 15 minutes just to be to be safe did the prophet ever had the prophet ever done such a thing they said no on the contrary in the Hadith it says that between the of the Prophet Alat and the of the prayer not thean the was approximately 100 verses or 50 verses meaning that the prophet used to eat and drink until the very very last second once thean of is given this is where we refrain to give a buffer zone of 10 or 15 minutes this is baseless"
