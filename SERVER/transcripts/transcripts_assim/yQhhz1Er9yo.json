  "transcript": "Muhammad from Canada. My question is sometimes when I pray, \nI feel like a pop coming from my back but I didn't hear anything and I didn't smell \nanything. Do I have to redo my Wudhu or it's ok? Are you certain? What do you mean certain? Are you certain that you passed \nwind or it's just a doubt? If it's a doubt, move on and ignore it. Because only when you're 100%, not 99.9% Only when you're 100% certain you passed wind is when you redo your wudu. If you're doubtfull, if you're 99.9% doubtfull then the Prophet ﷺ tells you \nyou need to hear a sound sound or find a foul odor and if you fail to \ndo or to have any of these two reasons that Elevate the doubt into certainty then the Prophet ﷺ \nsays ignore it and move on and Allah knows best"
