  "title": "Ruling on one who rejects a saheeh  Hadith | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "a city from germany says what's the ruling on someone who rejects a single hadith that is reported in the sahih this is an issue that depends on the person's knowledge so if this person is a knowledgeable person of the caliber of sheikh uh islamic the scholars of a high caliber then we would consider what they had chosen a mistake that does not tarnish their reputation as great scholars but if it is a layman whom if you ask him where is this verse found in the quran [Music] this is hadith not a verse of the quran so i didn't know that of course he didn't know that because you're okay i can't say that on live tv you don't have the qualification to speak in religion so now you're coming after 15 centuries of islam and you say oh this hadith i no i don't buy it it's not logical this is exactly what shaytan what iblees what satan did long long time ago when allah told him prostrate to adam he said no this is not logical i was created from fire adam was created from clay i'm better than him you're doing the same thing you're rejecting something from the religion with your logic knowing that your logic is impaired it is at fault it is filled with flaws your senses your eyes your hearing are not perfect there are so many galaxies out there so many planets so many solar systems that you cannot see yet because you can't see them it doesn't mean that they don't exist so if he rejects one hadith because of his whims and desires he's a facile and most likely we would not say that he is out of the fold of islam because this is sinful he accepts the hadith he accepts the quran but this particular hadith he rejects but if he rejected something that all the muslims agree upon and is part of our uh akida like the existence of heaven and hell like the existence of the sirat the bridge over hellfire where people cross to the other side if he denies the torment of the grave and rejects the hadith if he rejects the hadith of a spell being casted upon the prophet sallam by a jew magician or sorcerer by the name of assam hadith then this is problematic if he rejects all hadiths and he says i don't believe in hadiths at all because these are man made i only believe in the quran this person is an apostate because allah says in the quran to follow the prophet hassam and to obey him and to take what he brought to us and he's rejecting it so how is he going to pray give zakat how is he going to know what's halal and what's haram how to perform hajj without the sunnah so by rejecting the whole sunnah he's a kafir he's an apostate if he rejected something a hadith or two that these hadiths do not impact a person's iman and it's not rejecting something that the consensus of muslim scholars had been uh agreed uh upon in this case he's a facet he's sinful and an ignorant imbecile but he would not be a kafir and allah knows best you"
