  "transcript": "Gulag from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Yes Sheikh, I have a question in regards of the lecture I sent my local message There was Tafseer about Surah Ma'idah about And I have some confusion because the Sheikh was talking about things about Jihad and CCB level, he was talking about Gulag, the issues of Tafseer, Akhi, I do not speak about them without research This is Quran, this is not something to be taken lightly And to speak about it without going back And making sure that what you say is correct Because you're speaking on behalf of Allah Azza Wa Jal So you cannot shoot from the hip, first of all Second of all, issues of Jihad, at the moment This is not the time to speak about them On such a public platform because The pros are far less than the cons When you want to speak about great important issues like this If it's not going to hamper your work Your da'wah, your teaching to people So be it, other than that, this is not logical And unpractical, and Allah knows best"
