  "transcript": "I want to know really on a particular matter. I sometimes suffer from frequent nose bleeds. Uh sometimes even a slightest touch causes it often while performing voodoo. The bleeding starts midway or shortly after finishing. In such cases, do I need to repeat voodoo every time it happens? Even if it occurs repeatedly or there'll still some blood, little blood from the nose coming. First of all, I pray to Allah that he cures your illness and make you have a fast recovery. Second of all, the issue of bleeding. The majority of scholars say that this invalidates the wudoo and also the majority of scholars say that blood is nudges. And the most authentic opinion according to the Quran and to the Sunnah is that bleeding does not invalidate your woodoo. And the blood that comes out is pure from a human body unless it comes from the private parts. And this is backed up by many evidences. Alhamdulillah. So if you have a nose bleed, you can continue with your woodoo as normal and it does not impact the validity of it. You don't have to repeat it at all."
