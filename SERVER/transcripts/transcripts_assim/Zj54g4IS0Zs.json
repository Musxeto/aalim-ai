  "transcript": "foreign [Music] she found out last year that he was speaking with the girls in smoking weed then he gave up all of that he repented and she forgave him now she told me that he's smoking weed again and he told her that she doesn't have to worry and he promised her that he will give her up for having children I told her to leave him immediately but she said that he is always praying now and he will say insha Allah we need your opinion so the marriage is not consummated right not yet yeah okay so this is an issue of judgment they are married already so it is her call to assess the situation smoking weed is a major sin without any doubt consuming intoxicants would prevent your prayers from being accepted for 40 days and it's a major sin and if a person dials dies while being intoxicated he will drink from in Hellfire which is a bad punishment and something that is awful so it is her call to assess whether he is truthfully repenting or not and it depends on a number of factors if he's living alone overseas and he doesn't have any companion with him that would advise him and guide him and direct him to the right path maybe this is one of the reasons and your sister going to live with him would give give him a boost to start practicing and fearing Allah azzawajal because he needs a companion to associate himself with and Elevate his Iman with if she says no he is accompanied by Muslims and practicing Muslims but he insists on this and she feels that he's a hypocrite pretending to do things and maybe there are things that are hidden this is her assessment and we cannot simply advise people to divorce or to leave their spouses due to this reason because it could have been a moment of weakness it could have been an addiction it can be so many things and Allah Knows Best"
