  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh First of all, thank you for Muhammadiyah and Muslim United for facilitating this. Thank you Sheikh for sharing your knowledge. So, as you mentioned, as you mentioned before, there are so many countries that sharing hatred about Islam and you simply were saying boycott their product, it might be economic growth, might be distracted. Now, my question is about if in recent days the media plays a significant role to shaping public opinion about Islam, how do you think this impact effort to combat the Islam will be shared by media right now? Thank you. Okay, first of all, the media tries but they will never succeed because the religion is not mine or yours. It's Allah. And Allah in the Quran said that He will give victory to His word and to His religion. So, I have no problem with that. The problem is what did we do in the media to honor our religion? Now, if you go to the vast majority of Muslims' Instagram or Facebook or face hell, I don't know what. And you look into it. Do you find in the timeline 10% about Islam? No. You will never find 10%, 5%, maybe 1%. And the rest is all about movies, about women, about their profile picture. I'm looking like this now today. And you see pictures. People are proud of their pictures and it's ugly. But they say it's good, it's nice. And you get likes. Likes of what? If you put a picture of a dog, you will get likes. So, the Muslims are not honoring their Islam. So, the media will continue to write things about Islam but nobody believes it. Nobody believes that this is bad about Islam because Muslims, Alhamdulillah, are strong. But we have to see what have we presented to Islam. So, when the media does bad things, what should we do? Burn? Demonstrate? Protest? No. We write good things about Islam. We be proactive and positive, inshallah."
