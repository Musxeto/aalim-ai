  "transcript": "consider subscribing akbar from india chef in one of your lectures you were saying about the people under the shade of us on the day of judgement one of them is the one who doesn't go to pious people and ask them to make dua for him if i am not wrong you are wrong you are wrong you are mixing two hadith together but yes go ahead does it include asking parents to make dua for us or asking someone to make go after helping them etc okay i will answer inshallah from india says that he heard in one of my lectures and he got this confusion there is a lecture of mine where i explained the hadith seven are underneath the shade of allah azza on the day of judgment and he's saying that one of them is those who do not ask others to perform rookia and this is not true that's another hadith where the prophet told us allah about 70 thousands of his um that would enter paradise without any accountability or being tormented and one of them is those who do not ask others for rookia so we got this point clarified inshallah his question is if i go to someone and say he make dua for me tomorrow i have an exam or make dua that allah pays off my debt would that exclude me from the seventy thousand the answer is no because the those who are excluded are those who ask for rookia if i have gin possession black magic envy or evil eye or if i have an illness a sickness i'm suffering pain and i ask someone to do rookia on me to relieve me from my pains then this would exclude me asking people for dua is totally permissible you"
