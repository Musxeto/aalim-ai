  "transcript": "is it permissible for a husband to stop his wife from contacting her family members is this your question okay first of all Allah azzawajal has ordered women to be obedient to their what to their husbands and this obedience must be within reason within acceptable norms it's not Simon says so the husband says I don't want you to sleep before 10 o'clock I don't want you to stand on two feet you have to stand on one foot and hop to the kitchen and get me water this is ridiculous this is not a Humane this is not logical but it is within his rights as a husband to order his wife to do things even if she is not interested in doing them for example she wants to dye her hair and he says no I don't like you to dye your hair I like it the way it is she is obliged to obey him she wants to cut her hair short and he says I love long hair it's beautiful on you keep it she is obliged to obey him she wants to invite her friends every couple of days to dine and have a good time and he says no I don't like your friends to enter my home it is his house she's obliged to obey him she he doesn't want her to go and visit her cousin or her uncle's house because as the captain of the ship he's got a vision he sees things and he deems them to be harmful for his women folk for his family so he has a right from Allah azzawajal to prevent her from going to places that he thinks that may harm her religion or her personality or the way she deals and treats him when she comes back in some cases this is within his rights over her but if he says to her I don't want you to speak to your parents don't ever communicate with them they must not come that you must not go no he cannot order her to sever her kinship because Allah ordered her to connect to her kinship yes he may order her not to accept them in his house this is his house she can meet them outside she can go to them if needed with his permission if he doesn't allow her to go she can contact them on the phone and and and through other means but not to the extent that she um sivers her kinship and Allah Knows Best"
