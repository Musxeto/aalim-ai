  "transcript": "[Music] how to properly advise people to maintain personal hygiene while fasting in Ramadan many Muslims sleep after fajar and report for duty without brushing this combination of waking up from sleep and having an empty stomach releases a pungent and undesirable odor while talking we know that majority of Muslims don't use miswak can one use toothpaste what if the toothpaste gets swallowed or leaves a mint flavor in the mouth how to properly advise people to maintain personal hygiene don't kiss them okay it's his fasting and he's talking to you not in very close proximity so you cannot ask people to brush their teeth when they're fasting see the odor that you resent or you feel offended by the Prophet called it aloof and in the hadith he said lock aloof or saw him I have bought yet Allah Azza WA JAL damira a hotel misc the smell that remains in a person's mouth and comes out from his stomach due to fasting is more beloved to Allah than the smell of musk why because it is a result of a form of worship nevertheless this does not mean you go blowing at people and making them offended by the smell no no where it says this on the contrary the Prophet Allah saw Sam's Sunnah was to use the miswak frequently while fasting so yes it is recommended to brush your teeth not necessarily with two spec toothpaste if you fear swallowing something but with the miswak frequently if one doesn't do this we cannot blame them it's not encouraged but it's not blameworthy keeping distance however if you use toothpaste and you can find the flavor of it whether mentor others there's no problem in that the problem is in swallowing particles of it pieces of it but if you brush and only the smell and the fragrance remains and even the taste there's no problem in that inshallah [Music] [Applause]"
