  "transcript": "Mert from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Sheikh my question is about guidelines when speaking to women at business or at work so I've crossed about examples such as smiling a bit when talking or being a little bit sympathetic or like without cracking jokes of course but like just speaking a little bit sympathetic and also like saying hello or thanks or goodbye Can you clarify me regarding this example? Basically speaking Akhi, Islam promotes the segregation between men and women to the extent that the Prophet said Alayhis Salatu Wassalam whenever a man is in seclusion with a woman the third person with them is Shaytan, Satan and he Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam prohibited men to enter upon women even if these women are his sister-in-law or someone related to him but she's not his mahram. Islam promoted segregation to avoid any fitnah or trial or temptation to the extent that women are obliged to cover from head to toe that women are ordered to lower their voices and not to speak in a soft manner so that those with illness in their hearts would not be tempted to the extent that a woman is prohibited from wearing perfume when she goes out so that men would not be tempted by her beautiful fragrance and not to make a sound when they walk on the ground with their high heels or with their anklets that they put in their feet so that this sound would not be utilized by Shaytan. All of this is mentioned in the Quran and also in the Sunnah. Now when you come at the workplace and you see someone every single day and you just smile, what do you think your smile is going to do? Shaykh I'm not a famous Hollywood actor, nobody cares about my smile. True but Shaytan beautifies your ugly face and makes it the most handsome man to those who are desperate or in need in that moment at that time and place for such a smile. Likewise little by little it breaks the ice saying hello, good morning, good day. After three, four weeks of saying this you're going to say the weather is fine, oh but it's a little bit cloudy, it might be raining, oh I hope I brought my umbrella. Three, four weeks later uh would you mind, would you like having coffee? I know this cafe that serves excellent latte. Have a bite, then my place or yours. This is how Shaytan works. Now this may seem a bit extreme to some people saying oh we're not going to do this. Yeah you're not going to do this because Shaytan is setting you up for the right moment. Some people say I've known this woman for seven years, ten years at the workplace, I've never had any emotions towards her that were wrong. That's not true. She didn't give you a hint or open the door but the moment she would do that, you're a family man and if you push me too far I just might. You will do that. This is how Shaytan rolls and this is how he works. So as a Muslim, practicing Muslim, stay away from all of these things. Don't smile. Nobody would rate you and say oh you're rude or you're kind just because you did not smile. Don't initiate greetings and make it as strict as possible and as serious as possible so that business goes on."
