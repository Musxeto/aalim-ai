  "title": "Mention name of companion (Abu Bakr) without saying RadiAllahu anhu, is this hatred? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "from canada he says if someone says abu bakr and moves on he does not say radhiallahu and may allah be pleased with him would that be a sign of hatred the answer is no it's not my dirty mandarin mandar i'm losing the words it's not obligatory you know it's early in the morning and it's about like five o'clock 4 30. so i'm not able to get my thoughts together it's not mandatory to say radhiallahu it is something recommended this is highly rewardable it indicates your respect and love but if you don't say it either for forgetfulness or due to the fact that you're reading a paragraph that includes names of the companions a gazillion time and you'd like to minimize the time or the effort there's no problem in that there's no sign of hatred the hatred is in the heart the hatred is in what appears in your tongue when you speak ill about them or you criticize them or you belittle them this is a sign of hatred"
