  "title": "Is the Hadith about the Sultan Ruler being The shade of Allah on Earth Authentic?",
  "transcript": "from turkey he said that i've heard a hadith that the sultan the muslim ruler is the shade of allah on earth so he says that he doesn't think that this is appropriate um i don't know the authenticity of the hadith at the moment so i'm not gonna fake it or say that yes or no i have to refer back to the the sources of hadith to see whether it is original or not so once i do this i can tell you whether it's authentic or not but either way let's assume it is authentic what is the meaning of it is it metaphorical or to be taken as it is it means that the shade of allah meaning that the one who executes allah's orders uh um through so to implement sharia you need the sultan and to force people to abide by the law and to co-exist and to live in a peaceful fashion you need sultan you need the muslim ruler and this is why enforces through the muslim ruler what he does not enforce with the quran because ask people abide by the quran follow the quran 99 would not care about it but when the muslim ruler enforces a fine or threatens you with jail sentence everybody complies so i hope this answers your question"
