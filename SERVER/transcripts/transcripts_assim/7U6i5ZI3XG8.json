  "title": "Had doubts if I recited correctly or not during prayer, what to do Whispers of satan Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "i think uh um i wanted to know like uh suppose if i'm praying and i feel like i have recited properly but if i go into uh if i do suppose to jude and then i get this thoughts that what if i did not pronounce that properly so should i just disregard this or should i do frustration or forgetfulness do you get this feeling often or once in a blue moon uh often now the rule is satan is looking for customers he's looking for people to join him in hell fire for eternity how does he do this those who are negligent and ignorant he doesn't do whispering to them he just opens venues of haram nightclubs partying going to bars earning haram money they don't care about halal and haram food so he opens venues of haram until they leave the fold of islam like the vast majority of muslims those like you and me who are striving to please allah who are meticulous when it comes to prayers and halal and haram food they read the ingredients they are very keen on making proper wudu and cleaning themselves after answering the call of nature what to do with these overthink and exaggerate so he comes to you and makes life impossible to the extent that you end up practicing something that is not related to islam ask yourself is islam a religion of peace and ease or is it a religion of hardship and difficulty the first is the logical answer it's a religion of peace and ease so why why am i practicing this did the prophet salaam suffer like i'm suffering did the companions suffer like i'm suffering no this means that you're not more knowledgeable nor you're more righteous than them open your eyes and know how shaytan is messing up with you what to do the only course of action you can take at the moment is to ignore the whispers of shaytan totally ignore it how by not paying any attention how by acting on your gut feeling so you're in your sujud when you recited the fatih and the surah you had no doubts none whatsoever that you did a good job why is it coming to me now in situ not when i was reciting it uh shaytan wants to confuse me what to do ignore should i prostrate for forgetfulness no totally ignore act upon your gut feeling and move on and your prayer is totally valid will"
