  "transcript": "Saad from India. Assalamu Alaikum. Saad. Assalamu Alaikum. Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. So my question is that when to stand up for the if you miss some waqas, exactly when to stand up and do we say Allah wajib by standing up for praying the missing waqas? I can barely hear you. It seems that you are speaking from inside a well. But if I understood your question correctly, when someone misses a raka'a or more in the congregational prayer, in the last raka'a of the imam, the imam is sitting and we are sitting behind him for tashahhud and salutation upon the Prophet alayhi salatu wassalam. If I understand your question correctly, you are asking when should I stand up to complete the missed raka'as? The answer is after the imam concludes his prayer by saying Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullah, stay don't stand up, wait. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullah, the second salam, he finished it, now you can stand up. Should I stand up just like that? No, you should say Allahu Akbar while standing up and you complete your prayer as usual and Allah azza wa jal knows best. Allah azza wa jal."
