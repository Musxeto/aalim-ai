  "title": "With the Prophet ﷺ‎ Episode 8 (The Prophetﷺ‎ & How he treated Children (2)) - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Salam alaikum and welcome to another episode of with the Prophet I'm Ali Coleman we are joined with a guest from Saudi Arabia Sheikh Azam al Hakim assalamualaikum welcome my lord I can't shake we have one more episode to discuss the children around the Prophet peace be upon him who were not his family members we covered a number of things it's a few more things we'd like to get to before we continue with other members of society around the Prophet I'd like to ask about the question of gift-giving the Prophet said to give gifts to one another that you may love each other how did he intend for this to be applied to children whether they be children who are our own or others around us reminder for him and handling.that have a behind I mean o Sole allahu wa sallim wa barik alaa be orderly I mean nabina muhammad in water early he was happy as me and my back you can see this clearly when you give a child a gift that is so happy with it even if it costs peanuts yes still whenever you give a child something he appreciates it unlike us we have to look at the brand we have to look at the value you have to look at the usages of it children are unlike this at all and again you give respect you get respect you teach the children how to accept gifts when they grow up they learn how to give gifts and the Prophet said today's salatu salam in authentic hadith dejado dahab meaning that if you would like love to grow between you and one another then exchange gifts and the field of giving and the topic of gifts yeah is widely spread in Islam mother Aisha comes to the prophet sallallaahu lemon asks him if I have something to give to my neighbors which one should I begin with the Prophet said the closest to you physically meaning the closest of the doors of your two neighbors so the Prophet is highlighting the importance of gifts now when it comes to children the Prophet al-islam showed us practically the art of giving whenever it was time for harvest for the dates of Medina the Companions would bring the dates to the Prophet erase a lot of Silla so that he would be the first to taste it and to accept the gift from this harvest that Allah has given them so the prophets Allah Allah would say and make duaa oh Allah bless our Medina and bless our crops that is the dates and bless our mood which is a means of weighing the size measurement is a measurement of size and our SAR so the profit is supplicating to Allah whenever they bring him these new dates the new harvest and then the Prophet would call for the youngsters of the children of the Companions and give him first the first date to taste so he begins with the youngsters and he would select this young child because the younger they are the more keen they're looking mm-hmm to be the first one to eat it the eldest would appreciate so if you have like a five year old and a seven year old if you give the five year old the seven years would tell himself yeah I'm older I I should wait in line but the youngster would not understand this so the Prophet used to give also ara his salat wa salam was once in an authentic hadith well gifted someone gave the Prophet as-salaam a piece of cloth so he said to the Companions who should I give this piece of cloth - so the Companions did not reply didn't know how to answer so the Prophet ordered them to bring him on Hallett and on harlot was a five year old companion a girl a young girl so they brought her and the Prophet have some put that piece of cloth on her personally and he said to her complimenting her Sanna on Khalid Sanna Sanna means this is beautiful in Abyssinian so the Prophet is talking to her with this Abyssinian word though he's an Arab because she was among the migrants to Abyssinia in the beginning so this word was quite familiar to her so this is about it the concept of giving to children yeah enriches their ability to give when the gold good something to keep for the future when it comes to the Masjid very very important place for Muslims mm-hmm kids may not have that appreciation of the difference between the marketplace and the mosque yet they have to learn that so there's a certain way of addressing kids who are playing running around using loud voices maybe we would find if we walked into any Masjid in any Muslim country we might find adults yelling at kids for every small mistake I mean maybe that disturbs us maybe it's not correct how did the Prophet peace be upon them correct children and help them appreciate the uniqueness of the mosque you okay first of all you can't be more Roman than the Romans in a sense that nowadays people are too sensitive and they are making up things that are not part of the religion how I'll tell you for example whenever a child runs in the Masjid or makes some noise after the Salah is over you will have people standing in the middle of the Masjid shouting their heads off don't bring your children sit down you're not you're misbehaving why do you bring your children and they make a scene right more than the scene that the children have yeah and this is totally wrong and at the same time people made the message as a kindergarten so they bring their children that toddlers the babies and all what you hear is crying and playing and destroying property this is also not right then what is the correct thing okay the correct thing is that you have to have the balance mm-hmm the Prophet says adding is salatu was-salam instruct your children to pray when they're seven and spanked them when they're 10 this means that the age for me to bring a child to the masjid is 7 years of age before that is not mandatory mm-hmm however it is not prohibited either right because people generally feel the earlier the better yes but again you have to balance so how did the prophet alayhi salatu salam deal with this in an authentic hadith the Prophet was leading sallallahu alayhi wa sallam once the prayer and during the prayer he heard a child crying an infant so he wrapped up the prayer in a quick manner everything was ok but instead of saying subhana wa ba la vie for example 10 times he said it like three times mm-hmm so it was half of the time of the normal prayer and after he concluded the prayer the Companions asked the prophetess um why did you pray in such a way listen to what the Prophet said is awesome he said I heard a child an infant crying and I was worried for his mother's heart now his mother's praying but she cannot do anything because she's praying and the child is crying so the Prophet escalated arezzo salam and concluded his prayer quickly so that the mother can attend her infant now this is the end of the story hmm the Prophet did not erase or some blame the woman he did not say all women why are you doing this confusing us and causing so much distraction you stay home and pray with your children because a woman's prayer is not mandatory in the Masjid the Prophet Isis Lomb did not reprimand the child because the child is a child so this is something we have to pay a great deal of attention it's amazing he was sympathetic to the mother and which she was going through and he did not give a bad example to his Ummah by saying anything negative right now a lot of the guys in the message especially the elders would complain and would fabricate a hadith which is well known among the Muslims prevent the messages from your children and from your insane people people who are mad don't bring them to the message and don't break this is fabricated this is not a hadith but they know it and they accept it as a happiness now having said that the reaction far exceeds the action itself you do not kill a mosquito using a cannon this is an overkill once I was praying raesha in my Masjid and during my Salah I heard a child cry so I immediately remembered this hadith I concluded my prayer in a fast fashion which was okay after Salaam one of the elders stood up and started shouting and reprimanding and pointing his finger hmm at a man who had his two girls six years old and about three and a half year old hmm girls and he's shouting you don't have any shame in your face you don't fear Allah you've distracted and he's shouting in the Masjid and this is a sin by itself the man did not reply he took his kids and went out of the Masjid I came out quickly and I went to meet the man and I apologized as a mom I said listen my my brother the elder is you know he's old he's a grandfather in his grumpy so please forgive him the man started crying he said sure nobody knows what I'm going through their mother left the house four months ago and she just left she doesn't want to stay in the marriage and she doesn't want the children and I don't have anyone to take care of them it's been so long I did not print the message I just wanted to pray a prayer and to hear the Quran and this is what I get what can I do so subhanAllah so many times really act and we do things without thinking about the consequences of our actions and this is what happen oh what someone's going through we are ready for a break we will come back to continue our discussion assalamu alaikum welcome back we will continue our discussion in this show with the Prophet on the subject of the children around the Prophet of Islam sallalahu there Salam I'd like to ask you Sheikh about leadership the Prophet peace be upon him was a very no doubt visionary person he didn't think only about the immediate moment he thought about the future about future generations and he was very careful in cultivating good relationships with young people but also recognizing talent and giving people opportunities to cultivate their leadership skills like it or not the people young people will inherit the Muslim Ummah and lead it to wherever it will go what about this subject what kinds of things principles examples do we see of him identifying working with granting opportunities for leadership development among young people well when it comes to young people the sky's the limit if we would like to address that in regards of children we have examples for young people such as Zeta bethabeth okay he appointed the task to him to learn Hebrew which he mastered in 13 days now he didn't give this task to ali bin ABI talib to abu bakr he selected this youngster because he saw in him that he could master the language and he did in 13 days when you look at osama bin is 8b - he was 15 or 16 years of age and he appointed him as the leader of an army going to attack the Byzantines and in the army where as soldiers Abu Bakr Umar Uthman and Ali so you give the flag of leadership to a kid 15 or 16 years of age yes he's the prophet of Allah so he said he no what we do not know because he has a vision mmm what when we come to youngsters who are children the Prophet Alice Aslam did not change his strategy he used to teach them train them to be leaders of the future Anna signa Malik may Allah be pleased with him he was a young child his mother brought him to the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam when he first came to Medina and she said Oh prophet of Allah Ana's is a learned boy he's smart let him serve you and this service was for nothing he didn't get paid or anything but it was an honor to serve the Prophet I saw him and look at the brilliance of this mother hmm to give her child to serve the prophet of Allah knowing what he will benefit from so anise tells us that the Prophet Allah so salam sent me once on her errand he told me to do something and he told me that this is a secret so Anna's went and did what he was told to do then he went back to his mother and his mother is home sooo lame may Allah be pleased with her a room I saw she is one of the wise companion female companions of the Prophet Aslam so she asked her son who was a child where you been so he said that the Prophet sent me to an errand so she said what was it a simple question mm-hmm any mother would ask her son right so the son said it is a secret and I'm not supposed to tell the wise mother did not do what our mothers would probably do hold a stick and beat the heck out of him until he speaks the truth and spells it out she said well if it's a secret of the profit Arizona do not tell a soul about it 70 years later annasidou Malik was telling one of his disciples and his companions what of the tabi een sabot l boon Annie and he said otha 'but after he decided and he narrated this hadith he said fab it by Allah if I had told the soul I would have told you even after 70 years he did not conceal hmm and he'd not expose the secret of the Prophet Isis M now this type of selection the Prophet could have given this arrant to someone who's more trustworthy someone who's an adult because usually we think that children are not worthy of assuming responsibility and this is a very fatal mistake whenever we think small of them mm-hmm they will think smaller themselves and whenever we think big of them and give them responsibility they will be up to what we think of them and this is definitely something we're lacking in our community in our society in our families we tend to not trust our children especially now with the social media stuff so what are you doing mmm I'm sending an email I'm browsing a site that deals with hobbies so no no you're watching YouTube you're doing this you're on Instagram you're chatting with the your friends at school we tend to make them feel that it's an obligation for them to treat us and this is wrong we have to give them trust we have to look the other way and sometimes and pretend that we did not see anything because if we keep on putting rules and regulations and no and bands this will teach them how to go around it and how to cheat and how to lie hmm so so good examples that you've given us about how the Prophet peace be upon them recognized and gave opportunities I mean grand opportunities for young people to to develop to grow mature and you're right I think there's a natural tendency because we're dealing with a small body it means somehow less less significant less Authority less whatever and so but there are people and they're very intelligent very perceptive they catch things and if we're dishonest with them they know it and we're unwittingly whether we realize it or not if we're not honest with our children we're teaching them to be dishonest so recognizing appreciating not only the the potential for leadership but also their intelligence what about this subject of mercy it's a very generic topic but we have many examples at a point too on this subject of of how the Prophet was merciful towards the kids and you've cited some examples and how that radiated out of him we're starting to wind down anything left on the subject of mercy or recognizing leadership or intelligence well again as you've stated that you must not deceive children just because they're children you must not look down at them in an authentic hadith the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam as narrated by Abdullah an honor the Prophet was in our house and my mother told me when I was a child come come take this and she had something in her fist so the Prophet said what are you going to give him she opened her hand and she said a date or prophet of Allah the Prophet said had you not given him that date it would been registered as a lie so many times we deceived the children come come let me give you something and once we get hold of him we do something else we just wanted to grab him the Prophet I said I'm warned us that this is at the sight of Allah considered to be a lie part of the responsibility and making them feel that they have a role in life imagine this the Prophet Adam is with his companions and to his right sitting next to him is a child a young boy and to his left there is Abu Bakr and Omar now if you just can imagine this gathering a child to the right and other elders and respected companions to his left the Prophet is brought up with a glass of milk so the Prophet drinks from it now the etiquette is that you give to the one on your right but the prestige is to give the elders on your left so the Prophet is following the etiquette sallallahu selim so he goes to the young boy seeking permission from this young boy because his right imagine the rule are doing this so he says a young boy do you allow me to give the elders what's remaining from my left over of drinking this milk mm-hmm what does the youngster say by Allah I do not give you permission Wow do you think I'm gonna allow them to drink after you and give them president to me no so the Prophet put it in his hand and the young boy drank from it what kind of respect is this that the Prophet had iced up to this youngster yeah so what kind of lessons is he installing in him yeah and putting inside and also teaching the elders correct and the elders did not say a thing because they know if they were in his shoes they wouldn't have done any well great discussion we've had a couple rounds with the children around the Prophet and so that will conclude our discussion for today's episode thank you so much Baraka lucky and Thank You viewer we pray that it was beneficial for you may Allah accept our time together until the next episode of with the Prophet assalamu alaikum we don't allow you put a got"
