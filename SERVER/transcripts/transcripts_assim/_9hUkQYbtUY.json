  "title": "If I marry a girl who posts on Socials Wears makeup Shows sum hair Will I be dayyoth assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "the second question is from Bilal he says I like a girl and I'm thinking of marrying her but she wears makeup outside and she shows a little bit of her hair when she wears hijab she dresses wearing Abaya but she also posts herself on social media these things put me off a little as I don't want my wife to dis playay her beauty does that make me a de youth if I let her but I say to myself I'm not the best Muslim as well yes it would make you a de youth if you see your wife wanting to do these things and you do not prevent her and stop her from doing it now as you are still in safety and you're not mad at it definitely this girl is bad news she's indecent she does not abide by the Quran and the Sunnah for wearing makeup when she goes out for posting her pictures on social media for showing part of her hair which is a what kind of a man would allow his wife or his daughter to be in such a fashion a real man has jealousy not over such things because he's a man rather because Islam prohibits it so even if his son were to smoke or watch Haram um and filthy scenes or shave his beard he would have the jealousy for the sake of Allah for the dean so the advice is no real Muslim let alone a man would marry such a girl with such dealings and doings she's not the last woman on Earth you have to choose who to be your soulmate and life partner the mother of your children and the wife that you would stay married to for the Le rest of your life inshallah"
