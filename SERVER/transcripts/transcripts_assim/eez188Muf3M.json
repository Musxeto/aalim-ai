  "transcript": "Ammar from Tunisia Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh, my friend, he told me that he will score 19 out of 20 as a general grade at the end of the semester. He was doing what, Ammar? He told me that he will score 19 out of 20 as a general grade at the end of the semester. Okay. So I told him, this is not possible, but if he manages to do that, I will give him 100 dinar. So now, I know this is halal because it's only a reward, but my concern is that two weeks approximately later, he told me if I manage to score 12 or more, he will give me 100 dinar. So now I don't know anymore, is this still halal? Jazak Allah Khairan. Jazak Allah Khairan. Now again, your pledge to give him this amount, was it if he were to score 19 out of 20? Yes, yes. This is binding. What he said afterwards, 12 out of 20, this is up to you. If you say, okay, again, this is a conditional gift, and this is not a bet, and there is no gambling in it. It's a halal gift. You tell your friend, you tell your son, you tell your neighbor, if you do this task, I'll give you this. This is called ju'ala in fiqh, in Arabic. It's a gift appointed upon a particular and specific task. So again, if your friend is greedy, and he sees you as a sugar daddy and says, okay, if I get 12 out of 20, you should be ashamed of yourself. 60 out of 100, and you still want to be rewarded? What is this? But if you're generous, and you have money, and you still don't believe in him, and think he wouldn't get 12, and you agree that it would be binding, but it's not haram or anything else, alhamdulillah."
