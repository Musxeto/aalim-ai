  "transcript": "me which has two questions his first question says are women slaves to their husbands the term slaves if you mean that he can do whatever he wishes by beating her up selling her abusing her that's definitely no she's a fruit free woman Allah created her free and she is free but in the metaphorical sense you can say that she's obliged to obey her husband more than anyone else on earth providing this that this is done bill Marouf in what is normal and through channels of kindness Allah says in the Quran washi Runa bill Marouf treat women in kindness but at the same time the Prophet said Alice awesome as in the hadith of Mahad imageable may Allah be pleased with him when he came from Yemen the moment he entered and saw the Prophet SM he fell down and prostrated to him the Prophet Alice awesome immediately ordered him to stand up and he said what are you doing mark he said I came from a Christian country and I saw them praised their elders and leaders in such a fashion by prostrating this was permissible in some previous religions so the Prophet said that is awesome if I were to order someone to prostrate to someone else I would have ordered women to prostrate to or I would have ordered a woman to prostrate to her husband and this highlights the importance of a husband in a woman's life and that she is obliged to obey Him she's obliged to comply with what he tells her this does not mean it's a Simon Says kind of house or kind of marriage but rather it means that the man is the pilot who steers and flies the ship or the airplane and hence it is his call it is his instruction this does not mean that a woman has no say that she does not communicate that that she does not air her opinion and talks to him about it but rather at the conclusion at the end it is his call but is she a slave definitely not and she is not a slave"
