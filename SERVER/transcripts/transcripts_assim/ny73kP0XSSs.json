  "title": "Muslim Prayers (fard, sunnah, night prayers and witr) - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Um, Asma from the UAE says she I thought that she was asking about the suras to be recited, but apparently she's asking about the number of rakas. We know that we have 17 ra of mandatory prayers. two for four for four for three for and four for these are the mandatory prayers that a person has to pray because they are pillars of Islam. Now the voluntary prayers are 12 and these are the highly recommended which the prophet used to pray and this was uh found in the hadith of the mother of the believers and also may Allah be pleased with her reported something like that and also may Allah be pleased with him and with his father. So they told us that the prophet used to pray 12 rakas highly recommended voluntary prayers two before fajar and these are the best two raqas the prophet said that they are better than the whole world or whatever the sun had shined over two rakas before the mandatory two raqas and then the prophet used to pray four rakas before dur and four rakas after dur. So these four the the mab of Im Abu Hanifh that you pray them in one like you pray and the mab of IM Ahmed and and other schools of thought that you pray it in twos. So you pray two raas and you offer salam and you pray two raas and you offer salam. This is the safest has nothing highly recommended has two afterwards has two afterwards. Nothing before highly recommended and then you may pray night prayer as much as you want. The best is that you pray 11 as the prophet used to prayatam. You can add, you can subtract. This is up to you. And she's also asking about wit. Is it mandatory? The answer is no. It is not mandatory. And may Allah be pleased with him was angered when they when they told him that there's someone saying that is waj and he said no there are five mandatory prayers that Allah has obligated upon us. And he uh uh mentioned the hadith"
