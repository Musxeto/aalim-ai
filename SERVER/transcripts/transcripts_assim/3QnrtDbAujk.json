  "transcript": "oh ah we're still studying the times of salat the chapter that deals with time of salat and when is it possible for a person to pray a certain or particular prayer and when it is forbidden for him to pray a particular prayer and we have uh hadith 137 and who will read it for us narrated by jubair bin motim allah's messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam said o descendants of abdomenif you must not prevent anyone who goes round this house meaning the khab and prays here at any hour of the night or day that he wishes now this hadith falls in line with the previous hadiths that we have read because some of the hadiths tell us that it is forbidden for a person to pray in five particular times and those are right after fajr prayer and just before the beginning of sunrise and from the beginning of sunrise until the sun has risen that is about 15 minutes of it and the third time is when the sun is at the center in the middle of this the sky where if you erect anything it would not have any shadow and this is about five to ten minutes interval and the fourth time is immediately after us or prayer and just before the sun starts to sit and the fifth and final time is when the sun itself starts to disappear until it disappears completely so these are five times it's forbidden for us to pray and we've clarified this subject and we said that with the exception of the prayers that have a legitimate cause and reason and and this is the choice of al-imam may allah have mercy on his soul and of course it was also the recommendation of evan taymiah and his student ibn may allah have mercy on them all so this is authentic opinion of all i believe that mustafa has a question yes uh does the masjid is it included from the legitimate reasons of praying during the night of course the masjid means the salute that a person offers to a mosque to a masjid when he enters because there's a hadith where the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam told us that if any one of you enters a mosque he must not sit down until he offers turaka and scholars say that the word itself the masjid the name the salute of the masjid is not found anywhere in the sunnah so this is a terminology that has been given to any two raka's offered in order for you to sit down nevertheless though i'm gonna just uh divert a bit from answering your your questions so if i divert too much remind me those scholars say that if you enter a mosque and you offer two rakah as sunnah for example it's fajr prayer and we all know that there are two raka's sunnah preferred prayer before the original obligatory prayer so i come to the mosque i offer these two raka's now after finishing shall i go and pray two more for saluting the masjid scholars say no you don't because there is not a particular salah prayer that is called the order or the instruction of the prophet is that you may not sit down until you pray and to give you another example what happens if a person comes into the masjid and they are praying in the congregation they are praying the jumarrah of course definitely the first thing i would do is to join them and what happens after the prayer has finished should i stand up and offer to raka the masjid scholar said there's no need so the word itself the masjid is a terminology that some of the scholars looked at the hadith and said well the prophet said do not sit down until you pray to rakah so what is what are these let's call them the salute of the masjid al-masjid actually there isn't anything all what you have to do is pray whether you pray sunnah whether you pray the obligatory prayer whether you pray another sunnah for example uh or or the sunnah of evolution you pray to raqqa after performing abolution it suffice it it's enough you can't immediately sit down now coming back to your question if a person enters a masjid and there is no sunnah to pray there is no obligatory prayer to pray and he wants to sit down so he has to pray these two rakahs for uh in order for him to sit to be able to sit down otherwise he would be sinful and these two are exempted from the five times where it's forbidden for you to pray because they have a legitimate reason and cause so it's like praying the funeral pray prayer it's like praying the uh for when when the sun eclipses and so on the thing that i'd like to point out is that though there are these five times where you're denied from praying it is also forbidden for you to pray whenever the congregation is on and this is something a lot of the brothers don't do don't know and and the best and clearest example of all is during fajr prayer a lot of the brothers come into the masjid the imam is praying fajr and because they left their houses without praying the sunnah they come into the mosque and pray on their own the sunnah while the congregation is going on so they tried to finish two raka's as fast as possible and then they joined the congregation this is forbidden and it's not acceptable that two raka's that they have prayed is void it would not do and the reason behind that is that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said that whenever the obligatory prayer is on whenever the obligatory prayer has been called for no prayer is accepted except this particular prayer so again this is a time though it's not bound by a time interval like the five times we have it but it is forbidden for us to pray when the congregational prayer is on now coming back to you i have a question yes uh if you hear the adhan and instead of praying the sunnah and the masjid you breathe at home and then you go down to the masjid do you pray those two raka's or you just like what do you think abu malik well the sunnah is to pray them at home yes he did pray them home but then he went to the masjid so he's asking what do i do now well if he answers well i assume if if they didn't begin the congregation you know prayer then he can pray the two workouts that you know he can or he may or he must he must pray that's the right and the correct answer because if you prayed the sunnah home and you went to the masjid you want to sit down you are instructed by the prophet islam not to sit down until you pray to arakas okay i heard that for fajr prayer he just used to sit down and not pray if the two raka's if he prayed them at home well with all due respect to your hearing see in in islamic law it's not a matter of word of mouth it's not a matter of i heard so this is point one that we have to clear out anyone could come in and say listen i heard that uh chaffey did this and that but you have to prove it it has to be written down and you have to cross-examine that the narration the chain is correct because you would open a book there are hundreds of thousands literally hundreds of thousands of books and you could open a book and it says shafer says so ahmad says so malik says so but if you cross reference cross examine the these sentences or statements to their own books to the own school of thoughts books original ones you will not find them so point one it's not enough that a person says imam ahmad says you have to have the credentials you have to have the proof assuming that this is correct and true let's assume that this was said by imam ahmed again in islam we don't have the four apostles or the four books mark luke john and paul we don't we don't have these in islam imam ahmad imam malik they are all on the top of our heads and they are all honored honorable scholars of islam yet all of them say whenever the hadith is authentic then throw my opinions and my sayings and take the hadith so when we say ash rasulullah we testify that the muhammad salla is allah servant and messenger which means that on the day of judgment allah will not tell us allah will not question us why didn't you follow abu hanifa why didn't you follow malik he will ask you why didn't you follow the words and the hadith of the prophet which means that the four schools of thought the imams are knowledgeable people but they have differences among themselves this is based on the methodology they took their verdicts from the hadith so one looked at it from this angle the other looked at it from two angles a third one had a hadith that the others did not know of and that is why we follow them depending on their following the quran and sunnah because at their time they did not have any print houses that would print all these books that we have they didn't have internet they didn't have lots of things that we have and enjoy and they were deprived of they used to travel to from one area to the other to acquire one or two hadiths now at the tip of the punch you know you just press a button and it lists for you ten thousands of hadith and it tells you which is authentic and which is not through their knowledge and through their traveling so to uh wrap things up you have to prove that this was said by the imam and if it was proven then you have to cross-examine it with the quran and with the sunnah it is not something divine that imam muhammad said we would have we have to follow it i believe that we have to pause for a short break and insha allah we will continue to talk about the subject closing the gap why closing the gap in this program sheikh yousef estes and omar dunlap are going to discuss how to bridge the gap between peoples of different cultures and orientations the gap between males and females muslims and non-muslims the east and the west human beings feel like that they're being slighted one way or the other the gap between the youth and the elders the gap between various status in working the work field and education and then trying to provide solutions for these particular problems just before the break we were discussing brother mustapha's question about a saying that he heard that imam ahmed says that it's okay if you prayed sunnah in your house to come to the masjid and sit down without praying and again with all due respect to what you have heard or to the sheikhs that say this it is a very simple process that we should follow to feel at ease and this process is cross examine whatever you hear with the quran in the sunnah so if we cross examine what you have heard with the quran and sunnah we will find that the prophet says allah whoever enters a mosque must not sit down until he prays to raka so he did not mention unless you have prayed sunnah and he did not mention unless this or that he it's a general instruction that we should follow and just to uh add an extra bit of information the prophet alison was once delivering the khutba of jummah and sulaik al-ghattafani one of the companions entered the mosque and sat down so he told him the prophet did you pray to raka's he interrupted the khutba and he stopped it his speech and asked this man did you pray the guy said no i did not so he told him stand up and pray to raka's which shows you that now the two raka's are not sunnah definitely because does your have any sunnah before it does it have any journal uh soon afterwards yes no how do you say no mohammed does for after after year how many raka's four four if you stay in the most if you if you perform them in the mosque you pray for raka's but if you prefer uh perform them home you pray only two raka's this is the sunnah of juma so this shows you that the the sunnah for sitting down in the mosque it is a must that is why the prophet interrupted his speech and asked him to perform it again brother fadi is it permissible for instance if someone walks into the masjid after the athena fajr forms the evolution to pray that like to gather the intentions together to pray to pray to rakat as a form of hate masjid and sunnati and satsahara yes do you have anything that left over from a couple of weeks ago or so yes it is it is now preferable uh prayers you can join uh the intention but as i said depending on the uh the joining so if you are joining two preferred thing this may not do for example if you want to pro to join the sunnah of fajr because now you're entering the mosque after the event so you want to pray two raka's of sunnah of the fajr and last night you did not pray afterwards so you say okay i'll join both and have the intention of both this is not permissible but if you want to join these two rakahs with this tihara this as you remember is praying two rakahs and seeking the guidance of allah to choose for you you're asking allah to choose for you i want to buy a car after half an hour i'm going to the showroom to buy a car i've got the money in my pocket i pray to raka's and i ask allah for for guidance and i tell him after praying to raka's oh allah if this buying the car is good for me in this life and it's good for me and for my religion then make things easy and if it's not good for my for me in this life and it's not good for my religion then distracted me from it and decrease something that would be beneficial and make me feel happy with it so this is sahara now you can pray the sunnah of fajr or any other sunnah which is recommended prayer and us with it why because the prophet said allah whoever wants to do something he may pray two raka's that are not obligatory any two raka's so he did not specify praying to raka's for this reason which means that any two raka's would do providing they are not obligated in prayer so to put it in a nutshell if you join two or three nias at the same time in a prayer and there's no conflict among them then it's okay so if you pray sunnah fajr and you add to that sunnah you do after evolution and you add that to that afterwards it is okay to pray only to raga nor you had a question just have a little question yeah question i connected uh we have to pray when we uh come to the mosque before setting down is it become obligatory so if we live it or we miss it uh we are sinful or yes you are see again remember we talked about this uh a while ago we said that there are five verdicts on everything we do either is obligatory or forbidden recommended or not recommended or permissible so whenever the prophet says ali do this then this is obligatory and whenever he says do not do this then it's forbidden other unless there is something else to you know make it a little bit weaker from obligatory to recommendable or from uh forbidden to unrecommendable but as it is as it stands the prophet says if you enter the mosque do not sit down so saying do not sit down means that it's forbidden you may not sit down you just said if the prophet sam said do not do that so this means or do that then we have to do that he says do not do that it's forbidden is it a rule that if he says do this then the opposite is is forbidden like if he says pray so not praying is forbidden right yes so it's always a rule like if he says yes this is the rule of the opposite unless there is something else and this is the fundamentals of unless there is a something that is called karina that makes it lesser for example one of the easiest uh examples and the basics is the when the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam says i denied you before from visiting cemeteries now visit them because it reminds you of the hereafter now this visit them is an order so one would think that this is obligatory scholars of say no it's not obligatory because it followed a denial it followed something that was forbidden so whenever it is forbidden and then it's made as an order it goes back to how it was which is permissible now this is different than if the prophet says allah grow your beards now this is an instruction it's an order we look in the hadith we look in the quran there is no way where it says it's okay or it's preferable or it was forbidden and before and now it's it became obligatory so it's a clear and simple instruction an order so this means it is obligatory when the prophet says that these are forbidden for the males of my nation and permissible for the females and he was carrying gold and silk so this is forbidden he says it's forbidden no one comes to say well he he was saying it's not recommended he didn't mean actually forbidden no he said forbidden then it is forbidden we're drifting a bit but so i hope it's the final question so according to this rule when the prophet saws said grow your beards then definitely according to this rule not going our beards is forbidden it's a sin is a sin yes thank you yeah but now one has to be careful you know one sins vary we have small sins minor sins and we have major sins but if you look at them and classify them this category in my minor major it would encourage you to do the minor ones and you will never know when you will cross the line and do the major ones because the more you do minor sins the more easier it is for you to sin no the best way to look at it not in regard of minor and major the best way is to look at who you are committing this sin who are you doing this awful act for you are sinning and you are disobeying allah azzawajal so don't look at the magnitude or the size of the sin look at the magnitude of the who you who you are disobeying going back to hadith which uh brother mustafa has read to us it tells us the hadith tells us that the prophet is asking bani abd manaf the descendants of abdul manaf who were taking care of the holy mosque in mecca and he is telling them that you should not prevent anyone who goes around the house the kaaba and prays at any hour of the night or day that he wishes which tells us that the prophet indicated he indicated that any time of the day or night which means that if anyone prays do not stop them this tells us that the five times where it's denied for us to pray there are exceptions otherwise the prophet would have told them do not prevent anyone from praying unless he's praying in the five forbidden times but by telling them do not prevent people from praying tells us that there are prayers that you may pray any time during the day or night especially in in mecca in kaaba after performing tough such as mustafa yes you always pray to rakat after you've completed seven times going around the country yes after you finish seven rounds around the kaaba you go behind makam ibrahim it's a place where abraham peace be upon him stood to build the kaaba and it's monumented over there so you pray two rakahs there this is which means that whenever you perform tawaf you usually it's a sunnah that you you pray these two raka's so the prophet says do not prevent anyone from praying at any given time day or night which tells us again that this is one of the the the evidence saying that these five times are not completely forbidden on the contrary there are exceptions and these exceptions are known from the sunnah and are known from the scholars that taught us this i'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program so until we meet next time wassalamualaikum warahmatullahi"
