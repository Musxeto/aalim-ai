  "transcript": "what's a book in english that you would recommend to people to to read maybe when it comes to understanding akida better well first of all i'm the last one to ask because you know me i don't read english at all so i have no idea what books are there but um basically speaking when you look at the aspects of apida a lot of the people immediately go to kitabutohit and this is one of the greatest books no uh no doubt about it however it focuses on tahiti so all of your idadah should be devoted to allah what is considered to be shirk but this is not akita you have to hid which is found in other books now one of the great books that are available is the book of al-qaeda and sheikh ibn may allah have mercy explain that thoroughly and i think it's translated as well now i would i would highly advise people to go to my youtube channel and it's for free i don't charge for that huh alhamdulillah there's no no ads even uh well with the grace of allah till now if you go there there is a a series a playlist with the name of the islamic faith and this is a book was written by sheikh abdul aziz which is a lot of the people are against and a lot of the super salaries accuse him of being hawaris of this and that i don't know the man i've never met him in my life i've read the book and this is the only book i've read of him i've never heard his lectures so i don't have anything binding me to him but the book is so nicely explained and alhamdulillah allah has blessed me to go through it it gives you a crystal clear point of view of al-qaeda and in an easy way explains a lot of the the misconceptions and allah has also favored me to correct some of the things that i think with my limited knowledge that are wrong so it's not blind following there are things that are maybe an error or here or there it was tried i tried my level best to rectify it and fix it this playlist would definitely give you a a bird's eye view to see the arcadia from a very very easy perspective and this is maybe zero zero one of al-qaeda rather than one-on-one are you familiar with the akita series of course that's a good series who isn't who isn't i i remember reading it um 33 maybe 32 years ago series and i've benefited i've read it like eight ten times whether it's which is one volume or the messengers and the messages the angels the jinn the devils signs of yom al-qaeda day of judgment minor and major the whole nine yards alhamdulillah allah bless me of reading that alhamdulillah you"
