  "transcript": "sad from qatar he says we seem to have gotten on the wrong foot because when the call was taken all what i heard from him was and in arabia we have this wrong concept that if i'm disputing with someone or someone oppressed me i say hasbi allah as a threat not knowing that this is not a threat has be allah means allah will suffice me and when i am he is the one i trust and depend upon so this is not a dua against you this is declaring that i am trusting allah azza but people take it negatively so this is why i was uh joking around when i said to him what have i done to you so his question is the dua saying it seven times etc this is backed by a hadith but the scholars of hadith who tell us what is authentic and what is not graded it as weak such as great scholar of islam al-bani he graded it as weak so we tell people that this is weak and he's the doctor of the sciences of hadith that we follow you"
