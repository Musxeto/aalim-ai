  "transcript": "foreign [Music] was about the importance of Sunnah in Islam but when I came here I saw that the lecture is about the Quran so I don't know what to say and what to do but alhamdulillah as long as I have my first wife with me the iPad I have I have inshallah enough information in it Quran is a miracle agree the beauty of Islam is that it is simple it is challenging and no one can argue when we meet the people who say that we follow Prophet we follow Prophet Noah peace be upon him and he built an ark and the Ark managed to survive the flood that covered the whole entire Earth can we see it no so it's your word that has to back it up when we see the Jews and they said Musa peace be upon him the greatest of all Messengers with his staff Allah opened the sea and he crossed and made Pharaoh drown I say Masha Allah masha'allah can I see the splitting of the sea no can I see the staff he said no okay Jesus peace be upon him he cured the leopard he gave life to the death to the Dead with Allah's permission he did this he did that masha'allah very good can I see Satan no so all of the religions do not have a miracle that they can present except the Quran the prophet had many miracles the moon was split into two huh this happened and they saw it but we don't have the ability to show it to them the water used to gush from his fingers one plate of food would suffice 350 men with the Baraka of prophet Muhammad we don't have these things the only miracle that remains with us is the Quran the Quran is the word of Allah Allah spoke the Quran spoke the Quran jibril heard it jibril took it and gave it to Prophet Muhammad it is not created it is an attribute of Allah and this Quran the word of Allah was given to the best of angels jibril peace be upon him to reveal to the best of Allah's creation Muhammad in the best night which is in the best area and location on Earth which is Mecca so this book is unlike any other book with it Allah abrogated and erased all previous scriptures and religions so no one can come and say I have this religion that I'm following and it's like the Islam No foreign whoever chooses other than Islam as a religion it will not be accepted from him this Quran is a means of healing and cure Allah says and we send down from the Quran that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe you're a believer you can recite the Quran as urukia and Allah will cure you when you're depressed you recite the Quran and Allah would relieve you from your depression when you are in trouble you recite the Quran and Allah would ease your problems and if you look at how the salaf used to deal with the Quran not like us because we're not from the salaf are you from the salaf we follow the self but we're not from the salaf where do we put the Quran in the glove compartment in the car why because this is protection inshallah it will save us from accidents we put it under the pillow we put it on the Shelf because this is Baraka Baraka when was the last time you finished the Quran uh 2017. before covet before covet but insha Allah insha Allah no more coffee I will try to finish it before 2030 inshallah this is how the salaf used to deal with the Quran no the salaf used to see in the Quran the solution for all of their problems one companion his name is his father was one of the smartest of Arabs very very cunning and smart and strategic he got his son married to a beautiful reputable woman from quraish after a few weeks he went to visit his daughter-in-law so she's he asked her how is my son is he treating you well she said Masha Allah he fasts every single day and he prays the hajjud the whole night now we would think that this is good this is no I'm I'm smart if he fasts in the day every day and he praised the hajjud the whole night when will they have hanky-panky so he understood that his son is not fulfilling his wife's rights immediately he went to the prophet and he said oh prophet of Allah look what Abdullah is doing so he said bring him so he brought him and he asked him Abdullah how do you read the Quran he says I finish the Quran completely once every night from cover to cover every night in Salah what is this if we spent one hour not one hour ten minutes reading the Quran [Music] what's happening every time I open the Quran I feel sleepy but when I open tick tock there is a problem we have a problem so the prophet said no Abdullah this is too much read it once a month and this is for the lazy like you and me every hijri month we finish the Quran once because we're lazy finish history month we begin another one in Ramadan okay we finish five six times but normal months so Abdullah was satisfied no see I can do more he said okay read it every 20 days he said no I can do it more he said read it every 15 days every 10 days every week every three days Abdullah says I can do more he said no don't do more meaning finish it every yeah then start again he said no if you do it more than that you will not understand it this is how the salaf used to deal with the Quran the salaf when they were recited or told an Ayah they would say the last three verses of Surat al-baqarah of course you all remember I said right this area was revealed one what does it mean for Allah azzawajal belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on Earth and whether you disclose what is in your own selves or conceal it Allah will call you to account for it the companions came to the prophet a prophets of Allah Jihad no problem no problem zakah no problem fasting we can do this but to conceal intrusive thoughts bad thoughts in ourselves I don't speak I don't do but I cannot Sheikh said something from I am from the United States I was insulted so now inside of me I want to Tim but I will not because I'm old man and he knows silat so no MMA champion so but inside I want to beat him this Ayah says Allah will hold me to account I didn't do anything I didn't speak so they came to the prophet he said the prophet of Allah how is it possible that we conceal something and Allah will hold us accountable to the prophet was angry and he said do you want to be like the Jews saying we hear and disobey fear Allah say we hear and adhere and obey immediately when the prophet said this to them they went on their knees and said we have no objection this is Allah's word in the Quran how can we object to it and this is when Allah azzawajal revealed his last eye of Surat al-baqarah that abrogated this is called in Arabic abrogation is called when there is a ruling and Allah uplifts the ruling so Allah erases in the Quran [Music] so Allah revealed the last Ayah Allah burdens not a person Beyond his scope he gets reward for that good which he has earned and he is punished for that evil which he has earned our Lord punish us not if we forget or fall into error our Lord lay not on us a burden like that which was you did lay on those before us the Jews and the Christians I our Lord put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear Allah says meaning I shall do this Allah will not burden us so this is how the companions reacted one of the Beautiful Stories that took place of the interaction of the companions with the Quran imagine a companion by the name of foreign he's the cousin of Abu Bakr and he is among the first to migrate to Medina so he was a great companion the only problem was he was broke he did not have any money he was from among the sofa sofa so Abu Bakr being a rich man he used to give his cousin allowance every week so that he can feed himself he can use the money for his own things fortunately master fell into one of the shaytan's traps great companion one of the first to migrate to Medina but shaytan managed to fool three of the companions Hassan even fabit ATA what did they do they slandered mother Aisha they heard the Hypocrites and they said what the hypocrite said oh she committed adultery with safwana may Allah be pleased with him how dare you now Abu Bakr was hurt what is the relationship between Abu Bakr and Aisha father and daughter and he is my cousin and I'm giving him money and his land is my own daughter he's Slanders the wife of the Prophet the love of the Prophet I will not give him a penny was he wrong if we were encountered with something like this we would kill him but again he's young and strong and I'm a skin so Abu Bakr said wallahi I will not give him one single penny after a while revealed the Quran for this incident and the prophet came to Abu Bakr alaihissalam he said Abu Bakr didn't you hear what Allah said about you I said what so Allah azzawajal revealed the Ayah and let not those among you who are blessed with Graces and wealth swear not to give any sort of help to their Kinsmen the poor and those who left their homes for Allah's cause let them pardon and forgive do you not love that Allah should forgive you immediately Abu Bakr heard this do you not love Allah that Allah azzawajal should forgive you what did the worker say I love Allah to forgive me I make you my witness o prophet of Allah that I will never stop giving him his allowance no harms done finished made them change This Is How They interacted they did not relate to the Quran as only Baraka sometimes when I go to Muslim countries I hear them turning on the loudspeakers before Fajr 15 minutes [Music] and the people inside the Masjid what are they doing this is Sunnah this is we love the Quran this is why we're doing this this is not loving the Quran this is abusing the Quran the Quran was not revealed to be listened to as a song it was revealed to be adhered to imagine one of the companions his name is what is his name I'm bad even Bishop in one of the Expeditions with the prophet Allah the Army was resting at night they went to sleep so of course there has to be what guards so Amar and Bishop were the guards so they said I bet I will take the beginning of the night half of it and you take the other half so you go sleep and that is the Watchman what did he do social media Instagram YouTube no everybody's asleep so he started and reciting the Quran not knowing that there was an enemy of Islam watching and when he saw him standing he knew that he was the guard so he took an arrow and boom shot him did a bad run he continued his prayer the enemy of Islam said this is strange took another arrow boom took a third Arrow boom only then are bad after three arrows he finished his prayer quickly and walked in Yasser saw the blood in the house he said you crazy why didn't you wake me up from the first Arrow I was reciting Asura it was so beautiful I didn't want to cut it I only feared that I might die and they will attack the Muslims so I had to finish my prayer quickly I remember I was praying in a Masjid Fajr prayer in Judah where I live and the Imam was reciting in the Quran beautifully and there was in the Salat all of a sudden I started seeing people jumping reaching the ceiling boom boom what happened a cat entered and when the cat started touching their feet everybody was and I was thinking to myself a cat does this what about an arrow sometimes you see cockroach oh look at the worshipers you will find them running out of the Salat I don't want to sell Italian today no no Salah today so this is our relationship with the Quran unfortunately now the Quran has all solutions for our problems but the problem is nobody refers to it nobody goes back to it Allah says in the Quran and the messenger has said O My Lord indeed my people have taken this Quran as a thing abandoned yes or no have we abandoned the Quran yes who are you fooling have we abandoned the Quran what is meant by abandoning the Quran the scholars say abandoning the Quran is of different types number one to abandon listening to it believing in it lots of the Muslims now if you turn the Quran they will say turn it off turn it off we're not in mourning you know what is morning when someone dies you turn the Quran only because of he died but no no turn the Quran I don't want to listen to it I go to malls I go to hotels I go to shops 24 hours seven days a week music nobody plays the Quran why you play the Quran this is Baraka this is tranquility people don't like to listen to the Quran this is abandoning the Quran number two most of us listen to the Quran alhamdulillah but we do not contemplate and read the tafsir and you find Muslims nowadays talking about global warming about governments about elections about world peace about politics and when you ask them do you know the Quran I said no they're not qualified you go to a Muslim leader and you say to him Allah says what does it mean I don't know five Ayah short Surah you recite it every day I don't know how old are you 50. and you till now did not open that FC to read what it means what does mean it's one of Allah's names I don't know isn't it a problem or not and if I say to you Liverpool who are the players in Liverpool Christino Ronaldo well where is he oh in Saudi Arabia yeah everybody knows but when it comes to Quran zero people don't know the Quran then this is also one of the ways of abandoning the Quran most people only recite the Quran when a person dies and they give um the reward to the deceased when woman gets pregnant mother-in-law comes and says 41 times you will get a boy so if I recite it 40 times I'll get a girl what is this where is this coming from all of this Innovation because shaytan managed to make them go out of the way number three of abandoning the Quran you listen to it you understand the meaning of it but you refuse to implement it when I have a problem with my brother let's go to the Quran no no no no I like to go to court why because the Quran and Sharia is not going to be in my favor I had many counseling sessions in America Canada Europe between a man and his wife they're having divorce the woman is nakabi hijabi Masha memorizing the Quran after the divorce takes place she goes to court and takes half of his money the man comes to me of course not law she has no right in one penny of your wealth so can you speak to her Sheikh said okay why what are you doing sister she says I was married for 15 years and he divorced me I'm going to punish him punish him by what by taking half of his house half of his cars half of his bank account but this is Haram this is eating people's wealth unlawfully the prophet said it is Haram for you to consume your brother's wealth and to shed his blood and to slander him no matter what the reason is she said no no I don't care I need money and they don't care this is abandoning the Quran number four may you may act upon it you may understand it you may implement it but you don't feel the connection you don't feel that Allah is speaking to you the Quran is revealed for you not for me or him for you so when you read the Quran Allah is talking to you you don't feel this because you're just reciting it for Baraka for Azure no you have to find the sweetness of the Quran and finally abandoning the Quran as a form of healing I'm suffering alhamdulillah from fever from Bad throat from a virus I took my beloved wife gave it to me before I left Jeddah I didn't think that she was that evil but alhamdulillah so when I came here one day two days I got it so I speak to her she said you got it huh so I I've got it what do I do I recite Fatiha every time I read three times and drink and I believe I will be healed inshallah and I'm being healed I don't take medication I don't need to alhamdulillah unless I have very bad fever I have to take two panadols so that I can sleep so you have a problem with your knee you have a problem with your back you have a problem with your headache durukia read the Quran form of healing Allah said so this is one to one level I will not address the big issues of World Peace and globalization because this is way above our pay grade for us how should we relate to the Quran imagine if you every day 10 minutes only come with your brother with your sister with your wife with your parents read one or two is read it and memorize it after five years you will be memorized the whole Quran and know the whole tafsir very easy but time runs and runs and runs and we do not go forward and we do not progress so I hope my way of speaking did not put you to sleep because I know that a lot of you has already fallen asleep I can see people but I apologize it's any difficult for me to speak like this Muhammad"
