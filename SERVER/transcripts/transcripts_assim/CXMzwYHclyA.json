  "title": "Is it permissible for a woman to freeze her eggs in islam? - #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign if we look at what you're asking we would find that it is a bit beneficial but the harm and the sin in it is far greater than the benefit the possibility of these eggs being mixed with someone's else is not very little and there are tons of reports of similar incidents happening in the U.S deliberately and undeliberately where corrupt doctors used to swipe and exchange these eggs and embryos just to please a couple or for deviant purposes of Their Own so the benefit is far less and the harm is outweighs the little benefit of yours if you don't have a child after some time and if Allah does not will it alhamdulillah we live on this Earth for only a limited period of time and then we go to hopefully Jannah to name for eternity and there we will have as many children as we wish for eternity so I am inclined to say that this is not permissible and Allah Knows Best"
