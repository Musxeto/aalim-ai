  "title": "Can I intend to pay extra Zakat this year to compensate for shortcomings in previous years?",
  "transcript": "Sister Azma from India My question is about intentions related to zakat. As you have said in one of your videos that paying extra for zakat cannot be counted for next years. However, for previous 10 years, suppose I pay extra on my jewelry for the year 2022, about $1000, so that it does not fall short. But my actual dues of zakat for 2022 might have been lesser, which I wouldn't know due to not having exact weights possessed each year. Can I make intention that, although I had intended an amount as precisely as possible for each past year, but if there is anything extra in the amount given for every year, it may automatically be counted for the year before it, so that it would not be considered a delay until I gain more amount to cover remaining years? Or just because of intending $1000 for the year 2022, it will only be applied to the same year? So, if I understand your question correctly, if a person pays the zakat for the current year, and pays an extra $1000 just to be safe, and also he intends that if the previous years, there may have been shortages due to unintentional mistakes or errors in calculation, that, oh Allah, accept the $1000 extra that I'm paying now, to compensate for any shortcomings that I had done or committed in the previous years, this is totally fine and permissible, insha'Allah. If you are a Muslim, you must be able to afford a free counseling session. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So, come to me and let's speak about it, insha'Allah, within the following two days or three days. And, by Allah's permission, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all."
