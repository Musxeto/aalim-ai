  "title": "Should we leave the House if Bad things are Happening since we moved in? (Belief in Bad Omen)",
  "transcript": "my question today is uh i have a relative from my father's side they they shifted to a house and they don't believe in bad women but they say that once they shifted to that house they've been having some problems which they didn't have like their relatives are falling sick and some of the relatives are having some fights and they have to leave the house and move to another house so does this thing happen according to islam so can this happen in a particular house this is an issue of um controversy because there is a hadith where the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said there is no bad omen and if there if it's a big if if there were to be bad omen so it should be in a bad house a bad woman and a bad ride if there were some scholars looked at this and said that okay this means that if there were to be bad trouble with the three these three things then this gives us the right to change it so if i move into a house and all of a sudden i get sleepless nights children fall sick i'm having calamities financially etc and i feel great resentment to this house i don't believe in bad omens but i'm not happy some scholars say choose to leave and change the house so that you would eliminate any ill feeling or any belief in bad omens and this is a reputable opinion of scholars so you can do that the other alternative which is the most economic because relocating is difficult it's not as easy as it costs money to believe that everyone is tested on earth and this is part of your tests people falsic whether they live in mansions or in caves people have calamities whether they are living in first world countries or third world countries it doesn't matter so tests happen and we have to make dua and try our level best to overcome it and allah knows best you"
