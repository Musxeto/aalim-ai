  "transcript": "from pakistan he says what's the difference between hafs and wash and this is a technical question and i believe ali asked me this question before on uh twitter and answered him and i think he sent it again to my website and i answered it but i don't know anyhow benefit of the doubt these are two different recitations so we know that the quran came down was revealed on seven and half is side and some explain it as an accent so it's a different structure of the word with different meanings that do not go against one another but rather they go in the same channel giving additional meaning to the word itself and there were seven ahrefs there were seven great scholars who were attributed to have structured and spread the quran according to their recitation they have taken it to uh from their uh scholars to the prophet isaiah himself and hafs and wash are one of the disciples of these seven great um [Music] reciters so hafs an asam al-khufi for example and so these are their two disciples who learned from it and we have it as we speak"
