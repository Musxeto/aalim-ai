  "transcript": "my question is like what is the reality of being patients over the Calamity or the color of Allah because like sometimes when was comes to you like sometimes you have like re you have even so whenever comes to you can repent it but sometimes you feel really low and when was also comes to you instead of repelling it you like you start to entertain this thought like maybe I will never out get out of this maybe Allah will not help me so if this kind of thought comes and I like I because of my role even I start to entertain this thought does that mean like I am not counted among the patients anymore like for example if someone's in a hardship for months or maybe years and he stays patience with this but after like after sometimes after some months like when thoughts comes to him and he starts to like like think he will not get out of this and stuff like this not thinking like like proper proper thinking what should we what we should be thinking about Allah if that happens okay I I will answer you I will answer first of all the calamities nobody on Earth is Exempted from every single individual has calamities even the richest man on earth he will have a Calamity that fits him whether physical mental Financial social marital he will have his Calamity even the richest man in the world would get a divorce and would get a settlement that takes a chunk of his wealth everyone has calamities what to do when a Calamity strikes you have one of two options either to embrace it and accept it and to be content with it and move on with the tide go with the flow nothing I can do or you complain you object you reject you react you bang your head in the wall and in both cases the Calamity will remain as it is the end result the consequence of Your Action differs those who can't whose patient and content with the calamities that took place Allah will reward them greatly in the hereafter and in this Dunya Allah Will Make This calamity turn to be a good thing for them those who complain and object and do not accept the Divine decree of Allah azzawajal and they complain the Calamity would depress them would continue unchanged but they will store a lot of sins that awaits them on the day of Judgment of judgment so what to do the intrusive thoughts you get even if you entertain them as long as you don't talk about them and you do not act upon them so you're not frustrated you're not complaining to people about them you're not banging the wall or hitting the slamming the door or showing your frustration and and anxiety and depression objecting to it if you don't do any of these things these are intrusive thoughts that Allah has forgiven try your level best to block them try to your level best to fight them and acknowledge that who's giving these thoughts to me ask anyone who's putting these thoughts in my head immediately everyone will tell you shaytan ask yourself this question is shaytan intending good for me or evil everyone will say of course evil what is shaytan intending to drag you to Hellfire with him so when you listen to him and respond to his call what are you doing you're pleasing him and you're obeying him do you think that Allah is happy with you of course not Allah is angry with you so what are you going to do definitely if you look at it from this perspective you're going to block and not entertain such Whispers and you're going to remain steadfast accepting This calamity because it's from Allah can I change it can I do anything to improve my situation maybe look for another job maybe go to the doctors okay this is halal Allah is telling you to go ahead but to complain and object and resent what's happening and show your frustration this is not something in your favor and Allah Knows Best"
