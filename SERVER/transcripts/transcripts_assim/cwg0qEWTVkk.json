  "title": "Is It Allowed to Use a Telescope to Sight the Moon? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "um is one allowed to use a telescope to site the moon as far as using telescope for citing the moon it's permissible because finally you have to use your eyes so a telescope it only makes it easier for you to see it brings the object closer to you it seems to be closer the object is there the Moon is there the moon doesn't come closer but it seems closer and it's easily seen so using the telescope is permissible it does not at all go against the Shar against the saying of the Prophet there are some people who do object to it but they fail to realize that then if they object to using telescope you have to OB even see with the spectacles because when a person sees the spectacle like when I see I'm using the spectacles it's nothing but a glass it's making a correction in my eyesight and I Can See Clearly so if you object using the telescope that means you have to object even using the spectacles telescope is nothing but there are some lenses some glasses put so that it helps you in seeing so as long as you see with your eyes it helps you in seeing there's no problem so the scholars are unanimous in this that using telescope is permissible if you want to use it but it will make a little bit difference not much not much difference because when the moon is there and if it's a cloudy sky with the telescope also you can't see it and if you have a good eyesight without the telescope if the moon is to be cited it will be seen But if someone wants to use it he can use it it's permissible"
