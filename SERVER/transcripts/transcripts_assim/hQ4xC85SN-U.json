  "transcript": "um Chef if someone's making dawa to some sort of surface family or his friends or someone else and he's advising them reminding them warn them from the punishment of punishment from Allah but these people they respond that it is none of his business or they respond that it is between them and Allah how should we respond to that respond by simply saying okay and stopping see you are not obliged in Islam to shove things down people's throats you can always lead a horse to the river you can never Force the horse to drink Allah says in the Quran it is not up to you Muhammad peace be upon Him to guide people rather guidances in the hands of Allah so all what you can do is present your case give them advice remind them of Allah show them an Ayah show them a Hadith if they are defiant if they are not inclined to listen and they don't want to listen quote unquote the hell with them I did my duty and I tried my level best to bring them closer to Allah and they don't want to I would utilize my time and effort with other people who would listen so if I did this with all of my family and they don't want to listen I'll go somewhere else I go to the neighbors I go to the Masjid next door I go to the community I go online I do utilize my time with people who are thirsty for truth and knowledge rather than these ignorant imbeciles who are so indulge in these swamps of worldly matters or what they care about is their desires and lusts and gaining money let them be I did my due diligence I did my level best to call them with Fair preaching and wisdom they don't want to listen so should I force them under gunpoint of course not so let them be and move on"
