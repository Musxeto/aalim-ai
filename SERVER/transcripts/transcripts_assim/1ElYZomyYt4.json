  "title": "Spitting to the Left 3 times In Salah to Ward Off Whispers of Shaytan",
  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Bangladesh, I've learned that if we get afflicted by \nwhisperings in Salah, you know part the   Devil Khanzab, and we have to say we have \nto seek refuge in Allah from Shaytaan and   spit three times on our left side, sheikh is \nthis only in the standing position and is this   in any amount of response or \nis it when it's overwhelming. Okay I will answer In Shaa Allah. [Questioner] from Bangladesh, he says while \nhaving whispers in Salah we were taught   by the Prophet ﷺ that one has to seek \nrefuge in Allah three times from Shaytaan   and then spit to his left \nor beneath his left foot,   so is this only when standing? The answer \nis no, this is throughout the prayer   usually, but standing is the most appropriate \nposition to do it and or when you're sitting down,   if you're in sujud this is not applicable, so is \nthis with any type of whispers or overwhelming   whispers, no it is with overwhelming whispers \nbecause normal whispers come and go, we're talking   about something that is persistent, something that \nis continuous to something that is bugging you   and impacting negatively your prayer, this \nis when you do it and Allah knows best."
