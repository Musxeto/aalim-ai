  "title": "Is skipping Sunnah to avoid judgment considered showing off (as Iâ€™m doing it for the people)?",
  "transcript": "Saad from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaikumussalam some things that are like sunnah out of the fear that since the local people don't do it they might think that I don't know how to pray or something so would my prayer be invalid because or would this be considered showing off? No this is not related at all to the validity of your prayer and your prayer is 100% valid."
