  "title": "Voting in Democracy & Can we vote for a candidate who will work to help Muslims get their rights",
  "transcript": "from nigeria sheikh we know that in a democratic country it may be permissible to vote for a muslim candidate if he is known as someone that would fight for the rights of muslims but sheikh in a situation where there's a dilemma where on one hand it's so hard or impossible to find a muslim candidate that when elected he would not sign bills involving river or allocate lands to those who would build gambling centers or nightclubs and then on the other hand if we choose not to vote for this uh muslim candidate because uh who would not do the sins i just listed if we choose to vote for him um now we would give uh non-muslims in the country a chance to take over or run the country however they like and muslims may lose most of their rights so what do we do in this situation first of all voting in a democracy goes against islam because you vote over people who are not qualified and you vote over making haram things halal and you give the right to choose two people who are laymen and may and most likely would choose some something that goes against sharia so this is totally un-islamic however we have a rule in islam which is weighing the pros and cons as sheikhou to compile the benefits and the advantages and complete them and to prevent bad things and disadvantages and reduce them this is what sharia came with so in a country that it's is quote unquote democratic we have to look into the candidates okay he's a muslim but he's not a real muslim like most democratic countries where you have politicians usually the politicians are the dirtiest people on earth they lie they cheat usually i'm saying not don't quote me they lie and they cheat and they say things and they can sell islam and their religion for a penny and you pay pe peanuts you know you get monkeys this is what you get nevertheless there might be someone who is trustworthy whose honest who has integrity and dignity but it's not that huge will you find them so such a muslim candidate when i compare him to the others i find him that he's better overall all in all not in every single thing yes he may promote riba he may promote opening of nightclubs or bars but at the same time he tries to push a lot of islamic agendas that would benefit the muslims that would give them their rights that would give them freedom of religion to practice their islam to wear the hijab to promote uh prayers in in the masjids quran etc when i compare him to someone who is totally secularist and against islam and hates islam or promotes the enemies of islam then definitely this one is better than that one so in islam you have to weigh the pros and cons usually what gives you an advantage in figuring the things out is you go to your scholars in your country and i'm talking about real scholars not uh scholars who are politicians i hear that you get imams quote unquote coming to make a khutba in jummua on a friday endorsing one of the candidates and saying all the things he's going to deliver if he were to be elected in a masjid no this is not right and such a person is not a scholar maybe i don't know i don't put anything in my conscience but go to the real scholars who have no affiliation with the government or with the politicians who's not on their payroll who's independent who fears allah and he hasn't does not have any hidden agenda and this inshallah would give you the right decision see you"
