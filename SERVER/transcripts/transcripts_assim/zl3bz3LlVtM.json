  "title": "What does Being at ease Tranquility in prayer mean (involuntary movements in salah) Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "from the uk he says being at ease which is translated in arabic to nina is a pillar of salat so if a person is in sujud and he has an involuntary case of shaking his feet without his will this has no impact on your salat and even if you're standing up this has no impact in your salat i prayed the other day with a brother may allah cure him and grant him a good health who had a stroke in his brain and when praying all of a sudden his hand moves involuntary and goes he has to grab it and put it back on his chest so is his prayer valid definitely it's valid but what is meant by toma nina tranquility at ease is that when you pray and stand in prayer you don't move excessively where people who look at you say that no no this guy is not praying for example if i'm praying and all of a sudden i do this and i start okay anyone who looks at me says this guy can't be praying he's checking his mobile is watching maybe he's texting so this means that there is no nina and that the prayer is invalid muhammad"
