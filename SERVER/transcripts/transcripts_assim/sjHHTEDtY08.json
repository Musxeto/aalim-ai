  "transcript": "And finally, the Prophet ﷺ used a very needed etiquette for us today when talking. He would not publicize people's names in the public. So Aisha says, if the Prophet ﷺ was told something negative about a person, the Prophet ﷺ would never go and say publicly, why did so and so, and name the person, why did Abdullah do this or say this. Like in the hadith of Ibn Lutbiya, a man, the Prophet dispatched to collect the zakat money. So the man came after a few weeks and said, O Prophet of Allah, this is the zakat money I collected from all the different tribes and this is a gift that was given to me. So the Prophet ﷺ got onto the pulpit, praised Allah, offered salutation upon the Prophet ﷺ and said, why do we employ people to collect the zakat and they come back to us saying that this is your zakat and this was given to me. On what basis they were given a gift? Shouldn't they stayed in their father and mother's home and see whether people would give them a gift or not? The answer is definitely not, because this is a bribe. Had you not been an employee by the government or by the Prophet ﷺ, nobody would have come to your house and said, listen akhi, this is a gift for you. But because you're collecting zakat, they're wanting you to cut them some slack and this is why they're giving you something underneath the table and this is a bribe. In this hadith, the Prophet did not say, why did Ibn al-Lutubiyyah did so and so and so? He just simply said it vaguely and generally and this is an etiquette we Muslims need. If you go to YouTube or Instagram or whatever they call them, snapshots and social media, you will find brothers mentioning by name this da'i, this scholar, this individual and stripping them actually, metaphorically that is, otherwise it would have been a rated R. They were stripping them and exposing them and they said this and they said that and they said and it's back and forth between them. It's like volleyball, throwing the ball from one court to the other and they're wasting the Muslims times and they're slandering one another and they're losing a lot of good deeds and each one of them say, I'm doing it for the sake of Allah. I'm exposing him so that I would warn the Muslims and it's all a private vendetta. It's all something inside their hearts filled with malice and envy and may Allah protect us all. Yeah, if you want to warn against someone, don't mention them by name, just say generally speaking, don't follow this way of thinking, follow the mainstream of scholars, trusted scholars, someone who's not controversial, instead of saying Sheikh so-and-so or doctor so-and-so or da'i so-and-so and you fill people's hearts with malice and and hatred rather than filling it with peace and deen and proper knowledge. We have a short break, stay tuned and inshallah, we'll be right back."
