  "transcript": "Sinjar from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh How are you doing Sheikh? Doing great with the grace of Allah Azza Wa Jal Alhamdulillah Sheikh my question was that there's a dua that we say when we wake up which is like Alhamdulillahilladhi yahyaana ba'dama matana wa ilayhin nushu my question was do we say that when we only wake up in the morning or do we say that like when we wake up after naps or at night times this dua to my knowledge is to be said when you wake up from night sleep but if you wake up from a siesta from sleep that is during the daytime you say Alhamdulillahilladhiyaana ba'dama matana wa ilayhin nushu and Allah Azza Wa Jal knows best"
