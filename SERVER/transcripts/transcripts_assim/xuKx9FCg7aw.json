  "title": "Are the Urine & Feces of Animals that are halal to eat considered to be pure? | Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "but Han says please make a video about this okay here we are as I was holding a rabbit in my lap and it peed on me can I pray in those clothes his rabbit pee or urine neji's we've spoken about this so many times impurity is not something that we come and decide so impurity is not synonymous with dirty so I could have stains of oil or grease on my clothes and hands and I would say this is dirty but this does not prevent me from praying my prayer is valid so impurity or nagisa is a religious labeling of something and it's not known by our own intellect it's known by the revelation from the Quran from the Sunnah when to make a long story short the scholars looked into the evidences regarding the droppings and urine and defecating of animals and birds and they came with a rule and this is what even Tamiya has come up with and scholars before him and after him what is the rule the rule is if the animals meat is halal to consume then the urine and the droppings are considered to be pure very simple let us look at this bird is it halal for us to eat if yes then if it flies over us and drops poos a poo on our head there is no problem I can frame give example a pigeon so pigeon left overs urine or droppings is pure it is not nyjah's is it dirty today's 30 but it is not as you see does not impact my prayer and purity when I want to pray an eagle a hawk a crow a lark or whatever predators no these are totally prohibited for us to eat even if we hunt them if we slaughter them we cannot eat them therefore this is nature's we come to a sheep a goat a camel a cow the droppings are hala are pure we're over we are even permitted to pray where they sit in their barns with all the droppings and urine the prayer is valid as in the same a Muslim but when it comes to dogs lions tigers foxes wolves and all the other animals that we're not allowed or entitled or permitted to eat then their droppings and urine is considered to be nudges so the question would be is the rabbit it is the habit I took from my hat and peed over my lap would that be analogous or not the answer is can we eat rabbit meat the answer is yes the prophet√≠s m8 rabbit meat which means it's helada in this case the droppings in the urine is not neji's"
