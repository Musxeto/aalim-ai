  "transcript": "foreign [Music] oh actually okay I will answer you there is a difference my friend between Rukia and ascar avkar is a set of phrases and prophetic hadiths and verses of the Quran that we say in the morning and evening time after fourth prayer before going to bed after before leaving the home before eating after eating before entering a toilet so many things these are called adkar and these are mentioned in the small booklet Fortress of the Muslim which Allah blessed me to explain and it's on YouTube on my channel and elsewhere Rokia is a set of verses of the Quran and Prophets sayings and supplications only specifically recited to uplift an illness a disease evil eye Envy black magic or gent possession and the likes so if you have harm or you're affected by evil spirits or a disease or something that aches you and pain in your body you do Rokia so now you're referring to a scar of bed or before going to bed and the answer is if you say it before you go to bed and you wake up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet or to pray and then you want to go again to bed you are not required to say them again because the first time is sufficient for you and Allah Knows Best"
