  "transcript": "uh I wanted to ask obviously we know that free mixing is Haram and everything if we have a buy like coming to the house let's say friend of the family or something and we know that obviously premixing will happen and Stu are we allowed to go and greet the person and then leave the place where the premixing is happening is it in your place or you're visiting no in our place like where I live with my family and stuff but I know that fixing will happen or it's happening can I go and just you and St and then I leave if there are women of the opposite gender present no you're not allowed to go and give Salam you just go to your own room or leave the house because if you go and give Salam you have to tell them that this is Haram this is free mixing you must not uh have such free mixing around but giving them Salam and leaving without saying anything that would be approving what they're doing and this is not permissible and Allah Knows Best"
