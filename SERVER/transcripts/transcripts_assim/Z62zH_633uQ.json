  "transcript": "regarding refund policy Amazon policy allows buyers to return items for a refund even if there are no defects solely based on a change of mind or personal preference for example not liking the item despite it working perfectly is this policy islamically valid and will the refund I receive be Halal for me as long as the seller is approving and agreeing to this this is permissible as in Islam there is a concept of transaction of choice where I get to buy a certain specific item and I demand to have the choice of either going through it or returning it and refunding my money for a day 3 days a week so this is permissible and if they give you this option then this is permissible as well however is it ethical meaning that some people abuse this by buying things and refunding it the the price after using it and this is unethical unlam to use something and once you get what you want from it you demand a refund a muslim's a Muslim does not do this because if someone were to do it for you and and treat you in the same fashion you would not have liked it and Allah uh Knows Best"
