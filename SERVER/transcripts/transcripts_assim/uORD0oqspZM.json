  "transcript": "from pakistan he says give us an advice to people who are vaccinated yet still a bit extreme when it comes to shaking hands cleaning surfaces wearing face masks they still take precautions though they are vaccine vaccinated well this is a personal preference we have a saying in arabic who's ever stung by a snake he's going to be intimidated when seeing a rope in the beginning last week he was stung by a snake it was painful it was dangerous now every time he sees a rope on the ground he's afraid it might be a snake when you drink soup that is boiling hot and it hurts you in your tongue and the pain remains for three four days next time when you eat ice cream you're gonna be careful so the trauma of a previous experience remains with you i cannot blame someone when i come to shake hands and he shake hands with me and brings the sanitizer and cleans his hand afterwards why are you doing this with me i'm not a dog i'm not najis no i completely understand and this is his preference so don't bother what people think and behave as long as it's their lives not yours and allah knows best"
