  "transcript": "question about her online class where she's supposed to change the facial features of a robot online and this is something she's taking in school she asked for an alternative they said either take this subject or take music so she says now i'm i'm lost what what should i do i don't know i can tell you it is halal and what is haram and to the best of my knowledge if you go to your teacher and say to them that this goes against my religion i'm willing to make another project i'm willing to draw a landscape to do whatever you want me to do just to prove to you that i'm good in using this particular software or program or i understand the concept of this subject i'm studying they would agree without any problem no one would hold a gun against your head and say that no you have to do it alhamdulillah but hypothetically if you are at the crossroad and either you make it or break it either you flunk all of your subjects and waste or your degree and won't be able to continue just because of this uh um obstacle in this case due to necessity you may but to my own conviction you don't have a reason or a valid to do so and they will change it with the will of allah"
