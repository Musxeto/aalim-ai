  "transcript": "he says that in somewhere we're in so many messages when they give the a van they have this practice of putting their fingers in their ears like this and when they give the a van they turn right and they turn left when they say hi Alice Oh Lottie hi Alan fella so he says is this practice from the sooner the answer is yes first of all Bilal the more evident of the Prophet our Sam used to do this now putting the fingers in the ears as the scholars say would cause you not to hear your voice loud so you would exert as much effort as possible to make your voice reach as far as possible this practice was suitable when we had no microphones and loudspeakers nowadays with the microphone in front of your mouth if you say hi Alice Allah the volume would not reach as many people the voice would not reach as many people as when you say it straight forward so this Sunnah was applicable when there were no microphones now with the microphones the sunnah is not to do it because the reason and the justification for turning right and left is to get your voice as far as possible and the opposite happens if you do it now with the microphones as for the fingers in the ears this still can apply and there's no problem in that insha'Allah"
