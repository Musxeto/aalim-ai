  "transcript": "and finally says i've read somewhere that hell has a cold portion called zamharir and there is a hadith or a dua that would prevent us from going there and this dua says is this authentic now we know that hellfire is divided into two different portions of torment there is extreme heat and there is extreme cold and the extreme cold is called zamharir and there are different types of torment in hellfire things that take you up and things that take you down things that you drink and would burn your intestines your face your it's horrible different types of torments and one of the types is the extreme cold and one does not imagine how can cold be a former torment until he hears about frost bites and how people lose their fingers and limbs due to cold if you notice that some type of gases are so cold that they would burn you like nitrogen liquid nitrogen if it comes in contact with your flesh it burns it so it is a form of torment is the hadith authentic the answer is no the hadith is not authentic however if someone is living in canada or up north where it's freezing like 20 or 30 degrees below zero and he simply asks allah to protect him from azer in hell fire which we know that is authentic and there there's nothing wrong in that providing he doesn't say it with the conviction that this is a hadith because it's not a hadith and allah azzawajal knows best"
