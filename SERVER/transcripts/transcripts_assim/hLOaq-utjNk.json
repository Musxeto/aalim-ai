  "title": "Is a woman sinful if she decides not to breastfeed her child | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "a sister says am i sinful if I do not breastfeed my child without any valid reason the answer is no this was mentioned in the Quran when there's a dispute between a wife and her husband over suckling if she doesn't want to suckle her own child then they will get someone else to do that so there's nothing wrong for a woman to refuse suckling her own child which is very rare because this is human nature but we don't know people's circumstances and this might be a valid for some but there is no sin even if she does not suckle her child for any good reason there's no sin on her insha'Allah"
