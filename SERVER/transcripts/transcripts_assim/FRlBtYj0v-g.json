  "title": "If my mum asks me to do something, am I sinful if I delayed it until after praying? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign time but as for women is not a must for us we can delay the prayers so my question is what if my mother asked me to do something that I can do afterwards after praying uh would I be sinfully for you disobey her as long as you know that she would not be angry alhamdulillah you can pray and then do whatever she told you to do and better more you can notify her that you would like to pray first and this would take 10 minutes 15 minutes and then you will do whatever you want you she wants you to do but if you know that she is in urgent need of that thing and the time is extended so if you do what she asks you and then go and pray there is no harm done there is no sin none whatsoever alhamdulillah it's a win-win situation"
