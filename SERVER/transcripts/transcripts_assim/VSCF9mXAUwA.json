  "transcript": "foreign to the following chapter which is remembrance said in the morning and the evening so what did we discuss earlier it was the remembrance and the vicar said after the five daily prayers now these are said after or in the morning and the evening twice a day however if you combine them saying them immediately after fajr or after assar or mahrez because it's a difference of opinion among scholars whether evening at carr should be said after asar or after maghrib either way if you managed to say that that would hit two birds with one stone this is why among the first athkar to be said in the morning and evening ayatura so the sheikh may allah have mercy and his soul started with saying i take refuge with allah from the accursed devil then recite do we recite when recite reciting ayat al-qurasi there is no need to do that because it's not part of the sunnah yet generally speaking when reciting the quran the sunnah is to recite the regime not with the atkar as this was not prescribed so we recite ayatul kursi in the morning in the evening as well as with the five daily prayers then we recite the last three pulls okay shaykh but we recited them after fajr yeah you recited them once each but in the morning and evening at car you recite them thrice each so you say three times three times three times in the morning and in the evening so if you manage to say that in fajr or in maghrib there's no need for you to repeat that once after fajr prayer or maghrib prayer because doing it three times each would suffice for that you would have hit two birds with one stone then part of the athkar in the morning and in the evening is to say this long vicar we have reached the morning and at this very time unto allah belongs also sovereignty and all praise is for allah none has the right to be worshipped except allah alone without any partner to him belongs all sovereignty and praise and he is over all things omnipotent my lord i ask you for the good of this day and the good of what follows it and i take refuge in you from the evil of this day and the evil of what follows it my lord i take refuge in you from laziness and senility my lord i take refuge in you from torment in the fire and punishment in the grave what a beautiful dua that incorporates a lot of things so laziness is when you have the ability to do but you don't senility is when you have the the desire to do something but your body doesn't cooperate with you so you don't have the ability to do it so you seek allah from whatever goodness is in this day and what follows it and you seek refuge in allah from whatever evil is in this day and what may follow it and you ask allah azzawajal to save you from all of these things what else we also say this beautiful dua in the morning in the evening we switch we say because is the same in the morning we say in the evening we say wa ilika translation in the morning we say oh allah by your leave we have reached the morning and by your leave we have reached the evening switch it in the evening so you say o allah by your leave we have reached the evening and by your leave we have reached the morning and then it goes on to be the same buy or leave we live and die this is unchanged in both morning and evening but the conclusion in the morning you say and unto you is our resurrection and in the evening you say and unto you is our return what does this cement in us it cements that this is our inevitable destination this is our fate we are born to die we are born to die nobody lives forever the jinn the humans they all die so once you have this as a way of life once you live knowing that you're about to die do you think you will be able to steal to kill to lie to cheat to harm others to neglect your obligations not to worship allah do you think you're going to skip prayers or fasting ramadan or not giving zakat on time no way because you know that you're about to die and your death can't be seconds away from now there are so many videos being circulated of scholars and and that is giving an announced a narration or a speech and while doing it they die people praying in the masjid they die did any one of them expect that no neither do we but when you frequently say this dua and acknowledging that hey i'm about to die i don't know when definitely this would reflect on your style of living and how you deal with life and death and allah azza knows best was muhammad [Music] foreign"
