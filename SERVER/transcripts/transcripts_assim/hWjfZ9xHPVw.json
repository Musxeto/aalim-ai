  "title": "Water reaches throat (while rinsing nose) in Wudu while Fasting, valid? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Salman from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah Sheikh I want to ask about Wudu while fasting I know the hadith of Ibn Sawira which forbids us to exaggerate but in my case water reaches my throat when I rinse nose in Wudu because of the following reasons. Firstly, my nose is blocked most of the times. Secondly, due to OCD I rinse nose multiple times, seven or eight times and sometimes I restart Wudu, sometimes I inhale harder as I feel that water has not gone inside and thirdly, I think that I don't sniff properly as water reaches throat sometimes in first or second attempt when the nose is blocked as well as when it is open. I try my best to spit it out but sometimes I swallow accidentally and sometimes I'm not sure. So as long as it is done accidentally Salman and not purposely, your fast is valid and to do to try to sniff and blow your nose six or seven times, this is not part of the Wudu. If your nose is blocked, it's blocked. You try to do it within the three allocated times of inhaling or sniffing the water and pushing it out, three times. More than that is not needed and it's not a must to reach your upper part of your nostrils. If it's blocked, the moment it goes to the best of your ability, this is sufficient insha'Allah."
