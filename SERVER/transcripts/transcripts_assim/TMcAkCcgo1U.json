  "transcript": "Aman from the US can you hear can you hear me clearly clearly I answered your question and your Salam oh okay um so my question is uh that uh there's someone that I know who has very big problem which that which is that uh every time the name of Allah has mentioned his mind tries to picture Allah and it seems like he can't control these thoughts but he knows that whatever he visualizes is not Allah because Allah is not cannot be comprehended by anyone and he says that every time his mind tries to picture Allah he says Subhan Allah and he seeks refu Refuge with Allah from Shan but he says that it doesn't seem to be working because it keeps coming over and over and not only that that's very frequently so what should I advise this person I would highly recommend that he takes a counseling session with me if he can afford it and if he cannot afford it you you know that we give one session only for free for those who are poor and they make Allah their witness and judge that they cannot afford it now this friend of yours has no choice either he stops these Whispers or he goes with it and believes it if it's the latter if he believes that these images are of Allah and he concedes to these Whispers he's a cfir he's a full-fledged hypocrite reserved his seat in Hellfire for eternity no going out and if he blocks it and he acknowledges that yeah this is Shan what does shatan want from you to throw you in hell what are you going to do I'm going to go with him to hell then be my guest no I'm going to block this I'm GNA fight it I'm not going to listen to him this is how you win and Allah Knows Best"
