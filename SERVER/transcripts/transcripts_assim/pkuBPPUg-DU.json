  "title": "Broke Wudu during Isha but continued praying anyway & prayed 4 days after that, all prayers invalid?",
  "transcript": "Ahmed from Egypt Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Hassan Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So Sheikh Hassan, while I was praying Al-Aisha prayer, I nullified my Wudu. However, I continued praying with that invalid Wudu and I didn't repeat my Wudu again to be honest. Not only that also, but after this invalid prayer, I continued praying the prayers for the four days after. And on the fourth day, I repeated only that Al-Aisha prayer that I prayed with nullified Wudu four days ago or before that day. So my question here is... Well, why did you do this Ahmed? To be honest, I don't know. It's just like being lazy or something like that. I'm thankful for that, I know. So, I'll understand from that, that after this Isha prayer, the following day Fajr, you did make Wudu, right? Yeah, correct. So, your question is, would be these four days that I've prayed after the Isha, which was not valid, be counted? Or should I repeat the Isha prayer and then repeat the 20 prayers of the four days? Is that your question? Yes, correct. Ya Sheikh, Mashallah, I'm very smart. Anyhow, Akhi, your prayers of the four days are fine. The Isha prayer that you skipped intentionally and did not pray and did not repeat your Wudu to do it is gone. There is no way you can make it up. Allah will not accept it from you. And you have committed a major sin by pretending. Ya Akhi, how is it possible? Allahu Akbar. Hey, what are you doing? I'm praying for the sake of Allah Azza wa Jal. Okay, are you in Wudu? Yes, I am in Wudu. Mashallah, keep on praying. I finished my prayer. I'm doing it for the sake of Allah. Allahu Akbar. I'm praying, I'm in Wudu and I break my Wudu. Whoa, hey, who are you praying to? I'm not praying. So what are you doing? I don't know. I'm just too lazy. I might as well continue to pray. Are you crazy? You are standing in front of Allah. And you're pretending to be praying to Allah. Question. Does Allah know that you have broken your prayer? Does Allah know that? And he says, yep. So who are you fooling? I'm not fooling anyone. I'm just pretending to pray. I seek refuge with Allah. This can mount to kufr if you're pretending to pray while knowing that Allah knows that you're not praying. So what are you doing? Are you mocking Islam? So this was a very, very major sin. It's gone. It's behind you. Number one, be remorseful. Ask Allah for forgiveness. Repent to Allah. Do a lot of good deeds, charity, night prayer, offering voluntary prayer. And be remorseful. Be afraid that Allah may punish you for that which you had done. But the four days of prayer were valid, inshallah. And there's no problem in that."
