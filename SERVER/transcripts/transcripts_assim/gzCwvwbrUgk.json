  "title": "A drop of urine does not pollute the entire ocean, learn to forgive others & be lenient assimal",
  "transcript": "[Music] next 465 page number 311 311 chapter is leniency aisha said prophet salallahu said forgive those who are virtuous they are minor slips authentic forgive those who are virtuous their miners slips what is this the translation is a little bit poor but the prophet is telling us [Music] that muslims have categories some of them are virtuous pious practicing yet this does not mean at all that they are infallible can there be anyone infallible other than our prophet allah was no way only the prophet so no matter how high your ranking is no matter how strong your iman is you still have shortcomings so once the shortcomings happen and appear from someone who's righteous and practicing as this individual what does the prophet tell us forgive look the other way why because this is one of so many good things that he has done this is a drop in an ocean a drop of impurity does not pollute the ocean so the prophet is telling us those who the norm is that they're good righteous virtuous if they make a mistake if they make a sin neglect it overlook it and forgive it and this is what they call leniency this is how we should treat those who are respected those of dignitary status that one mistake every few years is negligible it's a mistake they will overcome it because the prophet told us assam that every son of adam is sinful and the best of sinfuls are those who repent so we should not uh make it something that goes out of proportion however if someone is constantly sinning should we forgive him no this person has to be held accountable someone who is constantly doing wrong after wrong tarnishing the reputation of islam causing misheave causing problems in the society and we say we will forgive we will look the other way around no you have to draw the line we're talking about someone who is 99 active beneficial virtuous righteous but he made a single mistake forgive him like [Music] who's he he's one of the companions who witnessed badr on the eighth year of hijrah the prophet israel told the companions that we are going to conquer mecca he made a mistake he wrote a letter warning the people of matka of the islamic invasion and he gave it to a woman and sent the messenger to go the prophet islam received revelation from the sky from the heavens from allah telling him about what's happened the prophet sent a zubair alibnabi talib and told them that in that particular location you will find the woman and the woman has the letter bring the letter back to me they went to that location they found the woman they told her bring me the letter she said i don't have any letter they told her listen the prophet told us that you have a letter and he doesn't lie either you give us the letter or we'll strip you naked [Music] so the woman was scared and she said okay doke she took the letter from her bun she had long hair and she gave it to them they brought it back to the prophet i saw him he read the letter he said what is this took his sword o prophet of allah let make a long story short allow me to decapitate him kill him the prophet doesn't do this as some he has to investigate defend yourself give me the reason don't jump to conclusion any one of us would have jumped to conclusion whenever something wrong happens ask for justification with an open mind because you will find a reason for that how to have said by allah o prophet of allah i am not a hypocrite i believe that allah would fulfill his promise to you and that you will conquer makkah but because i am not originally from mecca i just wanted to have a favor to them that would not avail them would not do them any good they're going to be conquered they're going to be conquered but i just wanted them to remember this favor for years to come so that it would benefit my children and my family that's it now this is an act of treason so when omar said let me kill him the prophet said no allah azzawajal has addressed the people who attended badr by saying do whatever you want i forgive all of your sins so this particular mistake and the only mistake we know about how to may allah be pleased with him what did the prophet do surah he forgave it and this is how we should treat our friends our colleagues our relatives you have a colleague for 10 years he comes on time leaves on time does all the jobs he does or he's requested to do a week happens and he doesn't come on time he doesn't deliver on time and you sack him years that does not intercede for you you look into his matter maybe his father is in hospital and he's on and off with him maybe his wife is sick or divorced him and he is stuck with two children you have to appreciate and make excuses i was praying isha in my masjid which i rarely do because i'm not an imam i'm just a khatib so sometimes i go to deliver my lectures or i don't have anything to do so i prayed i was the imam during the prayer a child started to cry miserably what is the sunnah hast in your prayer so i asked it's an excuse i want to leave and so i finished my prayer in a quicker fashion than i usually do after i finished i turned around there was this man and there were two little girls one of the elders as the elders usually do unfortunately now i think i talk about the elders i'm an elder myself i get people saying coming youngsters coming to me and i think they're going to challenge me maybe in in some sports hey uncle uncle yeah i'm an uncle so what so one of the elders stood up and unfortunately the elders usually are very loud and rude and this is a deficiency the hadith that all of you know there's another version of it the prophet says whoever his life is prolonged and his deeds are good will enter jannah you know this hadith there's a third edition that people usually conceal and not say whoever man his age is prolonged and he has good deeds and hasuna and he has good character it is a well-known fact that usually the older you get the more impulsive and you're not able to tolerate and your children are afraid of you your grandchildren are way way afraid of you you're grumpy you're always complaining you're always criticizing this is a deficiency you have to fix what why do we bring this issue up one of the elders in the masjid stood up after the prayer was over and started banging on this brother fear allah don't bring your children don't do this don't do that you have annoyed us we cannot pray we cannot concentrate the man made a charade made a scene when everybody else was going to suffer most of them he is making a senator the gentleman took his two daughters and quietly left the masjid i immediately opened the door i have a special door for the imam and i went and i met him from the other way and i went to him and i said brother forgive our uncle at the time yeah he's impulsive and he didn't mean anything except good and forgive him take it easy he's not from the neighborhood this brother and wallahi the man broke in tears a grown-up saudi he was in mid-thirties started crying like a baby and i was looking what did i do and the guy saying i don't know what to do their mother left me four months ago and i'm the only one taking care of my two daughters she is six and the other one is three or four not my family are willing to take care of her not her family are willing to take care of her i leave my work i don't have a maid and i don't know what to do allah and the guy started to cry i felt so bad but imagine how this uncle felt when i told him the following day because i met him and he's one of my students and i told him look what you have done to that brother he told me so and so on well i didn't know then don't open your mouth seriously the way the prophet deals with issues our sunnah you see something wrong ask then act not shoot then ask questions so the prophet asked hatha why when he got the justification he forgave him because it was once in a lifetime a sin that was not reoccurring so he gave it away"
