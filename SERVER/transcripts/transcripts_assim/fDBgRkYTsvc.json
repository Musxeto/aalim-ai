  "transcript": "uh the next uh question that we are including is from a uh youth from a young boy basically he's saying is that uh these days in our school everything is online and on during the tests kids other kids they cheat and they get better marks does this make cheating in these tests halal for me two wrongs don't make a right and when all the people on earth decide to worship idols muslims stay steadfast and only worship allah azzawajal so if the old cheat this is the mistake of the school this is a mistake of the administration that does not uh take heed in ensuring that none of this takes place and hence you are not allowed to be with them if they sin you have to uh exclude yourself from such a behavior a muslim does not cheat and the muslim does not lie jazakallahu"
