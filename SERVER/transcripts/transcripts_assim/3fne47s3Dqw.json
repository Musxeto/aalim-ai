  "transcript": "an anonymous sent a question saying what is the ruling on the regular white discharge of a woman does it break her Woodill and does she have to change her undergarment before praying this is an issue of dispute the vast majority considers such vaginal discharges of women to be pure and that she does not have to wash or change the issue of dispute is whether it breaks your rule or not so the vast majority of scholars say that finding it does not impact your purity so it's not like urine it's not like Navy it is not Naji's in its in nature now whether it breaks wood or not it's an issue of dispute the vast majority of scholars say that it does break Waddell even has him and some other scholars said that no it does not break Waddell because women at the time of the Prophet erase a lot or some used to suffer from it as it's a natural thing and no one ever reported that it breaks photo and this is continuous and it would impose a lot of hardship on women to tell them that you have to perform Moodle every time you find this and thirdly those who say that it does not break although they say it's like sweat it is not coming out from a place of impurity rather it's coming from a place that the child comes out from which is a innocence not neji's so with all these reasons and others these scholars who went against the vast majority of scholars say it does not break woudl and this is what I'm inclined to the opinion of making it easy for women as there is no solid proof that it breaks hollow and it was never reported so we know that answering the call of nature breaks photo we have information and authentic hadith about estaba which is the blood that runs after the period of monthly menstrual cycle and how to deal with that and how to perform will do for every salat for that and we never heard anything in regarding the issue of vaginal discharges which means that insha'Allah it is it does not break well and if a woman wants to be safe rather than sorry and she performs Woodill for every salat she wants to perform after the event then she would be safe and no one would say she is wrong but again the vast majority say that it is not impure so there's no impurity on her clothes and she does not need to change that and Allah Azza WA JAL knows best"
