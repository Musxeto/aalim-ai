  "transcript": "Muhammad from the US. So I know that the largest Jamarat that pilgrims stone during Hajj is referred to as Jamarat Al-Aqaba. What are the names of the other two Jamarat and what is their significance in Islam? Thank you Sheikh. Ramadan Mubarak. And Mubarak to you as well. So the middle Jamarat is called Al-Jamarat Al-Wusta, the middle Jamarat. And the third one is called Al-Jamarat Al-Sughra, the minor or the little Jamarat. What is their significance? It's a ritual of Islam and Hajj. And the Prophet ï·º told us to take our rituals in Hajj from him. So the Prophet stoned them, we stone them. Some narrations say that this or these are the places where Satan intercepted Ibrahim peace be upon him thousands of years ago and Ibrahim stoned Satan whenever he intercepted them. I don't know whether these narrations are authentic or not. Some scholars authenticate and some do not. Either way, we don't really look into the origin of it because it's part of our Hajj and it's a ritual of our religion and we follow it for this reason. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all."
