  "transcript": "uh so last night some of my relatives were saying completely hardam things about Islam and uh I try to tell them to stop one or maximum three times for certain things that they have said but no uh not for all the topic uh so I felt and then um they didn't want to listen to me so I stayed on my side and I try to talk with my cousin about other things um so as not to hear uh the the others talking and then after seven minutes I decided to leave the living room because I briefly remember that uh when I W when it was like that you shouldn't stay with that kind of person that's why I left and um after only maybe 10 minutes I came back and they had changed their conversation but not completely but I still try to not listen to them and speak with my cousin so um what worries me is that I stayed with them and heard what they said and um I was not able to defend our religion correctly and that I didn't do enough though I was capable so um I'm afraid I have also committed an act of kuur okay first of all this is not an act of kufur in the Ayah 140 in chapter 4ah Allah tells us not to sit with such people until they are engaged in different topics otherwise we would be like them the disbelievers and the Hypocrites and and being like them does not mean that you committed an act of kufur rather you would be sinful for that like them what they're doing is kufur and the only appropriate way to handle this is to admonish them and to put your foot down and say to them this is Haram whoever says such things would leave the fold of Islam and becomes a cfir if they don't stop you leave entirely and never come back to them go to your room if you're in their home yeah leave to your home and don't associate with them once again so that they would know the gravity of what they had done being with them sitting and talking with their cousin say gives them the message that there's nothing wrong in what they had done and Allah Knows Best"
