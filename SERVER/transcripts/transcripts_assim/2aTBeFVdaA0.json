  "transcript": "Asa from Indonesia I've been regularly performing 12 prayer for some time but I feel but I feel mentally and physically exhausted when praying or finding motivation to pray I feel like I'm exper I'm experiencing some kind of burnout are there any steps I can take to prevent burnout during prayers or any other form of worship in general how many how many hours do you pray like uh 30 minutes plus a day uh yeah uh that's the Sunnah not the F okay but 30 minutes a day there's nothing to be burned out from I don't understand your question the total amount of time that we pray throughout the whole day divided on five um uh prayer times doesn't reach even one hour so why would anybody be burned out unless there is something wrong in what they're doing meaning that when they pray they repeat certain phrases and words because Shan is messing up with their head and saying that oh no no you did not say and they repeat and repeat and then they go to in this they repeat the prayer over this would burn you out and if you have this then you have a problem that needs fixing through a counseling session"
