  "transcript": "I would like to ask a she on what's the best thing I would tell a non-muslim who is interested in Islam for he or her to take a final step and become a Muslim no no this is not logical at all if we had an answer to this question we will all go let's do it such generic questions you are student of universities and you're intellectual you should understand you cannot ask questions like this if we had this formula that any non-muslim would hear and will become a Muslim why aren't we implementing it this doesn't make sense it is not one size that fits all each one has its own approach some non-muslims have the logical approach so we come to them through science we bring them the Quran and look this is the book that was revealed 15 centuries ago and it has these scientific uh uh uh facts not theories facts about the cosmos about geology about embryology about human nature about laws and about Society a lot of the non-muslims once they're rational and objective once they see this they say Yep this is definitely from Allah it cannot be man-made no way some people are targeted emotionally so we when when we tell them listen what Allah says about Adam and Eve oh this is different than what is mentioned in our Bible yes the sin was Mutual not generated by Eve it was from both man and woman and this is what had happened look what had happened with no Noah with Moses with Jesus the the miracle birth of Jesus Christ peace be upon him and the Virgin Mary blah blah blah they emotionally are attracted and say this is much much a better version than what we have and it shows how you guys honor these prophets and Messengers I accept it some look at it from a logical perspective the only scripture on Earth that has been preserved for 15 centuries not a single letter changed it is still in the same native language it was revealed in spoken by not less than 400 million living human beings on Earth memorized by not less than 10 million Muslims all over the world even those who don't speak Arabic do you need more evidence and proof show me one scripture on Earth one religion that has a constitution for how to deal with problems of life with crime with marriage with different aspects of the society there is no scripture on Earth is that is like the Quran lots of the non-muslims would say Amen they will immediately accept it but to have one specific way of a secret and magical key for people's hearts there's nothing like that to my knowledge and Allah Knows Best"
