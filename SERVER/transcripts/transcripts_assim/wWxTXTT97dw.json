  "title": "Is it correct to stop eating 10 or 15 minutes before Adhan of Fajr (Imsak)? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Junaid says why is there a timing for emsac before the fajr prayer as mentioned in the hadith the Prophet Allah salat wa sallam said that finish what is in your hand even if the event of Roger is called out please clarify a lot of the people tend to be more Roman than the Romans and this is unfortunate in Islam Allah tells us to eat and drink until we can distinguish the white thread from the black thread meaning the break of dawn from the black thread which is the night time this means that I have the right to eat and drink until I can distinguish and if I did not distinguish yet I still can drink and eat however due to the fact that we live in a city with lights and with high risers and buildings this means that we won't be able to notice when the break of dawn truly is that is why we depend on the event so the determining factor here is the call of the event the Prophet said REI salsa al-imam o bombing the Imam is a guarantor and Viru mocked a man the one who calls the van is entrusted for keeping the time therefore if someone calls the van on the day of judgment he is the one who's going to be held accountable for me eating or not eating for me praying or not praying so I have to depend on the event some people came when they made their timetables and they said well the Adhan is at five o'clock let's give a 15 minute buffer zone so 4:45 this should be in sac what do you mean by him sac it means that you don't eat or drink okay can I pray should know you can only pray after 15 minutes so who put these 15 minutes as a buffer zone so we did we thought that that would be safer no with all due respect don't innovate in my religion not on my watch the prophet aerosol sallam told us to eat and drink until we here even know me Maktoum giving the Adan Bilal gives the ad an earlier but we can eat and drink we can pray a night prayer but when I Benito me Mac - may Allah be pleased with them gives the event this is when we have to refrain so there isn't anything as such as an impact period prior to the event and I hope this answers your question"
