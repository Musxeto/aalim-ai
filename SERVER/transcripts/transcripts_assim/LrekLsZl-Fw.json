  "title": "What is the difference between Zakat and Taxes? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "simra says what is the difference between zakat and taxes and this question is exactly like if someone says what is the difference between standing up in prayers to Allah Azza WA JAL and standing up for the national anthem for example standing up for the national anthem is something else fabricated it's imitating other than imitating the disbelievers and it's standing for something other than allah azza wajal and this is a custom that people are unfortunately getting to develop they are picking up such practice in the Muslim world and this is totally prohibited as the great scholars of Islam said the funny thing is when the Quran is recited nobody stands up when the mentioning of the Prophet Allison is there nobody stands up and when they play the national anthem they make it a crime if you don't stand up now if you come to the cat and Taxation the cat is one of the pillars of Islam and the cat has been appointed and prescribed by Allah as erosion he's the one who created the heavens and the earth and he's the one who told us how to worship Him taxation it is something there is man-made this is something that is not from Islam and the vast majority of scholars say that taxation is prohibited the Prophet arezzo son said in the farewell sermon that your wealth your blood meaning your safety and your reputation are all sacred upon one another it is haram to violate you cannot take people's wealth without their concession and approval regardless who you are you cannot harm them in their bodies or kill them and you cannot slaughter them back bite them or lie about them because this affects their reputation and their honor now we find that people are taking it for granted that yes it's ok for you to take percentage of my wealth whether it's customs or taxes or now some scholars have said that this is permissible when the government is in need but who determines when the government is in need and who determines what the government is going to do with this taxation that it collects from me is it beneficial for me or not so there is no comparison none whatsoever between a pillar of Islam and something that the vast majority of Muslims scholars say that it is Haram taxation is man-made zakat is from Allah Almighty it can be 2.5 percent on certain things it can be 5 percent it can be 10 percent and it can be more than that whether it's taxation or not whether it is a cat or not as in the case of Rica's now all of this is to be paid not to the wealthy it is to be paid for the poor the needy and the rest of the eight categories that Allah has had mentioned in verse 60 chapter 9 of Sirte Toba so this is for the welfare of the whole Ummah if we are able to do this and follow it"
