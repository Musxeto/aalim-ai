  "title": "If my limbs dry up, is my wudu invalid? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "the drying of the limbs or not because this is also an issue of confusion with a lot of the Muslims they think that in order to have immediate progress from one action to the next that you must not have any of your limbs dry so if I want to wash my feet I have to grab my foot to the sink which means that I have to with my hands hold my trousers now my hands are dry so my order is invalid because I did not have this immediate progress no no no this is a different issue altogether there's nothing wrong and drying your limbs by itself or due to the actions of woudl in hot weathers like here in Saudi Arabia and sometimes it reaches forty seven forty eight Celsius centigrade if you performing Woodill by the time you wash your arms your face is already clean dry so what should I do this is a vicious circle should I keep on doing Moodle for the rest of my day there's no what is meant is by moral at is that you do not leave a gap which according to the earth which is one of the sources of legislation we discussed last time according to the earth the gap between washing your face and arms are not long so yes if I am washed my face and someone said something to me and I replied took a couple of seconds then went on with washing my arms there's no problem there was not a long gap unlike if I go and open the door and welcome the guests in and then I go back to the toilet trying to finish what I started"
