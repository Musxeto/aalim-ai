  "transcript": "sh I have a question I enroll in a course of Amazon selling I uh learned from Amazon selling 3 months then I came to know that Amazon sporting is right so I sto working on Amazon then I start finding something else to do such as dig digital marketing so I find that every platform is controlled by JS and they okay so basically speaking we spoke about this so many times what is the ruling on boycotting um such products that are owned or they are known to support or the governments of such companies support generously Israel directly or indirectly and we said that boycotting is something that is beneficial the prophet did itat but at the same time the prophet dealt sallallahu alaihi wasallam with Jews with byzantian with Persians while still having conflict and wars with them which meant that business as usual not only that may Allah be pleased with him when he accepted Islam he boycotted all types of wheat and grain shipped to the idol worshippers in Mecca so they felt the pressure and and they were in deep need of such wheat and grain after few months they the enemies of the Prophet Alam who were still fighting him sent envoys to the prophet begging him to to uh reconsider the ties of kinship between them and to allow the wheat and Grains to come to them so the prophet uplifted the Embargo and allowed it to go in what does this tell you they were Idol worshippers they were enemies they killed the companions but the prophet Salli wasallam uplifted the Embargo so this is a personal preference if you want to boycott because you feel that it would hurt those who support Israel good for you this is your personal uh way of doing it but if you see someone not doing it or consuming their cheeseburgers or fried chicken you cannot blame them say oh shame on you you're drinking their soft drinks no it's not it's Hal so put things in perspective weigh things with fairness and Islamic rulings from the Quran and Sunnah don't just shoot from the hip like so many people do unfortunately now if you want to work for these companies and there are no platforms for you to work and you are the bread winner there's no problem in working with Amazon or with any other company as long as it's Halal and you can can't find the alternative and Allah Knows Best"
