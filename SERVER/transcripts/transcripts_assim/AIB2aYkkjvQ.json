  "title": "Can a girl kill herself to protect her honor (from being raped) | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "a woman is about to be raped by the disbelievers can she save her honor and kill herself no because killing herself is a major sin and being raped is not her own doing and it's a smaller sin than killing so she tries to fight her way out tries to fight if they kill her good for you that's good but you don't kill yourself and this is a calamity from allah azzawajal so these things we have to be very careful when understanding that killing yourself is totally prohibited in islam you"
