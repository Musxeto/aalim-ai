  "transcript": "Abdullah from Japan yeah I wanted to ask about this thing um I live in Japan Muslim country and here most of the products I know have you know emulsifier or shortening or gelatin sometimes so I tried to call call up the manufacturer so when I call them is it sufficient for me to to just ask is that certain product has any animal derivatives or alcohol used or should I be you know ask each item that I'm that I have doubt about usually Aki in Islam When Things become so tight and difficult Islam makes it wider and when it's too loose and easy going Islam makes it tighter if you are in a non-muslim country and you're buying a product this product you have to have the knowledge to be able to analyze so you mentioned alcohol if this product is not intoxicating in nature if you're using ketchup or soy sauce if you are buying biscuits and they say it may have alcohol biscuits don't have alcohol and even if I eat it I won't be intoxicated If the product I'm buying has alcohol and I'm applying it externally such as creams perfumes detergents the presence of alcohol whether in big quantities or small has no impact I can't use that without a problem alhamdulillah so this is out of the question now other products that may contain contain glycillin or gelatin this is an issue of dispute some go into analyzing whether it is from halal meat or not whether the country is a country that we're allowed to consume the meat because they're uh following the Jewish religion or the Christian religion or they're Muslims and others say no this is totally Pro uh permissible to consume simply because in order to produce glycerin or gelatin it undergoes a very vigorous tough process that changes the material characteristic characteristics whether physical or chemical totally so even it was a pork was used or Haram animal meat donkeys dogs whatever bones dead meat they undergo a very vigorous process that changes the material totally into a different material and this is known as istihala like when you put silver water which is nudges to water and irrigate an apple tree it transforms into Halal substances the apple is fine it smells fine it tastes fine we don't say that this is Haram because it was irrigated with impure water this is not the case so there are a group of Scholars that say due to the hardship and due to the nature of transformation of such material from Haram into totally different products that are Halal it becomes Halal and Allah Knows Best"
