  "title": "Ruling on teaching & studying finance in islam - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "what is the ruling on teaching finance knowing it deals with interest is this facilitating in sin the scholars mentioned that studying finance econom economy calculating the rates of interest and reba etc is inevitable because companies commerce tradings require this speciality and this science therefore studying it in order to be qualified is different than implementing it and working with it implementing it and working with it is prohibited because you would be facilitating riba and the prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam cursed the one who consumes the riba and that is the bank and the one that sorry the one who consumes the river and this is the client the one who gives riba and this is the bank itself if the bank is the one who's giving you the interest and the one who witnesses it the two witnesses and the one who registers it and this is the accountant he said all of these are in the same curse of allah azzawajal so to study it or to teach it just for the sake of the whole science as a science which is beneficial and as a package we are required to talk about compound interest about depreciation about this and that this comes within the package there's no problem in that because when i'm learning it i'm learning to benefit and to be capable of avoiding haram and to acknowledge that this is haram and stay away from it but benefit from the rest of the science but if you are teaching it for example to bankers whom you know they are going to implement this this is haram if you're learning it to work in reba-based companies or to facilitate or to work with it this is haram but generally speaking studying such economy studying law for example with the purpose of taking the good and leaving the bad and not practicing what is haram there is no problem in that insha allah"
