  "transcript": "the next question is if I listen to the Quran instead of reading it will I get the same reward and will it count as not abandoning the Quran this is an issue of dispute but with the majority of Scholars say that reading the Quran is more rewarding than listening to it why number one this was what the prophet used to do most of the timeat rarely he used to ask people to recite the Quran to him as per the Hadith of Abdullah may Allah be pleased with him he said the prophet came to me and said read the Quran so I said how can I read the Quran and it to you it was revealed he says I like to listen to it from someone else so he read until chapter 4 until he reached Ayah number 40 and then he said and the prophet was weeping but this is rare the majority of that he was was the one reading the Quran and offering night prayer and and and the likes so listening to the Quran no doubt it's rewarding but is it more attentative to than reading it no when you read you combine all your senses looking and contemplating and watching visually but listening is rewarding and inshallah those who listen to it are rewarded for it but definitely not as much as reading it and Allah Knows Best"
