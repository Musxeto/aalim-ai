  "transcript": "Abdulla says what are the conditions when we can combine prayers while it is raining if it's just dis Ling little can we do this and can women also combine prayers at home while it's raining to answer your second part of the question no women or even men who pray at home cannot combine when it's raining because combining or joining prayers is something that Allah has permitted men to do in order to make life easy for them by not going to the Masjid when it's all raining and muddy a person who's staying home who's not a traveler who's a resident should pray every prayer on time as normal but those who go to the Masjid to pray every fart when it rains heavily so if it's just small showers that do not soak your clothes and there's no mud on the roads there's no hardship then you're not exempted you must pray in the masjid but if it's really raining heavily and the roads are muddy and if you go and come back you'll be totally soaked with mud with water in this case allah gave you the concession you can pray Maghrib for example in the Masjid and after you finish it the the mother then makes a comma and you pray for Raqqa of Asia so that when you leave and go home you have the rest of the night off likewise with voron acid we prayed the at 12:30 after we finished make a comma pray for rock huzzah sir and then you go until it is magic time and this was done at the of the Prophet hiding his salat was Senna and if the rain is really heavy before you leave home you can pray home without any problem the coining is when you've gone to the Masjid and it started to rain heavily but if you are in your home and it rains heavily and in order to reach the message it you'll be soaked because of the rain and you have dirt on you because of the mud on the roads no you have the concession you have the permission to pray home without any problem is Shalom you"
