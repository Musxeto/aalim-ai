  "title": "Making conditional vow (Nadhr) - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Shaima says she has five questions what's the ruling on nether nether in Arabic means to take a vow and vows differ if you make a vow to obey allah azza wajal unconditionally this is not recommended because you are obliging yourself to do something which Allah did not oblige you to do and if you do it as a form of compensation oh Allah if you make me pass my exam I will fast three days and this is highly not recommended because it's like trading with a large double gel in a negative way you would not have given any money for charity you would not have fasted any day for the sake of Allah except that you needed something from Allah but generally speaking if one makes a vow to obey Allah he must fulfill that vow and do it if it's in the obedience of allah azza wajal"
