  "transcript": "uh in trauma this year I'm planning to perform Hajj and I will opt for Hajj Kiran um I am very clear that um I have the option to go directly to mina on seven zul hija and he's actually Sunnah but there is a confusion among my colleague that no you have to go first to uh Haram to performed by Sai umrah and then start going to Mina and do the rituals and then do tawaf ifada and say ifada okay first of all what your friends had said to you is totally not correct a person when doing Hajj has three rituals to perform either ifrah or Tehran or tomato as you're opting for Kiran this means that you have the option of doing one of two either you follow the Sunnah which is to go to Mecca on the seventh and you perform which is a Sunnah what do you mean by Sunnah this is no it's not an what your friends are telling you is totally bogus and wrong this is Sunnah you've offered seven rounds which is followed by seven rounds of Sai which is not part of the omra rather this is called sayul Hajj and then you go to Mina and you do the rituals and everything on the day of Eid you go to Makkah to do which is a pillar but you don't follow that with sari over Hajj because you've already done that on the seventh after tawa for kudum oh so I have the option to earlier than eight the answer is yes this is how the prophet offered this offered it okay then what's the second option the second option is you don't go to Makkah at all on the seventh of the hija or the eighths of that you go straight to me now I don't do it a wife I don't do side no the prophet did that Allah and went to mina he did not clip his hair huh you never clip your hair if you're a mufred or a Karen until after the day of eight so your second option is to go straight to Mina okay then what do all the rituals of going to Arafat and then on the day of radio to mina now you have two pillars left if and by the way a father is a pillar of Hajj without it your Hajj is invalid it has three names so that you don't become confused when you read some of the books available or on the Internet name number one Paula name number two name number three all three are for the same ritual afterwards you offer sayal Hajj because you did not do them on the seventh and after you do the tawafel if normal clothes you don't have to be in the set of and you don't shave or clip your hair afterwards these are pillars of Hajj these are not a umrah so I hope this makes some sense to you as"
