  "transcript": "i' would like to ask a follow-up question to a question asked yesterday with regards to a husband gifting all his possessions to his wife uh and has since passed away and the key evidence of this was the word of the mouth a word of mouth of the wife so my question is uh what constitutes a valid gift in Islam specifically uh does do individuals besides the wife like some friends and family of the husband bearing witness to this gift uh constituted valid even though there's no r or legal evidence like she said the the the deeds and so on were not transferred in her name I answered this question yesterday hammed and I explained it but maybe you need to go back to the recording I said If a person in his lifetime gives his house to his wife and he does not change the deeds and she does not have full possession of it meaning she cannot come tomorrow and says to her husband I'm selling the house she doesn't have access to doing so even if there were 10 male Muslim Witnesses if the man dies this is a void gift if I say to someone I'll give you I give you I give you my car as a gift and there are four of our male friends sitting and they congratulate him and she masallah Mauk and I don't give him the keys and I don't transfer the registration in his name I don't do any of these things at all and I die or even worse there's nothing worse than dying but to him if I go back in my gift said well the following week said I Chang my mind it's my right it's not binding until the recipient has full Authority and possession of it and in this case the wife does not have anything the witnesses would not do her any good because there was no selling and buying this is a gift and the gift is not binding until it is fully possessed by the recipient and Allah Asel Knows Best"
