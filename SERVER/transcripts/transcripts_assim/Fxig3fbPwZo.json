  "transcript": "Misbah from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah Sheikh someone told me that the mobile Umul Qura time does not apply in Islamabad here where I live and I calculated it that the shadow equal to my height is around 1 30 pm whereas Umul Qura says it's 3 pm and the Zuhr congregation is at 1 30 pm sometimes Jummah starts at 1 30 pm what should I do? As far as the Jummah is concerned Alhamdulillah we've mentioned many times that even if the Jummah starts half an hour to an hour before the actual time of Zawal, the actual time of Zuhr, this is valid and this is a fatwa of Ibn Baz and Ibn Uthaymeen and a great number of scholars in accordance to the hadith of Jabir Ibn Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with the man with his father. As for the timing of Zuhr you have what you can see with your own eyes and if you see with your own eyes that the Zawal starts at a particular time when the shade of an erected object starts to begin towards the east this is the time of Zuhr regardless of the app this is the time where Zuhr actually starts so you can apply this and pray if they pray before that you must not join them because their prayer is invalid regardless of what app they're following and if they pray after that maybe 15 minutes 20 minutes the prayer is valid with the grace of Allah.
