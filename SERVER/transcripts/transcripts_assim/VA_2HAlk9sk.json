  "transcript": "[Music] assalamu alaikum and welcome to another hut a TV show I'm Ali Coleman I'll be your host for with the Prophet our guest is Sheikh awesome al Hakim from Saudi Arabia and our subject is about applying the teachings of Islam to our lives looking through the lens of the Prophet of Islam Prophet Muhammad sallallahu aleyhi will sell up let's go ahead and introduce our guests and continue with this a very important topic shake awesome thank you for being with us and welcome to the show barakallahu Akuma's ecumene la flair for having me and it's a privilege and pleasure as usual to be with you on this show likewise likewise it's been quite some time since we've sat together in the studio so as we said our focus is about the general topic and you can elaborate on this is about a very practical subject how to apply the teachings of Islam in our lives and in particular looking at prophet muhammad salallahu alaihe salam as an example of how to do that and so this show is focused on looking at his relationships with the people around him both inside of his home and outside of his home those that he gave birth to that he married that he had relations with his enemies the downtrodden in Arab society of his times all members of society what were his relations with these people and how did Islam how how do we see the beauty of Islam in these relationships it's important I guess to start out asking the question why we need to talk about the Prophet in this way can you can you start on that point Samana Rahim hamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik ala muhammad Andalite I mean nabina muhammad in water at your sake has made am i bad allah azza wa jal had sent to us to the humanity to the jinn and to the humans the best of his creation and that is the prophet muhammad sallallahoalyhiwasallam and he revealed to him his final testament his final revelation the quran so we have the perfect book the perfect messenger and the perfect message that is everlasting to the day of judgment the importance of this subject lies in the fact that we have a problem in the way that people practice Islam mm-hmm and also we have a problem in the way that people Muslims and non-muslims perceive Islam so in order to correct the misconceptions we need to go back to the fundamentals we need to go back to the basics to square one which is the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam if it were sufficient Allah would have revealed the book the Quran and told us to follow it there was no need for him to send a messenger and for us to study his cedar and biography over the period of 23 years but it was it isn't sufficient there has to be a manifestation to the teachings of Islam we have to have a role model and we have to have someone to guide us and for us to follow now having said that before you continue I want to acknowledge a very important point here okay we as Muslims of course have great respect reverence for the Prophet peace be upon us but even for non-muslims when they catalogue those human beings who have distinguished themselves throughout history recognize the Prophet as one of these persons very important a very influential a person who effected not only the history of Arabs and Muslims but all of human history so there's a great interest to study who this person was whether from a perspective of faith or even for non-believers he is a the Prophet is peace be upon him a point of great interest indeed indeed he is however my main focus is usually to correct the the ideologies to correct the behaviors of Muslims the non-muslims they have certain preachers scholars students of knowledge who know how to address them this is not my speciality my speciality is to address the Muslims and to fix what needs to be fixed why do we need to fix things because if you look at some segments of the Muslims you'll find that they have like split personalities they have the concept of I think they call it dr. Jekyll mr. Hyde or the other way around I'm not sure in the sense that when they pray and fast masha'Allah they're good Muslims you find them in the first rows of the Masjid they are good in the way they look as practicing Muslims but when you come to the way they treat others you find a big gap which shows that they're not walking the talk as it is supposed to be in the sense I'm a good practicing Muslim I have a long beard I have short sobs I pray in the masjid i preaches them but how do i deal with my wife with my children okay I'm a family man I deal with them well how do I deal with my neighbors and my co-workers mmm not that good but it's not bad how do I deal with sinners and non-muslims oh I have a problem did the Prophet have this problem eraser stamp definitely not and none to my knowledge across the past history had ever been scrutinized throughout his life like the Prophet Arizona in the sense that he's under the radar everything he did is documented so you cannot come and find something that you may hold against him and say ah he did this he did that and over the period of 23 years when you have this perfect record this by itself this alone is sufficient for you to know that he is the greatest creation of allah azza wajal and he's the indeed the best human ever talked to me and so as you said our focus is how he interacted with the people around him and we have agreed to start with his wives he we know that the Prophet peace be upon him was married for the first time at the age of 25 he married Khadija or Khadijah is some pronounce it she was a 40 year old merchant very successful wealthy merchant he married her and had a monogamous relationship with her for 25 years or nearly 25 years and it wasn't until after to get Khadija Tunisia passed away that he took other wives can you talk about how the Prophet peace be upon him acted towards women generally and then lead us into his choice of his first wife well the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam like any perfect human being had the perfect relationship with all segments of the society and specifically and especially with women those related to him the Prophet said Allah salat wa sallam told us that the closest to me among you on the day of judgment are those with excellent character and perfect moral conduct and the best of you are those who our best to their wives so this isn't just theoretical the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam was the best husband to his wives now when it comes to Hadiya may allah be pleased with her she is one of the perfect women in humanity and why do we say this because the Prophet said are in salat wa sallam told us that among the men there were many who were perfect all in all however among the women there were only four perfect women and he named them at is awesome Khadija fatima hacia the wife of pharaoh and maryam the mother of jesus christ these are the four perfect women so hadiza indeed was one of them and this is why sallallahu alayhi wasallam loved her the love that he did not love any of his other wives though she was like you have mentioned 15 years older than him though she was not a virgin at the time she was previously married and had offered offspring and children from her previous marriages and we do not know anything except that he loved her in a way that is unimaginable to us which shows you the caliber of Khadija may Allah be pleased with her hmm we were about ready for our first break Sheikh but before we do I'd like to just hint it what we want to touch on when we come back we're going to continue with the wives and ask the question about what happened we could look at the Prophet traditionally we look at the prophet's life in to fears that is before and after the migration or the hid jury to medina we can also make sense of his marriage life in that way has one wife khadija before the migration and the others it after when we come back we'd like to look at the life of the Prophet and his wives after the migration Salam alaikum and welcome back to with the Prophet our guest is sheikh osman al Hakim I'm Ali Coleman we're going to continue our conversation about the life of the Prophet looking at his life example as a way of applying the teachings of Islam in our lives Sheikh let's please continue we had talked about the wives of the Prophet as the first chosen relationship in his life we're going to look at other persons and members of society we're going to continue with the wives and ask about the number you know depending on the sources that you you look at if you type in a search on the internet how many wives did the Prophet have it will range between nine and 13 mm hm how many did the Prophet have what was the rationale the reason any wisdom behind the numbers of lives okay the prophet alayhi salatu salam when he died he had nine wives and all in all the most authentic opinion is that he had married to eleven okay so the first one being khadija bint khuwaylid may Allah be pleased with her and she is as mentioned earlier one of the perfect for women of paradise the second and third one the Prophet RA salatu salam married them in mecca because we know Khadijah died may Allah be pleased with her when the Prophet was in Mecca and there was this morning and how will I been Hakeem came to the prophet alayhi salaatu sent and suggested to him that he gets married and he married to women okay an elder woman who whose name was Sol de Benzema who was five years older than him now you have to look at this issue and highlight it because sometimes the disbelievers and the haters of Islam would highlight him marrying Aisha right at a very young age so he married soda who was 5 years older than him the first two eyes were older 15 years in the character diga and so he was 50 she was 55 approximately and he married to Aisha who was so young that this marriage was postponed and delayed for three years so he married her when she was six years of age not consummated the marriage until she was nine years of age and this was in Mecca now afterwards he married Alice or some to a number of women for example hafsa bent Omar who was the daughter of his beloved companion hapa we know how Isha was the daughter is beloved best companion Abu Bakr so now you look at the selection right y Hafsa was also previously married and now she had no husband to take care of her and Omar her father came to Abu Bakr came to earth man proposing to them to marry her and they rejected that and then the Prophet Adam accepted to marry her then you go on to Zeinab Ben Josh who was his cousin salallahu alaihe salam okay and she was married to a freed slave they eat in Haditha mhm and then their story partially is mentioned in chapter 33 sorted as AB where Zaid was his so-called adopted son before islam banned adoption and then he married him to his cousin Zeynep who did not enjoy or like being married to this freed slave and then he was forced to divorce her because life could not go on in such a relationship after that allah azza wajal made him marry zina been josh for purposes that this is not the right time to discuss in fact it's hmm then the Prophet Isis I'm also married zeyneb bent Hosea al Hill area who died in his lifetime who was a righteous woman and loved to give in charity then the Prophet that is awesome also married umm Salama whose name is hint bint ABI Omega NK so umm Salama was the wife of abu Salama among the first to migrated to Medina and her husband died like in the second year of hijra okay so now she was stranded she had children and no one to look after them the Prophet proposed to her had a sort of sinner and she didn't accept in the beginning mm-hmm she said I'm an old woman mmm I have children and I'm extremely jealous the Prophet sent to her Alice I'm telling her you're not older than me your children are under my custody and your jealousy I'll pray to Allah to take it away from him he was he was insisting yes and again she is not a young woman a beautiful woman someone that worldly standards would apply upon her we have a problem with that now indeed did we have big issues with that but what I'm trying to highlight is that the prophet's marriages Solari salem will not desire oriented mm yeah the selection of these women if you were a man of power and you had everything at the fingertips of your hands you could have chosen young women beautiful miss Arabia whatever right but the Prophet didn't do that I didn't do that salah salem he married as well on Habiba and on habiba her name is Rami lament a visa fee and her father is abusive beyond the head of the maca idol worshipers so when her husband died in Abyssinia and she was stranded she could not go back to Mecca another widow another widow she will be prosecuted the Prophet hasn't sent to Abyssinian ruler than a Joshi mm-hm and he gave him the the request to send her to Medina where he can marry her and then a Joshi himself paid her dowry and she came respected to Medina as the wife of the Prophet he sought asylum also my Munna Bentall hadith she is the aunt the maternal aunt of Abu Lahab us so her sister was married to his uncle al abbas and this bonded the families more and more and he married also Jew area Bentall had if Alma Slovakia she was the daughter of a tribe that the Prophet as Salam and his companions invaded because of their attacks against Islam and enmity against Islam all the men fled and ran away so she was a captive of war I see okay so that she came to the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam requesting that she buys herself out of slavery and the prophetess could have accepted that there's a pattern here she yes he could have freed her but then he told her listen I'll do something better for you what if I set you free and I marry you an immediately on the spot she said of course who refuses to marry someone of your high status as a prophet and a messenger so he married her and look what happened all the captive of war from her tribe was set free the people said how can the Prophet marry erase awesome a woman from this tribe and we have her siblings and and and tribes women and men under our captivity they are free for the sake of Allah look at the benefit right such as a marriage and finally the Prophet also married al-assad sir am Sofia bent her a didn't up who was a Jew and her father her husband her brother and her tribe plotted to kill the Prophet IRA so Sarah and to do heinous things against Islam the Prophet SAW said I'm freed her and married her and showed us that this is possible for a revert to become the mother of the believers and the benefits that came after that are so enormous in each instance we see the decision of a wife the Prophet peace be upon him cheering a wife for strategic purposes that had social implications not only for individual families but across the society so this is anything but I mean it is a very noble to say the least yes but if I may also commend that this is not the only reason for getting married all right so if someone says okay beautiful and noble causes however if I want to marry a second a third or a fourth wife simply because I am capable financially and physically and I want to get married I like to have children I like to have a beautiful wife is this something bad no as long as you are financially capable physically capable and you're fair and just and these are extremely important because they're mentioned in the Quran so in rhythm a lot idilu' fajita if you fear that you will not be fair with your wives marry only one so this is not the only reason for you and I I hope our wives are not watching to get married to a second wife but if a person marries a second wife for legitimate reasons that is permissible and if these reasons are dower oriented or Islamically oriented for the benefit of the society and Islam and the Muslims then definitely these are noble goals there's a lot there's much more obviously to cover and fortunately we we do have time and plan to be together to continue this conversation and to expand it to other aspects but we are out of time for this episode and thank you so much we look forward to continuing Balaklava come hmm so this will conclude our first episode of our discussion of the life of the Prophet how he implemented Islam in his life and we can look and learn lessons from the relationships that he had and established with people around him when we come back next time Shaikh I'd like to go into the home of the Prophet look at how he can't conducted himself more in detail as we continue our subjects thank you so much we hope it was beneficial last part I'll accept our time together Salaam alaikum"
