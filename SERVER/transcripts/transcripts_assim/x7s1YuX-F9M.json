  "title": "Are we still protected if our mind wonders off while reciting the Morning & Evening athkaar?",
  "transcript": "ayesha says when we make our morning and evening ask our our mind wanders off and start thinking about other things since we are not Arabs and we do not understand Arabic does this not give us the protection against which we are reciting those doers so basically speaking Aisha's question is about protection awarded from supplications and vacations enough car said but without concentration and secondly the issue of wandering while repeating or saying these of car how to fight this how to stop this so firstly the f car that we say the protection is full and 100% whenever we have 100 concentration the less the concentration is the less the protection is the evidence the Prophet said that is salat WA Salam invoke Allah supplicate to Allah when you are most certain of him answering you for Allah does not respond to a heart that is wandering and not concentration not concentrating so if a person is heedless and not paying attention like the so many Muslims we see every single day after the prayer is over we see a lot of brothers raising their hands making dua looking around saying things that they've learned since childhood not necessarily thinking of what they saying they're looking here and they're looking at the watches looking around in like 60 seconds or 90 seconds and it's over and then they go have they been concentrating no so will they get the protection sought after no because their hearts were not present likewise when you say the morning and evening of car if you just say it without concentrating in it it doesn't have the right effect an impact and this is the main reason why so many people say sure I've always said my life car I've always recited my three pull the last three chapters of the Quran three times and in the morning and in the evening and once after every prayer ayatul kursi but I still got black magic I've still got Ghent possession someone was envious someone gave me the evil eye how is that possible well it's possible because simply you did not do the right thing when you recited it because you did not concentrate in it you simply said it read it and did not give it much thought this is problematic in order for you to have the best and perfect result you have to say it with concentration sheikh al albani always criticized those muslims who offered that car after salat he said how is it possible that people just say subhanAllah subhanAllah subhanAllah subhanAllah in like from 0 to 100 in less than 3 seconds this is too quick too fast and one is not contemplating while compare this to someone who says Japan allah subhanallah subhanallah [Music] share this would take like 5 minutes so what what's the rush when you say it with concentration with contemplation with tasting it and finding the benefits out of it you definitely will have a greater impact than rather saying it from zero to 60 in less than 3 seconds now what to do if we are non Arabs so if we don't speak Arabic we will not be able to concentrate well actually I beg to differ if you spent some time and little effort to know what these words you are saying and repeating from the F car what they mean in your own language and you understand that once you say it in Arabic after a couple of weeks you will find that there is a whole lot of difference a world of difference between what you used to do and what you're doing it at the moment so take some time memorize it in Arabic memorize what it means in your own native language whether English or other than that and then you will find out that insha'Allah you will have a different feeling altogether for it"
