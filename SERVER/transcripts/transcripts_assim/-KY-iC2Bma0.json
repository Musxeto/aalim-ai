  "title": "Hijab Ban in India & Protest for our rights? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "a sister says protesting with slogans and banners is not part of islam as we see today's situation of the hijab ban in schools and colleges in south india what can be done islamically to get out our rights because if we if if everyone goes home and not protest it will not put pressure on authorities first of all the issue of protesting and demonstration how has been cleared out by the scholars of islam such as mercy on their souls and it is not part of the way of the self i know that i could be really famous if i just ride the wave and say that we have to fight we have to do this we have to do that till when are we going to be oppressed and not uh uh talk and and voice our opposition to what's happening we have to do this that would make me really famous and i would have lots of viewers the biggest problem is that we have to ask ourselves this question do we want to follow sharia or do we want to follow our whims and desires yes there will be people criticizing and saying this is all what you shares good at talk you don't do anything you don't react you're sitting in the comfort of your home while we are suffering and this and that blah blah blah this is a price we have to pay unfortunately again you did not answer my question do you want to follow sharia or do you want to follow your whims and desires for me in the midst of the comfort of my home i could say pick up arms demonstrate loot burn shops do this do that but this is not the role of scholars of islam as al-hasan al-basri said may allah have mercy on his soul when fitna comes only the scholars see it when it's over and done everybody sees it so in the beginning you hear voices calling for jihad for violence for fighting but when the dust falls down and it's all over and you start to count about body count and you start to evaluate your losses here is when laymen and normal people relate and say subhan allah the sheikh said so and so i wish we had listened why do we say this in islam we don't act upon our emotions rather we have to calculate the pros and the cons allah azzawajal tells us in the quran do not insult do not curse the idols which they worship so that the idol worshipers would not retaliate by cursing allah so cursing and abusing and exposing the idols that they worship is a good thing because it's being worshipped beside allah and it has no value it has nothing to offer it doesn't protect from harm and it doesn't provide you any good but because insulting it and cursing it would lead the idol worshippers to retaliate by insulting allah azzawajal allah tells us don't do that so coming back to the issue of hijab ban in southern india is it the first no it's been practiced in france in belgium in many in europe and it's becoming a trend objective to fight islam you don't have to beat around the bush they want to eliminate islam from their lives they want to force the muslims to blend in which means to lose their identity and to be like the disbelievers now in southern india is a different issue so it's like a tug of war you pull and i pull and let's see what happens when you say that we have to stand up for our rights and the only way to do so is by demonstrating and raising the flags and banners etc and marching in the streets is this the right approach you've confirmed that this is not according to the quran so is it the right approach well if we look in the seerah we will find that the prophet alaihis salat was salaam remained in mecca for 13 years he was ordered not to fight they used to abuse him and his companions they used to torture them in some incidents they killed some of them yet allah azzawajal did not allow them to fight back thinking of it if allah were to allow them to fight back as a minority the idol worshipers would have annihilated them and islam would have been eradicated and finished so for 13 years the prophet haslam was ordered to refrain to pull back not to fight back not to defend themselves to the extent that they were allowed to do two hijras and to migrate to abyssinia to look for a safe haven for them to worship allah azza and finally they were allowed to migrate to medina now the muslims in india are they a minority or a majority they're a minority even this minority do they fit in the category which was mentioned in chapter eight suratul and fell at the very end when allah azzawajal had set the minimum requirements to fight an enemy that is more than our number in the beginning we were ordered to stand firm when the enemy is 10 times more than our number 10 times we were not allowed to flee or to run for our lives we have to stand firm till we are victorious or we are martyred fighting and then allah reduced this and made it one to two so if they are double our number we have to stand firm in the battlefield if they're more than that then we have the concession and the permission to re-strategize or to catch up with other muslim forces to re gain power and relaunch an offensive later on what's the ratio of muslims to the non-muslims allah says prepare for the enemies whatever you can of force which is archery at the time now weaponries military equipment etc is required are the muslims prepared are the muslims as a minority all on the same page with one another or we have different sects and cults and leaders so the entire umma is divided into many many sects and they cannot find common ground to come into terms and unite am i saying all of this because throughout history and i'm apologize this is not becoming a q a but this is an important question and this is not live tv so this is uh um a youtube channel so i think i have the liberty to take my time why am i addressing this because the consequences that we see is not what others see and you can imagine you do the math think with your logic not with your heart and emotions what is the result of standing in front the majority who are backed by the authorities who are kafir disbelievers who carry great enmity and hatred to the muslims and they have the police force they have the army they have the guns what are the consequences people would say yes yes there will be casualties but we have to sacrifice the casualties that will take place what is the impact on their families do you think that the mother of a 17 year old boy who was killed and lynched she would say alhamdulillah my son was martyred and i have 10 more to give for the sake of allah we've seen the reactions of some families we've seen the reactions of some non-practicing muslims who started cursing islam cursing the hijab all what they care about is to eat and drink that's it so they don't share with you your concerns they are not with you on the same page and this is why instead of being reactive to such incidents we have to prepare ourselves we have to start establishing apida so that when push comes to shove we have firm muslims standing and not budging being steadfast and with firms feet on the ground unshaken without hakida you can't do this without unity of the muslims you can't do this without prior preparation you can't do this so this is what we are afraid of happening if we were to go down the line say yeah go do it prosper do protests and demonstration and do this and do that we've seen what they can do with their hatred against islam so the livelihood of muslims their safety is a priority and this is our main concern how can we react to such in just ban of the hijab there are many peaceful ways expose them on the internet on social media let the whole world share with you their atrocities their lack of democracy because they claim and brag that they're democratic and they are the worst of totalitarian regimes like china so expose them big time you have the internet you have social media you have western media that is thirsty and hungry for such news though they shared the same disbelief and kufur but they have the hidden agenda agendas so they would also expose their totalitarian government and authority the pgp pgb or whatever they call it and their their kafir regime and they would show the plight of the muslims but we cannot justify something that is against the way of the self something that is wrong by their wrong actions because two wrongs do not make a right and allah azzawajal knows best you"
