  "transcript": "sammy says selling what you don't possess this is the prophet's words al-islam do not sell what you do not possess so the scholars looked into it and said anything that you sell which you do not have access to or you do not guarantee so if i sell you this cup and you buy it by the time i take it to you if it breaks i am in charge i'm liable to pay for it i don't have the right to say you bought it no but i didn't deliver it if it's in my stores and i sold it to you or before selling it to you the stores were burnt to the ground i'm liable to pay for it so there is the uh the issue of risk of losing and gaining when i sell with a profit but if i don't have such a risk and i guarantee the profit this is what is prohibited to sell something that you don't have like selling you a fish in a pond go ahead and fish it maybe you'll catch it maybe you won't maybe it dies maybe it does this i don't know i just sold it to you this bird in the sky you shoot it down if you can maybe you miss not my problem no i cannot tell you what i do not possess so the only way out is to use bayer and this is one to know a particular item that is fully described without any ambiguity two to collect the full amount of the price up front before i deliver to them three i give a specific date of delivery not um 2022 inshallah no i have to give a month and a week preferably a date if this is done then yes i can if i take partial payment this is haram i have to take the full payment in advance and the description has to be totally clear"
