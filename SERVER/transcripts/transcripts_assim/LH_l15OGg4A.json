with nila today we will speak about something again all our topics are very important and they're all bring different you know they have different flavours mashallah but the topic of Telugu you know which is you know putting your trust in Allah or relying upon Allah soap an italic in a world where people today rely upon so many other things we rely upon our cars or phones our technology upon other people upon you know many many things and a lot of times we fail to rely upon the one who created us right the one who knows is better the one in whose hands our souls are our destinies are you know or everything is with allah subhanaw taala again joining me today in the studio to discuss this very important topic Shiraz Hakim only and share doctor I'm Adam sayfudine Salam alayka rehearsal I bought a car dear brothers here teachers the importance of the subject is just any huge because when someone has talked I lost my Italian it changes their life and the way they look at life right there just life becomes different and people who come from darkness into the light and Allah guides into Islam they can really any feel the difference you know because I speak myself you know before you like you try to do things in your life to always it's like a protection for you you know you need to go to the gym to be stronger so you rely upon yourself to defend yourself or to protect her you know cousin any day something will happen or you need to you know do this and this and this because everything goes back to you in the end of the day and you need to make sure that everything is in order in your life because if not if anything wrong happens oh my god you know something or wrong but then when you enter Islam and Allah blesses you with guidance I'm not saying that you're not gonna go to gym you're not gonna take care of life and all these things but the angle of view changes you know you're not so yeah you're not so skeptical anymore you relax really and you it's like your life just expands yeah Nia I don't know if I'm making any sense of Shola so let us first define that I talk good on you again as always for our viewers what does that talk--i means you have made that start with your Heyman hamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu la he was salam ala nabi'ina muhammad in sayyidil awwalin wal akhirin allah early he was happy he whatever you know be certain you know me Dean and my dad they were cool or having full dependence upon Allah subhana WA Ta'ala in all matters whether this is in this life or in the hereafter is a basis of Eman is part of a man in fact if it's not there that Eman is not there in seven hours in the glorious quran allah so allah says were at a life at our kallu include I mean it's a part of an area where normally there is something that would require a person to have full dependence and reliance upon allah subhana wa ta'ala if they are believers so if we are to be believers fully putting that trust in allah then we need to depend on him because we need to believe that allah is the source of all good allah is the one who's able to either give us what we want or not allah has control over everything in his hands may glory be to him are all things he has power over everything he can give us he can deprive us that's why if you put your trust in allah after you take all the necessary steps to pursue your need or to have something done you need to put the trust in our loss of haneda that will help you it will maximize the benefit it will make you feel comfortable that you depend on someone who's really trustworthy he is the one to depend on I mean what is our power besides the power of allah subhanho wa taala it's uncompelled that's why we need to have this full dependence of the heart because telecoil is the act of the heart basically I do what everyone can do I'm intending to pursue my education and I need to spend at least three or four years in college do I need to make tower cool upon Allah or I can see that everything is in my hands I have the budget for it I have the school of my choice I do know what exactly am I going to do in the next three or four years why do I need to work on subhanAllah well first Anita walk on in order to get things facilitated for you you need to walk in order to have the guidance in support of our loss of Hinata you will never know what will happen in the future you may not even reach that goal to begin with you may not even start that particular endeavor in your life without having the tawakkal so atewa cool is after you do whatever is needed to do but then having that Eman in the heart that none will be achieved without allah support none will be possible without allah support because then you get exactly what you need and then you put your Eman in execution you really exercise that Eman inside your heart and moving on with Allah's blessings and guidance mashaallah so TOEIC Kalyani is a reflection of fate of Eman Indiana dates it's something that extends from your faith in Allah Savannah Todd you are mentioning something about the that you should do what we call the s Bab or take the means right before we how do we balance you know because in the end of the day you know people say okay if everything is in the hands of Allah I don't have to do anything I don't have to think about anything I just you know it will happen anyway and which is just something that some groups and it deviated in in this Janna you thinking at all you know I'm a sinner okay this allows will you know in the end then how do we actually if you want to comment on the elder it's not gonna be a little bit but let's look at it from a number of angles sermons Allah he said that what cool is a form of worship of the heart because we know that the heart has a number of forms of worship that fills it up such as fear love ho ho echo and the body itself has a number of other forms of worship your tongue has a number of other forms of worship when you come to what cool there are two types of dependence there is the general type which people need one another in so this is not talam this is I need to trust you I'm relying on you to take me home because my car broke down so this is not a form of worship because Alonzo jail had made humans to aid and to help one another what we're talking about is the full dedication and devotion the full trust and reliance the full acknowledgement that no one can do anything except Alonso just so even if I ask you to drive me home and I'm totally dependent on you not even thinking of a large that were gel being the source of all goodness then there is a big problem now the scholars say that in order for your tawakkal to be valid you have to have two things you have to have your cordial dependence and reliance and trust in Allah plus taking the necessary means that Allah ordered us to fulfill and do so you have two extremes and a middle path one extreme would say and claims I trust allah azza wajal and i don't believe in anything of this world that can help me except allah subhanaw taala and therefore i'm not going to do anything and this is nonsense because it's like someone sitting home and saying i'll pray to allah georgian and i believe from the depth of my heart that only a large that you can provide for me and I will pray to Allah as usual from here till the day of judgement that Allah grants me righteous child okay are you married no okay go ahead and get married no I have full trust in Allah Jojo this is ridiculous and on the far extreme you get people like you've mentioned in the beginning devoted entirely and totally to the means so they trust no one but themselves they always want to be in control so I am sure that my bag is ready my clothes are in it my flight is booked my job is this I'm going at this time and I don't have anything to do with relying on allah azza wajal and this is totally unacceptable and it can nullify a person's islam so the scholars say that those who only depend on allah azza wajal and not taking the necessary means they are rejecting the sharia that Asheer but if they depend entirely on the means neglecting allah azzawajal in this case they are rejecting the essence of the dean on end of the Arpita okay we're gonna take a short break [Laughter] [Applause] [Music] [Music] it's time is very precious in the light of the Quran and hadith enjoy Islam with us Zayn and enjoying Islam with Sun and out tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. and repeat telecast at 10:30 a.m. in there on peace TV these TV presents about 100 million here at one of the

elaborate with the people spreading the truth of Islam do what you can to spread the word of Islam whatever we are live like Muslims use your power Allah is saying why do you need anything else this Quran is self-sufficient how a human being should lead his life is given in this instruction manual the glorious prophet for peace to prevail on earth in peacemakers next on peace TV sorry cristela welcome back we are talking about torque which is relying upon Allah putting your trust in Allah so finally I wanted this one clarification here if possible immune asylum Marcia but can do there's a hadith I believe about the 7000 people who will enter gender without herself and one of the characteristics is a lot of being yet alone right that upon their Lord they have talked granny can you comment about a little bit on all these 70,000 people why is it any such a big thing any and why these 70,000 people who will be selected and he just relate story I'm do love salatu salam others who know Holly just like a human oiler how mister Bava daily human team the topic of the work on is vast yes I have to admit beforehand there what cool is the crux of the email the core of the Eman called a man is dead - oh cool yeah awesome said those people are saying always in sha Allah and they are confused and even sometimes between inshallah and Masha Allah Masha Allah after if you did something and Allah Masha Allah so something inshallah God willing in the future because you don't know why you fall sick etc etc but the telecoil is very very essential in the life of the Muslim because you put your trust in your Creator and you are now supported you know that you are supported by the almighty see if you are supported by someone who's very strong powerful a king or a president you feel that you are about Allah the creator of the heavens and the earth this was in in the heart of the messengers of Allah in the hearts of the believers the prophets they were instilling and in calculating the seed of this cocoon in the heart of their followers the disciples their students moosa aleihsalaam LM matter our alchemy irony Allah saw moosa' in a mood raccoon when the Pharaohs the two truths now the truth of the Pharaoh and the penniless right there's real lights the day is breaking so now they are seeing each other and there's realized they saw they see in front of them truths behind what's the result inevitably happiness in la Moodle ah kun logical but did moosari serifs a color they they were not conscious why don't you see the water don't you see them behind you in Namur IRB cid i have my lord with me he's going to guide me strike the sea with the staff the sea split see that worker when all the surroundings everything all the signs are chained you are going to be captured the prophets of Lhasa Apso says he entered the Masjid and Fatima came to him crying because she heard the mushriks agreed that the moment he enters all of us will get up and beat him said give me my Udo took the wudu and he went to that circle and he stood on the circle and one of them could stand and say anything that is the bravery because the debacle liberates your heart when he was in the cave I will saying of the Allahu I know if some of them looks down he will see us at the Apollo's arrival at us he was telling his companion don't great okay in Allah Eliza with us when he was chased by surat Abdul Malik okay and Soraka is almost there I will walk a new practice it there is a night behind us that Korean Korean because as a father of the lejano said the heart is the king and the limbs and rest are soldiers but if the king is firm everyone will remain firm carry on carry on and he turned to surah qasas raga go back go back he cannot catch us I know you are after the hundred camels right go back because what happened to Soraka horse the horse three times fell off I said go back and see the token and see the trust see the European he is wanted the Prophet Elias Elam wanted yet he is promising Soraka the bracelets of Kozma the emperor of persia so that they were cool is very very important careful Islam even Tamiya when the Sufis challenged him in the debate and said we entered the fire can you enter the fire we entered the fire into the fire you said yes I will enter the fire and it will not burn me boy I must prevail as permission but he said what I'm illiterate aleca I was praying and crying and but I was confident that it will not burn me and in the debate started they said are you ready he said yes I'm ready but in one condition all of us should bathe with vinegar with our bodies with vinegar because he realized that they bought certain chemicals so that's why the fire doesn't burn them so he disclosed a secret so head wanted to run away said okay get the wood get the wood no no no that would take time there is this Lantern in front of us bismillah this is my finger put your finger put your finger I refrained so that our cool is that when you lift the matter totally to the creator and that is what we need to walk in it because we are lacking that unfortunately may Allah increase over what : for this going along the same line tell what cool was the practice of all the prophets and messengers of Allah we find in the glorious quran new holly he sallam said in neat our culture allah here what bwara be cool ma'am endure but in fill out the who don't be not yet here in never be a lot in most of him so i have full trust in allah who's my lord and your lord and the same thing with yaqoob hawaii thought was said I'm the father of Yusuf Ali him of salatu was-salam ala jamia NBA in la jolla solely he said when they had this conversation Yahoo Valley in salat WA Salam had this conversation with his children because as usual misil who was in fact yusuf at that time he was a king and he asked for his son his brother and he said leno silla hamako had to Nemo he'll come min allahi letter to Nana be healed I you have amiko Parramatta who Moshe call allahu la manna pool work he allah is going to be our trustworthy he's the one to depend on he's the witness and that's why one of the names of allah is a looook eel subhanahu wa'ta'ala because it's related to toe echo again now I will continue well a matter how mean hi to Amara home abou whom before that when Yahoo Bodhisattva sallam said well kana have any alloted human baby were hidden what human a boy be beautiful Rika when my Union come inna llaha me che he'll hook more inland ela ilayhi teller Cal - where are they - Lea tower : whatever keywords now he was putting his trust in Allah subhana WA Ta'ala I said I'm not going to do anything for you it's a large decision but I have full trust in Allah and every one who put his trust in Allah he's the one who's trustworthy and that's why he finally was joined with his son Yusuf Ali his thought was after crying and crying and weeping until he was able to have this union with his son Yusuf and the other younger son of Yahoo and the whole family got together and enjoyed this reunion together with a family because they had that trust in Allah so if you have this full trust but it needs a strong heart and belief without it yes someone might change someone yes I want to go ahead and do it put myself in fire but you're not like Ibrahim alayhi salaatu wa salaam if you like Ibrahim Ali I saw - a son he was in the fire but Allah made it cool and there was nothing to harm him because Allah was with him and he put that trust in Allah so Allah has a Cola here again very beneficial this is such an important topic for us to apply in our lives to put our trust in los 20 and everything that we do of course by taking the means first as you know we have this thing in English do your best then let you know that for the worst you know that God did the rest en la shala always take care of the people who put their trust in allah so allah exactly for watching this beautiful episode PCV salam alikum - like a briquette [Music]"
