  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu May Allah reward you enormously And you as well, Barakallah Feek Sheikh, my relatives are going to marry their daughter to my college mate while I was in college. They are inquiring about him. He was alcoholic during his college days, but now I don't know about him. Am I obliged to tell about him that he was alcoholic during college days or leave it? Am I obliged to tell that? Basically speaking, if a person used to commit sins, and these sins were between him and Allah, he did not commit them in public, and he was most likely remorseful, scared of them, but he's a human being, he was weak, and he fell into these sins while trying to conceal them. It is not permissible for you to disclose them at all. So, if you know till date that he still drinks, you're obliged to tell your relatives that this person is not good for your daughter. They said, why? He said, you say to them because he does a number of sins that I'm not at liberty to disclose to you, and if he were to propose to my sister, I would not accept her. If they insist, tell them this is what I have. You like it? Alhamdulillah, you don't like it? Go and ask someone else. I warned you. But if you don't know whether he had stopped or not, and it's been like 10 years since college days. People change in 10 years. So, the least you could do is say, I don't know anything of him. He was a good person. He was like any other chap of us in the uni. We used to do a lot of sins. Nowadays, I cannot tell. So, you have to ask someone who has fresh information about him, and Allah knows best."
