  "transcript": "what is Islamic ruling on women vlogging their Lifestyle on YouTube is it permissible or not now when women involve themselves and vlogging on YouTube the least they would have their voices showing and hurt and this is not permissible if not it's not recommended because there are those with weakness and illness in their hearts and we don't want to tempt them by any means however the vast majority of such vlogs would continue the woman in her house or on her vacation or on her shopping spree and she would show her children her lifestyle her cars her house and be present and this is not permissible women must not be filmed because this defies the purpose of hijab why did Allah azzawajal force them to wear hijab if they can come on TV and show in their Vlogs and speak about their lifestyle despite the fact that many so-called influencers among the women and I'm talking about Muslim women I'm not talking about Yani disbelievers I'm talking about Muslim women Unfortunately they appear in Vlogs that are so indecent and inappropriate for a Muslim woman to appear in they expose their bodies they talk about their lavish lifestyle breaking those who can't afford this breaking their hearts attaining evil eye how many people have damaged themselves and their families by portraying how they live and how their children are without knowing that people are inflicted inflicting them with evil eye whoa look at her son look at her daughter how beautiful how handsome how attractive how smart and boom it's done and the child is suffering from illnesses doctors don't know what the treatment for uh for it is so why put yourself in such positions why boast and show off things that would cause you more harm than good the answer is easy so that we become famous we become influencers we can gain money from the ads and I've talked about this before about that is about students of knowledge who are following this line of showing everything they are doing look at me I'm at the beach look at me I'm at the mountain uh top look at me I'm in my room alhamdulillah blessed me with my umrah I'm in manhaj I'm doing this I'm visiting so and so this is inappropriate why are you doing this to gain followers to gain momentum to gain Fame I don't know it is inappropriate what's in your private life keep it in your private life well it's beneficial for the ummah you can share that without a problem insha Allah and Allah Knows Best"
