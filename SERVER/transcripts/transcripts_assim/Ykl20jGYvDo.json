  "transcript": "omar says as saying astagfirullah three times after fart prayers is the kafara the expiation of the mistakes or or lack of concentration in the prayer does this mean that even if i couldn't focus the entire salat saying it three times would restore my reward of the full prayer as if i had focused the entire salat if not how does the saying of three times astaghfirullah kaphara helps uh help us first of all the allegation you've based is totally unfounded nobody ever said that saying astar for allah three times after concluding for prayer and then allah humanitas is a confirmed sunnah according to the hadith of talban in muslim the prophets always did this however nobody ever said that this expiates whatever mistakes or lack of that you've committed in your prayer so where did you get this from there's no evidence backing it from the quran or from the sunnah therefore yes it does not expiate and definitely if you have prayed your prayer and you did not have any sure in it saying for allah three times would not suffice to restore the reward now we have evidences stating that any flaws in your prayer is compensated by the voluntary sunnah or the rawatib which you pray before and after the prayer this compensates for for any short comings or flaws in your prayer but would it restore it fully this is in allah's hands and all what we can do is be hopeful and allah knows best you"
