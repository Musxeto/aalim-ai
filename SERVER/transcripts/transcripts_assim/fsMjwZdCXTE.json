  "transcript": "Medina from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu So my family is celebrating birthday today and I want to ask I think they're like finished now if I can like eat the food that's like on the table and stuff that they I think made for like the birthday or is that like yeah I don't know okay so celebrating birthdays is not something that Muslims do only those who imitate the disbelievers and follow their footsteps do so real Muslims don't do this because it was not done by the Prophet ﷺ nor his companions nor the Tabi'een or Tabi' al-Tabi'een so it is something related to the disbelievers and the Prophet ﷺ said in the hadith of Abdullah ibn Umar may Allah be pleased with the man with his father and whoever imitates a people he's one of them however if your family decided to celebrate someone's birthday it is not permissible for you to attend such celebrations it's not permissible for you to congratulate or to say happy birthday and the likes and you have to stay away from their gathering if they send you food a piece of the cake any other thing a gift while you are not celebrating with them it's totally permissible for you to accept it and to use it therefore if the celebration is over and everybody is gone and you go out to clean the table and you find food you eat it there's no problem in that insha'Allah"
