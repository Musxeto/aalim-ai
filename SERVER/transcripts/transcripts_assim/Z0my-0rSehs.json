  "transcript": "foreign was once sitting with a man a companion when a man in a very nice suit very nice right came and passed by them so the prophet asked his friend what do you think of this man and His companion said prophet of Allah this man is one of the dignitaries he is a rich and influential person if he were to propose people would give him in marriage if he were to speak people would listen and if he were to intercede people would accept his intercession the prophet did not say anything then another man passed by so the prophet asked him what do you think of this man and the man laughed he's a prophet of Allah this guy is a poor individual he's nothing if he were to speak nobody would listen if he were to propose to a family they would not give him a marriage and if he were to intercede nobody would accept his intercession the prophet said this man is better than the whole earth filled with that man what is the prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam is trying to tell us he's trying to tell us and teach us that a righteous man who fears Allah who implements Islam in his life even if he's poor he's way better at the sight of Allah azzawajal than so many of those influentials those who are rich or powerful in the government those who succeed in spreading corruption in the Earth this poor man because he fears Allah is better than all of them nowadays as Muslims we are amazed and impressed when we see an actor when we see a government official a ruler a rich man a billionaire and this is not perme or a sportsman how many of us if you see someone famous in sports would run to take his autograph would run to shake hands and take a selfie but if one of the greatest Scholars of Islam comes who's he okay what do you care to take a selfie no I'd rather keep my pictures for myself nobody cares about them this is not what Islam teaches you if you read the Quran you will find this mentioned in Surah to tawba Allah says similarly to ayahs similar to one another Allah says addressing our prophet wasallam and all of us so let so let not their wealth or their children impress you or Muhammad sallallahu don't be impressed by their wealth how many children they have Allah only intends to punish them through their wealth and children in worldly life and that their souls should depart at death while they are in the state of disbelief aren't we impressed by the lifestyle of celebrities they're beautiful cars they're beautiful mansions they're beautiful spouses the way they dress the way they speak we imitate them and some of them some of us even wear t-shirts with names of Ronaldo maybe Ronaldo or Messi or whatever and we love them we adore them what is Allah telling you do not if you read a real Muslim do not be impressed by these disbelievers so many things people praise and glorify at the sight of Allah is worthless is nothing and so many things people don't consider to be anything they despise and resent while it is so great at the sight of Allah in sahih the prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam ordered Abdullah the companion to go and fetch him a miswak so he went the companions were sitting as he was taking the miswak he was a very thin man as he was picking the miswak the wind blew him and he almost fell what would you do when you see a thin man being tossed like a leave in the wind the companions left asked them what are you laughing about the companion said o prophet of Allah look at his legs they are so thin it's funny the prophet said I'm correcting how we look at things by Allah his legs are heavier at the sight of Allah than Mount a mountain this man's legs that are thin they are more valuable and heavier than Mount uhud this is how we look at things how would I evaluate you by your car by where you live by the pen by your watch by the brand of your clothes this is not what evaluates people by we evaluate them by their Iman their taqwa their deeds their character when you want to marry not now what do you do what do you look for all of us when we want to get married we looked we look at the outer shell Beauty wealth lineage Authority this is what people usually look for and Allah azzawajal says in the Quran and a believing slave woman or man is better than a polytheist an idol worshiper even though she or he might please you so Allah tells you don't look at the beauty of a woman or how handsome a man is or how how rich rather look at the Iman"
