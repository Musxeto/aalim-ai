  "title": "Is Denying the existence of black magic, evil eye, or jinn possession - kufr? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Finally, Muhammad says, is denying the existence of black magic, jinn possession, evil eye, etc. an act of kufr? Black magic is mentioned in the Qur'an. For example, in verse 102 in Surah Al-Baqarah, Allah tells us that the devils teach people magic. It's mentioned that Prophet Musa saw things that were not real, peace be upon him, from the magic of the sorcerers. And also in Chapter 113,  We seek refuge in Allah from the evil of those who blow in knots. And this is magic, black magic. It is mentioned in the Qur'an, it is mentioned in the hadith of the Prophet ï·º that seven are among the major sins, number two is as-sihr, magic, and it's different types. It's optical illusion, it can be used by medication and drugs, it can be by the use of jinn, it can be used by or created by the talismans and the words used by sorcerers, etc. So it's proven. And no one denied it except Al-Mu'tazila and Al-Qadariyya and some scholars of Islam which prevented the majority of taking them out of the fold of Islam. However, if I were to be asked, I'm not here to ask, I'm just reporting what the scholars say. Something that is found in the Qur'an should, if anyone were to deny it, we should immediately say that this is kufr. But maybe they have something that would block us from giving them takfir such as misinterpretation and misunderstanding. As for jinn possession, no, it's not kufr to deny it as it's an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion is that it does exist, not only in Islam, in different religions as well. As for the evil eye, this is mentioned in the Qur'an and in the hadith. Allah says in the Qur'an, So this is definitely found in the Qur'an and in the sunnah and whoever denies it knowing that it is found in the Qur'an and sunnah would leave the fold of Islam and Allah azzawajal knows best."
