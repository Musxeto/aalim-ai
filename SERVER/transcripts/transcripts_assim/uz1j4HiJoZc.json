  "title": "How can I convince my shia friend that praying on the stone (turba) is not authentic Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "sheikh i had a question i wanted to ask on behalf of my friend he's from the shia i believe so he had a question about praying on the kerba the turf of the stone so i told him that the prophet salaam never prayed on the turba it was maybe concrete or maybe it was earthly soil but it was never before by and he just had some questions about it and he wasn't uh believing in me so if you can just give us some knowledge about this issue well yeah it's a no-brainer it's totally a no-brainer shiaism was not present at the time of the prophet salaam nor abu bakr nor am and ali may allah be pleased with him fought them and he burned some of them alive so this is not an issue of dispute this is well documented secondly in the quran if they are muslims allah says today i have completed your religion so the religion of islam has been completed at the lifetime of the prophet islam any such blatant lie or claim that this is part of the religion which was not practiced by the prophet is falsified by the quran allah says the religion is complete you come after 100 years and say oops no no there are few things we have to add to it you have to hit yourself with chains and knives and bleed you have to pray on a turba or a small piece of stone from karbala okay did the prophet ever do such a thing no the companions no so is it part of islam yes liar wrong answer allah says in the quran unless of course you don't believe in our quran as the super shia of raphael say and claim they say the quran you have is not authentic fatima is 70 times larger and bigger than it and there is not a single letter of your quran in it what kind of blasphemy is this so my advice to you do not associate with shia and do not be friend with them because they have a different religion and they would not rest until they manage to move you out of your conviction and belief you are as a muslim have the quran which has been there for 15 centuries and you believe the sunnah which 99 percent of the muslims abide and believe in it and alhamdulillah our religion is the vastest fastest growing religion in the world and the muslims the sunnis those who follow the quran sunnah are whom you know so don't go to such minorities who would like to score a point but it's already out of the game time so scoring the point when the buzzer has gone it doesn't help at all stay with muslims and abide by them 24 7 surround yourself with them and leave those people of innovation allah knows best"
