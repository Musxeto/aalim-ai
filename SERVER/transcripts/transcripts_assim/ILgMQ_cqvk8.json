  "title": "Sticking Duas on the wall as a reminder to read - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "i stick duas in my room whenever i come across new ones just as a reminder and i read those whenever i see am i sinful for this the answer is no as long as it is for the purpose of memorizing and reminding you there's no problem in that what we say is a problem is what the scholars say which is hanging the verses of the quran or decorating the room with allah's beautiful names and attributes this is something that is not permissible because allah did not reveal his verses of the quran to be a form of decoration and beautifying your room where nobody even looks at it and sometimes heinous things happen in the room with them on the wall so this is what we prohibit but to have a reminder of what to say when you wake up in the morning when you enter the toilet when you come out and it's just a reminder once you memorize it you take it off there's nothing wrong in that inshallah"
