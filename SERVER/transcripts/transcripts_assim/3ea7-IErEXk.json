  "transcript": "okay we got a question here for sister nine it's about uh shaving the baby's head on the seventh day she wants to know what do I do with her hair after I've collected it she said some people say that you have to put it in a river in an ocean some say you need to bury it um she says what do I do in terms of weighing it what do I give out do I wait with silver or do I and give that silver itself or do I wait take the value of the silver and give it away as money um she she'll be very grateful for some clarification the Sunnah is to shave the hair or whatever is there of the babies on the seventh day and to give in charity its way in silver which means that you weigh it in silver and the value of that silver not necessarily the silver itself but the value of it you give as Charity so if for example I don't want to go to the Goldsmith to see how much it weighs and I estimate that it definitely would not be more than uh a Euro or two for example worth of silver and I give â‚¬1 MH as a charity this is acceptable alhamdulillah there's nothing wrong in that now how to dispose of the hair and when someone Clips his nails some Scholars say that you it's preferable and recommendable that you bury it but there is nothing in the Sunnah that backs this up so to me whatever you do with it it's up to you even if you uh uh throw it in the dust bin this inshallah is okay"
