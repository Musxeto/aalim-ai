  "transcript": "Sayyid from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh, I have been studying in an online program. I have a problem with two teachers. One of the teachers, when he pauses to make us note down things, he chants or sings and another one plays music. So I avoid that music. I skip that part. Now, I have very few days for my exam, maybe six months. So there is more out to learn. So is it permissible to learn from these teachers? There's no problem in learning from them and avoiding the haram. No one is perfect and if they include singing without music, it's okay. I know his voice is horrible, but you can tolerate that. There is no haram in listening to him singing or barking or doing whatever as long as there's no music and the lyrics are fine. The other one who plays music, you have to mute the music or turn it down until it finishes so that you can listen to him. But if he speaks with the music at the background, no. Skip him and choose someone else and Allah knows best."
