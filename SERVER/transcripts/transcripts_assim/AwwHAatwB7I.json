  "transcript": "so say you're in like a you're in and the gets up to say 30 hour and he starts reciting at watch your in or you're still getting up and you then miss and then like Miss a pill basically so you have to stand up again once he finishes I don't understand your question if you're talking about delaying standing up from sujud while the IM has already stood up and started reciting the fa is this what you're asking about yeah basically so your your prayer is valid you're wrong in delaying it because the moment the Imam stands up you should stand up I don't see him she I in the sujud the moment you hear him say you stand up and while you're standing up he's already starting in the F there's nothing wrong in what you're doing but if you continue to do suud and the guy is saying in the suud position this is skipping the standing position and the fat which is a pillar and this is not right to do at all"
