  "transcript": "SMIL had a homeowner Raheem alhamdulillah rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa muhammad al al-amin nabina muhammad in wada alehiwassallaam a woman today we had a worse individual netting Hill al-midan Movado assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wa barakato and welcome to the second lesson of Islamic on this beautiful topic which is the Islamic law today we will try to wrap up as much as possible and see if we can finish what we have at hand and let me first try to get connected to the Internet anyhow what we have is the definition of Islamic now linguistically means understanding Allah says in surah taha Bashar al-asad re were certainly angry we'll rock let dr. Tammy listen AF Cavalli Musa says or allah azzawajal make them understand what i say yes a holy and the Prophet said I want to be at best whomever Allah wills good in him he will grant him understanding indeed so he made during for his cousin in a bus and said Allah my limo that wheel was a hoof it Dean grant him understanding in Islam or in the religion now this is the linguistic it's either understanding or the deep understanding of the religion itself technically the jurors said that it is the description of different forms of worship and transactions so it deals with the details of because we have fundamentals of fit and fundamentals of fill is something that is more general rather than detailed in folk we go into details whether it is mandatory recommended permissible not recommended or prohibited these are a la cama tech lifia and we look into the detailed eveson evidences so it's not sufficient to say it's halong rather we have to show where we got this ruling from where did we stand it from and set the stage for a particular rule ruling to be given while in fundamentals of fit we talked about the general definitions so we talked about the text itself what does it mean the evidence we talked about abrogation we talked about general and specific we talked about things that define who L mujtahid is who's entitled to make a sh t hat and a lot of things that are so general but not specifics no examples no pro evidences from the Quran from the Sunnah they talk in general terms where it shows the juror the roadmap into how he is supposed to think and act upon these issues now where do the jurors the folk AHA the people studying Islamic where do you get this this knowledge from how do they implement the knowledge they have into the fill we have in front of us halal Haram etc this is an issue that a lot of the schools of thought had their own different point of view the first three or four ways of obtaining the legislations in Islamic jurisprudence were not disputed upon so number one jurors look into the Quran and we don't have to go through what for an is okay so I'm told that the camera is upside down that's weird let me put it horizontally and see how this goes on the thing is how to do this this is something I do not know let's look at this No so don't turn off I apologize for the interruption but what casting would be presumed soon insha'Allah this is not the way we want it to be so how did it reverse this way so I hope this is better long Stan so coming back all jurors agree that Quran is the first source for any types of legislations and we don't have to go through that Allah Azza WA JAL had sent the Quran to be a source of guidance and the Prophet when he sent more item in jebel he told him that let it be the first thing you call them for is to believe in allah so giad and the messenger allah his salat wa salam all of this called them to the Book of Allah let it be the judge between them and us then you go to the second source and this is the prophet's sunnah sallallahu alaihi wa sallam and the Prophet Sunnah is anything that the prophet salallahu alaihe salam had said or done or approved generally speaking this is what is related to took there's a fourth category which is the description of the Prophet as son but this is related to surrender to the Shamal so any statement that the Prophet says Ali has a lot of services to considered to be Sunnah and the vast majority of what the Prophet says al-assad is a revelation from Allah its way now sometimes he may make a sh t hat and he may choose to do something or say something which Allah does not approve and Allah corrects it on the spot so this is also part of why and for example when he frowned in the face of the blind man the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam frowned and allah immediately sent surah abasa wa ta'ala so whatever the Prophet says allah√≠s alot was salam in nicosia he too commands er at Hill Cumorah elephants Roja I used to prohibit you from visiting graveyards go and visit it because it reminds you of the day of judgement or as a prophet said alayhi salatu was-salam also his actions so the Prophet prayed in a certain way or in salat WA Salam we should follow that this is his Sunnah this is one of the sources of learning and taking evidence from the Sharia the Prophet says adding his salatu salam sulukim Allah a - Moony Oh Sally pray as you see me pray now this kind of prayer sallallahu alayhi wasallam is not verbally stated by him rather his companions describe that to us so this becomes also part of the Sunnah of doing it and following it what the Prophet approves of is considered also a Sunnah the Prophet once prayed Fajr is awesome after praying for he saw one of his companions playing Taraka behind the pillar he was angered by that and went to him and said his father - raka is for - raka so the man said o prophet of Allah I did not pray the Sunnah of fetcher so after I finished praying with you I prayed two Rakas of the Sunnah so the Prophet did not elaborate did not comment and went which means that he approved what the man had done so this is the second source of legislation Quran and then we have Sunnah then we have the consensus of scholars and the verses of the Quran and the prophets saying at a salatu salam do back this up and we have a lot of evidences to show for that the suitor in Chapter four Surat Annisa where allah azza wajal says in the quran well may you shut the colossal member dmattia billion allahu la huerta Barrera Sibylla mu'minin' knew only him Atta well who knows even a Mauser atmosphere whoever goes against the way of the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam not only that and goes against the way of the believers & schaffer ii may allah have mercy on a soul used to consider this to be a an evidence of the legitimacy of consensus of scholars because the scholars when they agree upon something then a Muslim should not go against them and because they they have the consensus and the consensus is also something that a Muslim should pay attention to why is that a lot of the Muslims think that if we have a lot of scholars saying something that this is a consensus and this is not true Muhammad says whoever claims consensus he's a liar how do you know that one did not go against them so how do we know if the consensus of scholars is they all agree upon an issue well they say that for example the consensus at the time of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam when let me rephrase that because the time of the prophet erase awesome is unlike any other time now do the Companions legislate there's no who legislates Allah Sojin and the messenger salallahu alaihe salam this means that if someone comes and says well this issue there was a dispute among the scholars at the time of the Prophet this is unacceptable because at the time of the Prophet Elisha Salaam the Prophet himself was the legislator and he only can tell with their this is right or wrong so the Companions difference of opinion does not count and it does not exist it rarely existed at the time of the Prophet Alesana because whatever there was a need for anything they would simply go and ask the prophet s awesome end of story no harm done so by this we know that we cannot come and expect the companions may allah be pleased with them to legislate this cons comes only from the prophet alayhi salatu salam after his death yes now the Companions may differ and we have to look into their consensus if they have consensus over an issue then this is part of the Deen if an issue that does not have a straightforward ayah backing it up or a hadith backing it up then the prophet's companions consensus is the ultimate or the taboo in all the generations after them if we know that the whole generation agreed at a particular point of time upon an issue this is consensus and this consensus goes to the day of judgment not today we can come and say hmm that have been agreed upon so and so but now we have difference of opinion among scholars this is unacceptable their consensus is binding for us whether the companions that have intervene or any generation 7th century sixth century as long as it was established that there was consensus in a generation this is binding to all muslims till the day of judgment then we have the fourth source of legislation which is analogy well known as LPS and what is LPS analogy it says in the text if you wish this means applying the ruling specified by a religious text on a certain matter to another matter for which no text refers see analogy has pillars it has something that we have evidence on and we have something that we would like to compare the ruling of this thing to it but this does not have evidence to back it up and we have also Allah Allah the cause the reason we made such an analogy on this there are many technical things basically speaking if one comes to for example drugs meth cocaine heroin marijuana all of this was not mentioned in the Quran well if you want to cascade it a bit more if you look at intoxicants in general gin whiskey vodka tequila rum brandy any type of intoxicants you would find in the Quran the word harmony and usually this referred to wine at the time of the Companions so whatever you said hammer this is what we do we make wine out of barley out of dates grapes it's a something exotic but not readily available in the Arabian Peninsula but that's good so all of these they make wine out of but not all these intoxicants that we have today so a person comes and says okay this is halal for me to consume such intoxicants because was not mentioned in the Quran here we are in desperate need of pious of analogy so the jurors come and say okay what is the reason Allah made in toxicants haram we find verses of the Quran we find prophetic s-- hadith stating that Moscow Cathy rufa Carrillo Hana whatever in toxicants in large quantities then little quantities are considered to be Haram and in link in language and in the words of the companions they all say that intoxicants is whatever covers and hampers your decision-making whatever covers your brains and intellect and sanity so they said okay this is the reason why it was Hallam Allah tells us do not approach do not pray when you are intoxicated until you know what you are reciting and saying so hmm it's something to do with decision-making it's something to do with do I know what I'm talking about or not therefore if we look at drugs we find that it shares the same principle it intoxicates you it hampers your decision-making process it has a lot of bad things in it that are similar to wine so it takes the same ruling without this it wouldn't be possible to move on and progress in life because there are so many things that are new that were not stated in the Quran or in the Sunnah specifically so do we come and say for example okay riding riding a car is not in the Quran as soon as it holidays Haram no we have the general rule to apply likewise analogy was given to us by the Prophet himself release awesome the process of thinking was directed to us in the Quran and hadith of the Prophet Allah saw someone he himself was asked Ali his salat WA Salam o prophet of Allah my mother died and she did not perform Hajj should I perform Hajj on her behalf so the Prophet says if she had a debt on her would you pay it off meaning to the people my says yes and he says then all's debt is more worthy of paying off so the Prophet is teaching him to measure to make the analogy to compare Apple to Apple and then come up with a conclusion so this is number two and number three and number four Quran Sunnah consensus of unanimity or consensus of scholars is map and then analogy which is pious then we have a third part of sources of legislation and that is called and it's the Sun and it's called here subtle analogy sudden analogy is something that a lot of the scholars do not approve of and there are a great portion of scholars that approve for example Imam Shafi disliked it totally it used to attack it seriously because there are two types of subtle analogy one which is based on merely whims and desires the definition he says discarding the verdict of a clear analogy in preference of a subtle one or discarding a universal verdict in preference of a particular one providing that such process is based on firm evidences what Shafi did not like is the type of states and if that jurors used to come up with and failing to justify or to back it up so they say that yes I think that this is halal or this is how why they said it's something that sparked in my head and I cannot explain it this is not acceptable a juror who is unable to explain his point of view like Ali Mahmoud Roselli said he's not worthy of being a mistake but when you have things that are backed up by the Quran Sunnah so your analogy is weakened because the subtle analogy here overtakes it and would have more validity to it can you give examples this is not a place to give examples in details but just to give you a glimpse we have a transaction called a Selim and a Selim is to sell something you do not own or possess while promising the buyer to deliver at a specific time now this goes against all norms so the analogy would dictate that this is Haram why because the Prophet prohibited in hadith Hakim has a may Allah be pleased with him to sell something you do not possess and I don't possess it but it's an dictates that this is permissible because there is a type of transaction that the prophet√≠s are permitted how is that I go to a farmer and tell the farmer that I would like to buy his crops let's assume it's oranges and the type of oranges is well known the species of oranges is decided because it's his form I know it so I agree with him with rope trick ditions one that he delivers me on the first of April 2022 the quantity is dictated and we know that the quantity is 20 tonnes so it's fixed it's not something ambiguous the harvest of your know it has to be quantified thirdly the price has to be paid in advance so if I wait till January to 2020 the prices would go up but I buy it today with 20% off in advance so I would make a profit after a while the farmer would get cash quickly and not wait until the harvesting time so it's a win-win situation here this is a Stetson backed by hadith also the issue of well some what would argue and say this is backed by the hadith of the Prophet a son why would we call it a son this is a hadith according to the Sunnah Hamas is over that's it this is true another example would be an Easterner what is this is not this is not is something that goes against the norm against the analogy but it's beneficial to the people one two it goes it does not go against any specific hadith or evidence from the Quran and the Sunna what is this now it's this now is to ask someone to manufacture something to you so I go to a vendor or a manufacturer and I say listen I have this mobile I'd like you to produce a thousand of it for me so he's going to mimic and clone this mobile for me he doesn't have it and I'm paying for it so he's selling me something he does not possess the scholars say this is permissible because he's manufacturing it and all or affairs worldwide are dependent on it it's unlike selling what you do not possess in that's the case that someone comes to me and says listen I'd like to buy this Hyundai which is blue and it's 2018 model with little mileage and I say I'll sell it for you I'll take 40 thousand reals so ok here's a forty thousand reals or here's a down payment and I go and I look for such a car I may find that I may not find this is selling what you do not possess which is Haram and there's a lot of ambiguity I could break my word he could sue me I could find something cheaper it's something more expensive by binding myself to such a transaction while not only owning it this is haram number six I think is known as Al masala he'll Marcella it's in your textbook and Alma sorry Hal Marcella called interests without ruling this refers to matters that bring benefit to the people but there is no religious evidence that approves or disapproves of it now the interests without ruling some are accepted because it have it has interest in them and the Sharia backs it up so this is accepted and some benefits are not accepted so the Sharia tells you that this is cancelled and an invalid and there are benefits that are in between and we have to look into that third one and judge it now interest without ruling when we come to his job for example he job is concealing women from the gaze of men and it protects women does the Sharia support this or not the answer is yes then this is accepted in toxicants selling drugs there is benefit in it when I'm selling true or false true I'm making more money does the Sharia approve of it or not no so this is cancelled now we come to things that the Sharia does not approve nor cancels and this is called an masala hal masala depending on the benefits that it brings the people and the disadvantages that it carries and then we can judge for example allah azza wajal tells us in regards of intoxicants and gambling that there are a lot of burdens in them and some benefits yet the burdens far exceed in overwhelms the benefits what's the ruling palace you can understand that the ruling is it's Haram likewise when we come to something that the Sharia I did not comment on but the people need having traffic lights that injunctions so is it permissible in Islam or is it prohibited it doesn't say it is something for the Muslims to decide and if it's okay then they come up with it no one comes and says oh okay this is vida this is innovation no this is for the benefits of the Muslims however the problem nowadays is that a lot of jurors scholars students of knowledge have abused this concept of a masala hell masala to the extent that I've seen and you've seen probably Sooners of knowledge altering and changing the Dean all together because there is benefit in it so for example people come to issues like insurance this is the fatwa that insurances hammer why because it's gambling you put a premium of a thousand dollars it covers you up to a million in losses and if the year is over your thousand is gone it's like lottery buying a lottery ticket and you may hit the jackpot and you may lose what you've paid for your ticket no problem those who justify things without knowledge would say hmm there is Muslim there is benefit for the people when we say that insurance is hella correct but also there is benefit when you legitimize selling of intoxicants in our country you will not have tourists who cannot get wasted and drunk so nightclubs and bars and pubs would be Muslim subhanAllah they change the religion with this concept that is not mentioned in the Quran and the Sunnah even the jurors themselves when they look at the sources of legislation or anson Iijima happy at the bottom of the line at the last part they would mention al masala hell masala not at the beginning because it is easily abused and it changes the religion drastically now having said that it can be implemented but only by real scholars nowadays we find students of knowledge giving workshops on what on mah acid a Sharia the aims of Sharia and what they mean is Masada Hal Marcela they focus on this topic and the brainwash people making them think that this is part of the Deen you can change 90% of Islam Quran and Sunnah by masala hell Marcella will it dictates that we do the Symon says and this is totally bogus totally wrong totally Haram and by the way the Mikasa the Sharia the making workshops on no one from the set of had ever compiled books on them until maybe a hundred or 120 years ago nobody ever mentioned it as a separate science nowadays people are twisting things and they are riding the tide they're jumping the wave because they have the source and the means to change so many things that we have believed in and taken for granted because under Sunnah and this is what the self says listen no no no no no no this that was long ago now Mikasa the Sharia dictates that we do this that we do that that women travel without a Muharram that we can be in seclusion with a moment in a room for necessity that there is Muslim in someone who divorces his wife that we cancel this before Allah what is this and this is what's happening unfortunately nowadays which means that we have to be careful when we come to that number seven number five here in a document because the first two were textual texts Quran and Sunnah and then the Paris is man Messala Marcela and we have the customs of Muslims in Arabic is called aloof what the Muslims relate to and know and acknowledge and accept to be the norm and this is yeah any unknown it's not something separate from the Quran Sunnah but for example a man marry the woman with the consent of her father with the presence of two male witnesses marriage is done boom a month later the woman says where is my dowry and the man says yes honey I would love to give you your dowry here is one dollar and the wife is insulted and says no my dowry is a hundred thousand dollars now we go back to the Quran we book it back to the Sunna we don't have any specific amount of dowry so what to do here the jewelers go back to the earth and they say okay the custom of the Muslims in this community in the society a woman who belongs to a family of this status of social status how much is her dowry they would say probably X amount of money we go to the husband and say they pay her X amount of money this is the average so it's not what she says it's not what he says we go back to the earth and there are other examples of that number six the statements by the prophet's companions may allah be pleased with them and this is a respected source of legislation so we don't have a clear evidence from the quran from this wonderful measurement from the PS but we have a saying for a companion now some schools of thought as we will come to find out say that the opinion of a companion is are better and greater than anything else other scholars said no if the companion said right and other companions said left this means that we have a dispute between them and we cannot just cherry-pick Allah says in the Quran for antennas Adam fish a infra do whenever you dispute over an issue then you have to return it and refer it back to the to Allah and to a rasul to the Quran and to the Sunnah so when the Companions differ it is not permissible just simply to take whatever you like and go with it no you have to go back to the Quran and the Sunnah so some schools of thought give preference to the Companions opinion over anything else and some may consider it but not as a priority especially when there is a difference of opinion number seven the laws of earlier divine religions Sharaman Poblana Sharon Lina or not and this is an issue of dispute among scholars and the most authentic opinion is that in our law is sufficient for us to find all answers we do not have to go back to the laws of the nations before us because it would not be complete when Allah says a glioma Akmal - aleykum Dena come today I have completed your religion if we need to go back to other religions then our religion is not completed and when you read the books of you find strange things because the jurors themselves were either mistake meaning that they do not limit themselves to their Imam or to their schools of thought rather they expand far beyond that looking to the Koran to the Sunnah themselves and implement the same tools that their predecessors did and come up with a conclusion or with an opinion or the scholars are blind followers so the blind followers would get the statement of the Imam of the scholar of the school of thought and then justify it whether good or bad this is not my problem my problem is to convince you that what my Imam said is true but this is not true Islam Allah would ask us and question us about the Quran and Sunnah with the understanding of the three righteous predecessors of the three favourite generations the that the Companions the Sahaba the tambourine and the tablet today so now you come to an issue where people say that if someone pledges an oath to slaughter his son is he obliged to fulfill his oath or not and they say yes he is obliged because ibraheem almost slaughtered his son Ismail what kind of answer is this video this is the shower of those who were before us the laws of earlier divine religions this is totally unacceptable because in our Islam we have everything covered up covered so for example if someone says that prostrating to others is permissible as a form of greeting so like the Japanese would bow to one another this is Helen we say it's Haram this is no no no this is Helen why do you say it's hella they said because Yusuf as mentioned in the Quran all of his family came and prostrated to him and Allah ordered the angels to prostrate to Adam so such greeting is okay you see listen in our religion we don't have to go to back to the religions before us our religions clearly states that this is Haram the prophet citizen if I were to order a man to prostrate to someone else I would have ordered women to prostrate to their husbands but there is no prostration no one process except to Allah a thousand so again this is something that is found and the books of folk as a form or a source of legislation and we just mentioned it to get acquainted with it number eight prevention of what leads to prohibit to the prohibited and this is called self dude Zara error and generally speaking this is blocking the means so for example whatwhat's wrong in looking at a woman so what's wrong if I as a man looked at a woman I know she has eyes and she has a body she has hair all women do that she's like my mom my sister ah no this usually leads to something else which is liking and then initiating a conversation and then let's have coffee and then let's have dinner and then my place of yours poof so this leads to all of that but it may not lead to all of that so Islam blocks all the means that may lead to Haram so yes a woman applying perfume and going out where men can find her perfume smell a scent Haram as if she is a fornicator because this is blocking the means so a lot of the rules and regulations in Islam has this in it and I'll have one more question one more that is what it remind me I'll talk about the last part and we will post phone the leading scholars founders of the four schools of thought to next class insha'Allah because we will definitely not have enough time the last point of source of legislation is called al Estes hab and iNSYS hab generally is to leave everything as the default so for example what's the use what's the ruling on using in the mobile the default is Hallett because using anything in this universe is halal unless proven otherwise hmm okay what about its purity if I touch it do I have to wash my hands the answer the default lets us have is that it is pure and that your wood is intact unless proven otherwise and touching the mobile does not break your Moodle so generally speaking and this this hat is to hold on to the default what is the default everything in this unit in this world I can eat and consume and drink unless proven otherwise it's Haram and everything around us the carpet the curtains the table is pure its Highland it is permissible to buy it is permissible to sell it is permissible to use this is else to stop because this solves a lot of problems to you especially for those who have OCD when they come and say ah shake I did this and I did that and then something happened and someone walked on the spot of the ground so it's my whole house in pure what is this you get I get so many questions like this people say that I had a piece of cloth with Mavi prosthetic fluid on it and then it fell from my hand to the ground so I picked it up but I walked on that spot and went throughout the house living room the bedroom at the kitchen so now I'm having doubts that the whole house is contaminated and I should sell it and move elsewhere I will know what is this she says because it's got contaminated and it's all okay first of all are you 100% sure that the ground when your piece of cloth with methi on felt that it was transferred to the floor say no but mostly not not most likely I you hundred percent sure says no and then Alice's hub means that it is by default pure and clean don't allow Japan to mess up with your mind like this and play with you because this is all what shaitaan wants from you me Eliza will make us among those who learn his religion and have an understanding in it in the remaining few minutes we have a number of questions so question number one is there any prohibition to give or take money to or from others at the time of murder if I then please kindly reply you answer me the estus have it says can I take or give money at the time of the event of McRib what is the default default is Hell at MRIB Asia fajar Lahore any time I can exchange money because there is nothing to prevent it there is no hadith for example like the hadith that stating that selling and buying after the event of Jummah of friday is prohibited this is the only thing we have about tomorrow Friday and a van is called which is the second event where the Imam says a salam alikum - lago roca - and sit down and then the event is called this is then where after it you cannot sell or buy but other than that again estas hab the default you are okay apply what you've heard simply as much as possible to these questions faisal f app says can I pray for her soon after the fall well we know that the sin of the her is for Raqqa two plus two before the fort and two rakahs after the fall this these are the emphatic prayers there are another two rockets after the fall so it makes it four but this is that these additional two are not emphatic but if you do them you are rewarded so if a person misses the first four records or two of them for a legitimate reason he was preoccupied they did not allow him to leave the class he had a meeting which was urgent he forgot and all of a sudden the Akama was given there's no problem at all in making them up after the fajr prayer in sha allah can one take things on installments is it permissible now the vast majority of scholars say that buying things in installments is hella some scholars say that this is not permissible and among them is Shekar albani but the vast majority and share the same Tamiya said that this is permissible bin Basma they mean the whole nine yards providing that there are two conditions to be fulfilled condition number one that you buy what you're buying from the owner because nowadays if I come to you and I say I'd like to buy this mobile from you and you said I don't have the mobile but I can get it from a third party and I said okay how much and you would say this mobile costs a hundred pounds I'll sell it to you over the period of two years for 125 pounds I said that's fine that's cool with me instead sign these contracts these contracts are binding and you're obliged to transfer this amount to my bank account done deal done deal I go and buy the mobile phone and I give it to the customer and Hum Dil De Niro why because when I sold you the mobile I had no interest in buying or selling my interest is in giving you a hundred pounds loan and getting it back to 125 there's no risk on me of these of this mobile B I'm being stuck with it I can't sell it to anyone and I have to go maybe below a hundred pounds maybe a little bit more there's no risk this is Harlem you must buy in installments from the owner so I can do to justify this is when you come and say I'd like to buy this mobile phone and said come after a couple of days I go and buy the phone and I bring it in my shop two days later you come and say did you get the phone I said yes here's the phone I'll sell it for you for 125 you have the option to say no that's too much tell you what I change my mind I'm gonna buy something else I have no right to say hey I bought this for you now I'm stuck with it no this is selling I'm buying there is the risk of making a profit or making a loss so this is condition number one so okay I'm buying it from the owner the second condition is that the final price is fixed and done so when you come and buy this and I tell you okay I own the phone I'll sell it for you or to you for 125 pounds you should agree so I give it to you and you start paying in Romans couple of months down the line you call and say listen okay I I'm in deep financial problems and I think I'm not gonna be able to pay you for that installment for a couple of months so please can you bear with me and I said no I can't if you got a delay by two months you have to make it 130 pounds so I will add to it for the delay and you say um okay this is Reba likewise if the final price and this happens in mortgages is fluctuating due to inflation due to the interest rate so the agreement was that I buy the property for a million six seven months he says well now it's a million and 200,000 while year later is a million and 300,000 what is this this is totally prohibited and this is Reba that is not accepted these are all the three questions that we have for today and I don't know if we have any more questions the admins do we have any more questions I don't think so anyhow next Monday insha'Allah we will be addressing the origin of the four schools of thought the met have the school of thought of Abu Hanifah of a man Malik mmm chef mmm I met and we have one last question Islam says no compulsion in Islam well as in religion why killing those who leave Islam okay that's a very logical question now is killing others justifiable this depends on where you're coming from if you are a Muslim you said yes this is a prescribed punishment if you're a Christian or a Jew you know that this is an eye for an eye a life for a life etc so yeah this is part of the divine religions now we come to no compulsion religion no compulsion in religion means that there is no hardship in religion Allah did not order us to do something that is beyond our ability Allah did not order us to fly or to walk on the water all that religion is easy for all human beings worldwide to practice and implement this is what is meant by Larry Crawford Dean there is no compulsion in religion there is no hardship in religion as for a penalty when a person rapes your sister tortures her and kills her if there is no compulsion in religion would you advocate for the death penalty or not definitely you say yes those who go around and sell our children drugs and make them addicted to meth to crack to marijuana these are people who spoil and corrupt the earth would you advocate in killing them because putting them in jail or finding them would only encourage them to engage more so yes in religion as a Muslim Allah is the one who tells us to do or not to do so for you guys in the West freedom of speech is honored in Islam it is honored as well but without with boundaries when you come and say that it's part of my freedom of speech to slander your mother to say trash about your sister and daughter we say hey wait you will be flogged 80 lashes because this is not acceptable and not permissible in Islam so in Islam it is not up to you to embrace Islam and then a pasta sighs because we have rules and regulations you don't want to accept Islam from the beginning don't remain in your religion but to come and accept Islam and then leave Islam this is a crime that is the cardinal sin this is something that has to be punishable in Islam to protect Islam and the Muslims and throughout time they are a negligible percentage less than a percentage even those who reject Islam with the grace of Allah look at the Muslims the only country that may consider implementing execution for apostasy can be Saudi Arabia and Iran may be may be and this is Allahu Alem how it is implemented yet the fastest-growing religion in the world is Islam what does this tell you people in Indonesia they can uh pasta sighs whenever they want no one would tell them that this is wrong or will put you in jail you change your religion to Christianity whatever no problem in that so this should not be something that deters you from thrinng thinking of the whole big picture it's like someone saying I hate violence and I hate cutting people up so I'll not be a surgeon because I don't like blood look at the bigger picture helping people saving people's life etc and likewise in Islam this is what we have to do and I'm afraid that this brings us to the end of today's session so I'm looking forward for meeting your Monday I hope you shala we'd have less glitches like we had today and until we meet then I leave a few manila was salam o aleikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh"
