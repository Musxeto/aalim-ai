  "transcript": "Fazal says if i see my minor brother praying can I join as his Imam and then lead the prayer can I do the same with an adult provided I am better at visitation of the Quran and the Salah has just started another case if the Imam is absent in the mosque and this and someone starts prayer but then the original Imam appears should the one leading step back this is a question where Fazal is saying can I override someone while he is leading his own prayer alone or with someone else the first two incidents it is not permissible I go into the room and I find my 11 year old brother praying so I stand to his left claiming to be the Imam I say Allahu Akbar and I continue as an imam where he is supposed to follow me this is not permissible whether he is 10 11 years of age or he's an adult now in the case of the imam of the masjid this is something different because in the sunnah the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam once was sick so he deputized Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him to lead the prayer and once Abu Bakr led the prayer and all of a sudden the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam felt better so he joined the congregation he went from his own straight to the Imams ro and Abu Bakr once he noticed he retreated so the Prophet al-islam told him to remain where you are and continue to read and he refused and he retreated so the Prophet led the prayer allosaurus turn this one single incident some scholars understood from it that when the original imam of the masjid and they call him an imam or a tip when the original appointed official imam of the masjid comes late and the congregation had already started by deputizing someone or allowing someone to lead them it is his right to come and take his place and this Imam the deputy one would retreat and join the congregation and they would follow after the mm however the vast majority of what's happening nowadays is that the Imam would pray normally with the congregation and would not demand his position as an imam simply because the prayer had started and the incident of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam can be understood that this was especially for the Prophet himself at a solemn and we can find the yanny justification when we read the hadith and find that the Prophet told Abu Bakr to stay a little option the Prophet is awesome told Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him to stay an actually treat which means that this was the right thing to do and Allah Azza WA JAL knows the best"
