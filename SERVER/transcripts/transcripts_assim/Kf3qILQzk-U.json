  "transcript": "Fahim from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Sheikh, a person who is trying to be a better Muslim day by day but struggles to pray Fajr prayer due to laziness and oversleeping at the same time after watching your videos now he doesn't want to free mix because he doesn't want to commit more sins but when he advised his family and relatives not to free mix they counter him by saying isn't it hypocrisy that you don't regularly pray Fajr but decided not to free mix and who are you to advise us you fix yourself first then come to advise us so that's why he cannot do dawah to them because they counter him by pointing out his weakness so are they doing the right thing Sheikh? First of all, each and every one of us must perfect himself to the best of his ability however, it is not an objective he must reach before he starts to advise people this is the way of Shaytan Satan is always telling me oh no no no you should not advise people you should not give fatwas you should not preach or give a lecture until you finish a particular number of classical books and read them on trusted shuyukh and get a masters or a PhD and get the recommendation of 20 or 30 renowned scholars by this logic no one would preach and in Arabic we have a saying if no one preached unless they are sinless no one would preach except the Prophet no one is exempted and free from sin we are all up to our necks in sins this does not mean we do not advise others part of our religion and commitment to Islam is to advise people even if we are sinful so even if I smoke and I see people smoking I should advise them Akhi this is wrong now the norm is ignorant imbeciles would point out your flaws and shortcomings as a form of defending themselves so even if you go to someone who is a professional assassin he kills people for money and you tell him Akhi fear Allah this is one of the major sins in Islam he would look at you and say ok ok you fear Allah first and cut your nails you are growing your nails over 40 days and this is haram or look at you you are shaving your beard or you don't pray in the masjid or you shout at your wife and your mother Subhanallah what does this have to do with that so it's their defensive mechanism or defense mechanism to highlight your flaws and shortcomings in order to hide their own flaws and shortcomings and this is the doing of the jahileen of the ignorant imbeciles you've done your due diligence you've advised them about free mixing you should fix your own shortcoming in not attending salat for your laziness in fajr but this should not deter you or stop you from keeping advising them whenever it's beneficial when they speak like this ignore them and totally move on such people are not worthy of your advice because they are advocates of the devil they defend their evil by highlighting other people's shortcomings and flaws so that we're both in the same boat so might as well accept my sins and I'll accept yours and this is not the way of the muslims and may Allah protect us"
