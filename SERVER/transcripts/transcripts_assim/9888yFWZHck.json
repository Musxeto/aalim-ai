  "title": "While praying can I bend down & switch off my phone that's on floor if it's ringing? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign my phone is in the carpet or floor that I play in and then I forgot to turn off my phone or put it on silent mode and then someone's call someone someone calls me so can I do movements while praying like pick it up so that the jamaa won't be reserved of the ringtone check it's on the floor yes yes no this is problematic because if it's in the floor and you have to bow down this is adding record to the Salat and this is not permissible so it seems that you need to either turn it off with your foot and only a orangutan can do that in a good way or maybe if you try to squat without doing the record so and and this depends on the strength of your squad your quads and your knees and try to pick it up but eventually try your level best not to go into the machine without turning off your phone or putting it on silent mode and Allah Knows Best"
