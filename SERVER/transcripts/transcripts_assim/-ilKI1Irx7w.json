  "transcript": "Al Allah the almighty tells us in the Quran what translates to and among his signs is this that he created for you wives from among yourselves that you may found that you may find Repose in them and he has put between you affection and mercy verely in that are indeed signs for for a people who reflect by far marriage is one of the greatest blessings of Allah the almighty upon the people and one of the greatest blessing in marriage to find the proper spouse the prophet saysat wasam describing this blessing the world is transient Comforts and the best of the Comforts of this world is a righteous woman and this goes without saying about the husband as well so if a woman is fortunate in having a good man then this is Paradise on the earth for women and likewise for a man to have a good and righteous and loving wife that would be his paradise on Earth unfortunately this is not the case we all know that every woman knows that a husband can be hell and can be paradise and likewise a woman can be your nightmare and can also be your fantasy and I was requested to speak about Ways and Means of increasing love between the spouses but unfortunately I need someone to give me a similar class or or to teach me this because I was looking for this for a long time but uh uh seriously when you want to reach this level of increasing the love between you and your wife or between you and your husband this is of course for women in this country everything is possible um now I'm talking about the normal Muslims to have this first of all you cannot reach this level of love and you cannot work on increasing it before going into the basics and that is knowing your rights and knowing the obligations and duties that you have to do unfortunately we all know our rights yet we seem to neglect our duties and obligations when you look at the rights and obligations of each party you would find that the obligations and and duties upon the woman are far greater than the duties and obligations upon the man towards his woman but the woman has more duties and obligations towards her husband why is that well there are many reasons and justifications the easiest to say is this is what Allah decreed so we have to take it as it is but if you go into some depth you would find that a woman is instructed to focus on her husband and her family and this is the only thing she's supposed to do while the husband on the other hand has to focus on so many things among them is his wife and the family so if a woman takes care takes real good care of her husband this can be her Gateway To Paradise the prophet tells us in an authentic Hadith that when a woman prays her five mandatory prayers and fasts Ramadan and obeys her husband and fourthly preserves her Chastity if she does these four things she will enter Allah's Paradise very easy well while the man on the other hand has more than this the man has to financially provide his family his wife so he has to work the man has to attend five prayers a day in the Masjid the man has to make zakat for the whole family as in zakat and else and other obligation Financial Obligations he has to it's his duty to take care of his mother and father the wife when she's once she's married she has only her family to obey and to look after he has to give da he has to make he has to make Jad he has to mix with people he has to be tolerant with people while the woman is safe and sound and her husband all what she has to cope up with is the nastiness of her husband the prophet Alat wasam illustrates to us that importance of a husband and he says and the Hadith is narrated by mu jab mu jabal may Allah be pleased with him was the prophet Messenger to Yemen so he was his Messenger to many places when he went to Yemen he saw how the Christians glorify their kings and how they treat them in a very honorable and sort of respectful way to the extent that they prostrate to their kings when they greet them so mu when he came back to Medina the first thing he did he prostrated to the prophet Alat wasam thinking that this is good and the prophet immediately made him stand up and said what is this m if I were to order someone to prostrate to someone I would have ordered a woman to prostrate to her husband so even the prophet Alam would not allow this to himself yet he said had I ordered anyone to do this I would have instructed the woman to prostrate to her husband to make suud to her husband why just to show us how important the status of a husband should be the prophet also forbade a woman from fasting without the permission of her husband and this is in a sort yeah shows you how huge the responsibility that lies on a woman woman's shoulders towards her husband she is not allowed to fast voluntary fasting while he's in her house why because he may request or need something of her that she could not fulfill while she's fasting okay he could tell me later on he I Can Break My fasting no you have to ask or seek his permission before you fast okay I'm fasting for Allah yes Allah knows this but the the husband's Duty in this issue is more and prior to Allah's Duty so if it's not mandatory fasting such as Ramadan makeup of Ramadan it falls under Ramadan what what what kind of fasting mandatory fasting there there is Ramadan that's all expiations expiations are mandatory if someone makes NE vows also it's mandatory so if she wants to do this she does not have to ask him for permission but if she fasts every Monday and Thursday the white days if she fight fasts a day and Skips a day she has to seek his per his permission otherwise Allah would not be uh pleased with her the prophet Alat wasam saw one of the women in Medina and he asked her about this man and she said he's my husband so he said how are you with him she said said oh prophet of Allah I try my level best to be his obedient and uh loving wife so the prophet Alam as if he was not convinced or he was convinced but he wanted to reiterate this point again and again and again so he said well do whatever you you you wish and please because he is your Jenna and he's your now he's your Paradise if you please him and if you're obedient to him and if he's happy with you and he's your hell on the day of judgment because by not doing this to him Allah will put you into hell because of that now women are not liking this they're looking at the floor and playing with the carpet and looking at each other why is this why did we come well this is that our religion yeah someone would say but but this is not fair this is Allah's ruling it's not ours okay it's in our favor but we all have daughters we all have mothers we all have sisters so I will not be happy just because my wife she has all this load on her shoulders at at the same time I have to accept the same Lord to be on my daughters on my mother and on my sisters this is Allah's religion and it's a test Allah tests everyone exactly like he is supposed to be tested yeah I heard this personally from many men envying women saying well you're lucky you say sit home doing nothing you wake up at 10:00 11:00 some wake at all what you have to do is just take something from the fridge put in the microwave it's lunch alhamdulillah when your husband come you just smile with him for five minutes then he is on the internet he leaves you alone for the rest of the day you don't have to do anything we men do every single thing and women say the same to men you're out driving your car you're with your friends in the office you go shopping you see see a lot of things you do this you do that while we cornered in we we're stuck between four walls and no one is ever happy if you go to a peasant you would say ah I wish I had a big castle I wish I had a big house I wish I had lots of cars I wish I had servants to serve me I wish I had this I wish I had that while the rich man says I wish I was poor I wouldn't have to pay an ex exra an electricity bill with the uh uh the heating with the cars with the maintenance with the taxes with this with that and I'm afraid that people will jump on my house to steal my stuff I will do this I wish I was poor nobody's happy Subhan Allah except those who are believers who follow the Quran and Sunnah what no matter what happens to them they will say alhamdulillah and they're satisfied your son just died so alhamdulillah Allah chose this for me and I know that he will intercede for me on the day of judgment he will he will pull me by my hand to Paradise but he's your son if he did if he didn't die when he's 5 years old he's going to die 95 years old at the end the result is death he's dead so a Believer is always happy no matter what happens he's always content and that is why he's never angry he's never Under Pressure he's always you know uh uh uh chilling out um there is a beautiful Hadith where jiel himself descended from the seventh heaven went to the prophet Alam and told him sayum to khad because she can't see him and tell her that Allah gives her the Glad Tidings of a house of a castle of a fortress in Paradise made of pearl it's a big pearl for her and in it there is no no tired nobody would be tired and there is no s s is a lot of noise so Scholars thought about this why why Khadijah this house okay all prophet's wives will get houses definitely but why these two characteristics in this house that she will not be tired in it and she will not hear noise and and and chaos and shouting Scholars say because she did exactly the same for the for the prophet Alam when he entered the home he would she would not let him lift a thing she would do everything for him and when the kids wanted things when they wanted to shout when they wanted to play she would she used to hush them she would not nag him she would not request things of him she would not tell him okay we need some bread go get this go get that we why we need to change the furniture why don't you paint the house why don't you go and fix a sink why don't you do this in that no she would not burden him he's in the house he's in his kingdom and this reward is in accordance to what she had done in this dun okay what about the rights of women these are the rights of men okay now women say okay we we get the picture we got the picture we have to put our men on a silver plate silver plates are not permissible for you to use use porcelain or glass or plastic even just put him on a plate let him comfortable what are the rights of women then the rights of women are mentioned in this Hadith but when you contemplate on this Hadith these are not the rights of the women the prophet saysat when he was approached by one of his companions and he said what are what what does my wife have rights over me so the prophet saysat that you should feed her as you feed yourself and clothe her as youo clothe yourself that you should not say to her may Allah make your face ugly and that you should not beat her authentic Hadith men say that's all that's cool I'll bring her an apple every day I'm feeding her and I'll get her one dress every year this is more than enough but she doesn't have to change like Wardrobe full of of dresses and I will not say may Allah make your face ugly it's ugly already no I will not I say anything to her I will not even speak to her women came a lot of women come to me and complain our husbands stay like a week or two without even saying Salam alayum he just entered the house eats sleeps goes out to his kids comes at night sleeps and that's it as if I am a robot or or or a maid in the house and the man says yes I did not say anything the prophet said do not say may Allah make your face ugly I didn't that's more than enough and you don't beat her beat her she's 6'4 she'll crush me to death what are you talking about no well these are not her rights these are the minimum of rights that one should have to his uh uh wife but is that all no Allah tells us in the Holy Quran uh and they that is women have rights over their husbands as regards of living expenses similar to those of their husbands over with them as regards of obedience and respect to what is reasonable so all of this has to be within it should not she has to obey you but you can't you know say Simon Says stand on your left foot for 6 hours and she says I have to obey him no this is not which is reasonable this is not you cannot tell her well today I'm angry with you don't sit the whole day just keep on standing it's you don't obey me me Allah will take you to to to Hell Fire no this is not not what is meant by obedience this is dict dictatorship so Allah tells us that we have an edge over women but this Edge is obedience and we support them we have to provide for them this is The Edge and the prophet said the best among you men are the best to their wives so you want to see if someone is a real practicing Muslim ask his wife and I've seen a lot and a lot of people who pretend to be practicing and their wives call me by phone W and they say oh sh masallah my husband is a nice man and he goes to the Masjid he attends circles he travels uh to different cities to attend seminars and he is participating in dawa he hands out leaflets mallah he does this and does that said mallah your husband is one of the companions of the Prophet Alam says no this is the bright side and then she goes telling me the list of the bad things he does and then you you you don't know if is this Dr Jackal or Mr Hy it's a split personality with the people mashallah he's excellent but with his wife he is as bad as he can be and the prophet tells us the best among you is the best too his friends or his family his wife how can you be so humorous and happy and giggly when you're around your friends with the minute you enter the the house Mall welcome to the dark side of the force the guy is is is is is completely transformed why is that what did they do bad for you uh 17 years ago she said something disrespectful what was it I forgot but who cares it was disrespectful this is this is not the dealing of the Prophet at all you have to support your wife the prophet says feed her when you feed so sheh I eat like two cheeseburgers every every meal when people allow me if they don't take that cheeseburger off me but does this mean whenever I take two cheeseburgers I have to give her two cheeseburgers as well no no that means that she has to also have a full stomach and she I buy like three suits armanis and five suits of this and my Nike trainers and so on do I have to buy the same no it means that you have to provide her with the minimum clothing acceptable in her environment you did not take her from a poor place you took her from her for Father's house if you can afford it give her the same standard as she used to enjoy while she was at her father's house what about if she's Rich lucky you no no no no no don't think that even if she's Rich she is not supposed to put one penny of her income of or of her savings to you yes but she has a lot of money or she works at least we should share in in in the house no it's not her responsibility you all allow her to work you don't want her to work she has to sit in the house and you have to provide for her but she is not obl to uh uh spend one penny on herself on the children or on the house and spending on the house is a great deed that Allah rewards you know that if you spend if you provide for your for your family you some people pay with you know their hearts are torn with every penny they get out it's painful you can feel him you know suffering why I'm paying the electricity bill so who's enjoying the electricity who's using it yeah yeah but the family is Big so it hurts him well if you think of the great reward the prophet of a man who was so agile and active passed by the prophet and his companions and he was you know you you find some people like this so energetic they move from one place to the other they help they do this they're always active some people like me just sit in one place you know maybe sleep for an hour or two before moving no there are people mallah that are energetic so the companions like this man and they said mashallah prophet of Allah if this agility and energy was in the cause of Allah it would have been great this is their thinking this agility this power this energy should be directed in the cause of Allah what did the prophet sayam he did not say a he said well if this agility was running to provide for his children and family it is in this in it is in the cause of Allah so I work eight hours a day in the morning and this in yes I'm I want to put bread on the table food on the table who's going to provide us so if I go to work in the morning with this attitude then my work would be fun cuz what I'm doing I'm doing it for the sake of Allah then the prophet says and if he his power and Agility and energy is to provide for two old parents of his than it is in I know people I know people that wish their parents die yesterday than today not today than tomorrow they want they they're Fed Up of them why yeah she my mother keeps on nagging if I don't call her every every month once every month she's always why you're not calling me call you're calling your mom once a month said yeah yeah she lives far away she lives like 15 minutes away in in in in Bradford so I can't I can't live like this she she's I have so many things to do I see my mother every single day between and and I still feel that I'm not doing her justice by Allah if your mother just raises her hands and said may Allah open the door because of mercy and provision for my son Allah will answer her and everything that I'm enjoying at the moment is because of her grace of Allah of course first of all SEC but but after that with the Dua of your mother you know what happened to J we said this last year the the the worshipper when his mother uh uh supplicated against him so people are like this they want their parents to die are these Believers no if they had the good intention of working 9 to5 to provide for their Elders for for their parents they are in they are in Jihad the prophet tells usam and if he is working not for anyone except for himself so that he would not beg so that he would not live on welfare or he would not live on in people's donations he's working with his arm is washing windows he's doing this he's doing that just so that no one would give him Sak he is in but if he's out to boast and show off is working for this reason then this is in the cause of Shan so think again when you spend to uh uh spend money and to your family you are indeed doing something that is righteous and good now how much time do you have 25 minutes not very funny there are things that increase the love between the spouses and each one needs at least 25 minutes but we will wrap it up this was compiled by my daughter may Allah bless her and and give her reward say a mean this is not for me so I can do this for my daughter and she took the time and she wrote these points to me I edited and and added it because I told her daughter you know how I am with your mother I'm a very bad husband so I need someone to give me something and I found lots of things in it that are beneficial for me and I applied it myself and it works you know women are so kind and and and and uh how do you call uh how do you call other word for kind no no no merciful anyhow you know you have the words mashallah they get angry so quickly but they are pleased quicker than that one word one nice word would make them pleased do we have the ability to take the initiative and say this word no we're men men are never apologetic we break windows we break plates we harm people but we never apologize for what we do among the things that increase love and you should uh uh try this you have to accept your spouse for what they are are accept them as they are you cannot change people you do not have the ability to change people and the biggest example or the biggest proof is that you can't change even change yourself and you want people to change you first do the changing and then you'll find people able to change the prophet says in a beautiful Hadith and this Hadith I always say to people when they're having conflicts with each each other not only husband and wife but even relatives friends Neighbors The Prophet says no believing man should hate a believing woman if he dislikes one of her characteristics he will be pleased with with another it's a matter of balance a sister just called me just 10 minutes before I came here from Saudi Arabia and she didn't know that it was an international call and as she was talking I was sweating and it took about 20 to 25 minutes a phone call she's just like the Energizer Bunny see talking talking talking without nonstop talking crying crying and talking of what of her husband she's saying everything that is bad about him he doesn't spend time with us he's always at work from 9:00 in the morning until 11:00 at night work work work nothing but work he never spends quality time he never takes me out he never sits with me I would like to drink cup of tea and she kept on talking I was envious but then ask her one question is he that bad she said no no he is a very nice person he's very generous he's kindhearted he's like wah he's M she now sympathizing she's he is M he's a poor man as if she's confessing that I'm giving him hell so this is and I told her Subhan Allah couldn't you find any excuse for him who is he working for and I told her that so many women are calling me telling me that their husband does not have a have work and they're supporting him and they're complaining and I have other women calling me telling me that their husbands prevent them from going out of the house to visit the parents except once a month and they live in the same neighborhood the husband say no you don't go out and This Woman's husband is telling her listen go to your parents go to your friends go to your relatives enjoy yourself she says no no I want him and him alone so one of the greatest things that would increase your love to your spouse is to turn a blind eye look in the other direction if you see something that is awful always look at the bright side I I don't know I can say this or not I know someone who does this he says that whenever his wife cooks food it's always burnt or too much salt or uneatable not good for human consumption and he says I come from the house from from my work to my house you know shattered beaten tired just you know I want a good meal and I sit down and I find this food and I take a bite and I find it from the first days that it's it's it's not good as if it's talking to me don't eat me and I take two or three more bites and I drink water and said alhamdulillah may Allah reward you for the food it was beautiful and my wife while I'm eating she's looking at me from under the table and when I finish and I said this she says liar said what what said why do you lie to me the food is awful I cannot even eat it she said what do you want me to do she said do something Subhan Allah Shout Scream curse do something the food is uneatable uneatable why do you eat it and he tells me that he tells her listen my love I don't I don't take you out and I know that you know your relatives take their husbands take them out I never take you to a restaurant for uh uh food I never bring you flowers I never buy you anything I am always at my uh uh Gatherings or for dawa or lectures I'm always out of the house and you're doing a great job and you never complain do I dare and complain about food or about dirty laundry or about the the houses is messed up you're tolerating me the least I could do is to accept you and appreciate what you're doing for me the food is like this though you spend two hours in the kitchen they've been married for 25 years the poor thing his skin has this know um she spent two hours and this is the best she could do so if you accept and tolerate the mistakes of your spouse your life would be beautiful this is the Golden Rule unfortunately we're not like this it's not us only may Allah be pleased with him the story tells us the story tells us that a man said I went to the house of Theif to complain of the rudeness and harshness of my wife's character my wife is is is killing me so I said where should I go marriage counseling the best one is Omar at least maybe he may chop her head off or do something for her so the guy went goes there and as he knocks the door and someone says who is it it says uh my name is so and so I'd like to see the Khalifa and he waits for permission to enter he hears Omar's wife shouting at him and Omar is saying yes honey yes dear and she's saying you did this you did that you did this you and Omar you know the fierce Omar may Allah be pleased with him is okay yes the guy at the door said ah it's not good he left as he left Omar came to to attend the guest and he found him you know giving him his back and walking said hey come come what's happening said it's okay khif Prince of the Believers I came to you to solve my problem but I found you have a bigger problem than mine he said listen my listen my son my brother I tolerate her because she has rights over me she cooks my food she bakes my bread she cleans my stoves my my my clothes and she feeds my children and all of this is not mandatory upon her it's not an obligation she's doing this as part of obeying me when it's reasonable and with all of this my heart tends to be soft towards her because she's my wife I love her so and and and also she distracts me from looking into Haram because she's my lawful wife and that is why I tolerate her uh uh Behavior and the man said then what should I do yeah I she my wife is like this as well so what should I do to tolerate her he told him my brother life is short and by Allah life is short and if you look back and some of the brothers when when he heard this Hadith I I told him that life is short he said by Allah life is short whenever I wake up in the morning I look at my wife's face it's been 35 years with her how did I how did I tolerate this but then I say that this is the blessing of Allah and apparently this is what a lot of men say and hear this they come and complain sh W if you see my wife well you'll be shocked to death and I say apparently brother you did not look in the mirror recently because that is exactly what her remark would be about you so it's a you know it it takes two to tango as they say it's a it's a touche no as you see the flaws and the shortcomings of people always look at yourself and appreciate those who are tolerating with you number two among the things that would increase in your love to each other that you do not criticize leave criticism away and it is human nature do you like people criticizing you nobody that like this nobody likes you likes your wife definitely is not doing a favor to you when she criticize your driving you could be driving she could be you know all all the time what are you doing don't do this don't do watch out the car and you don't like this although she's saying something that is true Ahmed tells us that I married my wife for 20 years and we agreed not to criticize each other and 20 years we did not have a dispute in our lives 20 years without having a dispute I know people friend a friend of mine who is married for more than 20 years he said by Allah I was never ever angry with my wife never when she is angry I I leave her to cool down 5 10 minutes she comes and kisses my foot in appreciation for my behavior and when I'm angry she is trying her best to please me and apologizes and then I come and kiss her forehead maybe because she's shorter I don't know anyhow so this is this is the trend this is how you get love into your life third thing that increases love consultation you have to consult your wife she has to consult you the worst thing in a wife life is negligence when you neglect her when you don't take her opinion when you do things I I I I get phone calls from women complaining that my husband changed the living room he bought a beautiful set of furniture and the colors and the paintings and the new LCD and so on so I said you should be grateful said no he did not even ask me about my taste and it's completely wrong and who lives more in that living room it's it's her so this is bad whenever you do something make them feel that they're part of the family if you want to travel on a vacation for example you want to take a week off quality time you want to go somewhere for sightseeing it would add a lot of value to gather the children with the wife where do you want to go and you with your wisdom and diplomacy you can drive them to the place you want giving the the the financial status giving the time giving the weather giving the K after a while they tell you okay we want wouldd like to go to this place and they say mashallah you gave me an excellent idea the impact on them because you consulted them is is great because it gives them trust and whenever you trust someone they they love you and likewise for the husband of course we are not consulted you usually because we are the one who are is paying the money so they have to take our permission but it is us men who need to consult their wives this is what the prophet didam and his wives would give him advice as in in in the Battle of uh hudia the the the Treaty of hudia when he signed the treaty he went to the Companions and said okay now you have to shave and Slaughter your sacrifice and let's go back to Medina and nobody did what he instructed them to do and the prophet was angry at he went back to Sal he said didn't you see what your people did they they didn't obey me so Sal told him should I tell you something that if you do they would obey you go outside and you shave your head and you sacrifice your uh your camel camels and see what they do the minute the prophet did thisam they jumped on each other shaving each others in in compliance with his instruction because they saw the prophets doing it there is no return and this was because of the advice of this wise woman may Allah be pleased with her uh fourthly you have to show your affection without any reservations show your love to your spouse express it and this is this was one of the complaints of the sister I just I should have written her her complaints because that would have been another lecture she is saying that no matter what I do he never talks he never expresses his feelings I tell him I want to hear the word I love you thank you my darling thank you honey nothing he never says anything of this sort at all the only time I I hear this is when I tell him about his coffee he says sugar I love you too that's the only time I hear something sweet from him is when he's requesting sugar so so you have to express your feeling to your wife and she has to do the same to you one says she knows this I've been with her for 40 years what else you want me to to say to her no it is important to say this the prophet used to say this to his wife and he would show this to everyone else he would not keep it as a secret abdah may be pleased with him comes to the prophet and says oh prophet of Allah who among the people people you love most he says he doesn't have any reservation in saying this some of us have reservations in in in and naming his wife well where you going I'm going to pick the MS Ms who the MS you know Abdullah oh your wife yes yes um Abdullah uh what's her name um Abdullah the daughter of so and so the prophet would find it easy and and normal to to name his wife wife his daughters yeah Fatima khad it's normal so you have to express your feelings and she would Express her feelings towards him and tells him that I know that you love me most and there's nothing to hide in this of course he would not go to one of the other wives and say you know that AA is number one you guys are number two number three number four no but he would show everybody else that he loves her to the extent that he would probably and she says when eating with the prophet Alam if she eats a piece of meat he would take this meat and looks at the traces of her bite and bites from it and if he she drinks from a cup he would go and put his lips where she had put her lips on that cup this is beautiful love it's like we do every day in our houses when our wives gives us they give us the spoon they had eaten with with and what is this it's dirty go wash it bring me something yes she said I ate from it I know what is this where's the hygiene you crazy you it's all over you this is wrong a real husband a real loving Muslim would enjoy eating the with the same spoon would enjoy eating in the same plate would enjoy drinking from the same cup as show of his love to his uh wife uh number five among the things that increases love is playing what was the last time you played uh I wouldn't say Monopoly it has dice played anything that is Scrabble you you were in England do was English too when was the last time you played Scrabble with your your wife when was the last time you went outdoors and played badminton for example together or played the football or played could be that's a good game you know that would be it's fun why would I do this one says what happens if I see she Al albani playing with his wife what a disgrace no it's not the prophet used to do it he not did did not do it once he did it twice says that in one of the battles one of the journeys with the Prophet The Prophet told the Army to go and uh uh advance and when I him and and her were left behind he said how about we race she said yeah I'll take you so she raised with the prophet Alam and she said I was young and light so so I won the race and few years later the prophet Alam did not forget this and in another Journey he told the Army to advance but she said I gained weight after four or five years I gain you know you know people when they met marry they tend to get weight uh to to to gain weight so she said yeah I'll take you and they raised and the prophet Alam won the race and he said two shape this one for that one now we're even what kind of a prophet is he he's the perfect human being playing with his wife a lot of the men nowadays no shameful playing with your wife what is this a kid or something you're a teenager the prophet was about 55 years old when he raced her 55 years old no handicap no back ache I cannot walk no no no the prophet was the strongest of Menat so this is something for you to do now but you have to take it gradually don't go to your wife and say let's go and race this guy's crazy all of a sudden you come back from a lecture Let's Play Come On where's the back bman where's the Monopoly come on come on let's play no you have to take it gradually express your love express your feelings then she says going to marry again say it split it out you want to do this you have to show your love unconditional love uh the sixth thing you can play together but also there is something that is more honorable and that is to worship Allah together the prophet used to wake his wife AA and all the other wives and they used to pray night prayer together so it's not only the dun that we together it's not the fun it's not uh uh the emotion and love that binds us also the love of Allah that is why the prophet says Alam may Allah have mercy on a man who wakes up in the middle of the night wakes up his wife to pray with him and if she refuses he sprinkles water to her face so that she wakes up and prays with him not a bucket huh a sprinkles water and she does the same for him and they pray two raas if a man and a woman pray two a night Allah will write them in the preserved tablet as that those who remember Allah a lot from the women and from the men by only praying two how how long would it take you couple of minutes but if you continue to do this the relationship the love among you would grow because it's not only for money for Sheltering for clothings no it's for the sake of Allah the almighty uh number seven giving gifts and the Hadith not only for the spouses the more you give gifts to people they will they will be enslaved for your favor they will be thankful they will be grateful so even if you have an enemy give him a gift he will become a friend and you have to give your wife every now and then a gift and she if she is able to afford it she has to also give you a a gift every now and then bearing in mind that these gifts are not associated to wrong occasions so why are you giving your wife this on the 14th of Feb is it 14th of Feb Valentine Day is it 14th or okay my memory still is okay so I say Valentine's Day sheh it has to be you know Wrapped in Red and it's it's Anonymous uh sender no no this is Haram okay can I do it in our anniversary so again it's Haram why we cannot celebrate this no these are all un Islamic and as Muslims we do not celebrate our marriage once a year every single day every single night is a celebration so I give her not on her birthday because this again is Haram I give her any other time that to to show uh my love to her number eight we still have five minutes I I'll just go through it quickly inshallah uh cooperation in the house so the prophet Alam was described by mother mother Allah be pleased with her when she was asked how was he in his house in home when he was home how was he like she said he was a human being like any human being he used to clean his clothes milk his sheep and serve himself whenever I go to through this Hadith serve himself I try to remember when was it the last time I went to the kitchen and got a glass of water I can't remember honey a glass of water and she's sitting next to me what am I what's wrong with me why don't I go no no what did I marry her go and get me this go and get me that go and get me this go and get me that this is what I do and this is wrong you have to cooperate with your uh uh wife I know a lot of good Brothers mashallah they cook and they're excellent cook I've I've tried their their their cooking mallah I know brothers that wash the dishes once or twice a week I know brothers that do not want to burden their wives they take their the clothes and they take it to the laundry get to to to be washed and pressed why see alhamdulillah I have money and I don't want to burden my wife it takes a lot of time and and effort from her side so the more you do in the house the more man you are one says no washing the dishes putting the apron on and and singing while doing that come on sh what is this I'm a student of knowledge Haram this is not no it's not the the more you do this the more a man you are you become not only in the eyes of your wife but in the eyes of yourself because this humbleness is part of the Prophet wasallam characteristic uh number nine avoid selfishness and this is very important We Men by Nature are selfish we're selfish we love ourselves we love our property we love our cars we love our wallets we love our money we love these These are mine so many times I've seen Brothers you know when they're served food and one of the children you know a child just goes to pick take something hit someone why why said this is my food this is your son said this is my food I'll give him whatever nobody touches my plate no this is this is not cool you have to be tolerant you have to be giving you don't you must not be selfish uh selfish having said that our Target as a spouse should be to please my spouse and if I do and if I make this my target life would be beautiful because I'm not waiting for something in return and this is one of the points that needs more explanation but I I'll just wrap it up you have to give without waiting for return the most of the problems that come to me come to me from people who are generous and giving but and underline the but Queen Victoria used to say but me no but whenever someone wants to you know object but said no buts the problem is that people who give a lot usually expect people to give them in return and when they don't Hell Breaks Loose Ya Allah that beautiful kind tolerant giving and generous woman turns into a liess what is a Linus less it's called the wife of a Lon I just made that up anyhow she turns into a vicious monster killing it why she says I gave nobody gave me and return don't give please don't give do not give and do not retaliate in such a fashion or give without expecting any in return and those who give without expecting anything in return are the richest people on Earth because they are so at peace with themselves and with others they just keep on giving and people around them maybe 10 15 would abuse this gener osity but you'll find five or three or even one giving in return and the person would be grateful because somebody gave him something in return but when you give generously to everyone everyone gives back in return and one only does not you feel miserable why didn't he give me all of those gave you yeah yeah but I'm expecting every single one I have a a record book to to write down everything I did give without expecting anything in return and uh finally there are things that you should do when you have dispute with your spouse first thing communication and the most the most of the problems that come to me are because of lack of communication I think something about you I don't talk it builds up my memory my imagination my Shan comes and puts fuel to the fire you think also something against me and the Gap widens until it's no return divorce is imminent um be able to forgive and forget don't live in the past something that happened and hurt you throw it in behind youas forget it it's gone don't live in the ruins because only the only person would would be harmed by this is you and try to be the first first to apologize it's not a shame it's not uh um reducing your manhood to apologize when you do a mistake the prophet Alat wasam tells us about the characteristics of the people of Jenna he said among the men the prophets are in Jenna are in Jenna the righteous are in Jenna the martyrs are in Jenna those who who uh go and visit their brothers in Allah not their uh siblings their brother in Allah in a different City only for the sake of Allah are in Jenna mashallah okay what about women the prophet said the women of Jenna are Al Al is the one who gives birth to children I meet Brothers in the 30s 40s 50s mallah how many children do you have said one why is that your line of production is very bad was one one of the brothers I met from the the speakers I spoke to him mallah he's my age how many uh uh children do you have he say 15 one of the known as must one of theith Egyptian guy he is very famous in in Egypt and elsewhere he's Mah a good Sheikh he had has 20 yeah two football teams that's a lot that's good so the prophet says the women of paradise their characteristics uh are one they give birth to a lot of children two they are kind wud they are kind to their husbands for they benefit their husband and finally and the fourth one is that whenever her husband does her Injustice who's the aggressor the husband husband whenever the husband does her in Injustice he she takes his hand and she says by Allah I would not sleep until you forgive me and you're you're pleased with me he's the aggressor but the prophet tells us that the women of paradise are like this so if she's doing this when she's the one who is oppressed then how would she be when she is pleased and at good terms with her husband and the list goes on but I'm AF that this is all the time we have I pray to Allah that we benefit from this and we use these points to practice them and Implement them in our lives and not only this but to teach our daughters as well because our daughters are tomorrow's wives so we have to teach our our daughters the rights of their our husbands over them and we have to teach our children our boys the rights of their wives over them so that when they get married they are already prepared"
