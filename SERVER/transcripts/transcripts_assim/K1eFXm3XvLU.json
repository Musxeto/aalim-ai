  "transcript": "from abdullah he says there is a picture especially in pakistan of the prophet sallallahu salaam named as nalaine is it copied from the same original looking shoe or is it just self-made they place this drawing and kiss it is it permissible this is a total innovation it is totally haram and this is practiced by the super sufis they write or they draw a sandal on a piece of paper like this and they hang it on the wall saying that is good for protection it's good for bringing good luck and i've seen in their books that they say this is one of the best ways of healing so if you cannot have his shoes the least you could do is draw a sandal and then place the sandals on your eyes and it will heal your illnesses and all of this is baseless fabricated lies that do not relate to islam it's an innovation and it's totally prohibited to practice and allah azza knows best"
