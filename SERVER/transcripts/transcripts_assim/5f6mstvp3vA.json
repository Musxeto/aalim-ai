  "transcript": "the name is uh he says if one says out of his mouth which he does not have in his heart is this hypocrisy hypocrisy in Arabic is n and n or hypocrisy is divided into two types major that nullifies a person's Islam and minor and some would call it practical signs of hypocrisy and this is a major sin or even greater than a major sin but it is not something that nullifies a person's Islam and the scholars Define hypocrisy as saying pretending to do Islam while embedding and intending inside of your heart the hatred of Islam and the enmity of Islam so a real hypocrite is or a real maafi is the one who pretends to be a Muslim Allah described them in chapter four Surah that they remember Allah seldomly and they go to prayer but when they go to prayer they go in a state of laziness and they may give in charity but they're stingy and rarely they do so so all of these features are found among the Muslims but what's in the heart is what Allah would judge so even if a person prays even if a person says I believe in Allah and the messenger of Allah if you go to this Surah that Allah called it the Surah of the Hypocrites the first Ayah Allah says whenever the Hypocrites come to you and say we testify that you are the messenger of Allah and Allah testifies that you are truly the messenger of Allah but Allah testifies that the Hypocrites are liars so this is true and real hypocrisy but if someone says something that is not related to Islam while intending something else this is not considered to be hypocrisy this might be um being diplomatic so if I see someone I hate his guts should I curse him and and say bad things to him though this is how I feel or should I smile and try to be nice and cordial and diplomatic so this has nothing to do with hypocrisy because hypocrisy deals with Dean when you intend that the Muslims fail or lose or be killed or the cfer Prevail and win all over the world and the Democracy dominates everything else even the Quran this is true and genuine 100% h hypocrisy uh"
