  "transcript": "foreign [Music] today we will attempt to study two maybe three of allah's beautiful names depending on how much time we have the first name is one of the sequence which was mentioned in surat al-hashr and this is other than whom there is no deity worthy of being worshiped the sovereign the pure the perfection the grand of course these we've discussed in alhamdulillah now the grantor of security the overseer the exalted in might the compeller the superior so these names mentioned at the end of surat al-hashr which many muslims believe that reciting them as part of the atkar of the morning and the evening which would lead to seventy thousand angels praying for them and seeking allah's forgiveness for them and the hadith is not authentic so we should make a note of that that this is not part of the morning and evening at car though this beautiful verse has and includes a number of allah's beautiful names so we spoke about some of them today we are going to speak about the others and we have min one of allah's beautiful names is and this may sound a bit awkward to a lot of the muslims because we tend to know that translates to the believer so we have muslim we have mu'min we have muhsin the three categories of the levels of islam as in the hadith of jibril peace be upon him so everybody knows that al-mu'min is the believer a human being how can it be one of allah's beautiful beautiful names this is what we will try to explain in this very short time that we have first of all al-mu'min can be translated into two meanings the true and the trustworthy or the grantor of security and it all is stemmed from the word for example belief iman iman in arabic means to believe so when you say the true or the trustworthy this sounds okay but what about granter of security well security in arabic means em so when someone grants amn then he is mu'min and when you have insurance this is all these words are related and this is why if you start if you study the the stim and the root of the word you can from it expand your vocabulary in arabic so you can know the verb the noun the adjective the adverb and so on so what is meant by min when it comes to truth and to being trustworthy there are a number of meanings related to allah azza for example allah is the one who believes himself no one can authenticate allah azzawajal so we have a hadith we need scholars to authenticate it we have a messenger of allah we need someone to authenticate him and who is better to authenticate him then allah azza so allah the almighty is the upper power that no one could go beyond he's the only one who authenticates things who believes things who gives credibility to things so when allah himself authenticates his beautiful names and attributes authenticates his oneness and existence no one can have any other say allah says it is allah who testifies that there is no deity worthy of being worshipped except him so when he testifies this is part of being because he gives credibility and authenticity to what is said also he gives credibility and authenticity to his messengers and to those whom who follow them by what by miracles by signs by verses of the quran by evidences to prove to everyone that what they're saying is the ultimate truth he's the one who's the mu'min who would authenticate and give credibility to his servants on the day of judgment so he would ask the believers what had you done and they would answer and he would authenticate that and approve it and he would ask he would ask the criminals the sinners the disbelievers and they would say whatever they want to say and allah would falsify whatever they say and say that you have said what is a lie and he would reject them so all of these meanings related to truth and to be trustworthy comes from the me from the beautiful name now when it comes to security when it comes to the granter of such security we find the following meanings al-mu'min the almighty azzawajal is the one who grants his servants security so they are secure from any injustice coming from him because he is just and fair he has no wrongdoing no transgression so his mukmin and his servants know that even abbas may allah be pleased with him explained and interpreted the name al-mu'min he said those whom his own creation are safe from any injustice from his side he is al-mu'min who grants his believing servants tranquility in this life wallahi if you look at the believers in the poorest countries of the muslim world you will find tranquility you will find peace you will find content this can come only from who grants them such security not only the believers even the disbelievers when they come to allah azzawajal seeking his guidance seeking his shelter when they're afraid he will give them security from what they are afraid of and he will give as a min which is his name he would give such security and safety and peace to those who follow his rulings and implement his sharia you will find it in their countries where everything is settled and set and people know the do's and the don'ts and they uh implement it in their lives and so on we can go on and on and on but the time unfortunately is very limited however al-mu'min is one of allah's beautiful name when you hear it when you ask allah by it to grant you security to rectify your affairs to prove to the people your honesty and integrity and to show them that you are saying the truth then always contemplate on his beautiful name al-mu'min the second name which we will try to inshaallah wrap it up in in quickly is in and this name was mentioned in the quran as allah's name only once in this surah surat al-hashr what does mean it can't mean the trustworthy and ever watchful witness so it is stemmed from al-hayman domination and domination is to dominate things to control things to be watchful over things it's all included in the name al-hayman and al-muhamen to allah has a number of meanings all fit means that allah witnesses everything you do is the one who rectifies things and authenticates things and gives credibility to things like al-mu'min this is why it was followed by it also he is the watchful and the protector so all of this is included in the name al-muhiman al-imam al-razzali may allah have mercy on his soul structured it beautifully when he said al-muhemen is the name to the one who has these three attributes in him number one knowledge so a person can be muhiman if he has knowledge but knowledge enough is not sufficient it is not enough why somebody can be knowledgeable but doesn't have the power doesn't have the ability to execute his knowledge like many scholars scholars have knowledge they know what's right right and what's wrong but they do not have the authority and the power to implement that so they cannot be muhammian the second attribute or characteristic is that al muhammad has to be knowledgeable and with authority and ability sometimes you end up with people with authority with reign with power but without knowledge so they do heinous things because they don't know what's right and what's wrong they don't have a moral compass and has to have both knowledge that can be implemented through the absolute authority and power but all also these two things like some muslim rulers who have the knowledge and who have the authority but they do not have the consistency so they are like a wishing star that glows for a while and then fades away and this cannot be an attribute of al-muhamen al-muhamen has to be consistent in delivering what is beneficial to his his creation in his subjects throughout time without any interference or hindrance and this can only be to allah azzawajal who has the absolute knowledge of everything and who has the ability to execute and who has a consistency so allah nothing is hidden from his knowledge whether on the earth or in the heavens he knows inside and out he knows what you know and what you do not know he knows what you show people and what you conceal he know the little things and what's inside of your chest he knows your intentions and your thoughts he knows what you're about to do his knowledge is so vast and overwhelming that has no ending and you cannot comprehend it it is beyond what we can understand or explain this is what al-muhammad means the one who witnesses the one who knows the one who watches the one who protects so when you hear the name you feel the shivers down your spine you feel the power of the almighty allah azzawajal who no one in this universe could share any of these beautiful attributes with him the last name we have and i don't know if the time is is sufficient or not but we'll give it a try the last name is al aziz and this is a very famous name and it is translated into the exalted in might or the almighty or the invincible so in arabic usually people understand it as pride and honor this is why the opposite of israel as mentioned in the quran it is only you allah who honors and gives pride to whomever you wish and you deprive whomever you wish from honor and humiliate them so humiliation is the opposite of pride so allah is what does it mean in arabic when it's related to allah azzawajal it has three meanings usually it means the one with the strength that is unbeatable invincible so pride or honor has three meanings the scholars explain it in arabic very difficult for me to explain it in english but i'll give it a try they say it has the meaning of what does that mean sheikh is meaning that is allah azza is invincible nobody can benefit him and nobody can harm him no matter how much they try nobody can reach allah the almighty and this is why in muslim in the authentic hadith allah says in the hadith my servants you will never reach a stage where you can harm me nor would never reach a stage where you can benefit me how could we harm or benefit allah who is the creator of the heavens and the earth this is impossible so this is one of the meanings of allah the honor and the pride of being invincible then there is and this is referring to allah's conquering an ability to defeat all of his enemies and they cannot defeat him and they cannot do anything against him and this is obvious to anyone who has eyes and the third type of is is the power that only allah possesses this al aziz meaning the powerful that no power can be compared to him if you look to one of the strongest if not the strongest creation of allah azza the archangel jibril we were told that he uplifted the whole town of sedum where the homosexuals used to indulge in their heinous filthy acts with the tip of his wing to the heavens and then he dropped them upside down you cannot say that allah is powerful or more powerful or the power of allah is compared you cannot compare allah's power and might with any of his creation because there's nothing that comes even close so is the power which allah the almighty the majestic possesses which can not be like any other power people could think of these beautiful names we should always understand what they mean and what they entail so that when we hear them we have our hearts filled with the love and gratitude to allah subhanahu azzawajad we have a short break stay tuned and inshaallah we'll be right back today i'm going to talk about the book interactions of the greatest leader the prophet of allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam taught them what to say when stricken with a calamity allah says what means and we will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and lives and fruits but give good tidings to the patient who when disaster strikes them say indeed we belong to allah and indeed to him we will return those are the ones upon whom are blessings from their lord and mercy and it is those who are the rightly guided um may allah be pleased with her said i heard the messenger of allah say there is not a muslim that is afflicted with a calamity who says what allah ordered him what allah ordered them to say to allah we belong and unto him we shall return o allah grant me reward in my calamity and give me something better in return except that allah will give him something better in return um may allah be pleased with her continued when abu salam died i said which muslim is better than abu salama the first household to migrate to the messenger of allah then i said that supplication and allah the almighty gave me the messenger of allah in return reported by muslims i have some brothers who play sports video games like fifa cricket etc is it permissible to play these video games i'm just not gonna love hayden um sophia from america um i wanted to ask about uh washing and brushing the mouth when fasting i know their hades are talking about the that allah loves the smell of the mouth of someone fasting so recently someone told me uh it's not good to brush or use this work when fasting okay muhammad from the us my question is can my wife also join me in the class because the teacher is would she recite the quran or just listen uh is it funny for her she hasn't started she hasn't started yet but she wanted to know like if she can kill yeah she'll have to recite it and memorize it with the future okay i will answer inshallah uh jainal abedin from portuguese portugal assalamu alaikum ah sheikha thank you so much and may allah you are you and zach tv for all your good report i mean the question is uh what is the ruling on uh working in a company where all the day long they play radio and it contains music but he used earplug and earmark to block the music so that he can't listen anything sometimes he hear the little bit music and what is the ruling if he helps his another friend to get a job in this company thank you uh from india uh can we study for exam or give online exam while in it okay and we have sidi from germany is what said that after we prayed the false prayer we should change the position or speak to someone to pray the voluntary prayer but can we make zikr instead speaking to someone to pray the voluntary prayer in the same spot after we pray the thought prayers okay i will answer inshallah refer from bangladesh uh one of my scholar one of my shy in my country said that after urination take time and when it stops coming in urine and just pour water and come out and after that if your urine comes out it is forgivable and my question is is it really forgivable after that if any urine comes out i don't understand the question you performed after that what do you do after uh my question is one of my shark in my country said that after urination and just take time and if when the urine stops comes out just pour water and come out from the washroom and if some urine comes out after that it is forgivable my question is when i comes out from the washroom if urine comes out and it drops is it really forgivable i will answer inshallah um from the uk are you sure i'm fine one question or two no of course one okay okay um so my question is um you know when we were taught to exaggerate while missing emma often knows [Music] say for example we even sum up say we're not fasting just like on normal days and we win some entrepreneurs if we do it slightly would it be valid are you talking about in wudo when you inhale some water up your nostrils yeah okay so you're talking about not exaggerating like if you just put a little bit and uh rinse in your mouth and knows is that acceptable or do we have to exaggerate to like the far extent okay our lunch inshallah and isaac from denmark denmark and my question is if i raise my hands too high with you know in salah when i do take here you know when and raise my hands too high will that invalidate my salah okay i will answer inshallah faizan just one question which was that can we use something that belongs to someone without asking them because we know that if we ask them they will certainly allow us okay i will answer inshallah and we have abu hafs from bangladesh uh it's a clarification of a question i asked you a while ago uh it was that our imam has the arakida of jamaa and he does not blindly follow any madhhab and he as a result he knows that the hanafi way of praying with her is not correct and it's against the sunnah still while leading the witter prayer after taraweeh he prays in the hanafi way because he fears as the area is hanafi-centric people might cause chaos if he prays in the sunnah way and he fears that he might lose his job so sheikh is it permissible for me to pray which are behind him and is imam doing the right thing what did i answer you you said that i can pray but i was in doubt i was having doubt whether i um propose my question in the right way the the answer is the same abdullah from spain i would like to ask about riya in prayer because i'm getting a lot of doubts that maybe all of what i do is real for example i was a trained answer and i thought what if a person next to me helps my stops my leg to go back and put my leg straight in the road and i said oh that's real because i okay i will answer inshallah abdullah so i think we have enough questions how much time do we have okay bismillah rafi from bangladesh he says what's the ruling on playing video games this is too generic he says fifa etc i don't know i don't play video games and there is a criteria a rule of thumb if there is nothing haram involved such as music or free mixing or indecent scenery such as women playing so you play fifa of men not of women if there is no creation from your side so you don't build a player that has the face of zinedine zidane and the body of ronaldo and the height of messi for example that would be messy but this is creating other than allah's creation this is haram if it's halal just football you knew our two teams playing with it without anything haram there's nothing wrong in that from the u.s somebody told him that the hadith which indicates that the smell the odor that a person who's fasting has is beloved to allah azza and this is an authentic hadith so by their understanding they said that you should not brush your teeth or use them in swag and this is totally bogus the prophet allah as described by many companions used to use them as swag while fasting numerous times during the day and and the night during the day of course but at the night also by default because he's not fasting so the sahabi says i've seen the prophet use them numerous times while fasting not once or twice or before it's permissible after it's not so all of this is bogus you can use it and the smell even if it goes the indication which is fasting it's an indication to the deed itself not that the smell itself is beloved to allah that it is a result of a good deed this remains as it is and there's no problem in that muhammad from the u.s can his wife participate in a an online um quran circle with his uh with her husband where the teacher is a male the answer is no if this means that she will recite and the imam or the the teacher would hear her recitation and correct her this is not permissible uh jainal or whatever from portugal he says can i work in a company that plays music all time yes because music is not your job you're not someone who's playing the music you work in a retail office or a shop that sells clothes like many countries unfortunately muslim and non-muslims and they're playing music 24 7. so i'm a salesman i sell clothes i sell shoes i don't like listening to music but they force it upon me can i work the answer is yes don't listen to the music and of what he's saying that he's putting earplugs or listening to something halal over his headphone that's a win-win from india can we do our exams while in erticaf if it's online and there is no other way to delay it inshallah there's no problem in that sidi from germany he says we know that the sunnah which states that after praying for prayer you must not pray sunnah or voluntary prayer unless you speak or change your position so would making zikr after be considered as speaking it's an issue of dispute some scholars say yes i'm inclined to the opinion that says no you have to speak to an individual because when someone vows like um al imran did in nina rahmani salman i've vowed or he came to his people said that i'll not speak for three days he vowed so does this mean if he makes dikkar he broke his vow that's of course is not rifat from bangladesh he says that he heard from one of his who says that after urinating you just wait for some time and then pour water on your private part and go out if anything comes out then you are forgiven if urine comes out afterwards it's forgiven you have to ignore it it's not exactly as what he said the issue is do you want to follow sharia or do you want to follow whims and desires everybody's going to say i want to follow sharia good the second question and this is what i always say to the people who consult me in our counseling sessions those who have ocd the second question is the most important are you at the moment following sharia or following your whims and desires here they are reluctant here they pause a while what do you mean i said if you go after urinating and walking out of the toilet after five minutes you come to check whether something came out or not or you wrap your private with uh toilet tissues or you do this then you're following your limbs and desires normally two billion muslims on earth don't have this suffering you're having are you a better muslim definitely not medically the doctors say you have no problem so what is it it's in your whims and desires after you urinate wash your private your testicles sprinkle some water on your underwear and leave no matter what you get of whispers that something came out ignore it and say to yourself that this was from the water i sprinkled if you manage to do this for five days without searching without looking without going to the toilet after an hour or two just to make sure nothing came out if you manage to do this for five days inshallah you will be cured be it from the uk says if i put little water in my mouth and in my nose without exaggerating is my rustle and wudu valid answer is yes but you're not doing it according to the sunnah so the prophet as in the hadith of the sabbath be pleased with him he said that the prophet ordered me allah to exaggerate in swirling water in my mouth and in a pulling of water up my nostrils unless i'm fasting so the exaggeration is a must it's an instruction from the prophet sallam if you do it you get more rewarded if you don't you lose reward uh isaac from denmark he said what's the ruling on raising the hands a lot so raising the hands during salat in takbir you do i don't know what do you mean by exaggeration if you mean like what people do by pinching their ears allahu akbar which is totally an innovation this is not from islam now this is not permissible in dua if you mean to to raise your hands in dua like this this is okay but it's not from the sunnah to raise it that much the question is would any of these things invalidate the prayer dancers no it has no impact on the validity of the prayer whether you raise them too much or you don't raise them at all faizan from india he says what's the ruling on using people's items without seeking their permission if i know already and i'm certain that they would permit me this is as known in the books of afric what is by alfodoli the intruder sort of no it's not the accurate um interpretation or translation if i have a pen and a friend of mine sees a third person and he says that i'm interested in buying the pen which the sheikh has so he says i'll sell it for you for 50 euros and the guy says okay i'll buy it so the deal is done he comes to me and says i sold your pen which is only one euro for 50 euros if i were to say okay then the transaction is valid if i were to reject then the transaction has to be cancelled this is known as bayer ulfoduli and it has evidences from the sunnah that some of the scholar that the companions did this when the prophet gave one of his companions a dinar and told him to buy him a sheep so the man went bought a sheep on his way back somebody proposed so he sold him this sheep for two dinars went back to the market bought another sheep for a dinar and came to the prophet sam with a sheep and the original dinar he gave him so as if he actually brought the sheep for free the prophet was pleased and happy and made dua for him this is permissible so if you use people's things without their permission knowing that they would permit you there is no problem in that abu haas asked me a question and i answered him finally abdullah from spain the issue of having ria what is riya ria is showing off it's a feeling that you get or sometimes you do it on purpose so that people would say good things about you so i usually pray the sunnah in a minute and a half but if my boss comes if my uncle comes if my uh um spouse or someone whom i would like to impress comes in i prolong it into five minutes now what is my intention for the sake of allah no to impress people this is riya and this invalidates the good deeds now shaytaan has used this as a key to infiltrate people's thinking so whenever they're sincere and doing something for the sake of allah he comes and say maybe you're doing this to impress people maybe you're getting close to the one next to you to impress him and actually nobody does this nobody gets his foot next to someone's else foot to impress rather to annoy maybe yes this is a sunnah but nobody does it to impress people so shaytan tried to mess up with your head you're opening the door for him maybe should be thrown in the dustbin because it's doubt so i can open doors and doors of doubt maybe abdullah from spain who is married maybe your marriage is not correct maybe your children are born out of wedlock maybe you were born out of wedlock because your mom and dad were boyfriend girlfriend and they did not conceive you before marriage maybe they conceived you before marriage you never know this is nonsense we cannot base our lives and our religion on maybe this is why it's one of the most important legal maxims in islam one of the most important ruling major ruling which is certainty is not affected or uh impacted by doubt certainty is not affected by doubt is not removed by doubt it's removed by other certainties so whenever you get these feelings in salah ignore them ditch them and throw them in the dustbin this is all the time we have until we meet tomorrow same time i'll leave you here while [Laughter] on"
