  "title": "Fade, Qaza, & Marine Haircuts? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Now, this question I always get, is fading haram the haircut? So, the hadith we have, number one, the Prophet prohibited Al-Qaza. What is Al-Qaza? Qaza is to shave one part of the head and leave the other. The Mr. T haircut, where he puts this Mohawk and shaves here, this is Qaza, haram. What the marine, American and US marine do, they shave the sides and keep the top, haram. The friars, you know the French Catholics in their churches, they shave this area and keep the rest of the hair. This is Qaza, also haram. The other hadith is, وَمَن تَشَبَّهَ بِقَوْمٍ فَهُوَ مِنْهُمْ Whoever imitates a people, he is part of them. So, someone doesn't shave, but he has a fate. He has a certain way of lining his head, like Drake, or like Rihanna, I don't know these guys names. They have a certain thing because the African-American movie stars or celebrities, people look up to them. Oh, he is the brother, he is like us, he is from us, we look like him. This is haram. You are a Muslim, you have your dignity, you have your honor, you don't imitate anyone other than the Prophet Muhammad a.s. So, leave your hair, all of it, or shave it, all. Or, when you want to have it little, have it all on the same degree. Little fate is okay. What do you mean? If you do number 4 here, and number 3 here, this is not a fate. This is usually that, when even you go to the barber, he cuts short a little bit here. But to have it skin, and obvious that this guy is mashaAllah a rapper, and do this and do that, no. This is not permissible to imitate the disbelievers, and Allah a.s. knows best. Okay?"
