  "transcript": "so when I tried to explain to my friends that the last time for Isa is the Islamic midnight they argue that they didn't have clocks or forms of time measuring at the time of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and they argue that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam couldn't know exactly when the Islamic midnight was so they say as long as uh you pray before fud it's okay what advice um could you give to them and is the Sonic midnight like the last time first of all we have to ask them are you speaking with knowledge or out of sheer ignorance number two if it is through knowledge do you know that the Hadith was reported in Muslim when the prophet told us that the last time uh for praying is is at the middle of the night yes or no if they confirm and say yes but he said wait wait don't say but don't use your analogy because this is how Shan booked his first class seat in Hellfire when he used his analogy by saying it doesn't make any sense why am I supposed to prostrate to Adam when he was created from clay and I was created from fire I'm better than him so be careful question number three do we you and I know today when is the exact middle of the night answer is yes we have watches in this case what will we say on the day of judgment when we Face Allah telling us that haven't you heard about theith Muslim where the Prophet said that the end of time of is at midnight and haven't I provided you with the means to find when midnight is what would your answer be said yes but do you think your butt would sell on the day of judgment will be accepted but oh Allah at the time of the Prophet they didn't have watches they they it's none of your business Allah told them that the last time of is is midnight they estimate Allah told them that the last third of the night is where your Dua is accepted and this is the Divine time where The Descent of Allah to the lower Heavens this is for them to calculate not for you you have the means to calculate it now so how are you going to reject the instruction of the Prophet Alam this is crazy you're a Muslim you should apply the means you have we have the Hadith we know that it's the top in authenticity and we have the means to find the middle of the night after that you should do whatever you want it's your problem you're the one who's going to be held accountable on the day of Jud judgment"
