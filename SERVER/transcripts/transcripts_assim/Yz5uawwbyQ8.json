  "transcript": "we have the first caller uh sister khadijah from nigeria let's check how can one trade a relation who is a shia okay and what is their relationship with them a second a second cousin okay i will answer inshallah sister khadijah says what is my relationship to a second cousin who happens to be a shia first of all islam is a religion of balance fairness and justice so we don't paint all shia with the same brush this is unfair are they all innovators yes without any doubt are they all kafir no without any doubt they are shades like the sunnis are all sunnis pure muslims on onto heed of course not there are sunnis who claim to be sunnis yet worship the graves or seek refuge in the deceased or deal with magic or black magic and sorcery or believe in the jinn and they ask for their assistance all of these things nullify islam so it is only fair to say that shia are shades and grades those who are extreme and go to the extent that they slander mother aisha they curse abu bakr umar uthman and the vast majority of of companions of the prophet isalam they claim that the quran has been altered and changed as which is all about proving that the book of quran has been distorted and changed anyone who has such beliefs is a blatant kafir without any doubt so if your second cousin is one of those definitely you have to boycott them and not have any affiliation with them and this is not severing your kinship because we must not have any relationship with apostates but if he is an innovator ishia among those like the zadies like those who have inclination to loving al bait more than anyone else without cursing abu karamaroth man and the rest of the companions may already please with them without saying anything bad about mother aisha without criticizing the quran or the authentic sunnah as a whole and saying that it is fabricated etc in this case they are like any other innovator we have to be diplomatic with them we have to be kind we have to try to give them dawah and show them the way back to uh proper sunnah and islam and maintain our kinship relationships with them as allah has mandated and allah knows best you"
