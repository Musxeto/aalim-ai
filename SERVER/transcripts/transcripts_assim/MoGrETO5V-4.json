  "transcript": "ramla from saudi arabia she says why is it when i fall into sin and i say o allah i will never make this sin again i'm talking to allah then if i fall into the sin you say you have to make kaffara you have to expiate because you did an oath i was not making an oath i was talking to allah excuse me allah is your friend you think you can talk to your father and say okay tomorrow i'm gonna cook you some biryani and when tomorrow comes he said i changed my mind we're just doing any normal dish no when you speak to allah azza and you commit yourself to allah by saying i will do this i won't do this this is an oath you don't require to say i swear that i will not do this or that because you're directingly doing it with allah the only exception is if you did it in your head you did not speak it you did not say it verbally in this case no there is no expiation for that why what's the difference the prophet says the prophet says allah has pardoned my ummah has forgiven my ummah for my sake for the prophet's sake for whatever crosses their minds as long as they don't say it verbally or act upon it so if in my mind i say okay i vow to allah to do this and that i did not speak it i did not say it to anyone i did not act upon it then i said tell you what i changed my mind i'm not going to do it no problem yet the moment you say in prayer or you are making dua in the last third of an audio allah forgive me and you're verbally saying it ya allah i did a mistake i did the sin i promise you i've commit myself not to fall into it again and you're talking to allah azza this is a done deal if you break it if you go back to the sin you have to expiate it what about sheikh if i add insha allah so i say oh allah i will never smoke again in sha allah when you put insha allah to an oath if you say if you say i swear by allah not to miss a prayer from now on insha'allah this insha allah is a life saver meaning that even if you fall into what you promised not to do you're not obliged to give expiation because this saves you from expiation and allah knows best you"
