  "transcript": "nefler says an old lady who's so weak can't she pray can she pray without Woodill and she can combine Salah or can she just say and then the time of Prayer without praying because sometimes they don't even know what they're saying okay the question is not clear but I think I have an idea of what she meant to say if an old woman is sane and knows what's going on but physically it is difficult for her to perform Moodle well in this case we have to look at how difficult it is if she's just lazy or tired but she can perform model and there's no harm on her it is a must that she performs Rodo to pray she cannot simply pray without willow if she is unable to use water due to her illness or inability to move then she must try to go for the alternative which is dry evolution using TM mum hitting the sand or the soil or the dust with both hands wiping your hands and wiping your face if she's unable to even use that in this case allah azza wajal does not burden a soul beyond what it can bear she can pray without wood or or TMO but this is between her and allah giving the Adhan is not permissible for a woman so I don't know what you meant nafla by that and if she doesn't know what they are saying or she is senile she doesn't know if it's morning or evening she doesn't recognize her children she is unable to determine things or to make choices or decisions in this case she's not obliged to pray so many elderly who have lost it when you tell them pray they say Allah Akbar Allah who are coming and then assalamu alaykum o Allah they don't know what they're doing they don't know right from left we don't tell such people to pray because Allah Azza WA JAL does not hold them accountable when they are not saying when they do not have their conscience Ness"
