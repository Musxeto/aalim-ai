  "transcript": "marish says our Ayurvedic medicines halal or Haram they sometimes contain cow urine so Ayurvedic medicine is taken from the Hindus is it related to their religion most likely it is not it if it has concepts of treating the patient while attributing the healing process to their thousands of gods or Krishna or to whomever Rama or whatever they call them then this is not permissible but if it's just a medication known to be used by the Hindus or the read by the Buddhists or by other religions as a rule of thumb such medications Halla the vast majority of the medication we are using nowadays is taken from non-muslims where the Christians or other denominations because they have the technology therefore being our Vedic medication used this is okay as long as there is nothing Haram in it relating it to their gods or to their healing powers it's a medication it's herbs etc and then the ingredients are not haram meaning that there is no alcohol or poison or something that is harmful now the man which says they sometimes such medication they sometimes contain cow urine and Uranus Jordan people are usually discussed by it but in Islam it is not an issue of whether it's disgusting or not whether it's clean or dirty it is whether it's halal to use or not whether it is it pure or not and the most authentic opinion in Islam that the urine and the poo of animals birds that we are allowed to eat they are considered to be pure what does that mean are we allowed to eat dogs the answer is no then the urine and poo is nature's impure cats the same ruling pigs the same ruling lions the same ruling crows the same ruling are we allowed to eat camels yes cows sheep pigeons birds in general that are not like hawks and eagles and etc all of these are halide so we consider their urine and their droppings to be pure and if there is a need to include them in medication this would not make the medication Haram but you have to look whether it is medically sound or not and hence there is no problem in sha Allah"
