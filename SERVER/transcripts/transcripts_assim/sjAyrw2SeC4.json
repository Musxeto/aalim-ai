  "transcript": "from Sri Lanka love you for the sake of Allah and has a lot of imp my question is does being kind to your parents exped for major sins because I had heard saying of salaf or someone from the past I read it somewhere on Instagram and if so like what good deeds I can do to my parents to get that reward inshallah this was narrated this was narrated by Abdullah Omar if I'm not mistaken may Allah be please with mind with his father in when a man who made heus sins came to him and did not know how to repent and he asked him if he had a mother and the man said no then he said do you have a maternal aunt and he said yes then he said to him be kind to her and be beautiful because that would expiate your uh sins so meaning that she takes over your mom's role when your mom is not there so yes this is reported by the S and indeed if being undutiful and disrespectful to your parents is one of the major sins in Islam that follows shik then by default being kind and dutiful and obedient to them is one of the best Good Deeds that would probably followed itself so you could do whatever you can to make them happy to please them within Shar boundaries and the sky is the limit and Allah Knows Best"
