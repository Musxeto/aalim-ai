  "transcript": "[Music] the following question a lady has asked this question sometimes it happens that you fast for the entire day but just before if par that is the breaking of fast you get your monthly period what will become of this fast would this day be considered as a fast or not first of all you have to understand that forms of worship are connected and interlinked they have a beginning and they have an end if the worship was interrupted most cases the for the whole worship is nullified I go and make wudu ablution I say Allah Akbar and I begin to pray my lover prayer which is composed of four units I pray the first second third and the fourth and while in the tisha hood offering salutation to the prophet alayhi salat wa salam five seconds before giving the conclusion Salaam Salaam aleykum Selam aleykum to LA I pass wind five seconds one second before I say a selamat if Muhammad Allah not one second while I am saying as-salam-o-alaikum or and I pass wind is my prayer valid no Muslim would say yes every Muslim would say of course not you'll nullified your prayer your wood oh and there is no prayer without Buddha again agree likewise with fasting if you are supposed to fast your fasting should be from the break of dawn until the Sun sets so if I manage to do this in exactly ten seconds before the Sun sets I decided to drink some water or eat some halwa some cake something something 10 seconds is my fast valid of course not likewise if a woman gets gets her menses her fast is invalid sure she just finished 16 hours - 10 seconds well this answers your question the whole robada worship is connected any breach any breakage in the beginning or at the end would render it void and this would not do do you want us to reverse it please [ __ ] I'll give you another explanation a woman who is in her menses 10 seconds sure what's with the 10 seconds thing 5 seconds come on you know what I mean seconds before the break of dawn she checks and she sees her purity and a man and woman in her menses purity is well known either by seeing total dryness no colours or by seeing the white thread like discharge no colours this means that she's pure she's over 10 5 1 second before I than she saw this and again was given and she had the intention to fast if she were pure is her fast valid or not you tell me yes it is valid how sure she did not perform goosal also has nothing to do with fasting or still has to do with praying also has to do with intimacy with the spouse but it has no impact on her fasting therefore if a person had intimacy with it with his wife he's in the state of major ritual impurity known as janaba and he goes to bed and he wakes up half an hour after the event of fudger in the state of sexual impurity is his fast valid masters definitely yes Sheikh he's in the state of major ritual impurity yes mother Aisha may Allah be pleased with her tells us that she and the Prophet Arisa lobster used to wake up after the identifier in the state of sexual impurity and continue to fast so now you get the balance thing a woman in her menses sees her purity seconds before the event and then intends to fast her fastest valid she gets her menses seconds before the sunset her fast is void [Music] you [Applause]"
