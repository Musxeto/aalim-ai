  "transcript": "third question is reciting the sewers in sequence in salaat this is recommended but it's not mandatory so you can begin in the first rocker by reciting kohlrabi nuts which is chapter 114 and in the second rocker you recite color order willful approaches chapter 113 so or before there's no problem in that insha'Allah"
