  "title": "Why is sitting in between the shade and the sun prohibited? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "i was sitting once and i was half in the shade and half in the sun so my teacher told me that i shouldn't do that when i ask for the reason he said because this is where shaytan sits so he is asking me can you elaborate yeah i can easily elaborate this is what the prophet told us there are so many things that we believe without understanding because this is part of our religion allah described this in the beginning of surat al-baqarah that we believe in the unseen so if i were to tell you that here is a mine gold he said wait i can't see anything you will not believe me but when allah tells us that there are angels around us there are jinn around us there is heaven and hell with so many things in them there is torment in the grave we say we believe people say believe in what are you crazy can you see anything no but i can believe and relate because i believe in the quran i believe in muhammad ali our messenger and i believe in the existence of allah so anything else is by default therefore when we wake up we sniff water up our rustlers nostrils three times and blow it out why the prophet tells us because satan or the devil sleeps over our nostrils did you see that no but you believe it and do it those who oversleep and not pray faster on time satan urinates in their ears have you felt the urine so no i haven't seen satan to be to to feel his urine likewise when you wear one pair of shoes and walk barefooted with the other foot this is the way that shaytan walks i haven't seen the shaytan but the prophet told me this and i believe in it this is the dividing line between believers and disbelievers so we believe when the prophet tells us do not sit in the middle of the shade where half of you is in shade and the other is the sun because this is where shaytan sits we say we hear and adhere and obey because this is what the prophet told us and allah knows best finally you"
