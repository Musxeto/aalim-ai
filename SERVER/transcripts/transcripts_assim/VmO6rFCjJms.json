  "title": "Is majority of ummah Maturidi or Ashari & does Hadith that say the majority will never go wrong?",
  "transcript": "uh fosan from pakistan so here my question is that um my in my town there's a uh there's a shaykh with a map ready and he says and he goes that let's say that the prophet sallallahu alaikum said that majority of my ummah will never go wrong so sheikh my question is why is the majority of the sunnis ashari's and makuriti okay i will answer inshallah says scholars in my country say that the vast majority of the ummah they are ashari's and mathuridis and the hadith says the majority of my my ummah would not agree upon um dalala about about upon something that takes them astray first of all your scholar with all due respect doesn't know arabic so even the translation of the hadith is not true if he knows the real meaning then he's lying and most likely he's not lying he doesn't know arabic so he's just parroting whatever he heard from his the hadith my whole entire ummah would not have the the the consensus over something that is wrong the whole entire ummah not the majority because if you look at issues in islam you will find that the majority say something and a minority say something opposite to it and sometimes the minority are the one who are correct so it's not the masses that decide whether it is valid or not it is the quran and the sunnah and if you go to the quran and the sunnah you will find that the three favorite generations the generation of the prophets islam the companions the tabern and the tabernacle were all in consensus to the akida of alison al-jamaa never ever any one of them thought or said what the maturities or the ashari say definitely and they can't even deny this when they come and say only seven attributes of allah we approve of the life the hearing the uh seeing the intention the the speaking etc and everything else is rejected or misinterpreted is this the way of the prophet hassan seven only attributes of allah you approve of and the rest is not it's all metaphoric there's something wrong in iraq so this brother definitely has issues and you're better off learning from people that followed the prophet salallahu and abandoned philosophy and things that they've learned from the greeks and from the romans and and the likes"
