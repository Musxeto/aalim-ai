  "transcript": "from germany jake uh i'm very happy i'm talking to you i always follow your videos and i had a lot of questions to ask but for now today i'm asking you a question that um we have been in saudi arabia with my wife uh doing for business plus uh umrah in makkah and also we have visited madina so it was very hot of course but we have successfully performed umrah to umrah and after doing this at the end we got sick and then we came back to germany again as as far as our schedule but i'm asking you a question that getting sick is a sign of anything wrong that we have performed or i mean because so many people say um going to makkah madina people get uh how to say healthier than sick people on me so what is the sign of getting sick after doing this uh nobel umrah and you know performing praying in mokamodina okay okay so enamel hacks question is crystal clear they performed umrah and they visited medina and they were blessed with this holy journey if it's right to say however they fell sick when they came back to germany so does this mean anything does it mean that their umrah was not accepted that allah is punishing them allah is not happy with them no it doesn't mean a thing at all it has no relationship to um your umrah or to the validity of it or allah accepting it or not accepting it it is nothing to do with it this is something that allah predestined upon you so many people come from the umrah without any illness so many people even the locals sometimes we go to mecca or to medina the difference of the weather with the air conditioning with the sweating and then the air conditioning all of a sudden makes us get the flu and we with these recent vaccines the flu is much severe than before it is more vicious but alhamdulillah no complaints we're still alive we're still kicking so uh there is nothing related your umbra is accepted in sha allah try and do it again and again and again and allah would forgive all our sins with the grace of allah you"
