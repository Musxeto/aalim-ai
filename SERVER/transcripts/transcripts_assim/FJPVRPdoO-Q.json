  "transcript": "The next question is, do Muslims and Christians worship the same God? Of course, but their understanding of Allah Azza Wa Jal is distorted, because we believe in Allah Al-Ahad, Al-Samad. We believe in Allah Azza Wa Jal, Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala, who does not beget and is not begotten. They believe that Allah Azza Wa Jal has a son, has a wife, Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala, and they attribute to him so many negative things, but they believe he is the creator, the provider, the sustainer, and any Christian, unfortunately, they don't think. They're blind followers. They say Jesus Christ is the son of God. So, okay, when did he come to existence? 2024 years ago. Okay, 20-25 years. Where was he? Where was Jesus 20-25 years ago? He wasn't. Oh, so he came to existence 2024 years ago. Before that, he was not existing. It cannot be a God that exists after not being existed. So, when someone says to you, can God create another God? Yes or no? No, this is a stupid question. It's not to be answered. Why? Because if I say, no, they would say, God cannot create. And if I said, yes, he said, okay, then God can be created. So, damn if you do, damn if you don't. Damn if you do, damn if you don't. You do not entertain such impossible questions. One of the criteria of being a God is that you are there. You do not all of a sudden exist. This is why Allah Azza wa Jal is the first without a beginning and the last without an end. Nothing was before Allah Azza wa Jal. He was always there, subhanahu wa ta'ala, and nothing with him. So, when you say that Jesus came to existence 2024 years ago, he cannot be a God, number one. Number two, when they say that Jesus is God, they said, okay, what did he create? Nothing. No one on earth says there is a creator other than Allah. Not even Fir'aun. Fir'aun could not say, I create. Namrud could not say, I create. Namrud said, I give life and death. How? He brought two prisoners from the prison, sentenced to death. The first one, he shot him between the eyes. He said, see, I killed him. The second one, he said, I set you free. See, I gave him life. This is the most he could do. He said, but okay, anyone on earth, since Allah created this universe, did anyone claim to be able to create? Not a single being, only Allah Azza wa Jal. But they don't see this. They don't open their eyes to know that only God can create. And if Jesus was God, he could create. He could not do anything. So, yes, we do worship the same God. And this is why we follow the scriptures and they're called We can marry their women, whether Jews or Christians. We can eat whatever meat they slaughter. And we can consider this to be halal for us. This is differentiating them from others. And Allah knows best."
