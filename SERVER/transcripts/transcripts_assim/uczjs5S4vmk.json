  "transcript": "Nasly from Azerbaijan Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh If a person said, I swear by Allah that I will do something, but then he realizes that it is difficult, how can he get rid of that oath? What did he do? If he say, I swear by Allah that I will do something, but then he realizes that it is difficult. Therefore, if you take an oath and say, Wallahi, I will do this, or Wallahi, I will not do this, and then you change your mind for no legitimate reason, just, I change my mind, you expiate your oath by feeding or clothing ten poor Muslims, as mentioned in Surah Al-Ma'idah and Allah Azza Wa Jal knows best."
