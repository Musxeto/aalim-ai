  "title": "If a person persists in minor sins, will they turn into major sins? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so my question is that is it true that if a person assists in minor sins without repent ing or turning back then that minus in will turn into emergency this was stated by some Scholars that insisting on minor sins make them major sins but I failed to find any evidence from the Quran or the Sunnah backing it up because the Quran clearly states that there are major sins and minor sins and Allah says if you avoid major sins minor sins are forgiven so there isn't anything in between therefore I am inclined to say that this statement is not correct insisting on doing minor sins does not make it evolve into major sins but a person is sinful for insisting on it and Allah Knows Best"
