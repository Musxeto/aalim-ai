  "title": "Last time to pray Maghrib? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "is from the uk he says what is the last time for maghrib because some people in my locality say 20 minutes after sunset and this is not true the prophet told us hadith where the five times were identified of the prayers he said that when the redness in the west where the sun has set when the sun sets there is a redness in the heaven in the skies in the when this redness disappears and then it's pitch black this is when the time of begins and the time is of maghrib is over now in the uk this might be difficult especially if you are up north so usually they give 50 minutes to an hour and 20 minutes uh gap so if you can visually identify the disappearance of the redness in the meridian then this is the last time of maghrib but definitely it's not 20 minutes after sunset"
