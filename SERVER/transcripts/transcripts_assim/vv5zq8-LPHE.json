  "transcript": "uh sh what's the ruling on praying loud prayers silently only because one doesn't feel comfortable when others around him can hear him so for example if I'm praying Isha prayer in my room and somebody enters the room would it be hypocrisy if I stop reciting loudly and just do that silently for as long as this person is in the room with me first of all the scholars say that prayers can actions and the things we say can be pillars can be mandatory acts and can be Sunnah so Sunnah acts in prayer such as raising the hand when saying Allah abbar if I do it I'm rewarded if I skip it there's no sin and the prayer is valid so if I simply come to start the prayer and say allahar and I do this no problem even if I don't do this I put my hands to my side no problem the prayer is valid secondly the same thing goes for reciting loudly in and in the first two if I decide to do it silently so in and I recite the whole prayer silently the prayer is valid and if I reverse this and I decide to recite and loudly I have abandoned the Sunnah but the prayer is still valid so whether you do it because of people in the room and you're a sh shy or you don't want to disturb them there is no problem in that inshallah"
