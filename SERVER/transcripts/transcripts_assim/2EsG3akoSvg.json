  "transcript": "as can you tell us about the tahitu this is originally from the hadith of uh the prophet sam where he said o bilal why was i every time inside paradise at the uh glorious night journey when i entered paradise i used to hear the flip-flops in front of you your flip-flops your sandals in front of me wherever i went he said i don't know prophet of allah the only thing that i hope that allah would grant me reward for is that whenever i nullified my wudu i thought to myself i have to be in the state of wudu so i used to perform immediately would although it's not time for salah i perform mudu and i pray two raka's afterwards so the prophet said because of that this the scholars looked into and said this is called tahiyat like we have tahiti masjid the greeting of the message whenever you enter you do not sit until you pray to raka's they said the same thing applies for wudu whenever you make wudu you pray two rakahs and the etiquettes of it that you have to do it immediately so once you finish wudu you go and pray two rakahs not you go and eat and maybe drink a cup of coffee and then you pray to raka's it has to be simultaneous and allah knows best faison"
