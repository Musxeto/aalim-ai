  "title": "Small room in apt building where people pray with imam, is it considered as masjid? What's a masjid?",
  "transcript": "so there's a small room in the ground floor of my apartment and the amander delivers aan every work uh some people pray there in congregation so my question is will it be considered as a mid and what are the conditions of a place being a mid if it is in your building most likely this is not a full-fledged Masid rather it's a prayer hall because a Masjid has to be dedicated and solely given as an endowment to Allah Asel to be a Masjid where it cannot be sold it cannot be inherited and it cannot be given as a gift most likely the owner of the building can change it anytime he wishes into a storage room or to another apartment and sell it and it's it's his so it does not take the ruling of a Masjid however you are rewarded for praying with the congregation but definitely the reward is less than the reward of those praying in the full-fledged Masjid"
