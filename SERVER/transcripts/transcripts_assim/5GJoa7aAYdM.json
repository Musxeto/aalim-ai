  "title": "Is the brown discharge part of Menses, Is the START of menses red or brown blood?",
  "transcript": "I think we have Namira. So on the Islam Q&A, I read that there was one answer which said that the brown discharge is like a part of menstrual. So because they said that a woman's blood in the beginning it can be brown and then it can like turn red. And also I wanted to know when you say that the start of your menstrual is when there's a flow of blood. So do you mean like red blood or like brownish dark coloured blood? Again we have mentioned this many times and it's found on YouTube if you go or to my website. Brownish discharges may appear when a woman is pure before her menses begins. Or it may appear at the end of her menses before seeing a sign of purity. These two timings are different. Now the most authentic opinion is if a woman is pure for 10, 15, 20 days and she's praying and fasting, all of a sudden she feel cramps, back pain and she's noticing brownish or dark or black discharges. Some scholars say this is part of her menses and she has to stop praying and fasting or having intimacy with her spouse. However, what would happen if, and this happens a lot, after 3 or 4 days it stops and she becomes pure, only to find that after 5 days of purity she gets her menses. Then they are put in a dilemma, what should we do Sheikh? Should we repeat the prayers or the 4 days we stop praying? The answer is yes, it's your mistake. Because the second most authentic opinion, the second opinion of scholars which is the most authentic is such discharges, brownish discharges, are considered to be istihadah. So you have to clean yourself, change whatever is soiled with such discharges, perform wudhu after the adhan is called and pray. And it doesn't impact your prayer even if it comes out while praying. So this is the most authentic opinion. However, at the end of your menses, the blood is continuous, then it fades away, fades away, fades away and then we see the brown discharge. Have you seen your purity? No. So the scholars say this is part of your menses. Why? Because women at the time of Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, they used to send her their pads to differentiate and to distinguish the colour. These pads contained sufrah or qudrah. So the yellowish or brownish discharge, she used to deny them purity and she used to say to them, don't hasten until you see the white thread like discharge. Which means that this is considered to be part of the menses. And the hadith of Umm Atiyah, may Allah be pleased with her, she says, after seeing the purity, if a woman had her menses, then she saw her purity, she took ghusl, now she's pure. She says, we used to disregard whatever yellowish or brownish discharge we find afterwards. Which brings us to case number one. This is not your menses. This is part of istihada, disregarded. It does not impact your major impurity. You can still pray and fast. So I hope this answers your question."
