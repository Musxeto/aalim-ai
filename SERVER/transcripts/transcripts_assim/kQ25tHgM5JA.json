  "title": "How to pray when we join the imam in tashahhud (will end up making 3 or 4 tashahhuds)Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "hail says he has a confusion in regards to a person who catches the imam in the second rakah so if he sits in tashahud which is the follower's first raka but it's the imam's second draka he will make one to shahud then the imam would stand up for the third it's his second then the imam would sit for the fourth it's his third and he does a second to shahood this follower when the imam offers salam he stands up for this fourth rakah and he sits for the final to shahad so he has done three to shahood what's the problem in that he sometimes can do for shahood now no problem in doing that none whatsoever because his priority when joining the imam is to follow him so he followed the imam he did to the shahood his last raqqa he has to end it with the shahudan salutation upon the prophet salam so he has to sit for a third or a fourth it does not matter insha'allah"
