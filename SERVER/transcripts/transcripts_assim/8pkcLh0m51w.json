  "title": "He lives separately with wife & kids, can his father do Qurbani on behalf of him & whole family?",
  "transcript": "Tanveer from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh, my wife and children live with me in the city. I'm working which is away from my home. So I go to home like in every 3-4 months. Whenever we are back to home, we always stay and live with my father's family. We live together on the same roof. We eat together from the same kitchen. My father offers wudu sacrifice every year for himself and on behalf of all our family members. Is this correct or do I have to offer separate sacrifice for me? It seems to me that you have to sacrifice for you and for your family one sheep only or one-seventh of a cow. Because you have your separate home that you live the vast majority of the year and you only go back to your father's house for a short period of time such as a vacation or a weekend and the likes. And Allah Azza Wa Jal knows best."
