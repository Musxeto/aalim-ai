  "transcript": "if someone works as a shopkeeper or in a showroom in a Muslim country and the Masjid is very near to him he can hear the aan but the owner wants him to pray in the shop with other workers and doesn't allow him to go to the Masjid so will he be sinful for not praying in the Masjid and is the owner sinful for not allowing allowing giving him permission to go to the Masjid keeping in mind that unfortunately most customers come in when it's time for congregation alhamdulillah there is room in our religion and there is freedom in our religion in an authentic Hadith the prophet saidat said that a man's prayer in his mid is better than his in his prayer in his Suk in his shop in his Marketplace and of course his prayer in his Marketplace is better than his prayer in his home so with the grace of Allah if there is a congregation in the shop or in the mall or in the company and there is hardship or difficulty or restriction from praying in the Masjid alhamdulillah there is no sin at all in praying with the congregation with the grace of Allah and Allah Knows Best"
