  "transcript": "so as i've heard consistently about you speak about the parts of one of the groups known as the baha'is but who are they and what are their beliefs because i know the quranis and all these other sects do not relate to islam so who are the baha'is zayn from the uk says what are the baha'i and what are their beliefs this this is a a cult that is not related to islam was established in the mid 19th century and it was originated by a shia sufi group so they came with the support of spies from russia and from elsewhere to make this cult to divide the muslims and it is based on kufur so this or whatever his name is he came and first pretended that he is the gate the door that would deliver you to allah azzawajal then he claimed that he is like musa and isa or they were inside of him and then he claimed that he is allah the almighty and this is when everybody around him said okay that's enough and they executed him his uh uh one of his followers corrupted she was a prostitute who also wanted to spread evil and sins among all the muslims and then came other successors it's a total fabricated religion that does not relate to islam what do they believe in they believe that heaven and hell is metaphoric it's not real they believe in reincarnation they believe that allah azzawajal can come in the form of humans and get inside humans they believe that jesus was crucified for true and there is no second coming their prayer is three times instead of five they don't face the qibla mecca they face akka in palestine and two it's a waste of time to speak about their kuffur so they are totally kuffar apostates the majority of them are in iran and the shia dominated places such as lebanon iraq some parts of syria and jordan and palestine and in some countries of africa"
