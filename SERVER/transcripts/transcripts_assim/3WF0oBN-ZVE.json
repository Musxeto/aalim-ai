  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] AC [Music] alhamdulillah the message of the Prophet is usually divided into two types the meca period and the Medina period the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam lived all of his life until he was 40 years of age in meca and this is when Allah revealed to him him the message and he made him a prophet and a messenger he stayed in Mecca for 13 years and then migrated to Medina where he stayed there for 10 years until Allah asael retrieved his soul and he died in Medina Sall alai wasam so each era whether the mecca period or the Medina period had its characteristics and we know that the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam when he was in Mecca he was known to be the truthful honest the people of Mecca wouldn't trust him with their deposits due to his nature and character so there was nothing to tarnish his reputation and he was the finest man in Mecca known to the people of Mecca so when the message started and he was selected to be a prophet and a messenger before that all these 40 years Allah Was preparing him sallahu alaih wasallam from his selection and birth and upbringing no one took care of the Prophet Alat wasam except Allah so his father died when he was 6month fetus in his mother's womb his mom died when he was 6 years of age his grandfather died when he was eight years of age so it was Allah that took care of him and brought him up to be such protecting him from all types of normal entertainment that the youth of his age at Mecca used to enjoy Allah protected him from all of that Allah protected him from seeking the blessings of the idols or worshipping them or wiping over them or eating anything slaughtered for them and he did not feel that he belonged to his people because of their shik because of their immodesty because because of their wrong practices and therefore when he was about 40 years of age he used to like to be alone to contemplate and Ponder upon these great signs of Allah spread in this universe so he used to make it a habit to go for seclusion for a month or so so he used to go to the cave of H taking with him a SA or a GRL made with barley flour and water minimum amount of food and he us to used to go there and sit and Ponder and contemplate and look at these beautiful signs of Allah's creation to worship Allah Asel to glorify Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala but still looking for an answer as he does not know how to do that his nature tells him that there's only one God worthy of being worshiped but still he is looking for a path which would lead him to know Allah more subhah this was all part of Allah's preparation for him en to enable him to carry this huge message and that started almost three years before the prophet became a prophet and a messenger so when he was 40 years of age while he was in the cave of her he was met by the Archangel jiel who came to him in the form of a man he was startled in the beginning of this person all of a sudden appearing in his cave he firmly took hold of his shoulders and shook him saying to him read or in some narrations recite because it has the same meaning in Arabic and the prophet would repeat I don't know how to read and the angels the angel would Shake him once again telling him read and he says I'm not a reader and he would Shake him again for the third time and then saying to him recite in the name of your lord who created created man from a clinging substance recite and your L Lord is the most generous who taught by the pen taught man that which he knew not so the prophet was quite startled by this and he went back to Khadijah may Allah be pleased with her and he was afraid of what he had seen it is something that one cannot imagine and he was afraid mostly because if he were to tell anyone they they would accuse him of being insane or possessed by Jin and this was the most hatred thing to the prophet wasam to be accused of someone who was known all of his life to be honest to be truthful to be trustworthy to be wise and they come to him to solve their problems now they accuse him of being insane or possessed or has a spell on him so he did not like this and he was afraid but mother Khadijah may Allah be pleased with her supported him and made him steadfast by saying Allah would never disgrace you you have so many characteristics that call call for Allah to support you and to be generous and kind to you as he had been all these years you help the needy you assist those who need assistance and you feed the hungry so Allah Asel would never let you down now then after all of this time or after this incident there was this time or a period and some say it was approximately a month that this incident did not happen again and the scholars say that this pause was there so that the fear and the shock that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam encountered would disappear now he's calm now he's thinking about it now he's eager to have it once again so for a month or so the angel did not come back there was no revelation there are in the books of s and this is a Hadith that is not authentic that it was reported that the prophet sallallah Ali wasallam felt suicidal and wanted to throw himself from the top of mountains to end how he was feeling but this is not our prophet whom we know and the Hadith itself is not authentic it's called and the Z is not a companion of the Prophet sallam so he did not hear it from the prophet Salli wasallam he did not tell us who heard he heard it from and he was a single person so his Hadith over this substance or this issue is totally unacceptable and the scholars rejected it and refuted it the prophet would never commit suicide for any reason so for a month or so the prophet did not receive this honor again and he was anticipating and as he was coming down from cave H which he went back again trying to receive this inspiration this Revelation whatever came to him that he cannot explain he was waiting for it to come back again then when he was going back home in the middle of the valley on the way back he heard the sound he he looked to his right to his left in front of him to his back and he could not see a thing so he raised his head to the sky and he saw the Ark Angel giel peace be upon him sitting on a throne that was blocking the Horizon everything and he had 600 wings from his wings emeralds Jewels diamonds precious stones were falling to the ground when he saw this sitting on his throne again he was petrified so he went back home to Khadijah shivering out of fear telling her cover me up cover me up and this happened at the time when he was not certain of what he had seen the first time and this second time was certainly out of this world to see gibel peace be upon him like that and this is when the Revelation came to him oh once again oh you who cover himself with a garment arise and worn and your lord glorify and your clothing purify and uncleanliness avoid so this is when the revelation of him becoming a messenger of Allah was given to him and this is why the first revelation recite or read in the name of your Lord this was a revelation to appoint him as a prophet without a message and this oh you who covers himself with a garment arise and worn this Revelation appointed him as a messenger of Allah and Allah Knows [Music] [Music] Best [Music] for"
