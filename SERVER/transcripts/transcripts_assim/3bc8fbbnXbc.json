  "title": "Do muslims control the djinns?",
  "transcript": "I know some Muslims who have Jin in their control and they ask them questions about other people's matters is it a major sin it is a major sin and it can also reach the level of blasphemy because the Jin do not come to helping and aiding PE people unless these people offer them sacrifices and do things to please them otherwise you might ask this friend of yours claiming to be Muslim to ask the Jin to bring you a porsa 911 uh uh 4S for example preferably to be red in color with a beige interior if he fails to do do this then you would proably know that he is lying and if he does this then you have a big problem because this so-called Muslim brother has an ability to control the Gin which the companions of the Prophet did not do they cannot be righteous Jin some of them say no these are Muslim gin they're good Mah practicing Jin and they help me because I'm a righteous and Pious person as well well these Jin did not come to the aid and assistance of the 10 companions heavenbound companions of the Prophet so why would they come to help you secondly the prophet Allah tells us in the Quran that they see you and his tribe from where you cannot see them thirdly that seeking their assistance in such matters is not heard of and the scholars say that this is part of shik because asking them in such a fashion and manner is something that no one has ever done and it is unimaginable without sacrificing to them some of them may make uh uh things that nullifies Islam usually they would ask people to write the Quran in menstruation blood as form of humilating the Quran and then they would serve him or actually not serve him they would give him some help and assistance as long as he continues to worship them or to step on the Quran or to urin urinate on the Quran to do these awful and bad things therefore uh such a claim that they have control over the Jin no one has the control over the Jin the prophet Alam told us in the authentic Hadith that while he was praying fer one of the Jin came and attacked him so the prophet said I grabbed him from his neck and strangled him until I felt uh his saliva on my hand and I wanted to tie him to one of the pillars of the Masjid so that the children of Medina would play with him but I remembered what my brother suan Solomon the son of David peace be upon them all when he supplicated to Allah that Allah oh Allah grant me the power or grant me uh a kingdom and control over the Jin that you do not give to anyone else after me and that is why the prophet Alam did not do this and likewise if the prophet did not do this because no one has control over the Gin then most surely your friend has no control over the Jin at all and Allah Knows Best"
