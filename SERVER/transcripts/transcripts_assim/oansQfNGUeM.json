  "transcript": "Hamad says, I know that we need to say Alhamdulillah after sneezing even within prayer. Suppose I am reciting Tashahud and in the middle of it I sneezed. In this case I say Alhamdulillah and either I continue from where I was reciting before sneezing or I can start over the Tashahud. What is the ruling? Please advise. The answer is Alhamdulillah. When you are reciting your Tashahud or salutation upon the Prophet and you happen to sneeze, just say Alhamdulillah and continue without the need to go all over from the beginning and repeat that. Just move on and continue after saying Alhamdulillah. free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all."
