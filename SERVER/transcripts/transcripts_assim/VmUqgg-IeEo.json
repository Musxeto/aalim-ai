  "transcript": "uh last week I have asked you about the mobile ACC shop selling printed back like Superman and any other human beings and you said that it is not permissible however previously I was worked in a mobile shop where I stick mostly sticking the screen protectors but sometimes I may need to sell the printed packages once Imam came to my uncle shop and told him that we can't sell big teddy bears and keychains due to the images at the time ad came to my mind that once once in the prophet's house or his daughter house there was a curtain with images and and our Prophet told his wife or his daughter to remove it and they used it for pillow or something so I thought it it might be permissible to sell the printed things what's the Islamic ruling and and what what about the salary I earned any remedy Shake whatever was done in the past when you thought it was permissible is halal for you so don't visit that place any longer don't go to the past and start to dig up things from the pastas move on with your life the Hadith you mentioned was the Hadith of may Allah be pleased with her and she's the wife of the Prophet Alat wasam and the prophet told her to remove these curtains with the images so she tore it into pieces and stuffed it into a pillow so there were no images anymore so this is different than what you're talking about and Allah Asel Knows Best"
