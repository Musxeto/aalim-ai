will attempt to talk about two great women one is the last of his wives and the other is the first of his daughters so may muna Bentall hadith even her husband the mother of the believer and the wife of the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam her mother is hint bint house and it was known among the arabs that she that his Hindman house was among the most honorable in-laws a woman could have she had nine daughters from different husbands which is by itself normal in arabia a woman can be widowed divorced and continued to marry and to live a life unlike what we think of women today if a woman is divorced then she's expired if a woman is a widow nobody looks at her eye which is totally against Islamic values and against logic women can marry and Mary and Mary without any problem this is the cycle of life Hindman tov had nine daughters among those who married her daughters were two uncles the prophet alayhi salatu salam ala bass and hamza hamza marrying Salma been to omae's al-abbas marrying Liu Baba al-kubra the grand do Baba why were there a minor Liu Baba yes there was Liu Babis Oradell two sisters Lubell kübra was married to a lambast the uncle of the Prophet as Salam she was also known by all model and llevaba Sakura was married to Al Waleed numenera one of the first enemies of Islam who was killed and died as a kafir but his son was the sword of allah azzawajal harlot evil will eat so the Prophet s son was married to Hallett's aunt and also two of the prophets cousins were married to her daughter's so Jafar and ABI talib and I leave Nabi Talib they both married as madmen Thomas jeffer was martyred in the Battle of Mota then afterwards she got married to Abu Bakr Siddiq and after Abu Bakr died I leave no ABI talib married her and the prophet alayhi salatu salam himself married to of hand bent house daughters the first one we talked about was the mother of the believers dana been to hosea may allah be pleased with her and then he married my Munna bint al-hadith may allah be pleased with her the Prophet said alayhi salatu was-salam the believing sisters are maemunah the wife of the Prophet her sister of MPH adult mental health and her sister Salma been tell her if the wife of Hamza and the SMAP been to amaze their sister from their mother's side so if I made them a second earlier saying that Selma been too amazed well this hadith indicates that she was Selma bent al-harith despite some of the books of history that calls her Salma bent or - as well now when the Prophet married my Munna Allah his salat wa sallam he married her about three years and a half before his death and he married her because of the advice of his uncle al abbas who told him to marry his wife's younger sister she was married first then she married another man and he died when she became a widow al abbas advised the Prophet herself to marry her and the Prophet took this advice and married my Munna her name was Birla and again he changed her name into maemunah because bara is self praising by saying my name is righteous pious person so he changed it into my Munna which means blessed and by marrying her her tribe came into Islam [Music] in groups because now the Prophet is married that is awesome - one of their people and they came banu hilal came into islam and supported islam greatly may Mona may Allah be pleased with her was married to the Prophet Alyce awesome in self and she died some 40-plus years later in the same spot she married the Prophet Ali Saleh to Sam and was buried there and she was 80 years of age that was in the 51st year of hijra so after forty years of the death of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam lived with the prophet only for three years and a half yet gained the on of this life and the hereafter by being the mother of the believers that no one would ever mention her name without saying may allah azzawajal be pleased with her and she's also the wife of a prophet alehissallaam engine Rodie allah and her wah-bah and now we move to the first daughter of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam a woman known for her wisdom known for her excellent lineage no one can surpass her when it comes to honour and lineage she's the daughter of muhammad abdullah sallallahu alaihi wa sallam the prophet and messenger of allah azzawajal her mother is hadiza been to who a lit the one we know a lot about she was the eldest of the prophets four daughters may allah be pleased with them all and she was the first one among them to get married she was born ten years before the revelation came to the Prophet Alice thought of Sunna which means that she was about ten years old when the Prophet a son became a prophet and a messenger now having said that when she was at the age of ten all the dignitaries of Quraysh set eyes on her to be a potential wife to one of them and the luckiest who would win it who would win her heart at the age of 10 it was her cousin a bellossom near a beer he's the son of Hal had been to Hawaii it the sister of Khadijah mother of the believers may Allah be pleased with them he won her heart proposed and the Prophet gave his daughter Zeynep to him in marriage she was 10 years of age and she gave her husband Ali and oh mama now everybody knows only the grandsons of the Prophet Isis m2b Al Hasan and Husayn the sons of Ali and Fatima not knowing that there were others so Ali and oh mama where the children of Zeynep and a bilasa already died when he was young in the hadith where the Prophet carried his grandson as he was dying in the start started to weep sallallahu alayhi wa sallam and the companions told him how is this possible you are weeping and the Prophet said to them that this is mercy from Allah Azza WA JAL this is Ali the one who died in the hands of the Prophet Elisha saw Absalom as for oh mama she grew and later on was married to I leave now avatar on the advice and instruction of his late wife Fatima who was her aunt but she told him if I die marry oh mama now Zeynep was among the first to accept Islam with her mother and other sisters and when the Prophet migrated to Medina sallallaahu are you are you seldom she stayed with her husband I will ask and Abu asked was a very decent man though he was not a Muslim at the time the way zeyneb treated him he fell in love from head to toe and he could not think of leaving her because what was the school Zegna were taught in Xena were taught in the school of Muhammad alayhi salatu salam and Khadijah went away lit what do you expect their offspring to be so she was loyal to him faithful kind loving caring when she accepted Islam and I will ask remained on the religion of Koresh the people of Koresh came to him and said to him yet you are among the most trusted men to us we deposit our wealth and money and we entrust you with our trade so we are the dignitaries of Mecca and we are requesting that you divorce Muhammad's daughter and choose any woman from Quraysh and we will give her to you an offer people may usually not be able to refuse but not about us he said no by Allah where would I find a wife like Xena I would never do such a thing and I would never depart or leave or separate my beloved wife so they left him on the second year of hijra the Battle of Badr took place and I will ask was with the army of the disbelievers but he did not fight he just accompanied his people without fighting without participation and this is why he was taking as a prisoner of war when the Prophet has some asked for ransom we know the story where Zainab sent her brother-in-law with money and with the necklace that mother Hadiya gave it to her on her wedding night to hablas the prophet saw this felt soft and he asked the people if they were too let her prisoner go and return his ransom then this is kind of them and they immediately comply then they sent him away back to Mecca the Prophet then asked him Alice awesome to send his wife there is his daughter the prophets daughter Zeynep to Medina and I will ask agreed when he went to Medina he told his beloved wife filled with sorrow that your father wants you beside him so he sent her with his brother Cain Anna ignore Revere now when Cain Anna took Zena to take her to Medina two of the people of Quraysh Jabara ignore a sweat and a fur they've not armor these two people at the time were so evil that they started attacking the camel that was carrying Zeynep with their Spears and you know what happens to a big animal when being poked with a spear it started jumping and moving violently Xena was pregnant at the time such violent moves made her miscarriage and she bled and she was taken back to Quraysh left with the family of Banu umeå to be specific with hand bint utbah the wife of Abu sofyan and the prophet alayhi salatu salam heard of this he sent one of his companions to extract her and bring her to Medina which he did the Prophet Elisha was so angry with these two men aboard a pseudoephedrine Abdullah more to the extent that when it was the conquest of Makkah for that he used to send expeditions and tell them if you meet these two men burn them alive for what they had done to my daughter Zeynep and then the revelation comes from allah azza wajal correcting the Prophet Isis Salam and telling him that it is not permissible to burn a living creature and torturing it with fire because this is only to Allah so the Prophet corrected his command and said do not burn them rather kill them and then her bar later on accepted Islam and came to the Prophet al-islam in migration and showing his repentance what would you do if someone attacks your daughter causes her to miscarriage the man I wouldn't say with the golden heart because even this would not suffice to describe his heart Salalah haryana the moment the man accepted Islam the Prophet forgave him as if nothing had had been done and it shows you that the heart of the Prophet a son was filled with forgiveness with love with compassion forgiving such a person after what he had done now in the second year of hijra and better Battle of better I will ask was captured for the first time four years later on the sixth year of hijra he was captured again this time he was in a caravan going to trade with Syria when he and his wealth they were abducted by the soldiers of Allah when he came to Medina he managed to seek refuge in his ex-wife because they were separated for four years due to different religion and she heard that Xena and after fajar prayer she announced in the Masjid my name is Zainab the daughter of Muhammad and I give refuge to a bellossom near a beer so the Prophet s Salam was shocked and he said to the people by Allah this is the first time I know of this I have no knowledge of it at all so if you see it fit to send him with what he came with that's up to you as for seeking refuge the minimum of the Muslims can give protection and refuge to anyone so it was a first where a woman comes and gives protection to a non-muslim and Muslims all abide by this pledge of protection given by a woman so the Prophet SM gave him his trade and and money nothing was missing and he dispatched him to Macau once he reached Makkah he gave everybody their money and their wealth and the trade and he took all that was deposited with him and gave it back to the people and then he said to them have I missed anyone and they said no may Allah reward you you have given us everything that we have entrusted you with then he said if this is the case then I bear witness that there is no God worthy of being worshipped except Allah and that Muhammad sallallaahu Selim it is His Messenger and servant I did not want to embrace Islam before this time so that you wouldn't say that I kept something for myself or I did not return the money to you as of now I am a Muslim and he went back to Medina migrating to the prophet alayhi salatu salam when the prophet saw him solo assalam he was happy and he gave him his wife back without a new contract without a new dowry and this is a ruling in fact which is when two couple when a couple who were non-muslims one of them usually the wife accepts Islam and she is obliged to leave her husband she cannot live with a kafir with a nun Muslim but if she left him for a year for a five for ten years without getting married and after that he became a Muslim and they wanted to go back again in marriage they can without any marriage contract according to this story the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam honored zina a lot she was his eldest daughter he had so much love for her he gave her to her husband when she was 10 years of age she believed in him alongside with her sisters and mother they were the first to accept Islam and then when she was attacked by a bar and his accomplice and she miscarriage she kept on suffering from that and she got sick more frequent because of that until she died on the eighth year of hijra you can imagine the feelings of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam after so many losses in his life so many tragedies from the death of his father while his mother was pregnant with him from the death of his mother when he was six years of age from the death of his grandfather who took care of him when he was eight from the death of his wife Khadijah and the death of his uncle Abu Talib and being forced to leave the most beloved country to his heart and migrated to Medina from the treacherous treatment and the betrayals of the Jews continuously and the undermining of the hypocrites for the attempts of spreading Islam and for Dawa and for his personal and own tragedies and calamities yet he remained standing on his feet he trusted allah azza wajal he believed in allah soldier he sought his strength only from allah subhana wa ta'ala and this is why he remained steadfast till the day he died that was zina the daughter of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam may allah be pleased with her hi there Allahu Alem when is betrayal merely Aslam was allah wa sallim wa barik ala nabina muhammad why he was happy he remain"
