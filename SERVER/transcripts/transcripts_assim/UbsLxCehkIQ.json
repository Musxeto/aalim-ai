  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Sri lanka my question today is \nSheikh um I have this uh severe thoughts about   severe thoughts because I was sick and I was going \nto the doctor and this was ever since I got my job   so every single rupee I have earned has been sent \nto the doctors and medical issues and I have not   even saved a penny till today sheikh so this has \nbeen going on even now and it's continuing to go   on and this has been worrying me a lot uh it's \nlike even though I go to the doctors and they   say that I have nothing I come home content but \nI get a new problem physically and then I go to   another doctor and then I grew up more checkups \nand this is a cycle that never ends and this   is at a point I think that I'm going to put my \ntrust in Allah and never go to the doctors again   but then somehow I we I ended up there so this is \nalso interfering with my daily life with the job   and everything even though I try to put tawakkul \nin Allah it lasts only for a few minutes so how   can I solve this here this takes a lot of time \nand I advise you to come and book a counseling   session with me inshallah if you did not take \na free session before if you can afford it   you have to pay for it but if you can't afford it \nyou can come Allah is your judge and witness that   you can't and that you're poor and I'll give you \none free session uh inshallah in a nutshell all   these worries you're getting for the past three \nyears nothing materialized doctors say you're fine   till when are you going to allow Satan to mess \nup with your head like this the only one who is   bothered by it is you everybody around you your \nfamily your relatives your friends they go to   work as usual they eat three meals or five meals \na day they enjoy themselves they play around they   go to the gym they go to the park they do their \nthing and they're living and they're happy the   only one who's depressed is you over what over \nnothing over an illusion over your imagination   and this will continue for another 10 years \nuntil you die why because Satan is messing   up with your head and you're the one who's \naccepting him and calling him please come in   he's knocking on your door he doesn't have any \ncontrol over you he's simply an auction your door   you're the one who's opening it and inviting him \nin so you have only yourself to blame as mentioned   in Surat Ibrahim chapter 14. verse 22 I Satan \nsays I had no control over you except to call   you and you responded and answered me so don't \nblame me rather blame yourself nobody actually   is going to care about you Abdel Aziz nobody you \nlive you die nobody cares you're the only loser   and you will continue to lose and you \nclaim that you have tawakkul Allah you   have zero tawakkul in Allah because if you had \nTawakkul on Allah you would be like the birds   birds don't have a certificate don't \nhave a degree they wake up in the morning   they chip around they fly they go it worms \neat whatever they can find and come at   the end of the day with full stomachs \nand with food to give to their chicks and that's why Allah gives them rizq \nand provision and takes care of them   so if you have full tawakkul Allah you would \nnever have a problem with the grace of Allah"
