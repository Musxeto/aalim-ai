  "transcript": "Selma from Canada taking so my question is I'm trying my best to put my words together it's extremely important question I need to ask you my recently son passed away and I have a very bad anxiety and loneliness after M and I wanted to move from this home to sell but the question is that my husband is planning to go to India to see his mother his mother has a daughter and grandchildren in India she is a good in hands and I ask him to delay and not to go this time and let's let's work together and sell this home and move on on life because this house is remind my son every day most of the time I get anxiety depression because he he has a lots of memory in my this home but my husband he says that no I need to go he did the same same thing last year he went to India we will not able to move another home because he went to India to see his mother he's doing the same thing and he whenever I tell him not to go he said you are a Janam woman you are stopping me to see my mother am I jaming one question second is that no okay first of all uh we have only one question it is his right to move if he is not considering your emotions there is no problem on you the problem is on him he is the one who evaluates whether what you're asking for is legitimate or not his mom's presence in this life is timed what would you think he would feel about you if he were not to leave on time next week and she dies the following day and he could have met her and seen her before she passes away she passed away how would he think of you definitely a woman from Janam so it's best for you to let him go meet his mom Allah knows how long she's going to live second of all your anxiety is Shan driven Shan is messing up with your head Allah chose the best for your son aren't you able to cope with that the prophet himself when he was blessed with a baby boy he called him ibraim he had only four daughters all of his male children died at an early age when he was about 60 or 61 of years of of age he was blessed with a boy and the boy died before he completed two years of age so he was devastated what did he say he said the heart is saddened and the eyes are watering and weeping and we don't say anything that angers Allah but indeed Oh ibraim by departing us we are saddened so you should have total Reliance in Allah and not allowed Shan to mess up with your head like this besides your husband's point of view is okay let's assume we sell the house and we move on to another house but you still get these anxiety attacks after M what are we going to do migrate to India again or move to somewhere else it doesn't make any sense so let him go in peace stop nagging him and Trust Allah and make r on yourself and inshallah you'll be in good hands"
