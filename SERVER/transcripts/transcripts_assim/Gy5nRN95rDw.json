  "transcript": "[Music] sheikh i read a hadith which said that there is not any slave of allah who commits a sin then he perfects his ablution and stands to pray two raka's of prayer then seeks allah's forgiveness except that allah will forgive him so my question is if a person commits a sin and instead of praying this to rakat of tawba mentioned in this hadith he instead prays a father prayer any father prayer does he still have to pray the two rakat of salat after that prayer for forgiveness or is that for the prayer itself sufficient okay i will answer inshallah from canada can i pray for prayer instead of the turaka of tawba no the hadith is specifically about it that you have to pray these two rakahs and ask allah for forgiveness but we have another hadith which says that between afar and afar is an expiation to whatever sins that take place so if you repented from major sins and you pray the father then another thought that would suffice as well you"
