  "transcript": "question can a person ask his wife to talk less on phone with her brothers and sisters like once a week if he feels that she's talking a lot with them this is a little bit weird yeah i mean and i may take some time to expand upon this the relationship between a man and his wife is not based on simon says it's based on mutual understanding on respect on knowing who's the pilot that commands a plane and who's the co-pilot who also assists in commanding the plane and flying it but takes orders from the captain why do i say this so many times in counseling i get sisters complaining after 20 or maybe 25 years of marriage of so many heinous things that they want out of and they don't know how to get out of it and when you listen to them from the very beginning you say well that was wrong she says yeah i know but i obeyed him and he ordered me to do this and that and i said that's wrong too and he told me not to speak not to go not to do not to and all of these things are not human not normal yet she obeyed him in every single thing and now she's suffocating she can't take it anymore but he after all these years is used to total obedience so what is to be done we have to acknowledge that there is something that must be understood marriage is not slavery and he has no right to control you like a doormat and order you to not talk to your father and mother and your siblings and orders you to blindly obey his father and mother who are not related to you and order you to serve like a slave in their house and not to reply to them it's not right for him to abuse you and beat you like a dog and you don't open your mouth or he doesn't speak to you for five six months and you allow this nonsense to take place and happen this is not marriage even if you have children it has to stop it's your fault from day one not to have communicated with him and if you failed a number of times in communicating with him involve your parents involve the elders involve the imam of the masjid expose him let him see that you're not taking this crap anymore but when you allow yourself to be a doormat you will always be a doormat the first thing he does when he come home is to wipe his shoes on you this is not acceptable this is not marriage so going back to the question can he ask her to speak less we have to look at this request to evaluate if she is using the landline or the mobile to make long distance calls not through the internet but regular phone calls and the phone bill is humongous and he has to pay an arm and a leg for it yes definitely he has to order her not to do that and if she wants she can pay it from her own pocket money if she has any and not him but if she is talking through the wi-fi zoom skype uh whatever and it's not costing costing him a penny we have to see the frequency if she speaks to them eight hours a day while he is at work is there anything wrong in that of course not he has no right in asking her not to speak that long and she has no right in telling him i was speaking to them this long let it be between you and them why do you tell them everything where is where in islam is it mentioned that a woman must tell her husband about everything she had done throughout the day what time did some people even ask for a log what time did you do the dishes what time did you wake up when are you going to make the laundry okay there are 10 minutes lost between this and that what were you doing there this is stupid man and it's your mistake he has no right in treating you like this i'm not saying to rebel and make a scene out of it and fight and no but come on use your common sense in such marriages if she's speaking to them a lot in his presence and neglecting his rights she's not preparing the food she's not talking to him she's not taking care of the children she's just chit-chatting with her brothers and siblings and and every single day when the husband is present yes this is a an exaggeration she is misusing this facility and she has to be asked not to do this in his presence because this is his right of enjoying sitting with his wife or being served by his wife and allah knows best you"
