  "transcript": "question is I have I often have extreme fear that I have committed kufur or sh and I repeatly recite the shahada and you once told me not to say the shahada unless a scholar confirms that the situation was actually kufur or SH now I have written down so many situations in my notes app that I can no longer keep up up with all the questions every day I experience situation where extremely afraid of dying as disbeliever I never had such fear before I also suffer from terrible thoughts about Allah okay then should I do you you I would highly advise you to take a counseling session with me where we can speak about this and clarify all these doubts and as a heads up and I'll tell you what why do you need such a session compare how you are today with how you were three or four years ago and you will find that you are deteriorating and the trajectory of your life is going downhill quickly why simply because Shan has messed up your head you need therapy you need someone to slap you on the face figuratively of course to wake you up and open your eyes and look what shatan is doing to you and this is what we do in our sessions we show people how foolish they are and make them laugh upon themselves Ya Allah I've been doing this this is crazy why was I doing this it's like people who quit smoking 10 20 years later when you say to them you used to smoke he said yeah said how he feels so embarrassed said wah I don't know it was the craziest thing I don't believe that I used to smoke how would I inhale such filth and and things that would make me cough and sick I don't know what use it was to me but I used to do it so they don't believe that they used to do such things likewise in therapy when you show the people the traps of shaan and how he led them to reach such a bad Valley of thoughts about everything they can see clearly and they can open their eyes and avoid this uh"
