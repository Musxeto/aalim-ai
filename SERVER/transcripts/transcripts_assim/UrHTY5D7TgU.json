I didn't get your question. Like, for example, if I'm rinsing my mouth to make sure that it goes from right to left, Where is the riya? What is the meaning of riya? Showing off. Okay, who are you showing off? You're on your own in the toilet. Um, because like, sometimes you know someone might walk in and they see me making rudu. There's no riya in it, Achy. Don't mix apples with oranges. Riya is the intention to show off. Otherwise, you would not have done it. So, yes, if I am doing something in front of people, and I'm doing it to have them impressed by me, otherwise if I were alone, I would not have done it, that would be considered riya. So, all what you're mentioning and talking about is just simply whispers of shaitan in your head. Over and over again, I tell people when they come to me for counseling sessions, and I have hundreds like you. And when they speak, unfortunately they don't hear themselves. So my job is to open their eyes and make them aware of what they're saying. Islam is a religion of ease and simplicity. Is what you're doing related to ease and simplicity? The answer is no. So definitely shaitan is messing up with your head. What to do, Shaykh, when I have OCD? Simple, five letter word. Ignore. But I can't, it's compelling. It's not compelling. Just shrug your shoulders and move on. If you insist, then it's you who's causing this, not shaitan. Shaitan has no control over you. Allah mentioned in Surat Ibrahim chapter 14, verse 22, shaitan declares it in hell and says, I had no control over you except to call me and to call you, and you responded and answered me. Simple as that. Shaitan has no control over you. No one has. So it's your own doing. You have only yourself to blame, as shaitan stated in this ayah, falat al-umuni, walumu anfusakum, don't blame me, rather blame yourselves."
