  "transcript": "peace of Allah and blessings of Allah beond peace of Allah and blessings of Allah Beyond a prophet beond peace of and blessings of dear brothers and sisters in Islam in continuation to our talk yesterday we're still discussing the issue of repentance and the importance of repentance in Islam and the origin of our discussion was the Hadith of the mercy sent to mankind sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam when he said oh people repent to Allah and seek his forgiveness for I Repent to Allah and seek his forgiveness every day a 100 times and also the Hadith of Allah be pleased with him and with his father he says that we used to count in a single gathering with the prophet Alat that he says a 100 times oh Allah forgive me and repent upon me for you are the most uh uh to accept repentance and the most merciful and we spoke yesterday if you recall about that Allah's beautiful names and attributes are a description of Allah the almighty and among them is that he's most forgiving and that he accepts those who repent so he loves it when people repent to him the prophet saidat had you not sinned and then sought Allah's forgiveness Allah would have taken you away and exchang you with people who would sin and seek his forgiveness so that he would forgive them and this beautiful Hadith illustrates that Allah loves to forgive not that Allah loves sins this is wrong no one should think this Twisted way and goes out to send saying that Allah loves us to sin no Allah says inat that he abhor sin and disbelief however what he loves is when his servant seeks forgiveness when his servant repents to him and this is why Allah Asel one of his beautiful attributes is joy and happiness and this is unlike the attributes of humans or of his creation because Allah is nothing like anything we can imagine nothing is like Allah the almighty however the prophet gives us the similitude the example the similarity between Allah's happiness and joy when a servant of his repents so the prophet says Allah is more joyful is more happy when his servant repents to him than a person who had all his food and drink on his camel and he was crossing a lonesome desert and he took a short nap only to wake up finding his camel running away he tried to allocate it he looked for it everywhere could not find it so when he was almost certain of dying being weary and tired he put his head on on his hand and lied on the ground certain of dying he took a short nap again but only to wake up this time with his camel next to his head he held it he grabbed it and out of Joy he made a mistake and an error so he said oh Allah all praise be to you you are my servant and I'm your lord he flipped it and this Hadith shows us that Allah is more joyful and happy than the happiness and joy of that person who was almost going to die until he found his ride his food and drink and Allah has the highest example of course this Hadith of how Allah loves repentance all also is extremely important and we always come on and on to this very important topic of those who fight the Muslims and rebel against the rulers and give to other Muslims in this Hadith the man said a statement of kufur when he said oh Allah you are my servant and I'm I am your lord however no one said that he is a cfir why because Tak to get someone out of the loop of Islam requires a number of conditions to be fulfilled among them is knowledge among them is choice that you're not compelled you're not forced but rather you have made that with your own choice and will and there are many conditions and also obstacles have to be removed there might be an obstacle with a person or an individual that prevents us from giving him Tak such as ignorance so if someone does something out of ignorance if someone does something out of an error or a mistake as in the case of this Nomad then this prevents us from giving him takir those who give Tak and accordingly would act upon it to kill people and to take their wealth and to divorce and separate women from their husbands these these terrorists are the best in it and our Prophet Alam ordered us to kill them and he told us that they are the hell of Hellfire they are the dogs of Hellfire so it is important to acquire knowledge because your impulsiveness Your Enthusiasm your love and care to other Muslims can be easily diverted into extremism and fanatism it can be easily diverted with the right people to manipulate your mind in into making you a suicide bomber or into making you someone who gives te to everyone else only to end up himself in Hell asking Allah for forgiveness is a great thing and the prophet told usat that all mankind are sinful so this is in inevitable Allah created us Allah knows our weaknesses and Allah accepts our repentance if we repent and seek his forgiveness all the son of Adam are sinful and the best of sinful are those who repent the prophet saysat so each and everyone must repent and if you don't repent then you're a wrongdoer because you're one of two either you are someone who does not repent which is a wrongdoer or someone who is repenting there isn't any third category Allah says in the Quran and whosoever does not repent then such are indeed they are the wrongdoers so if you do not repent by default you are a wrongdoer and what should I Repent from well Scholars say that there are two types of repentance mandatory repentance and recommended repentance so the mandatory repentance it is mandatory upon you as an individual to repent from committing prohib ited things from doing Haram and you must repent from not abiding or not doing what you are ordered to do the obligations as each and every one of us is instructed to do things and to refrain from things so these two things repentance is mandatory if you do wrong things if you are sinful you have to repent and if you're not fulfilling Allah's commands you're not praying on time you're not fasting you have to repent because what you were ordered and commanded to do you're not doing so this is the mandatory repentance so what is the recommended repentance this is when Allah tells you to do something which is a Sunnah but it's not an obligation and you choose not to do it are you sinful no you're not if I don't want to pray this is a highly recommended Sunnah I don't want to pray it you're not sinful you lose a lot of reward so Allah is recommending us to repent it's not an obligation to repent and pray likewise when Allah tells us not to do something which is usually labeled as Mak not recommended and someone decides to do it so by doing something that is against the Sunnah which is Mak he's not sinful if you enter the Masjid using your left foot you've abandoned the Sunnah you've done something Mak but you're not sinful so it is recommended that you repent from that as well and repentance is not that of a big problem any slave save would repent to his master once he knows that his master forgives sins plus the fact that he acknowledges the sin but the biggest problem is acknowledging the sin see the majority of us if not all when someone comes to me and say she fear Allah and repent to him the first thing that comes into mind repent from what I don't do anything I haven't done any sin so we see ourselves to be sinless and likewise the majority of Muslims when you tell them repent to Allah they think that this is an address to someone else not to them because usually I I don't kill people I don't steal money I don't fornicate I don't drink intoxicants thinking that sinning is only limited in these five or six or seven major sins other than that it's okay not knowing that every step we make we usually make a sin intentionally or unintentionally so the biggest problem the biggest barrier the biggest thing that blocks you from repenting is acknowledging that you are committing a sin it's like when someone is sick and he's been sick for so long once you investigate you find out that this person does not admit that he's sick he refuses to adhere to the fact that he's ill so he's always in Defiance and therefore he would never be treated those who have Jin possession they refuse to go to someone to do R for them or to do R for themselves which is much better so the first step for healing and for your cure is to acknowledge that there is something wrong and the problem with most of us is that we have fallen into the footsteps of Shan in a very strange and invisible fashion steps of Shan are known it's mentioned in the Quran and it is as clear as the sun in broad daylight what are the steps of Shan there's so many and this is not our topic but I'll tell you you out of experience when I do a sin for the first time before doing it and while doing it it is wonderful it is beautiful and I'm having a blast why is that because sins are beautiful this is human nature where is the test if sins were not luring and Design able where is the test if one does not want to fornicate or to drink intoxicants wine or whiskey or whatever and does not have fun in doing weeds where's the test if you can't stop because you simply don't like the taste then there's no test for you because naturally you don't like it but when you do like it then the test is high higher and the reward is greater when you stay away from it so when a person falls into a sin he enjoys it after the sin is over he Bears the consequences of Sorrow shame and remorse it eats up his heart after a while if he doesn't do the necessary measures to get over it by staying away from the places of sin so that it would not reoccur by associating himself with practicing Muslims 24/7 so that he would not be tempted by reciting the Quran the Sunnah gaining knowledge so that he would have the inner force with the grace of Allah to fight it off if he doesn't do these things inevitably he would fall again and also afterwards he would feel the shame the remorse and the embarrassment of doing such a sin but it would be less in degree than the first one and as long as he is still falling into the same sin which is reoccurring on and on and on after a while he finds finds out that the amount of remorse and shame have become insignificant because Shan has controlled his heart and the feeling of Desire is overwhelming to the extent that he reaches a level where he cannot live without that sin where it occupies his mind even when he goes to prayer for Isa he's planning he's thinking how to go back to the sin and unfortunately few years back he was ashamed of doing it now he does it without having any feeling of embarrassment that people would know about it maybe he doesn't show it off but if people knew about it that's okay after a while he would brag about it and come in the open and tell the people yes I'm doing it so what this is uh uh uh Freedom of Choice it's my personal uh uh life I can do whatever I want I'm free no you're not free you're a slave whoever says I'm free we say to him you are a slave and you belong to someone and you are disobeying your master if you're free can you hold up your breath and not breathe for 5 minutes you can't you have to breathe can you stop your heart from beating or pumping blood it's not within your reach so you're not free you have a choice but you're not free so the prophet tells us this in and elsewhere he says all of my um all of the those who believe all the Believers the Muslims are forgiven whoo as easy as that all of our sins are forgiven yes the prophet Alam gives you a card blanch he tells you all of my umah is Forgiven except those who sin publicly and then he elaborates and he says part of sinning publicly is that an individual makes a sin at nighttime and no one knows about it and allaha conceals it however he wakes up in the morning and he tells his buddy he tells his friend didn't you know yesterday I did this and this and this and he exposes his his sin which Allah has concealed over him this person the prophet tells us Allah will not forgive Subhan Allah how many of us sin in the open like this how many of us sit in their convertibles or in a normal sedan or a sports car and raise the volume of the music so the whole neighborhood listens to it I'm exposing my sin if I feel weak and vulnerable and I have to listen to music listen to it on your own put your headsets and listen to it on your own maybe Allah will forgive you maybe Allah will punish you but to go in public and sin like this you've exposed Allah's concealing your sins how many women go not abiding by the hijab and not only that they spend couple hours in front of the mirror before they go out which they never do to their husbands and they lure people with their beauty and charm not knowing that they have exposed their sins and you can go on and on and on so look how a person deteri Ates through Shan in the beginning few years back that sin ate up and consumed his heart with remorse now he has no problem and if someone looks him in the eye say why are you looking at me you have a problem they don't see anymore because Allah has blocked their Vision they blocked his their hearts so many times we go to the Masjid to pray while the is given or the ra the first ra is being performed we hear hear the Salat we hear the thean we hear the recitation of the Quran and you see someone walking in the opposite direction carelessly looking at you as if he's not doing anything you say he said yeah yeah yeah insh in and he smiles and walks away he doesn't feel it because Allah has blocked his vision Allah has tarnished his heart with sins this is not the final obstacle or step of Shan after a while this person who is careless and he does not pay any attention to what people say about him becomes a devoted soldier of Shan becomes one of The Advocates of the devil when he calls others to his sin and you can compare the differ throughout the steps of Shan he used to commit the sin and cry afterwards out of the pain in his heart from this shame and remorse he finds now he is calling people to come and follow him in what he is doing and this is the final stage this is the man who has reached the lowest of all lows he has nowhere else to go he had hit rock bottom there's nowhere else to go except up and this happens with those working in the media unfortunately those artists singers actors dancers working in TV channels broadcasting movies soap opras these guys have reached the Rock Bottom because now they're Advocates of shatan they are tools in the hands of the shatan we are entertaining people to help we are showing them what they love even if it kills them we're providing them with their needs even if it's Haram who cares so if you track the steps of Shan don't look at others and point fingers yeah yeah these are the people of the media the these are the movie makers makers these are the singers and the dancers and don't look at others look at your own self in the mirror and try to figure out what are the steps of shatan you are following because looking at others would not save you on the day of judgment while looking at yourself and analyzing it and correcting any deviancies or any shortcomings this is what will save you on the the day of judgment with the grace of Allah therefore repentance is crucial but what is more crucial is to diagnose the illness to acknowledge that you have fallen into that sin and this is why again and again the prophet tells usat Allah has blocked repentance from everyone who is committing a bid if a person is committing an innovation whether in worship whether in a whether in anything else Allah would not accept his repentance how come she you said yesterday that Allah accepts all those who repent to him even Those who commit shik yes true but this Hadith indicates that Allah has blocked not that Allah did not accept if that innovat would have repented Allah would surely accept his repentance however Allah blocked him meaning that he would not repent because he doesn't feel that he's doing anything wrong and this is the biggest problem those who celebrate the birthday of the Prophet alai they dance and chant and mixed men and women and they claim that they love the prophet it's a clear Innovation any non-muslim would see this the prophet didn't do it the companions didn't do it what are you doing this is innovation however if you go and tell them they would never repent of it said no we're doing something good let's go even further those those people who give Tak to Muslims to the rulers who kill innocent people who slaughter them like sheep even they say they say this doesn't do you any good who burn them alive and the prophet fade from Burn burning people alive who tarnish the reputation of Islam who are SE sex Maniacs all what they care about is to get slaves and concubines Halal Oram this doesn't matter and they kill Muslims indiscriminately if you tell them come and repent what will they say to you you're an Infidel you're a cafer we are on the right track and that is why Allah blocked repentance from them and this is why the prophet tells usam not to communicate with them but rather to kill them because communication with the doesn't pay no matter what you say they're going to turn back at you and say that you are the cfir okay the says all the are cfir the Muslim judges worldwide they're all cfir the mujah factions even they are cfir so who's the only Muslim or not it's me and this is how they go and manipulate the minds of the ignorants who are like them so they go to women in the UK in the US tell them that your husband is a mad he's a cfir and your marriage to him is void so you come to Iraq or come to Syria and we will find you a suitable husband who would be marted and you would be joined in Jenna what kind of a religion is this they separate man from wife for with mere ignorance and they take them and they throw them in fornication and adultery she's an adulteress yeah she they brought a a big Sheik with a big beard and he made them marry she's already married to that Muslim he's cfir who says he's cfir prove it to me all speculations all he say all nonsense but who follows them ignorance should we teach them she Allah Knows Best But the prophet told usam wherever you find them kill them this this is the instruction of the mercy sent to mankind all other factions of the Muslims and the non-muslims you should be merciful to not them you you should kill them okay prophet of Allah what if they kill me the prophet said and the is whoever they kill is the best of Martyrs so Those whom thear kill are the best of Martyrs and whoever kills them they're the worst of the Dead under the heavens and the prophet goes on to sayam they are the dogs of Hellfire they are the dogs of Hellfire they are the dogs of of Hellfire this only shows that all Muslims around the world should make a stance should stand in the face of tyranny should stand in the face of extremism and thear who are professional in killing worshippers in masjids couple of days ago about 50 or more worshippers in Nigeria media in a Masid it's not in a synagogue or in a church or in a temple of the Shia as they all usually justify it's in a Masjid and they're waiting for to break their fast it's m time and someone came in and blew them up to Paradise inshallah we're not sorry for them we know that inshallah they're in Paradise the suici the suicide bomber is in hell with the grace of Allah because he killed himself or she killed herself so such things must be addressed clearly bluntly you have to call a spade a spade you must stand up attack these terrorists not the followers of the Sunnah not the scholars of Islam they don't have any backing of a single scholar of Islam is it possible 1.7 billion not a single scholar of Islam supports them yes because all Scholars are cfir that's figures we as Muslims we have to stand firm against them expose them in social networking in the media in our Gatherings and if we know of someone who may be a little bit inclined to them we have to really address the issue because he's a security threat and this is distinct you can see that from a person who follows the Sunnah and follows the way of the Prophet sallallah alaihi Al wasallam I think it is time for the break but I haven't got the uh sign yet from my control room so I'm going to take the initiative and call this a break and the line inshallah will be open for you to call for your questions I hope your questions are related to the topic and not to Isis and not to anything else so until then I leave you do not not go anywhere and stay tuned asalam alaykum and welcome back I presume that the people are calling but until now uh we have a technical problem I hope it is solved before 3:00 and we can get your questions and meantime uh omim from Saudi Arabia yesterday called and she says that she is in Mecca she's from UK and now she is in Mecca alhamdulillah and uh she prays in zamzam Tower you know the tall buildings where the hotels are and there is a musah there's a prayer Hall but there's so much noise in it so is it permissible for her and her daughter to pray in her room because they can see it's a Haram view uh she can see the uh worshippers Etc first of all the issue of the worshippers praying in a prayer Hall is an issue of dispute some say that this is not permissible because this is too lavish one has to be with the congregation in the Haram but the most authentic opinion is that it is permiss ible due to the fact that the rows of the worshippers are connected and the Hall of the Masjid is full therefore they reach even to the entrance of the building or of the uh Masjid uh of the hotel's uh the zum Tower itself therefore they say that being in congregation in the prayer Hall which is huge is like being downstairs with the worshippers so this is one aspect the second aspect is when you are in your room you're actually not with the congregation because only you and your daughter are there so if anyone asks you can't say I was in the Haram I was praying in the Haram unlike the one in the prayer Hall or the Mah of the towers because it's so huge and there's so many Muslims with you so they're being with you you're praying with them as if you're praying downstairs and therefore you cannot pray my sister in your room with your daughter you have to either go downstairs to the Masjid itself to the Haram itself or go to uh the musah and the prayer Hall um says that I'll be staying for a few weeks so should I pray the Sunnah itself now we know that the prophet sallallahu alaih Al wasallam when he traveled he prayed or actually let me phrase that when the prophet sallallahu alhi wasallam traveled he skipped and this is what was reported to us he did not skip anything else so he used to maintain praying the two before and he maintained praying night prayers not only that he used to also offer a lot of voluntary prayers while traveling so all of this means that you as a traveler Should Skip these and but recite and perform uh everything else as usual her third question was how uh should she give zakat in mecah and where to do that in mecah it is the easiest thing to give zakat to in Zam Zam Tower itself as you're going down in the last 10 nights of Ramadan you will find a lot of small Huts that offer this and they will take the money and they will will inshallah uh give it on your behalf uh if you just ask the reception he would show you inshallah without any problem send out from Saudi yes yes we are praying for you for Almighty Allah to give you more knowledge give you wisdom and then give you strength because our the youth the Muslim youth are doing and the various parts of the world in fact we are all not happy of that okay so if you are if you talk about their issue that is a very good thing for for us um very quickly I have this problem um yesterday I mentioned to you you know on Sunday uh you talk a little on sh and then kuf and and then I was trying to say that in Africa this is a very very big challenge for Muslims and Muslims and you know a Muslim he has other things that he do besides the de he believes in in Magic and when he has a problem and then he go to a magician and this is very very prevailing in Africa okay so I try to say that if D is from Saudi Arabia goes to Africa and they should make it point to emphasize on sh in Africa I'm not talking about Saudi Arabia I talk about Africa if die from Saudi Arabia goes to Africa they should emphasize more on sh because our people are in very very deep deep deep deep in okay yes and then yes that is the the issue that I have like I have my brothers um they have they have they have sh they have things like armless they have talisma and then I said these things that you have they put it on their their hands and then they put it on their waist and then they prevent them for some problem okay sow any more questions I I got your question inshah yes yes okay from Saudi Arabia okay I think we losta uh um from Saudi Arabia yesterday said that the Indians pray three similar to when they conclude their prayer with wi so is this authentic this is the hanafi mhab the Hani school of thought unlike the majority of Muslims and this is wrong because the prophet ordered us not to make the wit similar to M and Scholars say that this means that you must not sit except in the third raak so offering witer in three R has two types either you pray two Ras like any Sunnah you conclude it with Salam and then you stand up to pray a single ra and you conclude it with t and Salam or you pray three Ras with one in the second ra you stand up and then the third ra you sit for and you offer so it is not similar to uh what is known as so this is the and this is the right thing to do we have uh Fara from Ghana yes yes what can I do for you please I said I'm pregnant can I fast okay any more questions no okay I will answer you inshallah Fatima from Saudi Alum how are you I'm fine alhamdulillah thank you for answering my other question the other day yes what can I do for you I have two questions again um I have this maid she comes to our house twice a week and we're not sure if she's Muslim because every time she like she doesn't pray during prayer she's just sitting over there and she's with us like about 3 years now and my mom wanted to know if she can give her sodaka okay and my second question is that um we're in this ladies Association and every month each member pays 20 R each and once in a year they will distribute the money and they will lend everyone the money and some get 5,000 and some get 3,000 depending on how long you stayed in the group but they wanted to increase the money we get so every time we pay they we pay back we have to the ones who pay 3,000 adds 300 and the ones who pay 3,000 adds 500 um but you can get your money back if you want anytime so I don't know adding this money I don't know if it's okay now at the end result you will get what you have deposited or you will get something a little bit extra you you'll get what you have deposited but but the money is yours yeah I I I understand but if I uh contributed with 5,000 then put 500 extra the end result I will draw what is only mine nothing else right yes yes you get the same amount okay and this is not to help others in crisis or something it's just a form of depositing money yeah yeah exactly like read the T in Salat or out of the Salat out Salat out Sal sh okay inshallah okay uh we have SRA from Saudi asalam alikum yes I have one question yes um when praying with in congregation behind the Imam uh we he mostly prays um two raas and then and then one Raa on its own but sometimes he may change and then he may pray all the three continuously without sitting for T in the second ra so my question is since we have to make the intention of which type of f are we I mean how are we going to pray before praying so what should Our intention be because we don't know whether he's going to pray this way or that way I understand your question any more questions uh no thank you you're welcome uh rwan from Saudi Arabia yesterday said can a person makes make a for two people and I tried to inquire from him but I don't think he understood my uh question so I'll explain if I want to go tonight and make a um for my father and for my mother or for my grandfather and for my grandmother who were deceased in the same um this is invalid I can make at a time for one person but if I go and make it from my grandfather and come back and tomorrow night I do another one for my grandmother and come back this is permissible inshallah uh Sinda was saying that the issue of shik and sending di I answered this question my my brother yesterday and I said that all Muslims from uh uh Saudi Arabia who are educated here have the basics of the issues of and they know exactly everything about tment and UMAS and Etc so by going to Africa they are well equipped however the problem is not in them the problem is that the people there do not accept what the people from Saudi Arabia preach because they follow the Quran and the Sunnah while the people there follow their rulers and M pastors and leaders and and and clergymen who control them so that they control them with these fabricated things not by the Quran and Sunnah the beauty of Islam that it is the religion of the Layman anyone in the street can come and read the Quran and the Sunnah and understand the religion of Allah there are things that he has to ask the scholars but not the majority Allah says ask those who have knowledge if you do not know but the majority of things it's Crystal Clear for people so I second your call I would love to see uh um diis coming from Saudi Arabia and going throughout the world to preach Islam from the Quran and Sunnah and not the political Islam but rather the Real Islam unfortunately maybe financial resources or any other reasons May prevent them from this HUD from bahin hello alayum how are you I'm fine z uh I have three questions here yes uh one uh because I am Muslim from philippin so there we are used to pray uh every Friday in the maid it can allowed to pray the jeur after jum uh do you go as a woman to pray Friday prayer in the Masjid and afterwards you want to pray yeah okay any more questions so and second question uh I just want to know how many uh sunah we use to pray for jur assar or Isa time okay and uh one uh and the last yes and the last question MH uh it is uh true that uh the lady Muslim is not allowed to get married with the Christian man okay okay thank you sh you're quite welcome only that we have no one okay um okay fiara from Ghana says that she's pregnant can she fast the answer is yes if you're not afraid for your health or for the well-being of your uh fetus or your uh baby that you can easily fast and this is highly recommended but if you're too weak and too fragile or the doctor says that this is endangering your uh pregnancy in this case you may skip it you have the excuse but if you can fast without any harm on you yes you may do that Fatima says that they have a maid that comes once a week and she doesn't pray and they don't know if she's a Muslim or not you should ask her if she's been working with you for two years and you have the mus Quran lying around and the prayer mats Etc at least you should know whether she's a Muslim or not if she's not you can give her DAW and call her to Islam if she is a Muslim you can invite her to pray with you so that you can make her practice bit by bit and you will get her reward as for giving her charity charity is not zakat zakat is a different thing charity is a general uh money you give to anyone and you can also give it to a disbeliever or a non-muslim there's no problem in that the problem is with zakat money she says um they have a scheme and this is something that is found usually in most communities where a group of people let's say 10 of them agree to contribute a certain money amount let's say a thousand R so this the total uh uh amount is 10,000 and each month one of them gets to get the whole thing so the first one let's assume I'm the first one the first month today I gave them a th and I got 9,000 so I have 10,000 of my own I can do business I can do something and the over the nine months coming nine months I will be giving 1,000 each so whatever I I put in I get back not a single real more or not a single real less is this permissible this is permissible this is not borrowing or a loan this is simply a form of deposit that people collaborate to help one another with someone like me for example I want to have the last payment the 10th month why because if I don't save my money I'm going to waste it so by giving a th000 every month I'm depositing it depositing it so after 10 months I have a lumpsum that I can use and this is my money there's nothing wrong with that inshallah Victoria says what's the ruling on reciting Twi from uh while holding mus if you're on your own there's no problem in that this helps you to look into the Quran and to read more and to go on no problem insh she says can I read recitation the commentary of T of the Quran outside of uh the Salat definitely what is not permissible is to read the commentary or the translation in the Salat this is totally prohibited you have to read it in Arabic the Quran cannot be recited except in Arabic and you cannot read anything else in another language while uh related to the Quran or to the of the Salat it has to be in Arabic outside of the Salat the sky is the limit you can read it in Arabic in your own language there's no problem in that at all cnra from Saudi Arabia she says sometimes when we pray with the Imam we follow the Imam so sometimes he and most often he prays two rakas concludes it and one ra and concludes it so this is the norm of praying witer the usually but there are nights without any notice he just stands SS up to the third ra instead of sitting for so what about our intention your intention is to follow the IM your intention as a worshipper as a m is to follow the Imam so if the Imam for example prays 13 Ras instead of 11 no problem I'm following and when he makes Witter I don't have to have the intention because my intention is related to the intention of the IM if all of a sudden from 11 he jumps to 23 no problem I'm following until he concludes his witer and Allah knows best HUD from bahin she says that can I pray Friday prayer and after I finish it I pray four the answer is no this is an innovation this is totally unacceptable and I've seen this in some countries like turkey and in uh Croatia Slovenia because they follow the Hani maab and I think they have something in their maab which says that Friday can only be performed after or behind the great Imam the ruler of the country and hence because he's not leading the prayer so we pray J just like that and afterwards we pray so what are you doing you're playing around why did you pray jum to begin with this is nonsense this is not part of the Sunnah I don't know if this is part of their uh uh school of thought or not though I doubt it that definitely Abu hanifah would not say anything may Allah have mercy on his soul and be pleased with him he would not say anything similar to that these are the generations who came after him who were blind followers and who would just say Simon says follow or go to hell there's nothing like that if you pray Friday then this does the job you must not pray if you miss Friday you must prayor prayer and Allah knows best she says can you explain to me the Sunnah prayer of and the Hadith tells us that whoever prays 12 Ras during the day and night Allah would build him a house in paradise and in theith ofab may Allah be pleased with her she tells that these 12 Ras are two before four before two by two two after two after and two after so to answer your question is four before and two after there isn't a recommended for there is a voluntary four before it if you wish but it's not part of the 12 Ras and is two afterwards her third question was that is it true that Muslim women cannot marry non-muslims and the answer is yes this is mentioned in black and white in the Quran Allah says do not give your daughters in marriage to the disbelievers the idol worshippers and a servant a slave who's black and believing is far better than an non uh Muslim or a disbeliever whom you may like his uh face body or wealth and also in Allah says do not give them back that is the Muslims who revert to Islam do not give them back to their husbands and they should not uh take them back as well so a Muslim man can marry only a Jew a Christian or a Muslim woman nothing else and if he does marry anything else this is not a marriage this is fornication and the marriage is void it's invalid a Muslim woman cannot marry any anyone except a Muslim man and this is the consensus of all Scholars and all women Muslim women who are married to non Muslims they are dis believing in the Quran and they are either two either they are adulteresses and fornicators or they are disbelievers if they think that their marriage is valid and they have a legitimate life this is all the time we have until we meet tomorrow same time I leave you peace of Allah and blessings of Allah beond peace of Allah and blessings of Allah Beyond Prophet Beyond mam love"
