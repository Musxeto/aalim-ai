  "transcript": "I have a group of friends who are participating in a football tournament that has an entry fee and also um prizes at the end which I understand is it comes under the um ruling of gambling uh so I will be participating in this and what I offered was to pay for all of them on their behalf and I thought that would lift the burden off of them but then I realized it won't the burden off of me so in this case is the only way to make this Halal is if I withdraw from the competition and then pay for them because if I don't do that most likely they will continue with the tournament and just pay themselves so they will continue with this sin of course you have done wrong by uh participating or by paying off the entry fee on their behalf and this is totally wrong you have to uh ask Allah for forgiveness and with withdraw from this competition altogether and if you can take your money uh from them uh that would be the right thing to do if not then just repent and show remorse and there would be no sin on you but from now on you should have asked before attempting to do such a Haram action from uh without inquiring about the permissibility of it and Allah Knows Best"
