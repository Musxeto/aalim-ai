  "transcript": "[Music] all Allah competing is a concept firmly based in Islam Allah Asel had ordered us to compete in the Quran so did the prophet sallallah wasam and Life as we know it is a place of competition so we live in this life competing with others trying our level best to reach the ultimate goal which is to strive in seeking Allah's uh uh uh pleasure and reaching however this is not an easy task and it can have things that would tarnish it things that would make it unacceptable at the side of Allah and it is best that we try our level uh uh best to go through things that motivat motivate us to do good deeds for example Allah the almighty has told us after mentioning the things that are in Jenna and how the righteous people would enjoy it Allah says so let all as Sprints Aspire after that let those who compete compete in that which means that Allah is encouraging us to compete in seeking paradise and such a competition would help the Muslim to strive to Allah because there will be hurdles in front of him as in every race there will be difficulties there will be challenges the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam said this in an authentic Hadith he said race in doing good deeds what are we racing against oh prophet of Allah the prophet saidat race against patches of Dark Night calamities that are as dark as the night where a Believer wakes up as a mmin as a Believer and by the end of the day he becomes cfir the prophet Alat wasam also advised us and instructed us to make five before five to utilize five before five he said utilize your youth before your old age and your health before your illness and your richness before your poor uh poverty and your free time before you get occupied and your life before your death all of this is encouragement for us to strive and to compete the prophet Alam ordered us to make Jihad to strive in his cause in Allah's cause and he said whoever dies and does not go for Jihad or battle and does not even talk about it with himself or aspire to it then he will die on a branch of hypocrisy and that is why the companions understood this Whenever there was a battle with the prophet they were they used to compete to participate in it to the extent that even youngsters as young as 13 and 14 would come to fight with the prophet alham and he would not admit only only them he would admit only those who were 15 and in one incident a companion who was 14 who was rejected by the prophet Alat wasam when he saw that a friend of his who was 15 was admitted and was allowed to fight he cried so the prophet told him why are you crying he said because you admitted my friend who 15 and I am stronger than him and I can win him in wrestling so the prophet allowed them to wrestle and when the 14-year-old companion won he admitted him to battle so even such competition is encouraged in Islam also giving in charity and to spend when you're young before you are old to spend in the cause of Allah while you are alive before your illness and before dying this is highly recommended and it is encouraged upon and this is why the companions may Allah be pleased with them used to compete against one another they came to the prophet wasam once the poor Companions and they said oh prophet of Allah the wealthy Among Us have gone with the highest degrees and the highest levels of Jenna because they pray like we pray and they fast like we fast but they have access of wealth that they can offer Hajj with they can offer omah with they can offer Jihad with and they can give in charity more than what we can give so the prophet told them and instructed them to give uh or to say after every F prayer the supplication we know Subhan Allah 33 times alhamdulillah 3 33 times Allah abbar 33 times and to complete the 100 so even the poor were competing with the rich Abu Bakr and Omar they used to compete with one another and Omar once said to himself today I will beat Abu Bakr in charity every time Abu Bakr beats me today I'm going to beat him so he went and collected half of his wealth 50% of all what he owns and he went to the prophet Alat and said oh prophet of Allah this is a charity so the prophet saidat wasam may Allah bless you what did you leave for your family so the prophet the Omar said uh what's equivalent to what you see oh prophet of Allah so the prophet understood that he gave away 50% of his possession and a while later Abu Bakr came with a big sack with a big bundle and he put it in front of the Prophet Alam and the prophet said Abu Bakr what did you leave for your family and Abu Bakr said I left for them Allah and his messenger which means that he gave away all what he owns all of his wealth Omar said at that incident wall by Allah I will never compete with you Abu Bakr because whoever competes with you will always lose this shows us that they used to compete with one another and reach ing Allah's pleasure also among the doors or the opportunities for competing is to go to the five daily prayers and to hasten in going early to Friday prayers and we know that men are obliged to pray Friday prayers in the Masjid unlike women and the prophet gave them a competition so he said whoever goes in the first hour he would be as if he has provided or given away a camel in charity and whoever goes in the second hour then it would be like a cow then it would be like a sheep then in the fourth hour like a chicken in the fifth and last hour it would be like an egg when and when the Imam enters the masjids then the Angels would fold their uh record books and they would sit and listen to the Imam we also know that it is part of Islam to try and win few of the things related to prayer for example the prophet saidat had the people known what virtues are there in the first row and in giving the aan the call for prayer they would fight over it and they would draw Lots or flip a coin so that they would decide which one or who would get this reward unfortunately nowadays if you enter a Masjid before Salah you will find the people filling the rows at the back of the Masjid and they are not interested in occupying the first Ro which the prophet Alam has encouraged us to do of course let alone if you ask someone to call the aan the majority of Muslims would refrain being shy being ashamed or not knowing how to perform the aan but if they were requested to be a guest on uh uh uh American uh Got Talent OR American Idol or whatever shows to sing a song or to do something they would love to compete in that Subhan Allah the prophet Alat also said to us that this dun is sweet and green this incident was when the prophet Alam got some zakat money and some booties of war and it was collected at night so when the companions heard about it may Allah be pleased with them after fer prayer when the prophet finished the congregation and turned to face them each one of them you know stretched his neck a little bit so that the prophet would see him and would not forget him when he did distributed these uh uh great wealth or this great wealth so the prophet addressed them and he said to them that do you think I am I was going to forget you this life this world is beautiful it is sweet and green and Allah will make you succeed one another so that he would test you and he would try you and he would see what you will do in it so fear or uh uh uh protect yourself from this dun and protect yourself from women because the first tribulation the first trial of the sons of Israel was in women and this shows you the great threat and the warning that the prophet Alat is warning us of when we have mixing between the genders as we see it nowadays also in theith of abdah may Allah be pleased with him telling us and showing us how the prophet Alam never competed over material things see he warns us from Dunya and he does not indulge in it because he's our role model the prophet once wasam slept on a bed of straw that affected his side and it left marks on it so they suggested that they would give him a better bed and the prophet said what do I do what do I have to do with this Dunya in this life I'm merely similar to a rider who on his trip saw a tree so he dismounted and took a short nap in the shade of that tree and then he left it so the tree is not our objective this life is not a muslim's objective the prophet said to IB Omar his brother-in-law and one of the great Companions of the Prophet Alam he said be in this life as if you are a stranger or a passer by so we should not live in this Dunya as if we are here to stay we are or not it's a temporary phase and the smart one is the one who is Guided by Allah to do good deeds and to reap the fruit of his work in paradise and whenever it comes to competing we always have to remember that what we do is for the sake of Allah and not for this D the prophet saidat said that there is no Envy except in two things someone whom Allah has given him the knowledge of the Quran so he recites it during the night and the day and someone who Allah has given him wealth and he is spending it in means that pleases Allah so you can have envy and envy here does not mean you wish that Allah takes it away from him and gives it to you no this is not the Envy uh uh uh mentioned or meant it the one the envy that is meant is the Envy of wanting to have similar to it but without it leaving an individual so Envy which is Haram is when I see you driving a beautiful car and I envy you and I say you don't deserve this I wish Allah takes it from you or you have a car accident this is Haram but the envy that is permissible is that when you wish that you have something similar to it so the prophet says even the Envy of wanting to have a similar car to your neighbor without him losing it this is not recommended and it is not encouraged because it is in worldly Affairs and worldly matters the only envy that is permissible is in the case of someone who has knowledge you envy him wanting to be like him without him losing his knowledge or with a wealthy person you want to be like him to spend in the cause of Allah and not to spend on uh worldly matters so competing that we are looking at has to be accompanied by a good intention meaning that I compete with you in prayers I compete in you the numbers of days fasting I compete with you in charity I compete with you in the number of Hajj but the most important thing is that my intention is for the sake of Allah because when when I compete with you in religious issues and my intention is to beat you not for the sake of Allah but rather just to win then this is a big problem the prophet saidat Allah the almighty says I am the wealthiest of all Partners whoever associate anyone with me I will leave him and his shik I will leave him and his bad deed because he Associated others with me in his intention so we understand from this that you must have you're competing with a sincere intention for the sake of Allah otherwise do not compete with others secondly your competition and the the way what you're doing has to be in things that deal with the Hereafter not with this dun so you don't compete with others in getting a better job or marrying the most beautiful wife or collecting money and being richer than others or having more children than others no this is not what is intended because such competition leads to destruction the prophet saidat wasam when the companions may Allah be pleased with them saw these bounties of war and he they saw the money and they were hoping to get part of it the prophet said told them be positive hope for the best and and inshallah nothing would happen except What You Wish by Allah the prophet says I do not fear Poverty of upon you what I fear is that this Dunya would open upon you like it was opened for those before you and I'm afraid that you will compete in this Dunya in this world like they have competed and that it would destroy you like it had destroyed them and one would say Subhan Allah this goodness this wealth this dun would it bring harm to us the answer is yes and this is the trial of Allah to us Allah has created death and life to test us who is Among Us the best in Deeds not the most in deeds and that is why competing has to be in things that draw you closer to Allah Asel materialistic matters are not of importance in the eyes of Islam that is why the prophet Alat warned us from competing in worldly matters in wishing and hoping and striving for worldly matters in the sense that it would distract us from what we were originally created for and that is to worship Allah the prophet said sallallah alai when one of you looks at those who were favored over him in wealth or in creation meaning in health in Beauty Etc then one should only look at those who are below him whom Allah favored him over them and let's look in materialistic things if I were to look if I look at those who are better than me richer than me wealthier than me healthier than me then I would always be dissatisfied I will never be content why if I have a jet plane and I see someone who has five jet planes this means that we're all multi-billionaires but still I would envy him because he has more if I have a beautiful car but then I see someone who has a us an SUV and a sports car and a sedan then I would envy him because he has more than what I have this way I will always be discontented I will always be uh uh unpleased with what I have I have two healthy children my friend has 10 I have a beautiful wife my friend has four I have a good job and my friend has uh uh uh or he's a CEO of five companies so I'm always envious I'm always sad and this is what the prophet is warning us from sallallahu alaihi wasallam if you have a car don't look at those who have two cars look at those who do not have a car and they ride a motorcycle and if you ride a motorcycle look at those who don't have a motorcycle and they they are riding a bicycle and if you have a bicycle praise Allah and thank him because others don't have a bicycle and they walk and if you don't have a bicycle and you have only your feet to use be grateful to Allah because there are people who are on their Wheelchairs and cannot walk and if you are on your wheelchair be grateful and praise Allah the almighty because there are people who are paralyzed neck down and they are bed readen and even if you are bed readen be always grateful to Allah asael that you have your sanity and that you have your brains and that you praise Allah thank him and be grateful for him so always look at the opp the positive side always look at the full half of the cup and be grateful to Allah Asel as his favors upon you are unlimited so if we take this concept of sincerity and the concept of competing in the Deeds of the Hereafter if we do this then we will excel in doing good deeds and we will keep on competing with one another not necessarily naming people and say telling them listen at the end of the week I'd like to see how many Good Deeds you have no this is not the way of competing but rather if I know that my friend prays night prayer and I don't I will compete with him without telling him by starting tonight to offer night prayer if my friends fasts Mondays and Thursdays when I don't then I will try next week to fast Mondays and Thursdays and maybe add to that the three white days of the month so that when the time comes on the day of judgment I would be inshallah with the grace of Allah having a lot of good deeds needs to help me in my grave and also when I stand in front of Allah the almighty and Allah Knows Best"
