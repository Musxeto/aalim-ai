  "transcript": "oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] alhamdulillah and welcome to lessons in the chapter we are studying is the chapter ofan the call for prayer and the Hadith we have that we begin our program with is Hadith number 156 brother Muhammad narrated by Allah's messenger said to B when you announce the aan deliberately and when you pronounce the quickly and leave between your aan and your time for one who is eating to finish his food he also reported from Abu the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam said no one should announce aan except the one who has performed the ablution he he also reported from zad bis Allah's messenger Sall alaih wasallam said the one who announces the aan should also pronounce theama narrated Abdullah Bin said in another narration of the Hadith reported by Abu da I saw it thean in a vision and I wanted to announce it Allah's messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam said you pronounce the okay thank you and unfortunately all what we've heard was unauthentic so the four virgins are all unauthentic it's weak so we don't have to apply them we don't have to elaborate on them nevertheless the first one tells us that should be quick and aan should be slow the reason because aan we want it to reach as much as possible and as far as possible while is to declare that it's time for prayer and everyone should be in the Masjid at the at the time of the so there's no need to raise the voice and there's no need to make it in a slow tone as they're all ready and prepared to pray uh the second Hadith it says that it's not forbidden it's it is forbidden for a person who is not to perform aan which means that before you call for prayer you have to perform ation and this is not authentic and the scholars say that it is not a must because aan is not uh uh leading the prayer is the call it's a notification so you do not have to be in the state of evolution when you call the aan the third Hadith says that uh uh he who announces thean must announce the but also this is not authentic it's an open uh uh thing if a person makes aan and he allows someone else to make the or the IM instructs another person to make the it it can be easily done and finally the fourth Hadith uh or the version tells us that the prophet allowed Abdullah Zade the person the companion that saw the aan in his dream he allowed him to recite the while the Adan would be for B but again this is not authentic so I don't see any reason for us to go on and to talk about these Hadith does anyone of you have any question okay we move on to the following Hadith Hadith number 157 narrated by abuur be pleas with him Allah's messenger sahu alhi wasallam said the MU has more right to determine the time to n thean and the IM has more right to determine when to pronounce the the muin has the right or has more right to determine the time to announce the aan which means that the Imam is not observing the direction of the Sun and is not paying any attention to whether it's time for aan or not is it time for prayer or not because this is this is the job of the MU so he's the one who's entitled to call for the Adan or not while the Imam is the one who is entitled to tell the MU to make because when the prayer starts it's the mu's job yet the Hadith itself is weak and it's not authentic but the meaning sounds acceptable b b may Allah be pleased with him would not request the prophet Alam to make aan he would observe and when it's time for Salah he would make thean himself but he would never make unless he requests the permission from the prophet so before he goes and visits the prophet in his house and ask him should I make or not and the prophet whether agrees or disagrees with that the following Hadith Hadith number and 58 narrated by Anin Malik Allah's messenger Sall alai wasallam said a supplication made between thean and is not rejected the supplication made between aan and is not rejected and seriously this is one of the greatest Hadith that Muslims should pay attention to now none of us claim to have to not H to have something that he needs everyone in this world has a list of things that he would like them to become true a lot of wishes that he would like them to turn into realities and the best way to make things come true is to go to the source which is Allah Almighty so you have to supplicate you have to make prayer to Allah asael to Grant you what you want and what you need and this cannot happen unless you know the times where Allah accept your supplication and that is why we tend to stay in mosques and tell people to stay in mosque between and so if we try to figure out in very quickly what are the times that are most likely for Allah Asel to answer your question the times sometimes in the middle of the night until middle of the night be more specific uh the I don't know for after middle not uh until down prayer no uh F third third of the night the first one the third third of the night so the last third the last third of the night of the night this is the time where Allah descends and asks are there any people seeking forgiveness that I forgive them are there any people that are asking me or requesting me to give them something so that I could give them uh uh Abu Malik well the times also is when when it's raining now the time when it's raining though this was mentioned by may Allah have mercy on his soul in his book yet it was regarded as it's not authentic and this was regarded by the scholars of Hadith so this does not count though reigning itself is a blessing of Allah do you know what the prophet Sall wasallam used to do when it rained Mustafa I think he he used to be worried no no no on the contrary uh must he used to come out and perform uh and drink from this rain drink no noik he would take what he had in his house out into the rain again no no F perform Sal no because Sal shuk actually is also not authentic it's very easy it's reported in s Muslim that whenever it rained the prophet Sall wasallam went out in the rain and exposed some of his body to that train and he would tell his companions that this this grain is near to from Allah it came from heaven and it's a blessing from Allah subhana wa tala and it shows that the prophet sallam whatever is close to Allah he would most likely like and expose himself to so this is what the prophet Sall wasallam used to do in Rain not to pray not to supplicate but to expose himself now this does not mean you have to soak yourself uh uh uh in the rain but it the first drops of the rain it's it's a Sunnah that you expose yourself to some of it um any other times of aadi uh in the Caba by the door called Babel mm this is again it's not it's not a time it's a location so we're talking about time but to embrace one's uh uh self or to to to put oneself chest and stomach to the Kaa and embrace Alam where the door is of the Kaa there is no authentic Hadith uh confirming this otherwise people would fight like crazy and kill each other they do well this is wrong is the the Hadith is not authentic so we do not uh uh do it I'm talking about times times and positions not necessarily locations uh uh Mustafa there's an hour in Friday where supplication would be accepted and excellent and when is this hour there is about 17 different opinion of Scholars but the most authentic one is in the of the No No that's one of the opinions the the the time of is like before M prayer a few few hours before M prayer it is the last hour hour of the day of Friday which is just before the sunset of Friday uh any time else for Abu Malik in prostration to do it in prostration the Hadith English I don't remember in English the closest a person is to his Lord to Allah is in the prostration position so if you can ask and pray to Allah as much as you can because Allah will answer your call after the final excellent the after the final T just before concluding your prayer just before T after you finish all the T and the Salat on the prophet Alam you make prayer because the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said that you may choose whatever you like from prayer so you should try your best and uh make supplication to Allah uh anything else do and those times include and and I mean well well you've you you've gathered everything that we know huh you you thrown everything that we know whatever these days have like of course of course and and the reason behind this is what AA may Allah be pleased with her said that oh prophet of Allah that if I am if I succeed in in seeing what should I say so he taught her application I'm afraid we have to stop here but we will be inshallah right back ask Huda dear brothers and sisters welcome to a new edition of ask Huda I have two questions please go ahead you can read it in Arabic and you can also understand meaning in your own language the different and interpretation of the meanings of the Quran are available in almost every language that exist on Earth by the grace of Allah the water of zamzam is for whatever intention you drink it with from Egypt his father has the way and he asked about how can he help him very good question can be give to any of the or the act of worship is a part of the unity of worship has to be paid to Allah subhana wa tala and in accordance with the guidance of his Prophet s [Music] and welcome back just before the break we were talking about the times that it's preferable that you make supplication to Allah so that Allah will answer your call so do we have any other comments uh brother Abu Malik yeah I just had one more time that we forgot to explain y again this is one of the times that the prophet Sall wasallam asked us instructed us to do as much as supplication as possible on that day and there are so many other times and and we can find a lot of them brother Mustafa yes um we see a lot of brothers uh between andan and they don't do Dua and when it come when after they finish the prayer after the the has went and we finished prayer they start doing thean the Dua so so what do you advise this is an issue that a lot of the scholars had uh uh argued about which is what's the ruling on supplication after you conclude your prayer now IB T says may Allah have mercy on him that the place of Supplication is before T after T is the place of VI where you say subh alhamdulillah allahar and the that comes afterwards a lot of the Muslims do this common mistake which is that after they finish their prayer they raise their hands and start to supplicate and they usually have something that they've memorized by heart and you they just repeat it and then some of them wipe their faces some go to the extent of wiping their whole bodies of as if they're bathing and I've seen so many weird stuff in my life from the brothers after Salah there are brothers that immediately after tlim they would put their hands on their heads and I I kept watching the brothers say are you afraid of UFOs you going to fly or what why do you put your hand on your head said no I'm making vicker what kind of vicker is that this is an inovation did the prophet do itam did the companions do it if they did we do it we follow suit but if not then this is an innovation it's not acceptable other people have seen this that after uh they finish their prayer they kiss the thumbs of their their thumbs and they wipe their eyes three times now this is really you know strange and and and so you go to the guy say dude what are you doing he said well if you say Allah Muhammad three times and you rub your eyes then you will not be become blind wow that that's cool but again do you have any evidence that I can do this share it with you said Yeah well my she said so Word of Mouth I've I've heard it somewhere I don't know where was it I think maybe radio Israel well you got your information from the wrong Source my friend you have to have authentic Hadith to apply this and it goes on and on and on and it's very simple and easy follow the footsteps of the Prophet Alam you will be with him on the day of judgment so as brother Mustafa has noted and it's correctly uh uh uh observed that there are people between and sit idle and doing nothing in the mosque maybe just watching People's go by here and there maybe the best of them would recite the Quran which is a sacred and an excellent thing to do but immediately after prayer is over they start to supplicate and there's nowhere in the Sunnah where it says that after prayer supplication is accepted nowhere while the Hadith we are reading now it tells us that the supplication between the and is not rejected so you're instructed to do this now do we have any other yes brother question about supplication during prostration you find that many people for example they elongate prostration a lot even after the IM comes up say to say that they elongate the prostration okay for a very huge length of time and then after that when they come up and they say like have the and says and then they extend their their prayer is this right or is it wrong now there are two questions here one what's the ruling I'm I'm not going anywhere just sitting uh what's the ruling on prolonging your prayer after the Imam has finished he made the T he concluded his prayer but you still want to do more supplication and add some more what's your ruling on this and the second question was what's your ruling on prolonging the prostration though you are following an Imam and the Imam has from the prostration position and now he is in the sitting position and yet still you still have like 20 to 30 seconds left of Supplication you don't want to interrupt that to answer the first question prolonging the prayer after the Imam has concluded it the scholars say it's okay because by concluding the prayer you are not missing anything if you PR long it a little bit because eventually you're going to conclude it what's not permissible is during the prayer that you prolong one of the Deeds of the Salah and not follow the Imam as in the position where you prostrate and you continue to prostrate while the Imam has raised from that position and uh is going to the other uh place of prayer do you get my point why is that simply because the prophet Sall wasallam has instructed us and said if the if the IM bows you bow immediately if he raises his head you raise your head immediately if he prostrates you prostrate immediately if he sits between prostration you sit immediately so prolonging it would be def will will be disobeying the order or instructions of uh uh the prophet Alat wasam at the very end the prophet did not say when he saysay you conclude the prayer with him no this this was left open so this same question was asked to Sheikh bin Bas may Allah have mercy on him and he answered that it's okay to prolong the prayer after is it's incl concluded and there's nothing uh uh wrong in that um any more questions yes nor I have some question connected to it supplications uh what a supplication a supplication that sometimes wasallam do after prayer or after prayer no no sometimes sometimes do the prophet Salli wasallam what was reported to us we have like books of supplications he would say and so on uh there's so many of them you just cannot list them but you personally may ask Allah whatever you want whether in Arabic or in English or in any language you wish you pray to Allah and ask him whether from this life or for forgiveness and Paradise of the Hereafter uh uh FDI yeah I was wondering we just talked about the times where it's preferable to perform supplication and the could be answered but if we perform supplication in in other times is it not not permissible like for instance after during r or when you stand up from r or after or anytime during prayer is it permissible or not no it's not permissible unless it was mentioned To Us by the prophet Alam for example it's permissible for us whenever the Imam recites a verse of the Quran and in the verse of the Quran and it talks about hell or punishment and you say I seek refuge in Allah Asel or it talks about paradise and reward and you say and you say I seek Allah's generosity this is permissible uh but when you are in the r position there are certain when you are in the Bowing position there are certain supplications that the prophet told us to do and so on to come and intervene and say something out of it supplication like oh God uh uh guide my CH my children to be good Muslims here is wrong yes because it's not a position for supplication as for the r the prophet says you may glorify Allah in the ru position in the suud on the contrary the prophet tells us sallallahu alaih Al wasallam that we should ask Allah we should supplicate to Allah we should call Allah as much as we want that is why it's preferable that one limits himself to the positions that we were instructed by the prophet Sall wasam brother Mustafa um is it permissible to memorize the supplications of certain people other than the Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam under repeat them now again this is a a problem that uh many people ask about what do we mean by supplication of people for example I read this Dua it's a supplication and I trace this Dua this has not been said by the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam nor his companions it was written by she so and so the words are very nice you know they rhyme they are close to your heart and they're beautiful now for us to do it it's okay but for us to think it's a Sunnah it's wrong for us to spread it among people it's wrong because then it would be misunderstood and thought to be of some significance for you to pray to Allah saying any type of Dua is is acceptable therefore if you see something and you like it and you think that it has some magnific magnificence to it and it may be nice to pray it's okay but don't spread it don't write it down and give it to people and don't assume that it is better than the Sunnah because always the Sunnah is much much better nevertheless sometimes one of us would like to call Allah because is all what we say in accordance to what's the prophet s wasallam Hadith no when you say oh Allah make my wife happy and make her satisfied with all the money that I have is this from the Sunnah is it is it allowed for me to pray like this supplicate yes then likewise if I read something that a she or an IM wrote and I like it I may say it but I may not spread it so so that people would not confuse it to Sunnah and start to recite it thinking that it has certain powers connected to it I may not also think that it is better than the Sunnah because nothing definitely is better than the Sunnah the Hadith of anas Malik we did not go through it completely though this episode this program was lost not in Translation but it was lost in and answering all the different uh questions I have one issue left but unfortunately I don't think we have the time for it for today's program therefore until we meet next time [Music] a [Music] [Music] oh [Music]"
