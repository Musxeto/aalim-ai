  "title": "Buying and Selling Part I (7 conditions for a transaction to be Halal) in Kuwait assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "foreign learning knowledge is a form of worship and everything we do can be a form of worship if we fix our nia and allah azzawajal did not differentiate between sails and river unless or except because it is a form of worship allah has made transactions and selling halal and made riba or usury haram which means that it is a form of worship and if you study which is something that each and every individual should do because the prophet said as in the hadith mayuri whomever allah wills good for him he will grant him the understanding indeed so without understanding you are ignorant you're negligent you're a layman and this makes you like the vast majority of people this is something we would like to avoid how to do that by learning our deen and the concept of learning is vast someone cannot come and say give me the most important thing what do you mean what should i study tafsir and he goes on this is not something that you can pick up in one day there are mandatory things obligatory upon each and every individual and there are communal obligations for rudolphia mandatory things such as what how to pray before that to hate the pillars of islam what does that mean i don't know no this is mandatory upon you to learn so that your athena is crystal clear how to pray sheikh i don't know maggie was three or four he said no no no this knowledge is important no because i'm studying arabic i don't have time to no this is essential upon every individual but the communal obligations are things that you're not required to learn them until you need them so what are the pillars of hajj i don't plan on making hajj today maybe six years from now i don't have money so is it mandatory for me to know that hajj is has four pillars in this seven eight conditions mandatory things what are the things that break your haram what are the restricted no you don't have the to know these and likewise sales and transactions if you're not a trader if you're not someone who sells and buys why would i have to know what is al-musabana what is what are the types of riba i don't deal i don't have money and if someone who's poor he says uh do i have to learn what is the threshold of zakat what are the four categories of zakat what how to give it to who to give it to the eight categories mentioned in surah toba said no you're poor you don't need to if you know so this is why the scholars when you look in the books of you find them categorizing it first of all as chapters dealing with ibadat ibadat meaning rituals and forms of worship such as salat siam zakat hajj why because they started first of all with salat as it's the most important thing in islam after the shahada the first thing to be questioned and they didn't jump to salat no they started with the conditions you cannot be accepted your prayer cannot be accepted without purity so they spoke about the chapter dealing with purity purity depends on water so they started to talk about the types of water according to the different schools of thought there are two only taheren and then they started with what breakthrough will do and then they started with the menses for women because it's a great deal with purity and then they went to uh the prayer which is related to adhan et cetera then they went to what you know zakat then assam then hajj then they moved into transactions why these are rituals we know them after fulfilling these obligations now people need to eat and drink and they see things that they like in people's possessions the only way to get it is to get it by force and this would mean chaos in the world that's why allah permitted buying and selling you like something it's going to cost you this much you have the price alhamdulillah and after the transactions when you are alhamdulillah full had a good meal had water and everything is what do people usually look for to get married houses yes but it's actually what's in the house that counts how an empty house doesn't does a job so they started to look into marriages so the scholars in the books of you find books related to marriages how it's conducted etiquette then divorce then custody then types of divorce custody of the children then all of these are related to these things so after you're full after you are married what happens people become arrogant people become choosy so they may harm one another they may kill one another so they talk about chapters that deals with injuries with murder with theft with and so on this is the logical way they cascaded things within and this is why we thought that learning how to deal in selling and buying can be beneficial for you why um let me please and this is a hassan hadid by albany he said you are obliged to learn how to sell and buy before you come to the market don't spoil our markets without knowledge you will be spoiling the markets and he used to go in the marketplace with his stick so if he saw two selling and buying without knowledge the transaction is haram he would beat them and he said go learn and come back. and if you notice that a lot of the muslims have little knowledge in transactions and this is why we get a lot of questions share what's the ruling on drop shipping share what's the ruling on cryptocurrency share what's the ruling on this or that amazon prime or whatever they call it and these things are new but they all come back to the old evidences from the quran the sunnah because this is the power of islam that it fits every generation till the day of judgment it's not something that oh this was at the time of the prophet now it's it changed no this is not true it is valid till the end of time a lot of the muslims in india call me in we had a property or we had a car and someone wanted to rent it from us so we gave it to him in rent is this halal said depends what do you mean sheikh what are the restrictions we have to know before you give a fatwa what's the background why why are you asking it's like telling me sheikh there's an apple can i say bismillah and eat it if it's the daytime of ramadan no if it's not yours no tell me about it don't just give me a question and want me to fall in your trap so then he says okay i have a five room uh villa and the rent of this villa is usually 300 kweti dinar a month good said okay that's a good price so someone came and wanted to rent it so i said okay you have to pay me twenty thousand created dirham as a deposit and i'll rent it for to you for five kuwaiti dinars a month is this halal i said of course not this is clear this is where the river if you knew your religion if you studied it you would have known that this this deposit is not a deposit it is what it's a loan he is lending you 20 000 credit dinar the deposit is usually 500 so that if paint is scratched we will fix it from that to give you 20 000 and then you charge him only five dnr for the rent this means that you are borrowing this 20 000 from him the interest that he lives in that house for a year for two for five for ten and he's making a lot of benefit out of that so this is riba and eighty percent of the people who speak to me fall into this and they think it's legitimate is halal because they don't have knowledge so this is one of the benefits one of the benefits of learning the rules and evidences governing transactions now let us define before we go into the hadith because the hadiths are clearly i mean we're not going to spend a lot of time but the introduction is important what do we mean by bayer selling because in arabic bayer can mean sell and buy at the same time so bear to who can be or can mean i sold it and it can mean i bought it it's the same thing so what is the definition of selling and buying different definitions i'll give you a simple definition that might be a little bit complicated but when you break it down into points then you will understand just from the definition in legislative and legal definition selling is the exchange what does exchange mean two parties involved i give you take so this is selling exchange the exchange of what of something of value so it has to have value with another person okay so there are two involved whether two persons or two entities companies from companies countries from countries this is still considered to be saying through how is this exchange done through cash or credit or a halal service so i sell you this through cash give me one fills i don't know how much how much is good i'm saying so this is an exchange cash or credit which happens a lot of the time salaam alaikum how much 50 says oh phils okay i'll take it tomorrow i'll bring it for you this is on credit halal no problem or through a service salaam alaikum how much is this 50 fills oh i don't have cash i can't buy it through credit but i'll sweep the floor for you this is a service so i'll sell my service okay he's okay ali ibrahim used to do this may allah be pleased and he used to do it with the jews he used to work for a jew we know that salman pharisee also worked in the in the beginning to free himself and this is well known this is a service so the exchange of something of value why do we say of something of value something that has no value cannot be sold so i will sell you a group of ants or roaches this is something that cannot be sold because it has no value i will sell you a dead cow i found it outside this is meter it's haram for you to to sell etc and this would bring us to a very important issue because in arabic it's called mal mal but what is the definition of mal mal the most any authentic definition is something that the whole community agree to be of value in order to exchange in the old times what was it gold and silver later on it was bank notes tomorrow if they bring rocks and they say okay five pieces of rock will get you this bottle of water everybody agrees upon it it's considered to be mal in arabic they call it feminia it has feminine it has a value among us okay what about cryptocurrency yeah it's not the time wait wait i know everybody is online now shall i buy no wait wait this will come inshallah later on so the exchange of something of value with another whether through cash or credit or halal service forever why do we say forever because if i lease you my car this is an exchange you're giving money every month and i'm giving you my car is it forever this is timed then this is not selling this is renting and the the law is different the rules are different so forever while not being riba yeah this transaction is not rebirth and not alone because riba is exchange give me a hundred dinar i'll give it to you 110. so can we say that this is selling no but there is an exchange share of something of a value and its credit and cash at the same time yes but allah says which means that they are two separate things so it cannot be defined with cells this is the evidence easy to understand insha'allah and the loan alone is also exchanged i'm giving you this money and you're returning it back to me but there isn't something that is being exchanged in return except the reward from allah azzawajal and that is why they called they call the contracts of loans to be it's not a transaction of exchange it's a transaction of being kind and compassionate to your brother why do i lend you money because i want to help you there's nothing else no strings attached so these are the main um definition when you break it down it helps you understand so now when someone says to you i want to do this you look at the definition how it's broken down is it no there is one condition that is not fulfilled this is not this is not this this is not that now there are as stated by scholars seven conditions for the transaction to be halal and where did they get it from they got it from collecting a lot of these conditions from reading quran and sunnah and this is why scholars come always on top and this is why it's frustrating when someone comes to you who does not know arabic who does not know the basics of who has never studied and you tell him about he doesn't even say what's the evidence in english is it what's the what's the dalil are you talking about you know i need to know your dali yeah foreign do you know the basics of the quran do you memorize the quran do you know hadith said no do you know arabic i said no but i need to know the dele you don't have the basics you go to a neurosurgeon and he says we have to do this procedure and because of this and they said show me what's your dalil he'll kick you out of the hospital do you not qualify didn't he do even first year of medical school so it's not wrong to ask for the delete when you're qualified when you have little of knowledge when you would like to understand so if you have an ambiguity a question a doubt so you say okay i've read that this and this and this and this and this and this and it goes against what you've said ah now you're putting forward an allegation that i can give you my point of view but when you come from out of the blue and you say i need to know the dali give me the reference number of the hadith i'm answering the question if i memorize the number of the hadith i would have been with the major scholars of islam not coming here to the legendary with all the respect what are you talking about give me a break so you have to ask for the when you have background these seven conditions of course i'm taking it from sheikh in our shaykh they all revolve around preventing riba preventing transgression and preventing ambiguity these are extremely important in any transaction between you and even your brother your sibling you cannot just do a transaction and say halas is my brother he's my friend he's my colleague there has to be these things have to be eliminated you can't go with a taxi driver salam alaikum take me to uh jabria okay how much no it's okay we will not have a dispute and when you reach you'll have gunfight you bring a plumber don't work without asking how much he's gonna charge and then give him the permission you think it's going to cost you a hundred fills he says it takes 10 dinners no there has to be no ambiguity no oppression or transgression no ripa so what are these seven um this is not related to the taurah it's general introduction and isha is in 15 minutes so i don't want to go to the hadith and break it for salat and yeah um you know we have wrong calculation in um calendar only in asia the four salat are perfect but asia they fixed it to an hour and a half from sunset throughout the whole year and this is wrong usually it's 60 minutes maybe 70 minutes is most maybe 50 minutes after sunset to fix it at one and a half is wrong especially for sisters because our sisters home oh there is uh like i just thought 15 minutes for isha when asia is out in five minutes so they're praying it not on time which is very dangerous anyhow this is not our topic so what are the seven conditions number one consent what does consent means that the both buyer and seller they're doing it willingly so if i come to a person who has a car that i like and i want to buy he says i'm not interested then i put a gun to his head so now you're interested he said yes definitely i'm interested and he sells me the car officially is this halal no allah says it has to be out of consent both of you are happy and this is why sometimes you may engage in a transaction unwillingly your father-in-law comes and he said sell me the property please come on you're my son-in-law uncle you're wanting to buy it half of the price i i want to come on yeah i gave you my daughter i regret this uncle but what can what can i do i'm stuck so but he insists on you out of shyness out of bashfulness you agree this transaction is hara because he knows that he forced you and you accept it unwillingly now the second condition is the person engaged among the two buying or selling has to be authorized to deal what do you mean by authorized to deal number one he has to be free not a slave why because the slave does not own and this is something we may talk about later about slavery about the things that may confuse a lot of the muslims why there is slavery in islam this is oppression where is human rights whether geneva convention we will come to that later but a slave who has this date said martial it's not yours okay what about my apple watch it's not mine it's my masters everything a slave owns and possesses is belonging to his master so when you see a slave riding in an amg a uh 63 2022 barbados and you want to buy this slave his master says okay i'll sell him for 1000 kd you gave him the 1000 kd he says to the slave bring me the car bring me the watch bring me your shoes just only wear one soap one dish dasha and you say i bought the slaves yes but not everything everything else is mine so condition to be authorized to deal one you have to be free two you have to be an adult a child with a checkbook coming to a car dealership and he says i'd like this car and here's a check this is not halal that's not permissible because he's not authorized he's still a child and the pen of accountability is uplifted if he hits someone if he does a crime or whatever allah azza will not hold him accountable as the hadith three the pen is uplifted from them one a child until he reaches the age of puberty a sleeping person until he wakes up and an insane person until he regains his sanity hadith everybody knows about it number three he has to be sane what's opposite insane someone who's insane just out of the luni hospital and he says i want to buy this and he gives you money you cannot sell him he's not mentally fit number four he has to have sound judgment what's the difference between this and being sane no you may have someone who's sane but he has no sound judgment he finds something that's worth one dinar he pays ten and he possesses something that's worth ten dinars and he sells it for 200 fields so he's sane but his judgment of selling and buying is a nightmare so these are the four conditions to be in a person sound or uh authorized to deal with and we will continue with the remaining two conditions correct five like this then i have to go into teaching mode which it means that i will spot ask you what i have said and then i might ask you to stand up and maybe ask you to do push-ups watch out i'm very vigorous in this may allah make things easy"
