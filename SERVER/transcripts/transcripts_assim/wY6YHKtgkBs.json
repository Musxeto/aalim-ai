  "transcript": "uh the question is i recently you uh tweeted someone asked you about um playing games on bitmoji and use you say that this is a permissible on the other hand you say that it is permissible to use the emojis that are already drawn or any drawings that already drawn and also you said it is permissible to play games which have images now i believe your opinion that playing games is permissible then why did the chef in the twitter you say there is no permissible to play against a bitmoji where it has been already been made i'm not making someone else made it i'm i'm unable to understand the question clearly but i'll try to answer you inshallah from bangladesh is asking about a confusion he has now he says i tweeted that it is not permissible to play games with emojis i don't remember what i had for lunch yesterday but let us take it from the beginning now bitmojis emojis there is a difference between them i think and i hope the smiley faces the yellow ones they are okay it's best to avoid them but there is nothing to say that's haram as there is no life in it the one i understand is the bitmoji where you have a almost a 3d character and sometimes it's a policeman it's a nurse it's a fireman whatever and they look real making them is totally prohibited without any doubt using them it is not something that i feel good about and i would never ever use them because they are more assimilation of living creatures and with a 3d effect etc if i understand your question correctly the games that i said it's not halal to play are the games where you design and take the features facial features body features and you put them together for your soccer player in a game that you're playing so you design it or you may you may put your face into it all of this is not permissible but to play video games where i did not do or make these um characters i did not draw them myself there's no problem in that you shall [Music] allah"
