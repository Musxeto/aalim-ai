  "transcript": "shahnaz from Australia um so I just want to ask if I'm getting to know someone during the marriage process um am I able to create a group chat with my dad as mawali and we're able to communicate like that I was like considered as chit chatting and it's when it's hard on my life so if I understand your question correctly someone is interested in marrying you you meet with him for the initial marriage interview he looks at you you look at him and you're sort of engaged there is a a prior acceptance or something any preliminary form of acceptance but no Nika has done so you want to form a WhatsApp group or a chat group where your father is included so that whenever you chat with him your father is supervising it is this permissible now says no this is not permissible because it is not what Islam promotes Islam promotes that you choose someone or someone chooses you you do your due diligence you ask around you see that this person checks most of not all the boxes then you agree to meet you meet in the initial meeting where a man and a woman yet interested in getting married meet in the presence of the guardian of the woman and you sit with him for half an hour for an hour he looks at you thoroughly and you look at him you chit chat you talk about different things in the presence of your father and afterwards if there is chemistry he said I like the girl if she likes him as well then alhamdulillah they agree on having the engagement and the engagement is just a promise that we accept you to propose your proposal and that's it it doesn't open any closed doors or allow you to freely mix on and or contact one another once the marriage contract is done then even before the roksati the nikah itself is done now your man and wife you can mix talk chat without supervision be alone in a room without any problem go out for dinner without any problem because you're lawfully his wife before that you are not in Allah Knows Best foreign"
