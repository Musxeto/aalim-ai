  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] AC [Music] alhamdulillah so after calling the people in secret and the Revelation continued to come Time After Time the stories of the Nations before us the stories of the Brethren of the Prophet Alam the other Messengers The Story of MSA the story of no the of all these great strong willed Messengers which made the foundation that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam knew that exactly what happened to them would happen to him the rejection of their people the accusation their resistance to his peaceful call everything would happen so Allah revealed to his messenger an Ayah and warned oh Muhammad your closest Kindred as this appeared in the context of the story of prophet musat the Prophet knew that what Pharaoh did to Mo Moses peace be upon him and his people the people of Mecca would do something similar or Worse to him and to who followed him so the prophet Alat wasam anticipated them rejecting his call one day he climbed Mount Safa and we know that saf are adjacent to this is where we do our when we go for and he shouted at the people on Mount Safa by saying to them be on your guard and this is what someone says when he warns his people that there's an army coming to attack you and then he started calling the clans of qur of the tribe of the people of Mecca by name and he used to uh um call them by name saying and and they came out of their homes saying to themselves who is this that is calling us out and they said to one another this is Muhammad so the people rushed to him and they wanted to see what was going on and when they gathered the prophet said to them what do you think if I were to tell you that there is an Army in the valley at the bottom of this mountain coming to raid you would you believe me and they out of honesty said yes we've never known you to tell a lie and we have never known you to be anything but honest and this is a fact so the prophet said to them Alat wasam I am a Warner to you ahead of a severe torment and Punishment the likeness of me and you is that of a man who sees the enemy so he leaves his family meaning that he goes to a high place to watch out for an enemy lest they attack his family then he fears that they will reach them before he can come to warn them so he begins to cry out be on your guard be on your guard this is in Arabic it is known as the prophet in one of the Hadith says I am the naked Warner what does that mean when a person who's on a mountain sees an army coming to attack and raid his people his people are on the other side there's no time for him to rush to them to warn them because it would be too late so what does he do he takes off his clothes from a distance and he starts waving his clothes so he's a naked Warner his people see him taking off his clothes and waving with them they know that there is an army coming to attack them so when the prophet said this to them Alam he then called them to the truth warning them of the punishment of Allah speaking in specific and general terms so now he addressing them all now he Narrows this to say to each Clan oh save yourself from Hellfire because I do not or I cannot Avail you anything before Allah then he goes to benr ABD hash his own Clan then he goes to specifics my own grandfather save yourself even if you want ask me from my own uh uh wealth whatever you want because I cannot Avail you anything before Allah then he started addressing his own uncles and aunts and relatives when he said I cannot Avail you anything before Allah oh oh safia daughter of Abdul mutalib my own paternal Aunt he said I cannot Avail you anything before Allah then he said to his own flesh and blood his own daughter oh Fatima daughter of Muhammad the messenger of Allah ask me for whatever you want of my wealth save yourself from the fire for I have no power to harm you or benefit you I cannot Avail you anything before Allah but you have ties of kinship that I will uphold as much as is appropriate now such an oration such a speech given to the people on that Glorious Day announcing to them publicly no no more hiding no more secrets I am the Messenger of Allah and I'm facing your brutality your power I'm facing your own convictions that you're associating others with Allah the one who holds his wrath and torment and punish punishment if you were not to obey him he would annihilate you and destroy you I'm just a Warner I have nothing to benefit you with I can't even benefit my own self I'm just a servant and a slave and a messenger of Allah asael and he selected every Clan his own Clan his own immediate family and named them by name to show the people that this is something that I don't have any power over the prophet Alat voice was resonating all over the place and the valley was trembling with his call that no one ever heard of it before for and this is when they listened and they could not give any reaction they were had two minds we believe him he never said a lie a single lie in his life we entrust him with our wealth and keep all our deposits with him because he's trustworthy so they did not have any reaction except for his own paternal Uncle Abu laab he reacted in the worst fashion and manner possible when he said to the prophet Alat wasam may you perish for the rest of the day was it for this that you called us together now this coming from your closest kinship your father's brother and he was one of the notorious enemies of the Prophet wasam throughout his life this is why Allah revealed a whole chapter in the Quran cursing and blaming Abu laab where Allah said in the Quran May the the hands of Abu lahab perish and may He perish himself in a Surah called imagine if they wanted to falsify the Quran if they wanted to prove that the Quran was not the word of Allah he could have accepted Islam pretended to accept Islam and then said look this Ayah or this Surah doesn't work but they didn't because this was the Revelation from Allah that stood the test of time and will stand the test of time till the end of time this call of the Prophet wasam continued and the prophet used to go to their gatherings and to wherever they would meet and give them dawa it was not that he stayed home expecting people to come to him no he used to go out and visit them collectively and individually and this is when Allah told the prophet Alat wasam then declare what you are commanded and turn away from the polytheists do what you're told no more secrets no more hiding show them what we had given you and he used to go from one place to the other repeating what his Brethren had said before him all the messengers of Allah used to say the same statement oh people worship Allah you have no deity other than him so he began to worship Allah wherever he could and he would not hide it he would go to the Courtyard of the Kaaba in front of them in Broad day light and would pray towards the Kaa worshiping Allah and they would look at him with these actions bowing and prostrating things that they're not accustomed to they used to hear the Quran and how eloquent and beautiful it was something they've never heard in their lives and you could imagine the transformation that this brought to their community and to the society that went against all their Norms all what their ancestors taught them them all what they found themselves doing all of their lives this was a shock to them that needed to be confronted [Music] for [Music] for"
