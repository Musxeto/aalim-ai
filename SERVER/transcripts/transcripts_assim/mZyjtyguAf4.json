had you nabina muhammad sallallahu alayhe wa aalihi wasallam wash on rod amore mo that her to her work will the desert even better work will let me the item ba da da were cool la ba la that in phenom Roberto la man by nature is weak is vulnerable this is how Allah created him and this is how Allah described him in the Quran no matter how smart intelligent or witty he thinks of himself yet he is still unable to make the right decision in so many cases this is why we mostly think that what we choose and what we do are the right things when actually they are not and we come to discover this days later and this is why allah azza wajal guided us this is why allah ordered and instructed his messenger sallallahu alayhi wasallam and the believers to consult Allah says in the Quran so o muhammad sallallaahu ariados Allah pardon them and ask forgiveness for them and consult them in the matter and consultation is sought after from people who are experienced and allegedly committed because sometimes you may consult someone who's experienced but he doesn't feel allah azza wajal and hence he would give you the wrong consultation and other times you may go to someone who is religiously committed who is righteous and practicing but he's inexperienced so again he would give you the wrong consultation at times of ignorance at times of jahiliyya the arabs used to refer to divining arrows so every Adam had three arrows in his possession one stated go ahead the second said briefly and do not go ahead and the third one was blank so whenever they wanted to make a decision they would draw one of these arrows and seek permission seek knowledge seek a decision from it other Arabs used to have birds for decision-making and they let the birds out if it goes to the right this means that they should go ahead with the decision if it goes left they refrain and this is from the doing of shape on as mentioned in chapter 5 Surat al-ma'idah and it is something that can take a person out of Islam it's a major sin because you are depending on making your decision on other than allah azza wajal today we have ignorant muslims doing the same thing and they think that this is righteous they think that this is halal they come to the most hath one of them wants to travel and he said I don't know if traveling is good for me today or not they come to the Quran and they open it and they do this if it talks about hell visit I'm not going if it talks about Jenna or success then this is a good sign and they go ahead with it and this is prohibited in Islam even if if it's from the Quran and this is why the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam used to always refer in great gatherings like read like Juma that everything that is innovated takes you astray and this would take you to hell innovation is prevailing when people are ignorant when they are far away from the Quran and the Sunnah they don't want to follow the Prophet Ali Saleh to--some they want to follow their own whims and desires and this is what leads them to Hellfire may Allah protect us all now when Allah Azza WA JAL prohibits something he always gives us an alternative Allah never leaves us in the dark and this is why he sent his greatest messenger to us sallallahu alayhi wasallam to take us out from darkness into the light so if referring to divine divining arrows for decision is Haram allah azza wajal substituted us with an other alternative that is highly recommended and it is a form of worship this you in it express your poverty your need for allah azza wajal you turn away from your own might and power to the power of the Almighty Azza WA JAL and you humbly beg him to guide you to choose the right decision Jabbar nabbed Allah may Allah be pleased with the man with his father as reported by imam al Buhari said the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam used to teach us SD Hara in everything as he used to teach us the Quran which means that this is of a very high level of knowledge that the Prophet used to feed them and give them and he said alayhi salatu wassalam if anyone of you is deliberating about the decision he has to make then let him pray Taraka of non obligatory prayer then say that there are you all know in arabic i'm going to translate it in English oh allah i seek your guidance in making a choice by virtue of your knowledge and I think ability by virtue of your power and I seek you of your great bounty you have power I have none and you have and you know and I know not you are the knower of hidden things or Allah in your knowledge this if this matter and you named that matter buying a car marrying a woman applying for a job if it's good for me both in this world and in the Hereafter or you say in my religion my livelihood and my affairs then ordain it for me make it easy for me and bless it for me and if in your knowledge it is bad for me and for my religion my livelihood and my affairs or for me both in this world and the Hereafter then turn me away from it and turn it away from me and our Dane for me the good wherever it may be and make me pleased with it this is known as the dawn of an East Harlem in Arabic is Tijara means to seek choice you're asking allah azzawajal to choose for you and this means that i am giving up my ability my knowledge my power seeking all of it from allah azza wajal when and where do we seek is to harm you as the scholars say ask allah for st hara when you are making a choice about something that is permissible you do not make a state law in doing obligatory acts and you do not do is hara in committing sins so a person who's intending to go for hajj Hajj is fault you do not make a stay hard unless your Easter Hara is whether I go this year or next year because there are things that I'm afraid of an enemy floods anything that you make sir Sahara is not on the pillar itself but rather on the tiny you do not make istikhara to attend a musical concert or to watch a movie this is sinful this is Haram you mocking Allah Azza WA JAL it's like someone who wants to drink whiskey and he says bismillah hear what you are hear you crazy what are you doing this is mocking Allah this is why a lot of scholars said whoever does such a thing is a kafir it's an act of apostasy to say bismillah before you drink alcohol or you consume something that is Haram also this Tahara is not done as so many of us think to make a choice between two things I'm interested in buying a new car should I buy the blue one or the white one so I'm hesitant so I play a priest Aharon this is wrong the Prophet says is salat wa salam said when you deliberate when you're thinking of something and you make your mind up so I'm inclined to buying the blue car only then you pray the Torah cos of Nan forever and then you make you turn on that blue car and if there is good in it it will take place you can do this door Avista Hara after two Nephilim or too soon AHA tiba of for example of lahore etc you can do it any non obligatory fret prayer however it is highly recommended to devote to voluntary prayers for it don't be lazy so many people think share can I pray the Hail Mary and Sunnah right Eber and SD Hara and so little booboo nothing why don't also make back pay of so many funders women and they all want everything in a couple of minutes this is not how it works this is a form of worship you're worshipping allah azzawajal show your humility your poverty your need to the Creator otherwise you are in big trouble and when to make the door is it before Salaam or after Salaam it's an issue of dispute the vast majority of scholars say that you do it after the salon even taenia says if you do it before Salaam it is better so it is up to you you want to make it before Salaam and after Sarah hamdulillah you're calling allah azza wajal and all is accepted now I did this D Harlem what's next do I get italics I wants that message how would I know that my sister Halle was answered so many people have the wrong misconception they say that I pray the Sahara for a whole week I didn't see any dream I walked out the door I didn't see any cat dead on my doorsteps I need a sign there is no such sign you are seeking guidance from Allah Azza WA JAL you have to make a decision first you have to pray the Torah cos of none for Eva second you make the Dora third and you proceed you go ahead you take your checkbook you take all the documents needed and you go to the car showroom if there is good in it things will facilitate things will be easy alhamdulillah if not the guy would say I'm afraid your ID card has expired I'm afraid we don't have that tone of color I'm afraid that you have to wait a couple of weeks then you would feel that I think I'm not into it I'm gonna pray 2 rakaats for the white car this is up to you but it's not a dream so many sisters get proposals and they reject the proposal why she says I saw a nightmare so what I see nightmares with my wife every single day and sometimes I find out that I'm awake and not asleep so that doesn't make any sense HT Hara is seeking Allah's guidance as a virgin and you seek Allah's guidance by proceeding go ahead with it don't wait and say I'm waiting for a good word from the brother I'm waiting for a good sign that something happens no this is not how esta Hara happens Allah Azza WA JAL says in the Quran and your Lord creates what He wills and chooses not for them was the choice exalted is Allah and high above what they associated with him another misconception and this is prevalent in a lot of the land Arabs country they go to a mawlana they go to a scholar they go to someone they think that he's pious and they pay him money and they say mr. Hara there's a proposal for my daughter and the guy is making a lot of bucks so he says in sha allah and he makes this to her and they think that they have done their due diligence and this is totally inappropriate and not permissible esta Hara cannot be done by other than the one related to the matter meaning if your daughter gets a proposal you as a parent are not the one who is going to make this the harder she is going to make this to her now you as a parent you make you may make less Tijara for you to receive the suitor to meet him but the marriage itself has to be done by the future spouse whether the girl or or the boy and women usually ask what about the time of the month where we cannot pray in this case scholars say that you can make the door without prayer and allah azza wajal knows your case and knows your need for his guidance and Allah would not deprive you from that I probably had our stuff ilaha illa-llah confessor fuel in who who Allah for him alhamdulillah hello banana me why should I lie down where you saw him well she had under Mohammed and Avenue who were all sort of sallallahu alayhi wa he was happy he remained very bad Allah the vast majority of us Muslims we depend not entirely on Allah and this is a sad fact we depend on our strength on our knowledge on our know-how we depend on the people we know and it's not what you know it's who you know and we often depend on the means and forget the causer of all means Subhanahu as the WA JAL is the Hara is one of the greatest signs of how true your tower could is on Allah Azza WA JAL how devoted you are to being a servant a slave of Allah Subhanahu WA Ta'ala and it is a great sign of expressing your belief and conviction of Allah's attributes of Allah's ability of a large knowledge and grace and bounty over you wise men used to say muhabba manista ha women edema many Stesha he who prays esta Hara would not be disappointed and he who consults people of wisdom would not be in a forum regretting it so this Tahara takes place only of a person who believes in tahiti who believes in allah azza wajal who has full trust reliance and dependence on the almighty as the virgin who begs a large favour and blessing and this is why a believer who does this Tijara all the time you would find him filled with tranquility relax doesn't have any problems you will always find him at times of calamities cold and happy with Allah's decree he's content all the time regardless of how things happen and take place because He gave His guidance he gave his affairs to the one that rules he put it in the hands of the one who decides in all days if this is why he is happy no matter how poor you are no matter how indebted you are you believe that Allah associate has preordained your provision fifteen thousand years before he created the universe so why are you worried don't you know that your provision will come to you whether you like it or not yes but I have so much debt yes I have many problems I have so many calamities don't you believe that Allah rules and whatever he chooses happens yes but do not budge surrender to Allah Azza WA JAL depend on him believed in him and nothing except good will come your way unlike the the disbeliever unlike the Muslim whose neglectful who is ignorant with things changing by the second in his life you will always find find him in stress you will find him having anxiety and panic attacks he's always worried he's always depressed and he's always preoccupied cannot focus cannot make a right decision he makes decision after decision and they're all wrong because he's not following the way that Allah has guided us to he did not surrender himself to a las predestiny and to us to Allah's choice and had he done that he would have found the sweetness of Eman which a lot of us lack and miss why is it that we when we pray we don't find the sweetness of a man why is it when we refrain from sin we find a lot of things hitching in our hearts yearning for sin instead of being happy that Allah protected me from falling into sin this is because we do not have full trust and dependence on allah azzawajal go out not now go out and ask one another do you know that dora along - Tofino kabir illimitable you look a bit odd radhika was a look at me in public and our defender Kotaku water up the water and water in the Gunther animal you ask Muslims around you do you know the Dora do you keep it by heart do you do it at least once or twice a day the Prophet used to teach them as he taught them the Quran and you would find unfortunately the vast majority of Muslims not knowing it which is quite sad and this shows you how far we are from our Lord as Virgil you know that the prophet sallallaahu seldom used to maintain this duaa in the eighth car of morning and evening what do I shake the door of the prophet alayhi salat WA Salam along by a hiya Hume be a masochist Arif especially colder weather to kidney in enough sick part of Fatima the Prophet used to say every morning and every evening ask our o ever-living o sustainer by your mercy I seek your help rectify all my affairs and do not leave me in charge of my affairs even for the blink of an eye do not leave me because I am weak and vulnerable I cannot stand without your grace I cannot take a breath let alone give it out without your provision and allowing it once you have this in your heart while mahi the whole world would be under you feet because you will be the strongest the wealthiest and the most person with honor in this life but the moment Allah leaves you to yourself when Allah a soldier leaves you to run your affairs on your own then you are in great loss so which one are you are you among those who trusts Allah are you among those who depend on him entirely or are you among those whom Allah social had left in charge of their own affairs fear Allah servants of Allah beg him for his mercy and guidance ask him to choose for you in your education in your selling and buying and getting married in your divorces and everything you do seek Allah guidance and then you will feel the sweetness of Iman I asked your forgiveness but I don't know how to make Doron English so I'll make it in Arabic and trust me inshallah good for you a la mulana or Hamner wah -
