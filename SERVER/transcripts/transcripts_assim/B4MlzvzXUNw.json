  "title": "Is friend a Kafir, he keeps 3 Quls Taweez for  Protection & thinks Prophet ﷺ come to receive salam",
  "transcript": "Salmaan from India I know of someone who puts \na paper which has three last surahs the three   quls written on it and he puts it inside a \nTa'weez and gave it to others for protection   and he has some ideas like he says the prophet \n(Peace and Blessings upon him) was a human he   is dead but he comes to receive our Salam even \nthough he admits the fact that this matter is   beyond our understanding this is a matter \nof the Unseen so if this types of Acts are   kufr and if he is committing these things out \nof ignorance as a Layman by blindly following   uh their Scholars and he thinks that he is on \nthe right track so should we treat him as kafir   first of all try not to fall \ninto the Trap of labeling people   it is not our duty to go around and give a crash \nuh uh course and a test and a quiz afterwards to   people and say okay answer these questions please \nso I can determine whether you're a Muslim or not   I mean he he goes and says al salam alaikum \napologies I can't reply until you answer these   questionnaires okay let's go and pray Ishaa \nin this Masjid I don't know the imams Aqeedah   so I can't pray behind him this is \nthe traits and characteristics of everyone who claims to be a Muslim is a Muslim \nby default until proven otherwise even the Shia   they're Muslims if I made a Shia and he says \nsalaam alaikum I said what do you say of Aisha he   said what do you think of Abu Bakr and Umar I have \nfew questions please can you answer this is wrong something that is kufr and we know that the \nconditions are fulfilled he's knowledgeable he's   not forced he's not misunderstanding anything \nor misinterpreting anything and there are no   obstacles preventing the labeling of kufr to fall \nupon Him such as ignorance such as being forced   Etc in this case that's a different story \nso this person you mentioned two things   one of them is that he writes the three quls on \na piece of paper and he gives it as a Ta'weez   for protection to people now this is an issue \nof dispute some Scholars even some companions   said that doing this with children is permissible \nlike mother Aisha and and a number of companions   and ibn Omar he used to hang a board with with \nthese three surahs Etc and the majority say no   this is not permissible would we say it's shirk \nno we would not it can it can underline bold it can lead to shirk but it's not shirk the second \nthing is you said that he acknowledges that the   Prophet is dead (Peace and Blessings upon him) yet \nhe also acknowledges that the our Salam reaches   him and you say are these things shirk of course \nnot this is proven by the authentic Sunnah Allah   has appointed an angel so that whenever a Muslim \noffers salutation upon the Prophet (Peace and   Blessings upon him) he conveys his salaam to the \nProphet (Peace and Blessings upon him) where's   the kufr and the Shirk so again this shows \nyou that so many misconceptions in your head   are hampering and impairing your judgment \nto the extent that you are ready to   classify and label this person \nas a mushrik and Allah Knows Best"
