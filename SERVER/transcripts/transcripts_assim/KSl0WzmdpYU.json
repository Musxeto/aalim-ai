  "transcript": "his third question was about uh the gifts that sales representatives of pharmaceutical companies give to doctors now the question would be is exactly that which the prophet has imposed to ibn and he's a companion whom the prophet salam employed to go and collect the zakat from different regions of arabia so the man came back may allah be pleased with him and he said oh prophet of allah this is your portion this is your zakat and this was given to me so the prophet was angered by this and he went up the pulpit and he praised allah offered salutation upon the prophet hassam said how come we employ people to do work for us and they come back saying that this is yours and this was given to me had wouldn't they have stayed home at their mother's houses and look whether people give them gifts or not this means that the gifts the people had given to that companion was not because he had brown eyes or he was from that tribe or this tribe or for his qualifications they gave him this as a bribe because of the position so you as a doctor even zahir if you stayed home and you were not a doctor if you were the admin in the hospital would any of the doctors give you a business class ticket for you and for your family to a goa resort in india for three days to attend a conference definitely not they're doing this to promote their medications that so that you always prescribe it or they give you a watch they give you a laptop they give you a pda all of these are clear riba and it's prohibited for you to accept"
