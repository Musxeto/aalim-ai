  "transcript": "Peyman that hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa salaam wa l mob rule theorem attend Allah Ameen nabina muhammad in wada alayhi wa sahbihi ajma'in and my back dear brothers sisters in Islam Salaam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh we're still pondering upon surah number 79 surah - nasi act and last time we met we spoke about five ayahs of this surah and in these five ayahs allah azzawajal is swearing by the angels so allah says by those who pull out with great violence by those who gently take out and by those that swim along and by those that press forward as in a race and by those angels who arrange to do the commands of their Lord so these five ayahs Allah is taking an oath and he's saying by the angels by the angels but what is a last wedding about what is Allah making a knows about so if I say well wha he I will and I don't say anything okay you will what you'll eat you will come you will go to sleep you will take something from me what is it you're taking an oath over here Allah so Jill doesn't mention that and this is one form of the eloquence of the Quran Arabic and the scholars say that what Allah is taking an oath over has been deleted but it is understood from what comes afterwards so Allah is swearing and saying by the angels Allah swears by his angels by the angels you disbelievers will be resurrected and you will be held accountable for what you had done and that is why allah azzawajal says in ayah number six Yamato will do for Raja fuh so by the Angels there will be a day of reckoning when is that day Yamato two for Raj Shiva tattva Oh Harada fuh it is on the day the earth and the mountains will shake violently the second blowing of the trumpet follows it so we have towards a Raja fuh and rowdy fuh Raja fuh comes from the verb to shake and tremble so allies telling us that the day of judgement is when the earth would shake and tremble and then it would be followed by a rowdy fuh which is the second blowing of the trumpet when the people are resurrected so the first is the sign of the day of judgment when the trumpet would be blown in for the first time and this ends all forms of life on earth and this causes the earth to shake and tremble so Allah so gel is indicating to us that a Raja fuh is the blow in the trumpet the first one followed by a rod Aoife where people are resurrected from their graves and it is said that between the two blows there would be a gap of 40 years and allah azzawajal knows how long these years are so this is something that every Muslim believes in it would be unfair for someone to kill people and torture them and died a peaceful death and not be held accountable for what he had done he has to suffer and he has to pay for what he had done it would be unfair for those who sincerely worshipped Allah Azza WA JAL for so long avoiding things that he forbids and then not be given or rewarded with the highest rewards in paradise and Allah Azza WA JAL is the most just of all this could not have so this is the scenario the first blow everyone dies and the universe changes in a drastic way the oceans turned into fire the mountains turn into dust and the skies and the earth and the moons and the suns and the stars everything is transformed as we will come in Chawla and learn later on on that day listen to the description that Allah gives about the people Allah says hooloovoo yeomen even wah Chifa hearts on that day will shake with fear and an anxiety of course the people will be divided with the two people of no fear and no harm and these are the believers Allah says in the cutsy hadith by my grace an honor that I would never combine two for my servant if he fears me in this life I will not make him afraid on the day of judgement and if he is not afraid of me in this life I will terrify him on the day of judgement so on the day of judgement there will be two divisions two types of people those who are in comfort and security they're safe for anything that burdens them but there will be people whose hearts are filled with fear and anxiety and these are the hearts of the disbelievers and the wrongdoers it's not their hearts only Allah says Allah sorrow haha Shia their eyes cast down their eyes are in humility and submissiveness they look down they cannot look up because they know that they come with burdened and heavy shoulders with sins lusts and desires it's pay time and this is when they will be held accountable for what they had done their eyesight is limited they cannot look around how can they they don't have the guts to do so they know they're wrong now they've seen everything in this life they live in denial no we will be in paradise we will be in the highest levels of paradise if there's a paradise if there's life after death so their denial they don't believe on the day of judgement the veil will be taken away from their eyes and they can see everything so they cannot look up they look down they castigates down in humility because they anticipate what comes to them allah azza wajal says about them in ayah number 10 yahoo loon in Namur do Doudna fill half Allah when they're resurrected when they're taken out of the graves they say who woke us up who is taking us out of our graves and of our resting places you pass by the graves you see our IP rest in peace what peace are you talking about don't you know that disbelievers graves are filled with Hellfire this is not hell it's just a window that opens to them and they burn in hell and this is nothing compared what awaits them on the day of judgement this is just a preview of what awaits them so when they're resurrected they cry and say shall we indeed be returned to our former state of life in animal do dune fill half Allah Allah Allah could mean life could mean earth and it also could mean hell but most likely because they said are we going back are we returning back is not in reference to hell it is most likely in reference to life after death meaning are we going back to this world now we thought we were dead it's all over nobody told us that there will be another life we always believe that there's no god there's no heaven and hell we always believe that once you die that is it end of story well tough luck there is a sequel to it and this sequel is to Eternity they complain and wonder either corner evolved and akhira is this possible even after we are crumbled bones when we dig a grave we see nothing except crumbled bones is it possible that we will be back in this form of life in our bodies if this is true Allah says ah do Tilka Eden cotton ha sir ah ha if we were to be resurrected and our crumbled bones to be fixed and reinstated in its original form Allah says they say it would in that case be a return with loss this is not what we hope for this is not what we lived for and surely this is not what we had died for we thought as disbelievers say we thought that life began with being born and ends with dying that is it so make the best of it enjoy it as it lasts and that is why we lived it to the fullest so we thought because it's as they say you only live once and Muslims don't believe in that we believe that this is not the life we are looking for our life is in Jena and this is why we tolerate what we get that is why we're patient and we worship Allah though it's sometimes not as what our hearts desire and that is why we refrain from things that we love and desire because Allah does not love it that is why they complain this is a return with loss this is not what we wanted we have a short break stay tuned and we'll be right back assalamu alaikum and welcome back either culinary varmint Nakula is this possible even after we are crumbled bones when we dig a grave we see nothing except crumbled bones is it possible that we will be back in this form of life in our bodies if this is true Allah says padhu Tilka eden cotton ha sir aha if we were to be resurrected and our crumbled bones to be fixed and reinstated in its original form Allah says they say it would in that case be a return with loss this is not what we hope for this is not what we lived for and surely this is not what we had died for we thought as disbelievers say we thought that life began with being born and it ends with dying that is it so make the best of it enjoy it as it lasts and that is why we lived it to the fullest so we thought because it's as they say you only live once and Muslims don't believe in that we believe that this is not the life we are looking for our life is in Jenna and this is why we tolerate what we get that is why we're patient and we worship Allah though it's sometimes not as what our hearts desire and that is why we refrain from things that we love and desire because Allah does not love it that is why they complain this is a return with loss this is not what we wanted so after being resurrected they say it would in that case be a return with loss this is not what we lived for and surely this is not what we've died for we were not expecting life after death and once they see that they say to themselves that this is a return with loss Alonso gel says for in here's a gelatin wahida te de jambe Sahira but only it will be a single shout a single surgery which is the second blowing in the trumpet and a de jambe Sahara which means that when behold they find themselves over Earth alive after their death so this shows you in this mat kisora how short how profound and strong these verses are very short but very meaningful it's like whips of lashes you just feel it on your back waking you up listen this is not the life that you would live forever you're gonna die and the life that awaits you is on the day of judgment so do well and you will be rewarded well if you'd not do that you will be punished and you will be shocked when you are resurrected because this is not what you have prepared for for either whom be Sahara as Sahara is the surface of the earth after it changes now in these beautiful short ayahs we could learn a number of lessons among them is as stated before the lodge the Virgin can swear with whatever of his creatures that he would want to swear with and we will find that throughout the remaining sewers that the last words with their dawn with Sun with the moon with the night with everything that a larger girl would like to honor and we will come to discuss this more inshallah at the proper time and place secondly we learned that the souls of the believers are extracted in a very gentle way while the souls of the disbelievers are extracted in a painful way and thirdly again and again and again allah azza wajal plants the Ikeda and the belief of the day of judgment and the process of resurrection on and on in our hearts so that this would be the best driver for us to please him and staying away from what displeases him because the more I believe in the existence of the day of judgement the better person I would be so before I do a specific sin I would think twice because I know that even if I'm not caught by the law I know that a larger job would hold me accountable for what I do after that Allah Azza WA JAL entertains if you wish his messenger muhammad sallallaahu are you send him we know that the prophet aerosol son faced a lot of troubles in Mecca he was ordered not to defend himself the Muslims were ordered not to attack or to fight or to raise a sword and they were suffering because it was a handicap match the disbelievers the idol worshipers would torture them would abuse them would say whatever they want while the Muslims could not fight back for 13 years they were ordered to tolerate and to be patient and this had a toll on the Muslims and especially on the Prophet that is a lot of self who watches his loved ones those who believed in him being tortured being imprisoned and even forced to migrate and Eve to Abyssinia for nothing except that they believed in the oneness of Allah Almighty and is this a crime when is virtue a crime well nowadays it is a crime if you abide by your religion you're a criminal if a woman decides to protect her chastity and wears the niqab that covers her beauty it's a crime and she would be fined for that why because you worship Allah if you worship Satan if you don't believe in the exit of Allah you're the man to them but by Allah you will suffer in hell and that is what you will learn from reading the Quran how to free yourself from worshiping servants and creatures to only worshiping Allah the Lord of the heavens and the earth so with all this in mind with the suffering of the prophet alayhi salatu salam Allah Dajjal entertains his messenger with stories of previous messengers that preceded him so that he would follow their examples and he would feel relaxed he will find the tranquility that the road am walking on is the same road that all messengers and prophets of Allah have walked before me so Allah tells him he'll attack a hadith or Moosa has there come to you the story of Moses peace be upon him and Moses to those who do not know is one of the firm and strong will messengers of Allah and their five know he brahim Musa Aisha and Muhammad sallallahu yoson they're the strong and firm will messages of Allah and Allah Azza WA JAL ordered the Prophet I'll accept to be patient as they were patient as well prophet Moses is the one whom Allah has spoken to as we will come to see insha Allah Allah spoke to him directly this means that he heard a Las voice and this is an honor no one shared with Moses other than the Prophet Allah saw some whom Allah has spoken to as well and he is the one whom Allah saw Jill had written down the tablets with his own hands for him he is the messenger most mentioned in the Quran in so many verses in so many sewers Allah origin has narrated to us his life story his biography since he was born and how his mother feared for his life and throw him in the river and how he was taken into the palace of Pharaoh who wanted to kill him only to up bring him to become a man and how he killed the Coptic and how he fled Egypt and how he's migrated for ten years and came back as a messenger and how he called Pharaoh to Islam and how Allah so JAL split the sea into two for him and how Allah Azza WA JAL gave him the message and spoke to him all of this was given to prophet musa peace be upon him who shares a lot of his life events with the Prophet Ali so some there are many similarities between both of them and we love musa peace be upon him as muslims we love him you know why when the Prophet Azam ascended to the seventh heaven in the miraculous night journey allah azza wajal mandated 50 prayers within the day and night now imagine 24 hours this means that every half an hour there's a prayer you have to go to the Masjid when he came back and told prophet Musa about these 50 prayers Musa gave him an advice peace be upon him he said go back to your Lord and ask him for reduction because I've been with the Jews and your people are not so different your people they will not be able to fulfill this ask Allah for reduction so the Prophet goes back to Allah and asks him for reduction and Allah takes five out of the 15 and he goes back to Moosa and Moosa says to him go back and ask for a reduction and a lot of uses five and five and five until only five daily prayers remain and Musa tells him go back and ask Allah for reduction in the Prophet says I'm too shy to go back so many times and Allah so it'll reveals to them that what I say does not change they are five times but they are fifty and reward so we are grateful to prophet musa peace be upon him that he reduced this bird from 50 into 5 easy beautiful nice prayers we perform in the day in the night and we barely feel it alhamdulillah the almighty all praise be to Allah the Almighty yet unfortunately still Muslims find these five daily prayers a burden and they don't pray it on time this is all the time we have until we meet next time via Manila Salam aleikum wa rahmatullah he or barakato any more what I saw"
