  "title": "Is having a normal shower the same as wudu? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Chef if a person takes a shower is that the same as we do like everything you know take a regular shower every single day okay so if I understood Sam's question he's asking is taking a shower every day the same as taking wudu the answer is no wudu has to be performed in a sequence because there are six pillars for wudu without one of them the water is invalid washing the face washing the arms till the elbow wiping over the head washing the feet simultaneously doing this and having the order which is face arms head and feet not mixing up the sequence these are the six pillars so you have to have those when you make voodoo having a shower if you don't intend wudu and do these steps in fulfilling the pillars you're not in the state of wudu except and this is an exception which you have to pay attention to General showers daily showers showers for cleaning showers for going to the jummah on Friday Etc they are all not wodo is not included unless you specifically follow the procedure except when you take a shower with the intention of uplifting a major ritual impurity that you have so if you had a Nightfall nocturnal emission or you had intimacy with your spouse and you are in the state of janaba this is known as major ritual impurity if you take Russell to uplift it so you can be able to pray or to read the Quran or to enter a Masjid wodo is embedded even though you did not follow the procedure and fulfilling the six pillars because it's a minor ritual impurity that is embedded in the bigger picture like if I come to the Masjid to pray though and I find that the congregation has started now I remember the prophet saying Allah Do not sit if you enter a Masjid until you pray to rakas but they're praying the congregation of prophet of Allah what to do go ahead and join them so I pray with them foreign were the bigger picture that included in them the turacas which the prophet ordered us not to sit until we pray likewise when you have a major ritual impurity and you uplift it with Russell or in a shower then the wudu is included in it and Allah Knows Best"
