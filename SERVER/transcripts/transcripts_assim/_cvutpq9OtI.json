  "title": "Understanding how the Sun Prosrates to Throne & things way above our paygrade | Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "now remember a Musa Hayden hoodie may Allah be pleased with him was with the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam once when the Prophet showed and pointed out the Sun while it was setting so it's moderate time almost so the prophet said to abu sa'id do you know where the sun is headed to I wish I said no I have no knowledge of that so the Prophet says that the Sun is prostrating at a lost throne asking Allah permission to rise again and it rises well and we know that there will come a time when Allah does not give it the permission to rise from the east and it rises from the West and this is one of the ten signs of the Day of Judgment now one due to our limited knowledge would say come on man what do you mean that the Sun sets frustrating at the throne of Allah soldiers seeking permission when the Sun sets here it rises somewhere else and when it rises somewhere where else it sets somewhere else come on give me a break it to give you when you speak about something that is way above your pay grade now if I ask you what are the dimensions that govern our world you would say it's the height the width and the length so these are three dimensions and recently they've added the dimension of time and the relativity theory of Einstein and how valid it is or not and going for them and back so these are the three dimensions the four dimensions that we can related to but this does not apply to the world of the unseen things happen in the grave in different dimensions that are owned in this three or two foot by six or whatever in this hole we know for sure that the dead person is made to sit in two angels come and interrogate him and either punish him or reward him we know that this grave is expand it can be filled with light from Jenna a window to paradise is opened all this happens in this small area by which dimensions are we talking about definitely not ours the profit on the night journey are his salat wa salam the bora the right he took it travels faster than light and it's faster not equivalent so we can even imagine it goes and passes by the grave of Musa near the red dome or the red dune that is where he's buried and the prophet said I saw him praying there and in a flash they are at al-aqsa Masjid in Jerusalem and he the Prophet sees him there and he leads him in prayer as he leads the rest of the prophets and messengers of Allah who were summoned there through dimensions we don't understand then in a flash he reaches the fourth heaven and he meets Musa again so what dimensions are we talking about something that does not relate to this world therefore when you hear things of the unseen whether the Sun is frustrating to the throne of Allah to Allah so gel at the throne or not you do not think of that of your own by or your own intellect with your own standards which is height width and length where are the jinn where are the Angels how they travel how they live how they exist this is something that does not fall under our calculations so we have to always think of how great allah azzawajal is and devote our forms of worship our ebody sincerely only to him subhana wa ta'ala and while doing this we Majin knows best"
