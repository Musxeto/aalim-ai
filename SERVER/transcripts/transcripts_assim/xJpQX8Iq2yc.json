  "transcript": "Amin from Sweden. Is it permissible for someone to work in a warehouse that is owned by a pharmaceutical company where we have to pick up products and put it into boxes? The vast majority of the products are medicine but there are some that are sex toys and condoms. Is it permissible? Okay, I understand your question. And the answer is yes, it is permissible in Sha Allah to work in such a warehouse because condoms and sex toys can be used in halal and can be used in haram. Spouses can use it in halal means without any problem. So there's nothing wrong in doing that and in Sha Allah the work is halal. Have you ever taken a counselling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counselling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it Insha Allah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
