  "transcript": "Adnan from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Where did you get that the rulers who rule with other than Allah's law are kafir? I mean generally I'm asking you, you're telling me about a ruling that would enable me to fight the rulers and to overthrow governments. I'm asking you, where did you get this ruling from? Adnan? And Adnan is gone. See this is a problem. Even if this causes bloodshed, killing people, giving takfeer to Muslim rulers. What brother Adnan was referring to was verse number 44 in Surah Al-Ma'idah, chapter 5. Where Allah says Whoever does not implement what Allah has legislated in shariah, then those are the disbelievers. So people say, oh, ok this country, the ruler does not implement shariah, he's kafir. Ok, hold your horses. Verse 45 of the same surah. The following verse, Allah says Those who do not rule with what Allah has legislated, they are wrongdoers. From kafir to wrongdoers. Ok, wrongdoers sometimes could refer to disbelievers. Let's go and fight. Hold your horses. The same surah, two verses after that. Verse 47. So 44, 45, and 47. Same surah. Allah says And those who do not rule with what Allah has legislated, they are sinners. I think we might need to think it over. So not every person who rules with other than what Allah has legislated is a kafir. Yes, if someone stands up and says I believe that the prescribed punishment mentioned in the Quran is inapplicable. We cannot practice it. It doesn't suit our time. Ok, you're a kafir. Someone says we cannot chop the hand of a thief. We cannot flog a fornicator. We cannot stone an adulteress or an adulterer. What are you doing? This is the law of Allah. Someone says the law of inheritance is No, no, no, no. Allah says give the son double the daughter. No, we make them equal. This is Allah's law in the Quran. Nope, we change it. He's a kafir. But I'm talking about different things. Someone who does it out of his own whims and desires to gain worldly benefit. Of course, he's making one of the major sins in Islam for doing this. Someone who's transgressing because he's favoring a friend or a relative over someone else. So he's twisting the laws or breaking it. But he believes that these are the laws of Allah. This is a different story and the topic is too long. But I hope this clarifies it."
