  "transcript": "latifa says if i understood her question correctly she's saying about selling a jacket to someone who may not wear hijab etc there's nothing wrong in selling clothes to people that you're not 100 certain that they will wear it outside without hijab otherwise we would have closed all shops that sell clothes we don't know the women who are buying it will be abiding by hijab or no selling clothes is halal using that particular piece of cloth in something haram or halal this depends on the one who buys it likewise if i have water i'm a supermarket i wouldn't investigate uh what do you want this bottle of water for excuse me what do you what are you buying it for maybe you're going to make ice cubes so that you can drink with your whiskey this is this guy's nuts this is not of your responsibility selling bottled water is it what he does with it is his problem"
