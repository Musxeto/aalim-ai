  "title": "Greasy Right Hand, pass food with right hand or left hand? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Ahnaf from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum. Walaikumussalam. Sometimes I eat with other people and they ask me to pass a spoon or a glass of water. Since I eat with my hand, my right hand is usually greasy. If I use this greasy hand to give it to them, they may feel offended. What should I do in this case? The Prophet ï·º said, when you eat, eat with your right hand. When you drink, drink with your right hand. When you give, give with your right hand. When you receive, receive with your right hand. Because the devil, Satan, eats and drinks and gives and takes with his left hand. So either you tell them that my hand is greasy, if I do this I'm going to do it with my right hand. Or you do it with your left hand and say, may Allah forgive me but this is the only clean hand I have. And due to necessity, this might be acceptable inshaAllah and Allah knows best."
