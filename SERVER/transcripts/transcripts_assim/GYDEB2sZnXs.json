  "transcript": "perfect with no flaws at all are the laws of Allah a way of life a way of life a way of life a way of life way of brothers and sisters in Islam welcome to this episode wherein we continue the discussion on the domestic challenges which face these spouses and I believe it's time to provide Solutions or shall we mention why are the problems first why are the problems what are the causes for the problems you know that we're coming from an Islamic background yes therefore as Muslims we believe that any Calamity that befalls on a Muslim is due to his shortcomings so whatever happens of a Calamity that is because of your own doing Andel would forgive a lot Allah and Muhammad s said this may Allah have mercy on his soul he said that I commit a sin and I see the traces of my sin on the behavior of my wife which means that that if you do something wrong if you're sinful this would affect your marriage this would affect your job this would affect your life with directly or indirectly you may not know this but this is your own doing and that is why previously they were so righteous that they can count their sins nowadays right left and center and we don't know which one of the so many sins that we've committed was or resulted in what we're facing now so I believe that if you want to have a happy life stop doing sin yeah but is that a general rule that every time something bad happens it's because of a sin that takes us in a direction where we're saying that everything it's like it's the fault of you it's either a test from Allah it's an hour like 50 something you have done and for example in the Battle of we know that the companions may Allah be pleased with them disobeyed direct order from the prophet and came down from the mountain and hence this caused a great fatality in the army of the Muslims and Allah mentioned this in the Quran that what had happened those were were martyred and those who were injured due to the fault of you meaning as a whole but we can give so many examples of you know things that happened to the prophet it wasn't because of Any sin and that's just a test from I think that's just an amazing topic that you've uh opened and and I can't resist commenting on this because uh yeah I think this really is to do with your internal State this is what it's all about right and let's just go back to the example right now there is this interaction between the husband and the wife but how do you react to your wife she says something or she does something or something happens in your house how do you react to it you know it may so two different people May react to the same incident in in totally different ways one your reaction may be positive what your wife may say may not annoy you it may not upset you at all why because you are in a state of peace and Tranquility within yourself but your sins what does your sin really do it actually disrupts you internally okay and so when your wife says something then you don't respond to it in a good way you take it in a bad way so I think the thing is here is that uh this is generally about calamity is a Calamity can happen to somebody to two different people for one person it's a Calamity and for another person it's an opportunity that person increases in righteousness increases in good deeds and it's something that actually brings them closer to Allah whereas the other person feels it as if this really is a punishment it's exactly the same thing happening to two different people so I think that the reality is is that it's how you respond and and that how you respond is conditional upon whe whether youying Allah because in the previous episode we were saying that oh it's a communication issue and now here we're saying it's your sins that caused this so if the guy is sinless then there's going to be no marital problem yeah may I I would like to add something we mentioned commenting on the previous episode about the communication Okay so a sister should understand that her role actually at home is to make her home Paradise on Earth Heaven on Earth second that what Allah subh said second the man needs that place to find that tranquility and peace and a man needs sometimes to be by himself give him that okay you come you want to be by Alone by yourself you have problems you need to to think about them and he doesn't give you that chance this is sorry just very briefly for the Sisters to understand men this is how men deal with things generally they sit and they try and figure out their problems themselves and when they want some help they're going to go and ask someone right but whereas women tend to share their problems and communicate their problems so I just want to say in terms of so we need to understand it's the nature of the man so if your husband wants to be himself leave him give him that okay and even when you want to to help him seek the right moment be smart when you should know when to talk to him is he in the mood or not now you are not in the mood you have problems yourself oh I am your partner tell me everything come on leave me alone okay I want to yes this is the reality I want to think okay when I need your help I will let you know okay so and also we seek advice from each other because the prophet s is our example and he s's opinion and piece of advice and he acted upon that so this is very important that and then let's flip and I I'll let you continue right because then the the woman if we're saying that she needs to communicate then then he needs to listen to her and so yes yes and a time where you that's we mentioned before the prophet wasam would sit with his wives after is listening and you have to be attentive and listen to her and let her talk but we should know that we cannot make a man a woman or a woman a man everyone has his own different personality this how Allah subhana wa tala created us regarding how about the marital problems that took place in the prophet's house is is this because of the sins no but Allah is teaching Us in the person of the Prophet Sall alaihi wasallam because he's the role model he's the example so Allah is tell telling us see if this is my prophet and he had these problems who are you so this is natural that it is going to happen in your house so Allah is teaching the whole umah in the person of the Prophet Salli wasallam for example he makes his Prophet to forget in the Salah to teach us how to behave when we commit such a thing so the prophet Salli wasallam is an example to follow that's why everyone of us has a secret things in his life but there's nothing secret in the life of the Prophet sallam you know everything about him but truthfully now that answers that issue but one can easily turn around and say okay fine then the prophets who suffered and and we don't have we don't necessarily have that very lesson we know their Sunnah was not you know preserved like the Sunnah of the Prophet isn't it that the scholars have actually addressed this issue by saying that yes the calamities befall people and when they befall people there are various reasons we are not talking from that perspective but that is that seem seem to have been an issue when it comes the why Allah test the people okay to test the people to elevate their status or to expiate their sins or but now Allah is teaching the um in the person of the prophet because he is the example so Allah made everything to happen in the life of the Prophet Sall wasallam so that when I study the life of the Prophet Sall wasallam and I deduce lessons you see this how this happened in the life of the Prophet Sall wasall and this how the remedy this how he behaved this is this this is that I believe that when I make or I face a Calamity and I attribute this to my sins that it is positive for me yes because it makes me revise my life and try to get rid of my shortcomings though I don't you know make fun of someone who had a Calamity say haa Allah is punishing you for this this is not for me yeah if a tsunami takes place in XY Z I would say that this is a test from Allah but I wouldn't say that this is Allah is is punishing them this there might be some of them being punished some of them being tested some of them Allah is blessing them with This calamity so that it would erase their sins or Elevate their status in Paradise those who drown SM them for them so we have to take a short break inshallah and we will pick up right afterwards we'll be right back don't go anywhere Salam alikum a way of life a way of life way of life welcome back so U among the reasons or among the reasons why there are problems is perfectionists or people really trying to create uh they they try they wish they could customize the spouse like you would do for a car or for a garment and truthfully this is impossible because they were already created by Allah the way they are is that one of the reasons and if so how do we get over that obstacle very big mistake uh people making marriage um I mean actually this sort of goes back to the previous we didn't even mention this you know I'm going to marry someone who's like that but you know what I'll shape them the way I want I'll make that person the way I want to make them it's a big mistake you know and I think this is a very important point I mean specifically the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam for example mentioned about women you know that she's made from the bent rib and the most bent part of the rib is the top part so uh don't try to straighten her because straightening her will be divorce so enjoy her the way she is and so this attempt to try and uh check where it's the wife trying to change the husband or the husband trying to change the wife and we're talking about some essential characteristics we're not try talking about here a sin and you're trying to get your spouse to stop sinning of course you have to GL clarified that yeah but there's some basic characteristics a person has don't think you can mold a person and I think that's a big mistake in marriages that I want this person like this and that can lead to some very big problems it often happens when like the wife may be sensitive and then the husband says something and she she starts crying and says stop crying stop crying now and then she cries more and it just doesn't work it's like you just want her to instantly you know act accordingly but it's her nature that at this time she wants to cry and Men sometimes we fail in and recognizing that no the reason she cries she carries on clients because you don't understand her yes because she expecting you to come yeah give her a hug want H okay I'm sorry okay brothers and sisters felt yeah it is very essential really let's have a group you Subhan Allah it is just like a child he needs that just try it when it happens and you'll see things will cool down Subhan Allah and one of the Mas said you see he said don't believe your wife when she tells you if you are a man divorce me I don't want to live with you any anymore you know what he wants to say love me me more H what a funky way to say it yeah love me more he doesn't mean it he doesn't mean it but thean will not leave you alone oh come on be a man don't see you don't have any manhood what I tell people like she she's challenging you you say or leave the house and he will be maybe chasing you come back oh coward come say yes I am cowed okay okay bye go till things cool down okay come back I'm sorry that's what happened made Ali upset Ali he left the house he went to the Masid he slept in the Masid slept the prophet s wasam came Fatima where is he left the house and he was angry so she made him made Ali angry the prophet wasallam went to the Masid find Ali sleeping the cff fell down his cheek was in the dust said oh father of dust get out went back think cool down so we it's a matter of understanding and so when she's crying and she stop crying the reason you're are saying stop crying because it hurts you CU you feel inside you the poor girl is so you want her to that's why if you smack your child and your child is is crying you see okay hold it stop because you feel the guilt inside you you feel the pain okay so that is very so going back to the issue of you know seeking Perfection it's a disease no it's not it's not a disease the illness is in wanting things to be not on their nature for example you marry a woman and you don't want her to feel jealous this is illogical it is something built in she's programmed to be jealous and it's a positive thing what's not positive is if she acts upon it and burns your second wife's house then you have a problem this is an illness and let me go back and reflect on what abim said now when you get married you have to accept your spous house as they are you have to unconditionally love them for who they are now there are small things here and there that you may change or request that it would be modified and edited a bit in you and in them my problem is when people do not live every moment for its own value sometimes Satan comes and they make them fall back and look at the past and they expect people not to change so I would reflect on my 30 uh years of marriage for example and I would think oh my wife was like this and that now she's changed and I neglect the good attributes that were perfected and I only focused on the things that she picked up during the journey which may not be that good but I neglect the good side and this is one of the biggest issues the prophet said thisam he said a man should not scrutinize and you know look for the shortcomings of another believing woman if he likes something or if he abhor if he abhor or dislikes something he will like so many other things M so don't be negative yes so living at the present have appreciation to what you have and don't look back because if you look at for example how she looks like 30 years ago you're not looking how she used to cook 30 years ago now she is mAh a professional cook so you have to weigh things better it sounds like we're always coming from the man's perspective it's always like what does the man get what ises the man I think a lot of of husbands are like tab they're just like they're lazy in the house they want to be served they're watching TV they want their wife to be like this and whatnot and you find a lot of men are not stepping up to be a man maybe a lot of solutions will be if this person you know figures out how to be a man you know things can happen we're almost like making it like the woman it's all her job to make sure the marriage goes good by serving him and giving him his time and cooking for him and looking good and the woman has the same problem see she always sits back and reflects oh my husband used to take me out he used to do this he used to do that now now she did does not reflect on his minimum wage he used to charge and not buying her things now he's buying her necklaces gold diamonds he's taking her instead of the restaurant once a week as he used to he's doing that once a year but to a resort for example for a week or two with the kids are taking her forra so the wives this is says she doesn't want that she doesn't want to go to Resort that's for him he wants to go to the resort the prophet said that they are ungrateful unfortunately so this is a feature that females t stand out at the crowd with but men there are I have to agree there are so many men my wife always tells me this she says you guys are lucky the prophet says that we are ungrateful and that's why we some of us would be in hell but you guys the prophet did not do this to you yet you are also ungrateful and I say by Allah we men are ungrateful yet the responsib IL is on us reduces this ungratefulness while the responsibility upon you makes this as a priority that you should be grateful for so I know where you're coming from and I definitely agree with you that the sisters have the right to reciprocate but not you know the in the other episode where you're saying that companion that his hair is going wild and he's this and that was talking about and then when he went and fixed himself up you know probably he just took a shower that's it he just took a shower and she's like he's the best like sometimes it's that simple for the men and I actually um if men put in a little effort they might actually find the marriages a lot better true with they just shower and comb their hair I agree and I think she there's another thing I want to point out specifically about what the prophet sallallah alai wasallam mentioned about the ingratitude of women but this can go anyway uh whether the man is like this or the woman is like this it's not just in gratitude it's it's a specific way of being ungrateful he does one thing wrong and then she treats him as if he never did a good thing says exactly this is what I'm saying and this is you know this is more than just in gratitude this is aul this is a really a nasty oppression on someone because yeah you can say you know you didn't do this and you didn't do that but to treat the person like you never did anything good you know in your in your life and I mean the husband can do this as well but it tends to be a little bit more uh the other way we can know that from the Hadith so it's specific type of and I think anyway generally just to mention um that we should develop a gratitude attitude you know it's very important I mean I do this in my family we sit down not regularly but we sit down even the kids we all sit down and we just think about something you know we're grateful for we keep a little diary you know and everyone in goes around the room and we say okay what are we grateful to Allah for for this week or for this day you know when we think about it and what would life have been like if we didn't have this thing and you know there's no reason why the husband and the wife couldn't just sit down and just talk about why I'm grateful that you're my husband and why I'm grateful that that I'm your wife you know we you can do things like that there's nothing wrong and it it m increases the love between the husband and the wife and and our love for Allah subhana tala and this is what Allah reminds us when he say Allah has given you from his bounties where they are innumerable you can't count them you can't count them you can't and if you try you cannot so the blessings of Allah Allah has overwhelmed you with his uh blessings so we have to be grateful otherwise Allah will take away this blessing if you don't thank him Allah will remove deprive you of such blessing so you have if you want to maintain and protect Allah's Blessings by you should thank Allah subh T constantly always always you should thank Allah subhah wa tala but regarding be idealistic the stories we mentioned of SAR is an example we should keep always s Omar he made the comparison okay if he gets upset now what is it not a big deal but see what she is doing for me perhaps we can conclude the episode just to be be fair and balance things out that the prophet did say the best amongst you to to men are the best to their wives and I am the best to my wife so so that the sisters will not feel that it's all them the man is expected to actually be the best to his family and we ask Allah to enable all the men to act according to the Hadith and the sisters to be you know concerned and and worried about the narrations which address them in particular and we will not end this yet inah we will be having another episode dealing with other aspects of marriage for tuning in way of"
