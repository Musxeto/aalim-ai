  "transcript": "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Now, we've learnt to the best of our ability things that are related to evolution or wudu. But what breaks the wudu? What invalidates it and mandates it upon us to go and perform another wudu? Because this is an ongoing process. You perform wudu, after a while you break it. Then you perform another wudu, and a third, and a fourth, and this goes on until we meet our Maker Subhanahu wa ta'ala. So what are the things that invalidate wudu? If you go to the books of fiqh or jurisprudence, you'll find a lot of differences among scholars, but there are points that they don't differ upon. So in order for us as Muslims to know what is right and what is wrong, as mentioned in the Qur'an, whenever there is a dispute or a difference of opinion, we have to refer that back to Allah and to His Messenger ﷺ. And this is done by referring it back to the Qur'an and to the sunnah of the Prophet ﷺ. So they all agree, scholars agree, that anything that exits the private parts, whether it is the front passage or the back passage, this invalidates the wudu. So whether a person urinates, defecates, passes wind, or discharge comes out from his private part, such as madhi or wadi, or any discharge that comes out from his passage, this invalidates wudu. Of course, there is a difference of opinion when it comes to vaginal discharge, but we will not go into that. And if this happens, then a person's prayer is invalid. They have to perform wudu after they clean themselves. Why? Because the Prophet ﷺ said, Allah does not accept the prayer of any of you if he invalidates his wudu until he performs wudu again. So this is a, or one of the things that it is agreed upon, discharge from the private parts, anything that is emitted or comes out from a person's private parts. Number two, any form of loss of consciousness, either due to intoxication, fainting, sleep, or insanity. So the loss of reason or consciousness, this invalidates the wudu. Because the Prophet ﷺ used to order the companions not to take off their socks when they're travelling for three days and three nights, unless they fall in the major ritual impurity status, unless they have janabah. But if they answer the call of nature, if they sleep, if they urinate, then they do not have to take their socks off, rather they perform wudu and wipe over them. This hadith indicates that these three things, defecating, urinating, and sleeping, invalidates the wudu. And scholars say, the reason that sleep invalidates wudu is because when you're asleep, you are unconscious. So you don't feel yourself when you may pass wind. And there is another hadith, ﷺ said that the eye is the knot that ties the anus, meaning if the eye is closed and a person falls unconscious and asleep, then the knot that ties the anus and controls it is untied. And the possibility of passing wind is there. And this is why it invalidates wudu. Likewise, if someone is intoxicated or fainted or falls into temporary state of insanity, he doesn't know what had happened during that period, it invalidates the wudu as well. Now the exception of sleep is that if a person's sleep is something that is not considered to be deep sleep. So if a person's doses and does not sleep, and he's aware of the environment, though he takes a very, very power nap, that he's aware if someone puts his hand in his pocket, sometimes he's aware of what people speak, but actually he's in a trance. He's half sleep, half awake. So scholars say that in such a state, this sort of napping, it's not a nap, but sort of to doze a bit is not considered to be something that invalidates the wudu. Why? Because of the hadith of Anas ibn Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, that after Maghrib prayer, remember that the companions used to work before dawn till Isha prayer. So when Maghrib, sunset, comes, they're totally tired and almost burnt out. So they're waiting in the masjid for Isha prayer, and they would doze a bit like this while sitting. But they would stand up for Isha prayer without renewing their wudu. Why? Because they did not fall into deep sleep. So this is the difference between deep sleep and other than that. The third nullifier of wudu, according to our textbook, is to touch the private part of a human being without a barrier. Due to the hadith of Basra bint Safwan, may Allah be pleased with her, that the Prophet alayhis salam said, whoever touches his penis must perform wudu. And Umm Habibah, may Allah be pleased with her, our mother said, the Prophet alayhis salam said, whoever touches his private part must perform wudu. And the word private part includes male and female genital and front and back passages as well, while touching the testicles or the buttocks would not be included in breaking the wudu. And this is an issue of dispute, because there is another hadith where the Prophet was asked about touching the private part, and he said, it's part of you, it's part of your limbs. So touching it or touching your nose is the same thing, it's part of your own body. And these two hadiths conflict with one another, which made the scholars be divided. Some say it breaks your wudu, some say it doesn't break your wudu. And some scholars took the middle path by saying that, well, if one touches it with lust and desire, it breaks the wudu. And if it's touched, like when drying yourself after a shower, without any desire at all, then it does not impact the wudu, and Allah knows best. Number four, eating camel's meat. And this is only found in the Hanbali school of thought. The other schools of thought say it does not impact the wudu. However, the most authentic opinion is that it does impact the wudu. Because the Prophet salallahu alayhi wa sallam, and the hadith is in Sahih Muslim, was asked about eating mutton meat, should we perform wudu? The Prophet said, if you wish. And of course mutton meat is cooked with fire. And immediately afterwards, the Prophet was asked, if we were to eat camel's meat, should we perform wudu? The Prophet said, yes. So look at the comparison. Can we eat mutton meat and then pray without wudu? Should we perform wudu? If you wish. It's not mandatory. Eating your wudu is valid after eating mutton's meat. But when he was asked about camel's meat, he said, you have to perform wudu. Which clearly indicates that it breaks the wudu. Why? This is something we have no justification for. And like lots of things in Sharia, this is an instruction and a command from Allah. We follow, adhere and obey. Whether we know the reason and the justification of it, or not. We just simply do it. So what is the ruling when people doubt whether they have passed to end or not? Whether their wudu is broken or not? This is a problem that a lot of the Muslims face. Alhamdulillah, Islam is a religion of ease and simplicity. It's very easy to determine the ruling. So don't be confused or dragged by the traps of Satan. There is a legal maxim or an Islamic fiqh rule that states, certainty is not affected by doubt. What is certainty? I'm a human being. What is doubt? I feel like a bird. Well, this feeling, this doubt is tossed in the garbage because it cannot impact the certainty of me being human. Likewise, if I perform wudu, I know I'm in the state of wudu, three hours later, I get a doubt. Did I pass wind? Did I visit the toilets? I don't have any certainty in it. So does this doubt impact the certainty of me making wudu and invalidates my wudu? The answer is no, because doubt has no impact on certainty. Phrases of doubt, maybe, I think, I feel, perhaps, throw it in the dustbin. Ignore it, because certainty is not affected by doubt. However, if you reverse this, you will understand it better. I woke up from my sleep and I went straight to school or to work. When it's time for dhuhr, I scratch my head, not because I have dandruff, rather because I'm thinking, did I perform wudu or not? I'm doubtful. That is certain. Certainty states that I woke up from sleep, which means I'm not in the state of wudu. To move out from this certainty, to confirm that I'm in the state of wudu, I have to be also certain that I performed wudu. Because I don't have this certainty, I toss it and throw it in the dustbin and I must go and perform wudu again. Where do we get this legal maxim? From the hadith of the Prophet, when a man came to the Prophet, and he said, O Prophet of Allah, I have this problem. I keep on thinking and feeling that I've passed wind, so I don't know what to do. And this happens to us while we're sitting, while we're praying, while we're walking. I feel something popped. The Prophet said, Alayhis Salaam, do not leave your prayer, and which means do not perform wudu, until you hear a sound or you find a smell, certainty. So the feeling of movement in my stomach, I felt something came out. If I'm certain of this feeling, even if I did not hear a sound or find a smell, if I'm certain one hundred percent, yes, I passed wind. In this case, I have to go because there is certainty. But in the case of doubt, I have a feeling. This feeling has to be thrown in the dustbin until there is proof of a sound that you passed wind or a smell, an offensive odor that you passed wind, and Allah knows best. May Allah's peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad. May Allah's peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad."
