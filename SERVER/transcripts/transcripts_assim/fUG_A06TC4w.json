  "transcript": "I ask I ask a vegetarian food stall run by Hindus whether they use nutmeg or not and they said no can I trust them to eat from them if I am not sure whether the food has nutmeg or not okay first of all the issue of nutmeg has been thoroughly discussed and we said that it's an issue of dispute whether little amount is possible and permissible or not and in countries like Saudi Arabia they allow food that has not met with little amount that does not intoxicate or impact a person's sanity and it's an issue of dispute as stated earlier so if you follow either way and the shopkeeper that sells vegetarian food only states that it does not include not Megan you have no reason to disbelieve him there's no problem in buying it in sha Allah Knows Best"
