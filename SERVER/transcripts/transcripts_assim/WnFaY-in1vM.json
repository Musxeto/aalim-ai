  "transcript": "ABD from Pakistan how are you alhamdulillah so sh in my mid there are total of three imams one IM who leads m f and is and he knows Taj very well sometimes he makes mistakes here and there but like for example uh when he wants to say like he said he sometimes says Zim like he mixes the letters and now there this is one Imam the other IM other two imams they like one of them he leads Z and and I'm pretty sure that he does not know the like the not the other the like whenever I hear him say like he doesn't say properly or when he says Salam he doesn't say it properly and I've also heard him in loud prayers he doesn't know the basic M that if they make a mistake that changes the meaning for example one IM when he said when he recites a Surah when he goes the he said like he mixes it so like he mixes the word so uh like this first first of all first of all the scholars say that as long as the fa is intact this is a pillar then the whole pray prayer is inshallah valid regardless of the mistakes that Imam makes number two some letters are close to others in pronunciation that the scholars say that this is acceptable and they're so close and hence the scholars say that this is negligible and acceptable and it doesn't change the meaning likewise he's unable to say the correctly he's not an Arab so all of this is permissible especially when it comes to silent prayers if you know that he is leading the silent prayer he you don't have the right to say that his prayer is invalid because when he speaks he's unable to pronounce the words correctly he did not pronounce anything incorrectly it's a silent prayer now this WIS is prevailing unfortunately in the subcontinent where I get hundreds of calls a week on my mobile from people saying she I don't pray in the Masjid anymore why because the IM makes a mistake how do do you know said I hear him say this and that and this is wrong so how long has he been a m she he's been an Imam for 30 years Subhan Allah so for 30 years this man is unable to read the faat properly and you who just started practicing five months ago and you yourself don't know Arabic became mallah SI and you are capable of correcting and uh uh making mistakes or detecting mistakes of others a little bit far-fetched so move on unless there is a clear mispronunciation of the F and the guy knows how to say it correctly but he doesn't no this is totally unacceptable there's nothing acceptable in this but he is unable to say better and there's no one else to lead the prayer other than him wise no you cannot pray behind such a person so I hope this answers your question"
