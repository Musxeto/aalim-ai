  "transcript": "Our first caller is Sidi from Germany. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. How are you Sheikh? I'm doing great. It's been a long time you haven't called. Yeah I was very busy but I'm happy to come back Alhamdulillah. Hayyakallah. How can I help you my friend? Sheikh it was said that a layman has to follow a scholar and if it's not possible then he has to follow a method with the Sheikh that he guides him. What if the layman lives in a location like in the west where he does not have a Sheikh in his area and what should the layman do? Well the best ideal situation for such an individual is to learn Islam directly from the Qur'an and the Sunnah through the resources that are available to him. A lot of the people in the west, in Europe, in America, in places, some places don't even have a masjid. Let alone a student of knowledge or a scholar. So what do such individuals do? First of all they have to do their level best because always remember Allah Azza wa Jal, one of his beautiful names is Al-Ghafoor, Al-Raheem, Al-Ghaffar, Al-Tawwab, Al-Lateef. All of these names indicate that he's most forgiving, most merciful and that he's kind and that he's subtle. So Allah is not eager to throw us in hell. As long as we're doing our level best, we're trying to find the truth through all means possible only to please Allah not to please our own desires like so many people do. Nowadays people are not interested in knowing what the Qur'an and the Sunnah state. They just want to follow their whims and desires. They don't have any evidences. So if you are not in a position to find a scholar or a student of knowledge to learn from, do your level best to do your own learning because you can't do anything else. However with the grace of Allah, Alhamdulillah, nowadays these new technologies have made things much easier than before. So through the social media, YouTube and the likes, you can find thousands and thousands of beneficial video clips for Sheikh Abdel Aziz Ibn Baz, for Sheikh Muhammad Ibn Saleh Al-Uthaymeen, for Sheikh Al-Albani translated to your language and you can find your answer and learn little by little. Also there are lots and lots of students of knowledge who are trusted in their religion, in their moral conduct, in their ethics that you also can follow online and Allah Azzawajal knows best."
