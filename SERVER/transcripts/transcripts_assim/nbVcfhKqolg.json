  "transcript": "Sarah from the UK. And my question is, you know when the prayer there's Adhan and there's Iqama, let's say do you have to pray straight off? I can't still pray up. Also when I pray I don'tâ€¦ Sarah, Sarah, you have only one question to ask, I apologize. But let me understand your question. So you're saying to me that you're in home and you hear the Adhan is called, do you have to pray immediately or must you wait until the congregation in the masjid is over then you can pray? Is this your question? Yeah, also I wanted to ask, let's say if I pray after Adhan 10 minutes, will my prayer still be counted or not? Okay, again you managed to sneak a second question. So should I punish you and not answer both questions? No, I'm kind and forgiving. Alhamdulillah, may Allah increase my kindness. Anyhow, listen, every prayer has a beginning and has an end. And this is why prayers were prescribed at a specific times. So if you pray it before the beginning time, your prayer is invalid. If you pray it after the time is over, your prayer is invalid. Now each prayer has a beginning and an end and if you go to my website or to my YouTube channel there are material that will tell you and explain to you but I don't have time to do it now. Let's assume it's Dhuhr. Dhuhr is at 12 o'clock, PM, the Adhan. It ends when the actual Asr prayer is called for according to the Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanbali school of thought, not according to the Hanafi school of thought because their timing is wrong. So the vast majority of Muslims, the three schools of thought, say that it begins Asr at this specific time when the shade of an erect object is equivalent to its length. This is when the Asr begins and this is when the Dhuhr ends. So if it starts at 12 o'clock, ends at 3 o'clock, you can pray any time between 12 and 3. So if you pray at 12.30 seconds, prayer is valid. And if you pray 2.55 and conclude before the Adhan of Asr, your prayer is valid without any problem. I hope this answers your question."
