  "transcript": "Bint Adam from Pakistan. I hope your Ramadan is going great In Sha Allah. It's excellent. Thank you so much. Sheikh I asked you a question recently but I didn't quite get the answer perhaps it was a little misunderstood. Please allow me to convey it briefly. Briefly. Sheikh to simplify. Yes I'll be very brief. Sheikh just to simplify if a person has fifty dollars, twenty dollars of which are lawful but thirty are unlawful. He did not separate the thirty dollars, gave the entire amount of fifty dollars in zakah. I just want to know would the entire amount remain nullified just because the total amount included a portion of Haram wealth? No, no the whole amount is valid. The twenty dollars that are zakat are valid and the thirty dollars that are Haram are considered to be cleansed. You will not be rewarded for them. There is no charity in them. There is no sadaqa in them because Allah is Tayyib and does not accept except what is Tayyib. Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala does not accept anything that is not pure. So the twenty dollars that are halal, these are accepted among the zakat. The thirty dollars that are Haram, these are wasted in the sense that you've cleansed your wealth from it. You have to get rid of it. But when you give it to the poor, you will not be rewarded for that and Allah knows best. And have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
