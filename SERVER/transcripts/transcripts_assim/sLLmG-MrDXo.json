  "transcript": "Abdullah from Canada Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Is it weird for someone to want hardship to feel closer to Allah, to feel loved by Allah? It is totally weird and out of the question Because it's like testing Allah Azza Wa Jal Come on, bring it on, show me some hardship and I'll show you how a strong Muslim I am Akhi, this is nuts, this is crazy, who are you testing? You don't speak like this with someone on worldly measures who could beat the heck out of you Let alone speak to the owner of the heavens and the earth and the creator of everything we see And the most merciful, the most compassionate Instead of asking him for mercy, for his kindness, for his generosity Instead of asking him to make you steadfast on Islam without testing you You go ahead and cross the limits? This is totally insane It was reported that one of the Salaf said, Oh Allah, test me with whatever you want And you will see how patient and tolerant I am So Allah Azza Wa Jal tested him that urine would not come out There is a medical terminology, it's the opposite of urine incontinence So it would not come out Why? I don't know, I'm not a medical doctor You go and check with him So the man was in pain and agony And he used to go down to the masjids and talk to the youngsters, the young kids Doing tahfidh al-Quran and say, ask dua for your uncle Bahlool Because he lied and he's unable to tolerate and be patient Akhi, no one can test Allah Azza Wa Jal And I think it's even mentioned in the Bible When the devil crossed paths with Isa peace be upon him And he told him, if you trust Allah, throw yourself from a mountain And Isa peace be upon him said, you do not test Allah Azza Wa Jal Allah tests you So this is totally insane That's why at the time of the Prophet, a man, a companion Fell sick and he was so sick, he was like a small bird that was shaken He lost all of his weight So the Prophet visited him, peace be upon him He said, this is strange Did you invoke Allah? Did you ask Allah for anything? And the man said, yes I said, oh Allah, whatever I was supposed to face as punishment On the Day of Judgment and Hellfire, bring it on to me here So it would cleanse my sins And the Prophet was outraged, peace be upon him He said, subhanAllah, and who can tolerate this? Why didn't you ask Allah Azza Wa Jal for forgiveness for al-afiyah? Ask Allah Azza Wa Jal for forgiveness and for health and for well-being Because there's nothing better on earth after certainty than well-being And Allah knows best"
