  "title": "How do I convince them there's no Sunnah prayer before Friday (Jummah) prayer ?",
  "transcript": "ABD from the UK I have a question about the Friday J the sun prayer before J you said there's no sun but there in Islamic Q Anda that states that states that every prayer every between two two and AD this prayer and also and they stated that said that he used to pray four before uh the prayer and four after the prayer so how can I convince people that uh that the the two for the J prer is not valid that's there's no J prayer there's no PR before J how can I convince that is there any that states there before before the issue is not how to convince people who cares what they do and what they don't do it's not my job to convince people my job is to show them what the prophet didat and his companions now if they misunderstand or they quote Tom or dick Hari and they go against the mainstream of the Sunnah who cares about what you've quoted that IM nawi said the prophet said between every and there is two this is an authentic Hadith but this is not related to J why because at the time of the Prophet when the IM entered when the prophet entered the mid and said and sat down bil gave thean so now after thean is over the prophet immediately stood up and started to do the when are you going to pray the two Ras oh no no no we pray the two Ras at the very very first aan there wasn't any first aan at the time of the Prophet there was only one aan the second aan that comes prior to that was introduced byman so Abu Bakr never called it om AR never called it andman called it later on may Allah be pleased with him because Medina was expanding and even then nobody prayed the sunah between this first aan thatman introduced because nobody considered it to be aan so coming to the Hadith of masb mas may Allah be pleased with him again would have prayed these four Ras before and after not on J on on but on the day of J nobody prayed a prescribed Sunnah simply because the prophet didn't do itam the companions did not do it did not do it did not do it now coming to your question how or where would we find in the Sunnah that you should not do this it doesn't work this way it's like the people of innovation coming to me and say to me show me where the Prophet said don't celebrate my M I said du there is nothing in the Sunnah that says this said ah we won so we will celebrate mid I said okay show me where in the Sunnah the prophet said m is not for and it's not two he didn't he prayed three okay I win no this is how he prayed it alhamdulillah and this is how he did not celebrate and this is how not he did not pray before J any uh prescribed Sunnah in sh the essence of it is you don't you do not introduce things to it without a and you don't reverse this by saying bring me something that proves that we can't do this no you want to make this part of the religion you bring me evidence that this is part of the religion bring me Hadith that it is not permissible to raise your hands after every F Salah and make Dua and wipe your body and shampoo it and make it in congregation or the IM and the whole bring me a Hadith I said no you're the one who's introducing in the religion what's not part of it you should bring the Hadith stating that yes this is permissible to do it in this fashion because Allah says today I have completed your religion and accepted and and and and perfected my favor upon you and accepted Islam to be your religion so if it were wasn't part of Islam at the time of the Prophet Alam and you're introducing it now how could it be part of Islam doesn't make any sense I hope this makes sense to you"
