  "transcript": "a sister says I want to know if my husband should attend all gatherings of or picnics in his family without me please note that his family does not like me at all without any valid reason at first I used to be among them but the thing is they make fun of me they criticize me by beating around the bush me and my husband we are tired of this please clarify the fault of a son towards his parents in this case well to answer your last question the father of his parents the forth of thus of the son towards his parents is to be obedient respectful and dutiful even if they are bad with you as a wife even if they abuse you even if they make fun of you this does not allow him to be disobedient disrespectful or undutiful you say sure but I'm his wife said yes yet he is that their son so you and your in-laws don't have anything obligating you to see one another they are not your kinship so if you decided not to see them at all not to visit them and not to have them visit you not to buy caught them completely but no strings attached they don't like my presence I don't like to see them so don't go let your husband go alone you do not want him to push you down their throat if they don't like you as you claim I'm not addressing the issue all in all because there is a possibility that you are too sensitive and if we investigate we will find that they are not bad people but you are too sensitive in the way you are dealing with them but this is not our topic in short assuming that they don't really like you and they make fun of you don't go who cares stay home stay with the children stay alone do something beneficial let your husband go and come back let this be a time off for both of you to renew your marriage when you meet again after he comes back in sha Allah as for the scent there is no sin on you none whatsoever if you totally do not go to them or visit them or talk to them there's no sin because they're not your kinship however any sound and and smart lady would know that keeping the bare minimum of communication a phone call every 10 days or a couple of weeks just to say hi and hang up afterwards immediately that would be beneficial"
