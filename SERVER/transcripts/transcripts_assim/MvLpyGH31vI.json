  "title": "\"Don't divide the Ummah\"; Can we unite with corrupt 'Aqeedah? (The Basics 6)",
  "transcript": "these branches of tawheed are the basics without them there is no success for the whole ummah and for us as individuals and this is why it's a grave mistake when we look at the arena and we see people focusing on things that may have some importance but they are not the real deal so in one country or one community the muslims are focusing totally on politics parties even if they have to lie or cheat or have coalitions with non-muslims or with deviant cults they say don't divide us let's unite how can you unite with someone who has a different akida who believes in a different god how can you unite with someone who endorses lgbtq plus or defends dismantling sharia laws or the prescribed punishments or ignores parts of the quran or the sunnah how can we collaborate with them how can we unite with them"
