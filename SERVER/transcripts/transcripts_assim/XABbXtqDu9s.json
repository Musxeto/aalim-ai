  "title": "Ruling on beard & Length of beard  | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "uh muneeb says what is the ruling of beard and what about its length the most authentic opinion is that it is mandatory to grow the beard and this is the consensus of all schools of thought that it is not permissible to shave it then it has to be left whether to shorten it or not it's an issue of dispute but shaving it is totally prohibited by all four schools of thought and evidence backing this up the prophet has some instructions to leave it honor it to let it go let it be so if someone is by nature in his genes he doesn't have be it do we say put fertilizers or put medication to grow it no just leave it about the length as i stated earlier it's an issue of dispute the vast majority say just leave it like it is there is a hadith by even omar and some also attributed to abu hurairah that even whenever he performed hajj he used to understand the ayah and surah the fact that you will shave and shave your hair heads and shorten he understood shortened to refer to the beard so he used to whenever he performs hajj take a fist of his beard and cut whatever is access of it but this was again his understanding the prophet aslam had never cut short his beard and he had a very wide thick beard the companions as well so this is the most authentic opinion that you should not take anything of it unless it grows to an extent that endangers your safety so if you have a beard that is this wide and this long this is a problem to those who are eating who are driving who are riding when the beat comes in their faces and their mouths and it may jeopardize their safety if they're working on a machine in this case their safety is a priority they may shorten it at least to have two fists or something of a normal length instead of that exaggerated one and a larger than those best"
