  "transcript": "Abdur Rahman from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Barakatuh. So my question is, we know from the hadith of the Prophet ï·º, he says that a man may pray and only get a tenth of the prayer or an eighth or until he reached a half. So is the prayer of a man who only gets partial reward still valid? If so, is he still responsible for the missing 50% or 40% or otherwise? JazakAllahu Khair. Wa Jazak. Without any doubt, the prayer is valid even if one gets tenth of its reward because otherwise the Prophet would have told us that the prayer is invalid and you have to repeat it. And that would have opened the Pandora Box. People with OCD would go bunkers because they would have to repeat the prayer like a gazillion times a day. But with the grace of Allah, His mercy and His favours and blessings upon us, He did not burden us with such things. Rather, if one-tenth of your prayer is counted and you're rewarded for that, Allah showed us other means to compensate for the missing part. Where the hadith says, look, and addressing the angels, look if my servant has voluntary prayers. So the sunan al-rawatib, an-nafil, your night prayers, your duha, and the likes, all would compensate for what was missing in your fard prayers. And Allah knows best."
