  "transcript": "foreign hmm foreign was instructed and ordered by allah to change the direction of qibla from jerusalem to the holy kaaba in mecca in the holy haram the holy mosque on that same year allah the almighty made it obligatory upon muslims to fast the holy month of ramadan and fasting as we know the month of ramadan is one of the five pillars of islam before that muslims used to fast but it was made obligatory upon them to fast the day of and that was before ramadan became obligatory and the day of ashura is the tenth day of the month of muharram the first month of the islamic calendar and the reason behind the muslims fasting that was the before before the sharia came to fast ramadan yes why why were we ordered to fast ashura because the order from allah azza so we are not we're not have a choice and was it to do with ibrahim no no it had to do with moses yeah it is the same day that allah azzawajal has saved moses and the sons of israel from pharaoh and his followers and they were drowned and moses and his followers peace be uh upon him uh was saved from those who were following him so when the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam came to medina and he found that the jews used to fast that day he said well i should fast that day more than you because i'm closer to moses more than you and he instructed and ordered everyone to fast that a particular day in uh thanking allah for that now so we have to be changed or there is something different between the muslims and the kuffar or the the muslims and the unbelievers well the prophet salallahu sallam at the very beginning he fasted only the 10th and then he said well if i make it to the next year i will fast with it the ninth so that he would not simulate the non-muslims in fasting only the tenth he would fast the ninth and the tenth in order to be different from them but if you fast only the 10th this is acceptable we can say it's not obligatory of course because now with ramadan it's not obligatory any more so ramadan is now obligatory for muslims it's one of the pillars of islam for them to fast also in this year allah azzawajal has made another pillar of islam which is zakat and zakat is the purdue is the money that every muslim should calculate from his savings or if he's a farmer from the crops he is is farming or harvesting or if he had cattle sheep cows camels and so on or if he was a merchant he should calculate the money he has if it reaches certain limit he should pay a certain amount which is usually in trading or in if you have savings gold silver or money you should pay 2.5 of that saving every single year and you give this to the poor you don't give it to the priest you don't give it to uh uh the ruler unless because this is this money is concealed and conceived by you nobody knows about it but if it's something that is apparent that people can see like the cattle or like the farming harvests and so on then the ruler should take this amount of you and give it to the poor it's the responsibility of the government to feed the poor and to give the money and shelter to them but if you have savings of your own you're responsible to get 2.5 percent and this system is the best system that would uh take care of the poor on the account of the rich without the rich being burdened by it 2.5 percent is nothing it's negligible every year and the poor would find an an honest and honorable honorable source of income without the need of begging others and the same time that's good for the society to make that to make the people feel like brothers you know it's it's one way of looking at it and it's a way of balancing things yeah and it is a well-known fact if if this system was applied you would not find any poor among the muslims no poverty at all and it's also a well-known fact that you would never find muslims dying out of hunger in the countries of muslims you may go places where non-muslim countries and you would find people dying on the street nobody is willing to feed them in islam it it is impossible to see someone dying out of hunger or thirst without being fed because this is the normal practice you feed the people that you know and you don't know and especially if they're in need you give them whatever they want usually your neighbors you have to care after your neighbors of course this is one of the main things in islam that the prophet said allah and this is his teachings when he went to medina this is what he taught the muslims that it is not a believer he is not a believer who sleeps while his neighbor is hungry you are not a believer you're not a mean you're not a faithful person if you sleep and your neighbor is hungry so whoever has this faith and belief in him must do this to his uh brothers and neighbors now after the last uh expedition and detachment shariat abdullah where was killed he was a polytheist and they took the two prisoners and we spoke about that before after this event took place the polythis the people of mecca the pagans knew that there's something wrong going on and this is not something to be taken easily we have to be serious and firm about this so they had it deep down in their minds that they they must attack but they were anticipating the right moment and the right moment came when the spies of the prophet came back telling him that the caravan that the prophet missed in the battle or in in the expedition of came back from sham as you remember that he missed one of the battles and this uh one of the caravans going to a sham it was filled with money and with with things to be traded now it was coming back to mecca and it was of course full of merchandise so the prophet heard about this and he decided to go and capture and take that caravan to hurt the people of quraish financially so he asked whomever had his right ready to come and he did not want to wait for any person who did not have his right ride ready with him so he went off with a hundred of the muhajireen of the migrants and 214 of the ansar of the people of medina two of the companions requested not to attend and that was a man and his father because they've already gave their word to the mushrikeen not to fight so they went off and and they had only one intention and that was to capture the caravan so they were not armed properly for a war they just went off with the swords and maybe a spear or two but they took the permission from the process of the prophet to not attend the battle the two people yeah yes of course are they familiar and his father and the prophet sallam gave him that permission now talking about the companions themselves they were not going for war the 314 companions were not ready for war they're just going to capture a caravan so it was a big caravan it was a huge caravan but it had few guards with them so there was a chance yes and it was led by abu sufyan ibn har one of the leaders of quraysh so the prophet alaihi salafsalam went out and he said may allah grant us as muslims this caravan where we would benefit from now as the muslims had their spies and they had their people doing the reconnaissance also the mushriks the people of mecca had their own spies abu sufyan knew that the muslims wanted to attack him while going to hashem so when coming back he was even more careful because it was a serious thing and he did not want to lose uh the money that he was entrusted with so he sent also his spies and he found out that the prophet saw sallam was about to attack his caravan and intercept it in a certain area so he changed his route which means that he went off-road instead of going on the normal route he went to the direction of the coast so instead of going south he went west and he sent one of his companions to quraysh and he was on his way riding as fast as he can to warn the people of quraish about their caravan that is that was about to be taken by the prophet and by the muslims themselves one of the aunts of the prophet abdul muttalib had a dream in her dream she saw that a man came on top of the hill shouting at the people of quraish warning them and he throw a stone a big rock and that rock as it came down from the mountain it broke into small pieces and every single house in mecca had the peace going into it her brother al-abbas the uncle of the prophet told this story and this caused a feud and an argument heated argument between him and abu jahl because he was a relative of the prophet sallam and this dream means that something bad was going to happen and i'm afraid that we have to finish this story after the break so stay tuned inshaallah we will be right back if you're 18 or if you're 18 if you've been muslim for 50 years or 5 minutes this is a show for you you know when five times a day i've our foreheads touch the ground in prayer we beg for what's most important in our lives we want to be good people better muslims we want to serve allah almighty with all our hearts in this show let's talk every week we're going to talk about islam and life how to relate with other people and how to serve allah we'll have studio guests we'll have a live studio audience there'll be an email for you to write to talk at hooder.tv so if you're looking for something different looking for something that will make you think maybe even touch your heart this is the show for you she was the aunt of the prophet do you know any of the prophet's aunts no i don't know sofia bent abdel mukhtalib and she was the mother of zubair abner one of the great companions of the prophet and we will get inshallah to some of the brave events she took part in attica saw a dream and she woke up not feeling very well about that dream and she told those who were around her and the dream spread all over mecca the dream was that she saw a man coming on top of a hill on top of the mountain of abu kobays warning the people of mecca and a big rock rolled from this man as he threw it to them and it started to crack into small fragments and every house there was a fragment that entered the houses of mecca when abu jahl the leader of the quraishis heard about this dream he was not very happy with it and he started arguing with al abbas the uncle of the prophet salallahu until this man bambam even actually came from on top of the mountain of abraham base and shouted to them that all people of mecca hurry up because muhammad and his army are attacking your caravan which has all your money the minute they heard this they stopped arguing and they understood and they interpreted the dream of attica quraish had to call all their knights and soldiers and brave ones to go and fight in order to save their caravan everyone went out and those who could not go they've appointed someone to represent them for example abu lahab the uncle of the prophet salaam who was cursed and condemned by allah in the quran sent a man in his place and this is one of the things that's the funny thing that i just remembered this is one of the things that proves that the quran is the revelation of allah the surah of al-masid where allah azza curses and condemns the uncle of the prophet and his wife um allah says in the quran that they are in hell and that was like 10 years before the prophet sallam migrated to medina throughout these 10 years anyone if anyone wanted to prove that the quran was not the word of allah abdullah could have stood and said well now i embrace islam i believe in the word of allah and this automatically means that the quran is not true but for 10 years he did not dare to say it's such a thing which means that the prophet salallahu did not talk of his own mind it was the revelation of allah who knows the future it is only allah who knows the past the present the future and the things that did not take place how they would have materialized if they were to take place abu lahab did not go with the army and he sent someone else to represent him now the previous expeditions and the previous detachments were all sent by the muhajirim they were all migrants from mecca no residence of medina ever went out and why it was simple the pledge between the people of medina and our prophet sallallahu alaihi lasallam was come to us to medina before you reach medina we are not responsible to whatever happens to you because you're on their way we don't have any protection for you the minute you reach medina we will protect you as if we are protecting our own families and children so this meant that if the prophet sallam reaches madinah he is in the protection of the people of medina of al-ansar and this is a label this is a name al-ansar this is the supporters means the supporters of the prophet saw and it's a label that the prophet saw sallam also gave the glad tiding to them by saying that no believer would ever hate ansar and it's a sign of iman and of belief to love them and it's a sign and of hypocrisy to hate them so whoever hates the ansar is not a believer is not a mean is not a faith a person of faith so the problem now was they went out for the caravan once the news came back to the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam that the people of mecca are coming out with an army now this is a different story so the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam gathered the people and some of them did not like the idea of fighting even among the migrants they went out for the money they went out for the caravan they were not prepared to fight so the prophet sallam gathered everyone that was with him the 314 men and he said o people advise me what should we do so abu bakr may allah be pleased with him and he's a migrant stood and said well he talked and said something that pleased the prophet sallallahu and he sat and then the prophet said advise me people omar may allah be pleased with him said also something that was well and he talked and supported the prophet we can learn we can learn we can think from this point that the leader has to sit and talk and discuss everything with his brothers well it he cannot say he has to but of course it is something to to be taken into consideration because if a leader puts everything into discussion you will never ever get one opinion the owen his own brothers not all the people well in this case it was everyone in that battlefield but the prophet had a purpose for that and we will learn this inshallah as we go on so umar also spoke and then may allah please with him spoke and said o prophet of allah do you think that we are going to abandon you and say to you like the jews said to moses go and you and your lord and fight we are sitting here without fighting no we're not going to do this oh prophet of allah we are going to accompany you we are going to fight with you and by allah wherever you take us we're going to follow you and you should not have any problem with that so i want to ask you about something about the effect in this period of time you said there's a war and battles so how do you how do you use to where to to pray to fast in this period of time now this era when was this how did this take place or when did it take place in ramadan in ramadan in the month of ramadan because the prophet left madinah on the 8th and some say on the 10th of ramadan so in islam whether it's a battle or something else if you leave the border of your city and you're traveling you are instructed to pray the four raghas into two this is known as shortening the prayer and also you have the permission to join prayers so you have the permission to join and assure each in the time of the other or each in the time of the other concerning fasting you have the permission to break your fast and make it up when you go back when you are in in safety or when you're back in your country but if you want to continue to fast it depends if it's hard on you then this is highly not recommended but if it's harmful for you then it becomes completely forbidden and if it's the same whether you fast or not then this is up to you to fast or not but it's also recommendable that you do fast so that you can get the opportunity of fasting with the muslims in ramadan without the need of making it up later on now the prophet sallam heard three of his companions but they were all from the migrants they were all from mecca praising the event and saying and supporting the prophet sallam that we are with you all the way the whole nine yards but the prophet did not want them to talk so again he said advise me people so one of the ansar stood up and his name was was sad and sad in he's a man of his own this guy was the leader of the tribe of aus and as we know we there are two dominant tribes in medina and al-khazraj so he was the leader of the aus tribe and he was a young man when he accepted islam he was barely 30 years old and when he died or or even less and when he died he was almost 32 or 35 at most yet when he died the prophet tells us allah that the throne of allah the almighty trembled out of joy because he was coming to join them in heaven saddam stood up and said prophet of allah i sense and feel that you are talking to us and you intending that we talk instead of our brothers the migrants prophet of allah we've believed in you we've followed you and we testified that what you brought was truth we gave you our vows and our pledges to support you and to obey you therefore go ahead do what you want to do by allah if you ride to the depths of the oceans we will follow you blindfoldedly so you and none one not even one single man of us would stay back so go to what allah azzawajal has instructed you and ordered you to do and by allah when we meet the enemy tomorrow you will see what type of men we are because we are firm when we meet the enemy and allah azza will satisfy you with the way we fight so the prophet was fair to inform to reform the answer to go with them so the prophet was did not want to force them so they want he wanted them to bring them to bring this initiative from them themselves and he prayed for saddam i'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program so inshallah until we meet next time um um"
