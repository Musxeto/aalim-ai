  "transcript": "good question so you're saying to me that you're in home and you hear the Adan is called do you have to pray immediately or must you wait until the congregation in the Masjid is over then you can pray is this your question yeah also I wanted to ask let's say if I pray after around 10 minutes will my prayers still be counted oh no okay again you managed to sneak a second question so should I punish you and not answer both questions no I'm kind and forgiving alhamdulillah may Allah increase my kindness anyhow listen every prayer has a beginning and has an end and this is why prayers were prescribed at a specific times so if you pray it before the beginning time your praise invalid if you pray it after the time is over your prayer is invalid now each prayer has a beginning and end and you'll go if you go to my website or to YouTube channel there are material that will tell you and explain to you but I don't have time to do it now let's assume it's at 12 o'clock p.m the Azan it ends when the actual Asar prayer is called for according to the Maliki shafiri and hambali school of thought not according to the hanafi school of thought because their timing is wrong so the vast majority of Muslims the three schools of thought say that it begins Asar at this specific time when the shade of an erect object is equivalent to its length this is when the Asar begins and this is when the ends so if it starts at 12 o'clock ends at three o'clock you can pray anytime between 12 and 3. so if you pray at 12 30 seconds prayer is valid and you if you pray 2 55 and conclude before the event of Asar your prayer is valid without any problem I hope this answers your question"
