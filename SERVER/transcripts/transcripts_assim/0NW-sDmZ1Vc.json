  "title": "Majority of dwellers of Hell are women & rich people Who are inhabitants of Paradise assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I think AG Muslim contain only narrations and could be trusted and be used for fatwa without the need or worry that it is or not from the prophet Alam my quy is about the inhabitance of the Hereafter it was narrated many times in an authentic Hadith that the majority of the Dwellers in Jam are the rich and women but you added that the scholars are differed different uh differed in terms of the majority of inhabitant in heaven and added something Onan and it is that the musl uh said among the inmates of paradise the woman would form a minority what is your question n so could you clear your stance on uh who who are the majority of inhabitants in barness there is no no conflict yeah what's the problem in having the number of women far greater than the number of men whether in heaven or in hell what's a problem in having the number of women in Hell more than the number of men and the number of women in Paradise more than the number of men there's no problem in that why do you think out I wouldn't say even out of the box why would you think of such thoughts that would only weaken your IM would put you in distance away from Allah if you believe in the Quran if you believe in the authenticity of the Sunnah especially bukari and Muslim as you've stated then you should say h maybe my logic is wrong maybe my uh intellect is wrong I believe in whatever Allah revealed when you put forward such what you think is a a conflict this means that your IM is weak or that there is a portion of hypocrisy that is looking forward to come out which I pray to Allah that this is not the case so stick with your belief and conviction and accuse your own understanding and intellect when you are unable to find a solution but the solution is very easy anyone on the streets would say hm where in the Quran or in the Sunnah that Allah stated that he created x amount of men equaling to x amount of women nowhere so why do you assume that there have to be equal number 10 men and 10 women so now you do the division in hell and he and Heaven it's not of your business Allah may may have created 10 men and 100 women so the ratio is 1 to 10 you never know this is in Allah's hands not in yours and mine and this is not something that would draw you closer to Allah by no means and Allah Knows Best"
