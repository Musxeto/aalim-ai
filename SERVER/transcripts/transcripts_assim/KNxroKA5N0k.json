  "transcript": "uh ismail from the u.s yes we have one question um recently a muslim prominent muslim speaker has said the masturbation is not haram or sinful rather is macro and discouraged can you please elaborate that a little bit okay ismail from the us he says that he heard a die saying that masturbating is makru which means not recommended you know that we have five rulings mandatory then recommended then permissible then macro then haram so macro is a degree above haram above prohibition but if you do it you're not sinful if you leave it then you are rewarded so he says that i heard a there is saying so so what's the ruling of masturbation masturbation is prohibited and why do we say it's prohibited because our scholars like sheikh bimbas like sheikh bin and many other contemporary scholars great scholars of islam say it is prohibited imam shafiri before them decades ago centuries ago also said that it is haram because allah mentioned in and in surat al-m so allah says that those who protect their private parts from erie prohibited sexual intercourse unless it's with their wives and what their right hand possesses and whoever chooses to fulfill his desire in other means then they are the transgressors and this brings us to uh shem shads from india's question so we hit two birds with one stone what kind of transgression is this whenever you do something that allah has prohibited this is a form of transgression against allah so this ayah imam shafer says is a clear cut that satisfying your sexual desires other than what allah has permitted you to do is a form of transgression in another hadith and the prophet susan was addressing the youth and he said to them o youth whoever is financially capable and physically capable of getting married then he should get married because this helps him to lower his gaze and protect his chastity so this is the natural channel okay prophet of allah i can't afford to get married what should i do i'm still suffering i cannot lower my gaze and i cannot preserve my chastity meaning that i can't get married what to do did the prophet some say go and masturbate because this is degree number two level two never he told them whoever is unable to afford it then he should fast this would be to him a blockage of a sexual desire so now you compare apple to apple the scholar said it's haram imam sheikh he said it's haram the prophet directed us allah too fast and never ever he agreed or permitted the companions to masturbate so if you do the math you certainly know and understand that this is prohibited and allah you"
