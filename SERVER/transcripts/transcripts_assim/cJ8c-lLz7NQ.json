  "title": "ðŸ†• Hajj or Umrah for her Mahr?? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "The second question is from Sumia. She says, can a girl make her mahr as hajj, like asking the man to take her to hajj or for umrah as mahr? Mahr is dowry. And we know that when a man wants to get married to a woman, he has to obtain the proposal of her guardian, her father, in the presence of two male Muslim witnesses, and he gives his consent in front of them. Part of the condition is that he provides her with a mahr, with a dowry. So whether it's something financial, money, a piece of land, a property, or anything that can be of value. Now when a woman demands going for hajj, this is something of value. This is totally permissible. However, I would be more inclined to put a figure. So if we are in year 2023, or 1445 Hijri, she should estimate, or her guardian, how much the package would be to go for hajj, and put that number of euros or dollars or dinars or whatever in the marriage contract. Why? Because 10-15 years down the line, they may have their differences, and she may file for khul'a. So the judge would say, give back your dowry. And she says, I didn't receive any. Or, I went to hajj five years ago. How much was the hajj? Here, we come to a crossroad. Because the husband says 10,000 euros, she says 2,000 euros. So we have to quantify it and put a figure to it, and Allah knows best."
