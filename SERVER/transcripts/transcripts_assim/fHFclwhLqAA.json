  "transcript": "Incognito from Saudi. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. Uh Sheikh before when I was 13 years old in Ramadan I jokingly in the beginning I said that I felt like a kafir because I was not fasting due to my period. I did not actually feel that way I was just joking with my friend did that take me out of the fold of Islam or do I have to repeat the fast? No you you are first of all you were on your period so there was no fast and if you pretended to be a kafir that was definitely a major sin. If you had any conviction of going out of the fold of Islam or mocking Islam then yes you are a kafir at that time but that was in the past so move on with your life ask Allah for forgiveness and show remorse and never do this again and don't worry about your previous fasts and salat because this is gone already."
