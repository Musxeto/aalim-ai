  "title": "Is using emojis & living creatures emojis in chatting permissible? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "now with the emojis a lot of the Muslims ask about this question especially with the presence of whatsapp and all these chatting platforms and they say that why do you say it's permissible because it has no life in it doesn't it have a face the scholars say that whatever does not have life in it so a face that has only eyes there is no life in it life cannot exist without your nose without a mouth so only having eyes or having these hearts instead of eyes I'm talking about the yellow Smiley's the emojis I don't know what they call a bit modular which has a character a policeman a an electrician a something here or there with a real face a body etc this drawing em them is not permissible using them it's an issue of dispute I'm inclined that using such ready-made things without drawing them is like watching cartoons I didn't draw the cartoons it's Haram to draw the cartoons but if I watch Tom & Jerry for example though there are reservations if I watch them am i sinful for that just for watching them No yeah there's no sin on me for that the sin is on the people who do it among other things but Danny let's keep it limited without expanding so the emoji the emoji is the Smiley's I I see there is no problem in that you shall Allah and Allah knows best"
