  "transcript": "a questioner says I heard the dead feel the pain even if a fly sits on its body they say this is because of the Hadith breaking the bone of one who's dead is like breaking it when he's alive does this Hadith indicate that the dead people feel extreme pain when their bones are broken the answer is no the Hadith is referring to how to respect the corpse of a deceased person after the soul is extracted at the time of death the person who died does not see or feel his body when it's being washed transported shrouded prayed upon place in the grave he regains his hearing and feeling once the soul is placed back for questioning and this is when he hears the flipflop or the shoes of those who who had just buried him leaving the graveyard and then he's questioned by the two angels and he made to sit in his grave in a way that is not resembling anything that we know of in this life because he's dead so how is this going to happen how is he going to be tormented or given favors and blessings of Allah in his grave this is a different phase and stage of life there's this life on Earth then there is the life in the Hereafter for eternity and in between there is the life of Barak this is the life of the Barak when he's in his grave we have no knowledge of what's happening but does the corpse of the deceased feel the pain if we slap it if a fly falls on it if someone drops it no it does not feel the pain but the prophet is telling us that the breaking the bone of a dead person is like breaking it when he's alive in mean in it having its Sanctuary it it having its uh uh status in Islam to be respected and taken care of and Allah Knows Best"
