  "title": "Difference between Ilah & Mabood (worshipped)? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Chef I want to know what is the fine difference between the two words when I should use Ila instead of mahbud or vice versa because when we say Allah Allah used instead of mabood what is the wisdom behind it behind it so that I can learn myself and I can teach others as well first of Allah is one of Allah's beautiful names so we Allah and we say abdulillah so it is one of Allah's beautiful names mahbud is not one of Allah's names and this is anything that is worshiped it's a description so anything that is worshiped is called my boot so Buddha is and other false gods are also called mabood that is why when we translate we say that there is no God Worthy there is no mahbud Worthy actually because those that are worshiped are so many but none of them is worthy of being worshiped other than Allah so I hope this answers your question"
