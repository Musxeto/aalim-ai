  "transcript": "a born Muslim man who went through many Counseling in last one decade his problem is whenever he talks with a Muslim about Islam he starts arguing like an anti-islamic but when he talks with an atheist or a follower of another religion he defends the superiority of Islam he doesn't know why his mind behaves this way he always tries to ignore every negativity and Ponder upon Allah praise Allah read about the last gen Messengers yet he now he's really frustrated with himself as he doesn't know how to recover so sh is he a kafir this is something that relates to conviction and belief now I cannot assess this person until I speak with him and if I speak with him and I discuss these issues I can tell by the way he speaks to another Muslim whether he's a hypocrite whether he's delusional or whether he is only having Whispers of Shan about things that may fog his vision and he's unable to see clearly so he may need counseling he may need to ask himself whether he is a hypocrite or he doesn't believe in Islam wholeheartedly or he does but Shan is trying to mess up with his head and this is something I cannot tell until I speak to him personally and Allah Knows Best"
