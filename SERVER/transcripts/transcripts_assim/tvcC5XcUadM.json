  "transcript": "Fahim from India. If I were to miss one of the Raka'a congregation and if I start to pray, then if someone joins me after completing, should I face them or face my Imam, bearing in mind that the masjid have dua after every congregation? I don't understand your question. You missed one Raka'a with the Imam. So after the Imam offered salam, you stood up to finish your fourth Raka'a. Another man comes to join you, correct? Yes. So you continued the Raka'a and finished it and offered salam. After you finished salam, if there is more than one person praying behind you, the sunnah is to turn your face and face them, give your back to your Imam. Your Imam, khalas, he's over, his prayer is over, he's history. Now you're the Imam. But if there is only one person praying next to you, then you just stay still because there is nowhere to look at and you can continue facing the Qibla. Does this answer your question? Yes. Alhamdulillah. Alhamdulillah. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
