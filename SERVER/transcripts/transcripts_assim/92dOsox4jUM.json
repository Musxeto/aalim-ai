  "title": "Can I pray two Witr in one night? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "can i pray witter twice like during asia prayer and then sleep wake up and again pray witter along with eight nawafil question is a frequently asked question it was the prophet alaihis wasallam who said this is a prohibition there are no two witters to be offered in the same night which answers your question halima directly so if a person prays water before he goes to bed so many people pray risha and they then they pray uh their shaffer and witter and they will go to bed and so they happen to wake up a couple of hours before fajr time and they pray to hajj as many prakas as they want now they fall into a dilemma and they say to themselves okay if i concluded my eighth rakah of tahajjud shouldn't i end it with witcher because the prophet said allah make the last of your night prayer witter so he says okay then i should pray with you but then he's confused because the prophet said as assam there are no two witter in the same night so what to do the prohibition overrules any other thing so because the prophet has some prohibited it you can only pray one witter if you prayed it after isha or before you go to bed and you go and pray eight raka's of the hajjud or whatever then you do not pray with your khalas the one you prayed before you went to bed is sufficient if you did not pray with her before you went to bed and then you prayed as many rakhas as you wanted before fajr in this case you have no problem in concluding one uh it your night prayer with one rakah or with three rakaas or with what ever so i hope this answers your question halima"
