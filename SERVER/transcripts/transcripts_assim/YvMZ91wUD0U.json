  "transcript": "moussah from the Emirates he's asking about the cat and how to know what is the threshold of the zakat and how to pay money over his business and this is frequently asked question and unfortunately people do not realize that not every business requires a cat so for example I have a million dollars I wish and I make a company or an establishment that is totally owned by me and I furnish the building I rent a building I get employees to work in my building and every year there's no zakat on it what about a million dollars share well the million dollars were invested in the premises in the furniture in the cars and in the telephone line the leased line etcetera the computers but the essence or the work of this company is consultation so people call any say we have a business we need a consultant to come and make a road map for us on how to progress in our business so my employee goes and sits with them for a couple of weeks puts a road map and a strategy of mission division bla bla bla and they pay him an amount of money I take the amount of money and I expand and spend it at the end of the year I don't have savings I don't have fixed assets that is there are sold and bought so I'm not a merchant I'm not a traitor I give services I give consultations there's no zakat in it those who have a factory or that is a hundred million dollars worth of machinery in property and etc what is the catabolism the warehouse we have goods worth of a million then this million is the catapult not the other 99 million of the premises and the machinery etc for a person who has a saloon I'm assuming that the work is holid meaning that it is a saloon for men it's a barbershop so they only cut hair and they do haircuts that are allowed they don't shave the beard they don't pluck the eyebrows etc this is permissible there is no Zach at the chair the hair dryers the Jill the blades whatever there's no zakat on that the zakat is on your revenue so after one year of collecting profit and money we look at the money in the bank account if it is more than let's say 300 or 400 dollars the value of 595 grams of silver then you give 2.5% every year on that particular day and Allah knows best"
