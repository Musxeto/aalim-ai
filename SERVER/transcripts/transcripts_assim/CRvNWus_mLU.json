  "transcript": "Mohammed says my friend gave me an order book of numerology containing knowledge about a budget which is newer new miracles based on name and birthdate and he said my new Merkle's were reflected upon my nature and yes it mostly reflected correctly he also said that this is acknowledged by the prophets so my question is can I believe in such knowledge or not first of all what your friend said is a blatant lie the prophet's peace and blessing of allah be upon them never believed in such nonsense the concept of numbers having an impact whether positive or negative on our lives that names or letters have a similar effect on what happens to us whether in the future upcoming future or what had happened to us in the past is complete fictional it is a lie and it contradicts your belief in allah azzawajal and this is why the prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam made this crystal clear in our religion when he said that whoever goes to a fortune-teller his prayers of 40 days would not be accepted notice that the man went just for the fun of it so checking your zodiac sect checking your star checking your fortune-teller any type of this nonsense even for fun would cause you to pray 40 days without being accepted of course you have to pray otherwise you would be rendered as a disbeliever if you abandon prayer claiming that as long as I'm not gonna be rewarded might as well leave it know you'll be a kafir' then and then the Prophet goes on to say are they so awesome and whoever goes to a fortune-teller or a priest and he believes him then he has disbelieved in Islam and in what was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad sallallaahu are you selling witches or an therefore this book that claims that there is a relationship between numbers your date of birth the letters of your name probably your mother's name and these collectively have an impact on what's going to happen in the future this is complete nonsense fictional and disbelief in Allah because we know that Allah has predestined our lives had written down everything we are going to do from now till the day of judgement so it's written and it's over with and no one has this knowledge except allah azza wajal to claim that someone who was born on the same date I was born in and that he was given the same name I was given that we would have identical futures that the events we will face are the same this is nonsense and nobody in his right mind would believe such nonsense now Muhammad said something scary Muhammad said that his new miracles will reflect upon my nature and yes it mostly reflected correctly so this is inclining that what he had said or what was found in that book was true because it seems that what they predicted true such a belief would nullify a person's Islam and you are on danger grounds brother muhammad because you are inclined to believe them in such belief is contradictory to your belief in Allah and your belief that no one knows the unseen one may ask ok then how was it closed to be true they gave general ideas they gave general predictions that could fit any person so you will get a call from someone you haven't heard from a long time ago and voila someone calls you this happens to us every single day you will meet a terrible accident on the road so be careful and it happens to every one of us every single day they tend to give general things and some specific things but be in our sub-conscience because of our wiki man we tend to believe them so whenever something that is true or it seemed to us to be true we hang on to it while the 99 false lies he they told us we tend to neglect so this is exactly what's happening with fortune tellers and the likes and hence you should be really careful from not listening or not paying attention to this what they say do not attend them do not read them even just for curiosity because your curiosity would not only kill the cat it would prevent you from having your 40 days of salat of prayers void and unaccepted"
