Raise your hands has anybody \nheard of Talha [Counting],   okay we have people enthusiastic yeah \nI think I did, okay I'm not gonna ask   any questions, Talha Ibn Ubaydillah is one \nof the ten Heaven bound of the Prophet ﷺ,   he said in the authentic Hadith that two men \ncame from a village called Bila it's in Kharasan,   close to Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, in the region, \nand they embraced Islam, they were brothers,   and they went for Jihad and one of them was \nmartyred, he died in the cause of Allah and   his brother lived after him for a whole year in \nMedina, and then he died, Talha says I saw in a   vision, I was dreaming, I was asleep, and I saw \nin my dream that the three of us, these two men   and myself were at the gates of paradise and the \ngates of paradise were opened and someone came and   said you, come in, and the one who died last, not \nthe Martyr was admitted first, and after a while   the gates of paradise were opened, and \nthey admitted the second one the Martyr,   and he said I wanted to go in before it was too \nlate, and they said no, no it's not your time yet,   and he woke up, so he spoke to the people and \nsaid Wallahi yesterday I saw this and this and the people were astonished, and they started \nspeaking and this reached the Prophet ﷺ,   so the Prophet ﷺ gathered them, said what's wrong \nwith you? Prophet of Allah ﷺ, he was martyred,   he was Shaheed, and yet the guy who died on \nhis bed a year after was admitted to Paradise   before him, how is that? he said the Prophet \nﷺ, Subhanallah he died one year afterwards,   how many prostrations did he offer, how many \ntimes he prayed, how many days he fasted,   how much money did he spend in the cause of \nAllah, by Allah what's between him and the   Martyr in Paradise as the distance \nbetween the heavens and the Earth,   so this is an encouragement for you to \nlive more, because the more you live,   the more Good Deeds you do, yeah imagine \nhow many times you say in the day [Dhikr] How many times, and you've got palm trees \nplanted the more you say this you got bricks   of silver and gold, you've got this and \nthis and Paradise all waiting for you,   while someone who's your brother, who's your \nfriend who died 20 years ago is deprived of this."
