  "transcript": "farzana from australia she says is studying sciences at school haram because there are people who say that studying at school is haram especially sciences this is awkward maybe these guys want us to live in the stone ages in cages they don't want us to progress and be advanced how would we reach these industries in these technologies without studying sciences now maybe your question for zana is not complete maybe these people were targeting certain sciences such as biology that teaches darwinism and or teaching physics uh talking about physics that or mathematics that claim that there isn't any such thing as infinity or that there isn't any creator for example i don't know this is different than genetically accusing all sciences of being haram this is not true chemistry physics math biology all of these are sciences that are needed for today's advancement and progression among the nations what is haram we have to identify it and exclude it or at least tell the students that this is haram so if you're studying in australia and your kids go to you to school you can't take them all out of school and prepare them to be janitors for the last rest of their lives they have to go to school or they have to do homeschooling if the schools are mixed and haram but when studying biology and they come to the concept that the origin of man is ape or a monkey like they claim we tell them that this is totally wrong and false when they study english literature and they talk about greek gods or the likes we tell them that this is nonsense we have tawheed we have monotheism allah is the only god worthy of being worshiped etc but this is what you're studying at school and we have to answer it accordingly so that we can get a degree and then have a life but to come and say that no all sciences are haram and if you believe in sizes you don't believe in god this is rubish"
