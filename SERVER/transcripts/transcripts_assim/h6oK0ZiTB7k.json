  "title": "She has Yellow & Brown Discharge for 15 Days then Takes Ghusl, is her ghusl valid? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Summer from the Emirates. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa'alaikumussalam wa rahmatullah. I have a question. A woman has a period for seven or nine days. Her period is not big. Then she has a yellow and brownish discharge for 15 days. So on the 15 days that in Maghrib time and after sunset, she performs ghusl. On the 16th day or 17th day, she has a white-red-like discharge some days and yellow discharge also until she has another period. For six months, she is doing like this. Is her ghusl valid? Yes, her ghusl is valid. You see, when a woman has her monthly period for seven or nine days, then the blood stops, yet she's continuously receiving colored discharge without seeing the sign of purity, which we were told about can come in two ways. Either to see the white thread-like discharge unaccompanied by any colored discharges or to see the total dryness when a tampon is inserted and it comes clean without any discharges. So if she doesn't see any of these two signs of purity and the brownish or yellowish discharges continue until the 15th day, then she can have her ghusl and consider whatever she's having afterwards to be istihada, which requires only that after the adhan, she cleans herself, makes wudu and pray regardless of what comes out. So if she saw on the 16th day the white thread-like discharge, her sign of purity, it doesn't matter because she has already performed ghusl the day earlier after finishing 15 days and Allah Azzawajal knows best. you"
