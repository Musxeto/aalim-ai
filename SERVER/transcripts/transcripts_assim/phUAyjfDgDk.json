  "title": "What is a Sutra and how high should a Sutra be? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "and Allah says what kind of object can someone or should someone place as a Sutra in front of him or her while performing Salah and how far from one's standing position should the Sutra be placed what is the meaning of Sutra if you remember we've mentioned this so many times a Sutra is a visor is a sort of a screen that a person puts in front of him so it identifies his prayer parameters his prayer limits and this was done by the prophet alayhi salat wa sallam and he ordered the Muslims whenever they pray that they place such a sutra in front of them and scholars say it should be this high about a foot high and you place it in front of you so if you bring like this I pad in front of you and place it this is sufficient if you bring the carrier of the Quran and you open it in front of you this is sufficient if you pray to a pillar of the message or to a wall or to a person who's sitting or to a chair all of this does the job insha'Allah some schools of thoughts say that even if you draw a line in front of you this would suffice and others say the lines in the message which people usually put their feet and align it to it when straightening the rows this is sufficient but this is not true it has to be something that is elevated from the ground the Prophet whenever he used to travel or whenever he wanted to pray in some place other than the Masjid they would place in front of him renessa and a Anitha is a short spear some people when they read it in the books of they would read it as anza because there are no vows on it so they would read it as Anza and Anza means goat and you would see people putting a goat in front of them and praying to it and the goat moves and they guys move along sir what are you doing said the Prophet used to pray to a goat no the Prophet used to pray to a Anna's ax and this is a short spear not a long one the short one the same Anna's ax was used by the Prophet al-islam when going in tower from the Kaaba and if he could not kiss or touch the black stone due to the crowd he would touch it with his short spear the aniseh without harming people of course so this is the Sunnah a person should follow"
