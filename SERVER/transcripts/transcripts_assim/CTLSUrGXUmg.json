  "transcript": "full shade from nigeria yeah if you i have a female friend of mine who unfortunately learnt some arabic from a male imam from a local islamic association and now attend a female islamic institution by watching one of your videos but she would like to know if she will get the full reward of reading korean like a righteous sister so how can i answer her if she does know how to read or not without examining her this is something that her female teacher should address so what i would recommend her to do is to look for a muslim a female teacher and she reads to her pages of the quran and she corrects her if she's capable of doing that or not but either way she can read the quran even if she has mistakes there's no problem in that because this is the best of her ability at the moment we do not hold back and say no we should not allow her to read the quran until she is perfect nobody is perfect we all make mistakes so if she knows the basics and she have learned arabic she can read the quran she may do that but to me i can't give her the green light to go ahead teach or continue to read as if she's a perfect person in reading it and i can not tell her to stop reading the quran is between her and allah azzawajal as long as she is doing the best she can inshallah there is no problem in that"
