  "title": "Why is a rakah invalid if we don't recite fateha but valid behind imam if he's in ruku assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "my question is that um you know when you when you said that um like if you don't recite the F in the prayer like your Salah you have to like if if you miss it you have to redo the yeah I just have some confusion you know cuz if you do um cuz if you if you're if the IM is in um and then you do the r and then everyone agrees that um that that you have cut that youve catch the correct but yeah so but my question is that if you if you miss the F or if you don't recite the fat or let's say you joined right let's say you joined late in the like and the IM is standing so would you still have to what do you still what do you still have to like stand up for the again okay I'll answer your question and the confusion arises when you cannot combine two evidence es which you think in your mind that they contradict one another and there's no contradiction in loud Ras the recitation of the IM is sufficient for you whether you heard the fat yourself or you came late when the Imam was reciting another Surah you missed the fa but his recitation is sufficient for you you don't have to read the faat or when you come and the IM is in the r position due to the Hadith when a man came and he entered the Masjid found the prophet and the companions all in the ru position so he said allahar did R and then walked while in the r position and joined the line the row he didn't recite the fat because he immediately went to R when the Salat was over the prophet said said meaning that may Allah increase you in being careful to follow the Imam though what you've done was not right to walk in the bwing position the prophet said and do not do that again in one of the narrations depending on how you put the vows do not repeat your prayer meaning that this raak was valid so as you clearly stated the majority of Scholars say that when you catch the IM in the position you immediately join him without reciting the fat and this is valid this is the exception not the norm if you missed the F in a silent prayer so you join the IM allahar in or in the third of or which is silent and I just stand still and then IM is reciting the faat silently and I don't do anything and then the IM goes for Allah for and I go for with him this ra is invalid why because I did not recite the fa so this is the norm you don't recite the faat in silent ra your prayer is invalid you don't recite the faat in a loud ra behind the IM your prayer is valid you don't recite the faat because you came late and the IM was in the r position and you made the r with the IM your prayer and raak is valid and I hope this answers your question"
