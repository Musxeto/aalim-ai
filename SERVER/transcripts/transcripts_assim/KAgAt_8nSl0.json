  "title": "What's the status of Prophet ﷺ‎ at sight of Allah? In Pakistan people exaggerate him Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign as well as try to prove different things about him from the Quran which is not the correct understanding I believe so could you clarify on this okay Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam is the greatest of all mankind he was the selected one he's The Chosen One by Allah azzawajal to be the Seal of the prophethood so he was the end of prophethood there is no messenger or Prophet coming after him with a new scripture or a new message he is the perfect human being yet never ever an incident that the prophet had ever missed without saying I am the servant of Allah and Allah described him in the Quran in four places and praised him by giving him the title and the description of ABD that he's a servant and a Slave so we say that he is a servant and a Slave but at the same time he's the messenger of Allah and the Seal of the prophethood so we have to address this issue that he is the closest to Allah among the humans and some even go to say among all of Allah's creation that he's the best of Allah's creation which is an issue of dispute but what is not disputed that he's the best of all humans and Jinn but we do not exceed the limit by giving him Divine attributes of knowing the Unseen or controlling the universe or being omnipresent whenever we are he is there looking at us listening to us watching us this is exceeding the limits and exaggerating in his status and falling into shirk when you go to that extreme and Allah knows best this"
