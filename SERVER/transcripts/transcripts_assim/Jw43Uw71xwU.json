  "transcript": "whether my income will be haram or i am committing a scene in this regard i am a railway employee my job is to inspect the railway track one kilometer every day six days a week so i go and inspect more than one kilometer like two kilometer on that day and submit inspection report uh that i have inspected only one kilometer then next day i don't go for work but stay at my home and at the end of the day i submit inspection report of another one kilometer which i have inspected yesterday the work is a teamwork of six members in our team and i am only the muslim and all others are hindus they all insist on such practice and only i cannot do the inspection by myself as it is a tumor so whether my income will be haram or i am my sinful for not going daily to my work so do i if i understand you correctly your job is to inspect one kilometer of the river no okay so this has an impact because every day it changes so if you inspect two kilometers one day and skip the following day the readings and the measurements are not accurate and this is considered to be cheating now you say that this is a team effort meaning that this kilometer you cannot cover on your own you need your team members to be with you but they do not show for the following day in this case you have to approach your supervisor and officially write a letter to him see seeing his boss or whoever so that you cr clear your conscience that i've done my best that this is what is happening and i cannot work the following day alone because my team members will not be joining me if they both say that this is okay this is the norm we have no problem with that you've done your due diligence and there is no sin on you in sha allah"
