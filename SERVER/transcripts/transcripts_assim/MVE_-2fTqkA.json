  "title": "Sunnah is to recite whole Quran once a month If complete in less time can I sit back assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "the question is we know that it is Once in a month what else if I have time maybe I finished it around 20 days or 17 days and I will ask for the next month that acceptable or has to read it day by day or is it allowed to read it at least one month anytime you have time okay so basically speaking about abdulrahman is asking about the Sunnah of finishing the Quran once a month so he says if I finished in 20 days should I sit back and chill for 10 days without doing anything of course not the Sunnah is to complete the Quran once a month in the sense that every night a Muslim has to have a portion of the Quran known as word he has to have a word that he maintains every night and if he oversleeps like sometimes the prophet did Allah he would make up his word during the daytime between Fajr and zohor at the time of duha prayer so this is what is the Sunnah is but when someone finishes the Quran finishes his word his word earlier than the month and there are a few days left it is not recommended at all for him just to chill and and relax and not read anything no he has to go and read the Quran memorize revise some of what he has memorized and occupy his night with such a similar word with so that he would not be neglectful and Allah Knows Best"
