  "title": "Should we fast according to Saudi Arabia",
  "transcript": "assalamu alaykum sh I just uh had this question it's about yfa as you know that tomorrow the 25th of October is the 9th of zul in Saudi Arabia so there are our brothers who do not live in Saudi Arabia for example Bangladesh India and Pakistan so should they fast on the day of Y araa in KSA or should they fasted according to the sighting of the Moon in their respective countries it has to be acknowledged that when the prophet Alat states that fasting the day OFA expat and erases the sins of the previous year and the following year this is in reference to the ninth of the month of the lunar month not specific Bally and limited only to the date of Saudi Arabia this means that the people in America the people in Bangladesh the people in China they all have to observe the sighting of the moon in the end of every month so that they would recognize the beginning of the following lunar month regardless of the date of arafa in Saudi Arabia it is exactly like the same process of Ramadan every region every country observes the moon so that tomorrow is the first of Ramadan or whether we should continue and complete the existing month of Shaban into 30 and that is why the stings differ and that is why Ramadan is different from one country to the other likewise with the month of the 12th month of the calendar people in their country and their regions must observe the moon so that they site the beginning of the month and accordingly decide when arat is okay so to answer your question to answer your question yes that it might be different arat day in Bangladesh and it might be different in America than what it is in Saudi Arabia okay and when I said I mean actually the same thing which you are saying to some of our brothers I mean I don't they quote me things like okay it is Haram to fast on the day of Eid I mean it will be Eid in KSA or something like no arafa is already gone in cases so how can we fast the people of the h i mean those people who are doing Hajj they already did it I mean on Thursday so how can we fast on Friday I mean this is not the thing these these these people are ignorant they have no knowledge because if they want to fast with us in Bangladesh it is 4 hours before us or 3 hours before us no it's 3 hours after or three hours after us this means that when we refrain from fasting from eating the break of dawn here when it is at for example uh approximately 510 in Bangladesh local time they are ahead of us like 2 hours so when we fast at 510 here there it is already 8 something yes yes in the in the morning do they say that okay we will refrain only with Saudi Arabia when they fast we fast no they follow the sun in their region likewise we follow the sun to know and acknowledge the prayer times so they cannot pray M with us and they cannot pray with us correct yes true because the day is different likewise the entering of the month is different from our country to their country so the the the day of Eid is on Friday in Saudi Arabia it can be on Thursday in Bangladesh and it can be on Saturday in America okay so it differs from country to country but I mean I don't know people I mean from where did this ideology emerge are there any Hadith or anything no no no there there IDE ol emerged from the fact that the day of the 9th is known as the day ofaa and they see people standing Ona on the 24th for example or is it the 25th I'm not sure so they think that this is the day that they should uh on the 25th they see people standing on Ara they say this is the day that we have to fast but this is not the case because their Eid might be on Thursday and it might be on Saturday not necessarily like us on Friday okay so Allah subhah wa ta'ala instructed them to site the moon every single month so that they can identify when is the 13 14 and 15 yes so if the moon was sighted different than Saudi Arabia everything will be different would be on Thursday here it might be there a day before or a day yeah like in countries where it's like in KSA it might be day but in those countries it might be night for around 12 hours more than that even correct so and we cannot fast during the night right no definitely not yes and this is no not not a single Muslim said this so it's like a I mean it doesn't work out like that I mean the ideology that we every region has their own sighting so it has nothing to do the people standing of standing on arafa the place it's about the yes the nth of the the lunar month when did the month enter in your country then nine days afterwards this Isa 10 days afterwards this isid yeah no regardless whether whether in Saudi or not the I mean it gets funnier when they go like okay we will celebrate araa tomorrow which is Thursday but Eid two days after after on Saturday yeah this is ridiculous this is this is ridiculous because n9th of zul is the day before Eid but I will be doing yeah they will be doing Eid on the 10th of zul according to the sighting of the moon but they want to do arafa I mean with K and no this is wrong related to also now there is this I mean it's growing day by day they want to do the Eid also according to KSA it's I mean sighting of the Moon in KSA this is an issue of disp whether you should follow Saudi Arabia or not but again this is not the most authentic opinion okay and Allah know okay thank you sh you're welcome [Music]"
