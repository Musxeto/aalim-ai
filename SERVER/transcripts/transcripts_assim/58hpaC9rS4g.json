  "transcript": "next question is from sister nadia how do i advise and help out my younger brother who is 19 to be good to parents and have better friends i just want him to have a better life you can preach him every single day but usually such teens won't adhere and listen to such preaching because they've been hearing it all their lives so it differs from one character to the other it depends on your brother's personality it depends on your parents behavior with him it depends on the approach you do to him and it depends also so whether he loves you or not see i could have a young brother and i could preach him all day long but he doesn't listen because he thinks of me as an extremist old man who doesn't know what's happening in this world and all what he hears from is allah says the prophet says allah says the prophet says and he's tired of this he this is what he is in school and friday and he doesn't want this anymore these youngsters need a strategy to address and to talk to sometimes you need to spend three months not saying a single verse or a hadith just treating them well making them feel comfortable with you feel secure feel that you intend goodness for them until they love you until they think the world of you and that you're the biggest sister who he would do anything to please only then you can give advice bit by bit small dosages that would probably be accepted by him but if you preach him all day long 24 7 and he doesn't respect you or care for you or if your parents are abusive and unfair to him or not treating him well it's it's going to be difficult if not impossible and allah knows best"
