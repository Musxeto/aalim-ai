  "transcript": "you have knowledge this is when Allah wants goodness for you the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam heard of two men so the companions were speaking about two men one of them is a scholar knowledgeable person and the one the other one is a monk someone who worships Allah a lot not a monk like I the Christians or the Buddhist noid Abid is someone someone who devotes his time and efforts only to worshiping Allah in his room or in his uh place of worship so they were mentioned in front of the Prophet Alat wasam so what did he say he said the virtue of the Learned man over the worshipper or the monk is like my virtue over the least of you companions verily Allah and his angels and the inhabitants of the heavens and the Earth even the ant in its hole and even the fish they send blessings upon the one who teaches the people good ill the ants in their holes the fish in the oceans they send their blessings they make Dua for those who teach people good what kind of good goodness of Islam knowledge of the Quran of the Sunnah of a of this is how important Scholars of Islam were and because of all of this respecting them praising them putting them where they're supposed to be is an obligation Upon Us Muslims we have to acknowledge who the scholars are IM may Allah have mercy on his soul says part of the of that they worship Allah through respecting the guided Scholars this is part of our AA that we respect not any scholar not Scholars that come in Tik Tok and TV and uh the videos real Scholars and we will come to explain what do we mean by real Scholars so they worship Allah they get close to Allah by praising and honoring the scholars by serving them by respecting them not because of their complexion their color their height rather because of the of the knowledge they possess and that is why a very very intelligent woman may Allah be pleased with her she is the mother of Ann Malik you know anas Malik may Allah be pleased with him companion he was 10 years of age a boy the prophet when he came to Medina immediately she went to meet him and she was one of his mahs we had we had om Haram these two women were aunts of the prophet's father Abdullah because his mother's side were from Medina so they were his Mah the moment she heard of the Prophet Sall wasallam coming to Medina she came to him and said oh prophet of Allah anas is a learned boy keep him with you no pay nothing he just serves you and for 10 years he accompanied the prophet Alat serving him for nothing just whatever the prophet tells him he does what did this benefit him he's one of the greatest narrators of the Hadith he was loved by the prophet wasam one day she came and she said oh prophet of Allah anas she said un and this is putting anas into un something in Arabic to yeah beautify it he's your servant make Dua so he said Allah prolong his life and increase in his wealth and forgive his sins Anna says I at the moment have reached Allah knows how much of age and my Offspring I bar more than a hundred with my own hands of my sons and daughters and grandsons and granddaughters Allah gave me so many of them and every Farm every Garden in Medina produces crops once a year mine produces twice a year and the last Dua I'm anticipating that Allah will forgive my sins so who in his right mind would give his 10-year-old child to this man to serve him if she did not know the status of Scholars by the way I don't need anyone to send me his kids huh I have enough alhamdulillah I have I have 15 grandchildren they're serving me like crazy so alhamdulillah keep your children the point is that people understood the status of and um understood the status of the greatest of all Scholars the the prophet sallallah wasam Abu hanifah and IM Shafi may Allah have mercy on their souls they say if the scholars are not the aah of Allah if they're not the allies of Allah I don't know if Allah has allies or not there they cannot be any Ally of Allah more than the scholars themselves but when we come to the definition of a scholar who is a scholar who is identified as a real scholar Allah identifies them to us when he [Music] says only those fear Allah from among his servants who have knowledge so the real knowledge is the fear of Allah the actual knowledge to fear Allah's power to fear to fear Allah's ability over you even when you're alone even when your doors are locked and nobody's watching you and there's no CCTV No cameras what do you do nobody's watching let's play no you fear Allah you're a scholar even if you don't memorize the Quran you are a scholar because you have the essence alassan albas may Allah have mercy on his soul says knowledge true knowledge is the fear of Allah and being righteous and the most of people who know Allah best are the scholars and whoever knows more fears more whoever knows Allah more fears Allah more Allah says and when they hear what has been revealed to the messenger you see their eyes overflowing with tears because of what they have recognized of the truth this is real knowledge when they hear the Quran they weep they cry because of what they've recognized but if someone is having photographic memory he has wide range of information he knows books he knows literature he knows the names of this and that but he doesn't act upon it this is not beneficial rather it will backfire on you on the day of judgment IB Mas may Allah be pleased with him says knowledge is not how many you narrate knowledge is fearing Allah so many people nowadays claim to be knowledgeable and with social media we tend to believe that a reporter or a journalist is a Muti now he writes journals in the newspaper and in articles about Halal andam masallah a family therapist becomes a Muti a reporter on TV becomes a reference mallah well yeah I heard a reporter on TV on a program saying so and so and this is halal and this is Haram therefore when we we acknowledge who are the real Scholars we can filter the others there are so many deviant and corrupt Scholars Among Us Muslims and the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam sought refuge in Allah from what from knowledge that is not beneficial he sought refuge in Allah from a heart that is not submissive he sought refuge in Allah from a NFS from a soul that is never having enough no matter how much you eat how much you make money you're never having enough and he sought refuge in Allah from a that is not responded to therefore before you identify someone to be a scholar you have to apply the acid test what is the acid test Muhammad says know knowledge is religion so look who you're learning your religion from you can't learn your religion from a priest you can't learn your religion from a rabbi you have to learn your religion from a Muslim Imam because this is knowledge so you have to identify is he God-fearing is he trustworthy is his knowledge solid based on the Quran or the Sunnah or he keeps on Flipping like a fish when you fry it it depends so so many people nowadays say things and they Retreat and oh no no no no this is no I I Chang my mind before I was a salafi now I am beyond salafia I am mallah improved new version 3.0 what is this what are you doing say no no no now I'm I know more I have more where did you get this knowledge from alhamdulillah I have intellect no this is not how it is supposed to be yazid harun says the scholar is your protection on the day of judgment in front of Allah so seek good protection when you come and ask a scholar and he gives you a fatwa you abide by the fatwa because on the day of judgment Allah will not question you Allah will question The Scholar but if he's a shaky scholar not a real scholar if he's a milk shh h n they have a problem why did you choose him his was spot on why didn't you go and follow everything Haram Haram Haram this guy is you know nut case he's everything B no no this guy is mallah he will not protect you on the day of judgment I will not protect you definitely but you have to choose a real scholar someone like baz someone like you follow them well he will be protected with the grace of Allah because they follow the right and this what brings us to the fact that Scholars are divided into three categories says may Allah have mercy on his soul a beautiful statement Scholars are divided into three categories number one scholar of the state The Scholar of the state is always with the government she we want fatwa saying is halal no problem here you go don't forget the bonus she we want fatwa saying this is uh this I sign just bring me the the template and I'll sign itas we've gone through this this is a deviant corrupt scholar because he does not fear Allah he worships the government second is he's a scholar of the nation okay what do you guys want to listen pop or jazz or hard rock can give you whatever you want you vote this has good intentions but unfortunately he has succumb to pressure that okay you guys uh rule democracy so he adheres to what the masses want and un but what can we do so you find them for example in Arabia saying mortgage is Haram riba is Haram the say we have to live rent is very expensive but yeah you said this last year when I went to this land of the is different and the people need to live so I inshallah inshallah this is good fatwa this is uh you're putting yourself in very very bad position so this is number one two number one number two number three a scholar of the religion he doesn't care who's happy and who's he does what pleases Allah and we believe that the old Scholars of Islam are were from this category when you look at Scholars like they died seven till date we are saying may Allah have mercy on them may Allah forgive them we and you take and reap the fruits of it you understand the of sincerity you understand the meaning of they only spoke for the sake of Allah is alive till date look how many scholars we had in the last Century 20 years ago 30 years ago they're gone because Allah did not made Allah did not make their mentioning and memory alive not sincere they were not truthful now for Scholars is it genuine or alhamdulillah we have ai we can ask she G she Google is a good friend of ours and Mah whatever you ask him he answers and AI mashallah you just type nowadays ask I'm sick U write an email to my boss I can't make today WR you this big email even our in the Mas can't do this I don't know you guys I don't know anyhow so do we need Scholars the answer is yes the need for Scholars will be until the day of judgment we will never ever not be in need of them because Islam cannot Thrive cannot exist without Allah's will and if you have good rulers but bad Scholars they will give bad advice and the whole country would go down the drain if you have good Scholars and they say this is halal and this is Haram but you have corrupt rulers can go Halal of course no music she has to be your house but you know what I mean you need these in order and to be successful the prophet said religion religion is advice and both meanings are correct religion is advice we said to whom the prophet said to Allah to his book to his messenger and the leaders of the Muslims and their common folk so we have to give advice and be and the need for Scholars is till the day of judgment Allah says in the Quran in two places in the Quan knowledge if you do not know you have a deficiency you have ignorance ask alaykum she I have a question yes what can I do for you of course I'm not this polite usually I'm a little bit so what can I do for you she 20 years ago I did Hajj and I don't remember whether I threw 20 years ago why now wait another 20 it would be 40 and inshallah this is a good number you crazy why didn't you ask well I was lazy and I found your number in the internet Islam should be something you praise and value that you ask for every single thing so that you worship Allah correctly and the scholars have a special place in our hearts when we see them we tend to praise them them and to honor them and to respect them not fear them they don't bite hopefully but their respect in our hearts so this is why when you look at the previous Sal hugely may Allah have mercy on his soul he says the scholars are more merciful to the um of Muhammad than their fathers and mothers so they said to him why he said their fathers and mothers protect them from fire and harm in this dun they protect you from Hellfire on these are the real Scholars a real scholar is someone that would agitate you would make you feel a little bit uncomfortable he sees you eat or drink with your left hand he says please eat with your right because Shan eats with his left you're getting arrogant why is he telling me this he sees something bad he tries closer to Allah and this is what Imam Ahmed may Allah have mercy on his soul said he said people need knowledge more than they need food and water you may need it twice or three times a day no only seven days a week you have to know is my Salah valid or not is this Halal or not so these Scholars we are in desperate need for them especially when times are not settled what do we mean when there is turmoil when there is chaos when there are pick up a rock and let's throw let's be uh rebellious Let's uh join forces no you go first to the real Scholars she what should we do to the Sunnah stay home she but the government is doing this and that we can kill we can sit home and shut up ah milkshake is afraid they must giving you money yeah look at the countries around us 12 13 years ago five or six or seven Muslim Arab countries tried this throw a rock what happened they've lost everything they them to travel everywhere now they can't travel no visas you your country is unstable they had hosp they can't their currency used to buy them food now they have to work three shifts stability half of the country is immigrant for what for a bunch of youngsters no brains but they thought that you know let's do the and we like uh what's his name these guys uh what's his name oh I forgot anyhow so no go to the scholars Hass when FNA comes everyone sees it only the scholars acknowledge that this is FNA be careful everyone is seeing it but they're unable to identify it when it burns the whole ground everybody can say w the scholars were right we should have listened to them so this is why the death one of the greatest calamities on the umah go and buy from Amazon a dozen of Scholars they don't make them anymore unfortunately Jeff p now you can't get Scholars Scholars are molded and made in the furnace of this life the trials and tribulations according to the Quran and Sunnah it what identifies them so if one of them dies it's difficult when she bbas died we thought that the whole world ended he was a beacon of light then few years later died said we're gone we're doomed and then she albani died we're finished no you're not finished this is the religion of Allah it's not dependent on Tom Dick or Harry Allah will always assign people to protect the religion but they're very few and they're very little the Ayah in the Quran Allah says have they not seen that we set up upon the land reducing it from its borders the lands are shrinking there is no adjuster of his decision this Ayah says this Ayah is referring to the diminishing and the reduction in the number of Scholars this is the biggest Calamity listen to what the prophet saysat he says Allah will not take snatching it away from the people rather he will take away knowledge by taking away the scholars until when there is no scholar left to ignorant leaders who will be asked question was without knowledge they will go astray and Lead others astray may Allah protect us W this is what we see today who do we go to people of knowledge no we go to people who are famous in Tik Tok people are famous on YouTube celebrities what knowledge do they have I don't know but he's famous so we follow him every time I go to a country to an airport people come I said you're lying I look behind me nobody's following me every all of they're following me I don't see anyone following so this is problematic where are the scholars that we can go to so how much time do you have I'm take my time I don't have anything to go my flight is in 5 days take my time but I don't want [Music] to 10 15 minutes oh aldah few questions and answers okay protect our Scholars how do we respect them we have to take a number of steps number one protecting is one of the main reasons for accepting the truth if you Quran and Sunnah I don't respect the Sheik why it's hot to tell you the truth and in in Arabia we don't have this we have air conditions but you guys alhamd you have good weather that so I don't like the Sheik if you don't like the shikh you will not learn from him the most important thing is that you love the Sheikh you honor the you respect him so that you can benefit from him you need to respect and honor the scholars because are the Protectors of the Legacy and the inheritance of the Prophet Muhammad doing something against the Sunnah you know that he's not worthy of being followed because he's not following the Sunnah so why would I learn from someone who is doing this I see some brothers with all due respect to all duas sitting openly with women shaking hands with women what kind of Da is this why don't you invite me come on I'm not that uh ugly and they sit with the sisters and Mah sisters are like this and chitchatting and cracking jokes and at the end of the seminar okay who who wait what are you doing said it's here in the heart well I have to do heart surgery this is not following the Sunnah the prophet sallallah Ali wasallam was a she said oh proph prophet of Allah give us your hand so that we can give you the Pledge of Allegiance he said I Do Not Shake Hands with women full stop so you know better of course not the prophet is our role model Scholars this leads to students to come and learn from them and encourages them to take from its original source so even if you dislike something about a scholar not fearing don't spread anything bad or evil about him encourage the students to come and learn from him and unfortunately the enemies of Islam know this fact in the world the first they do is discredit Scholars they come and talk about them so the masses would against them and stay without having any called or to show show them the right way and this is why the prophet sallallah wasam said he's not from us who he is not from us who does not honor our elders the the the elders must be honored must be respected regardless of their position even even if they're the janitors in your company you have to not respect the elders and have mercy upon the youngsters and know the rights of a this is a Hadith of authenticated by IM albani if you don't know the rights of our Scholars upon you then you are not among whom from the prophet and we leave the remaining time for Q&A inshallah should I go yes sir sound is it permissible for a sheh to give give a seminar to women without hijab yes the Sheikh is meaning yeah there is no visor of course the she doesn't wear hijab there's no problem as long is lowering his gaze because nowadays it's difficult to ask a Sheik to come but alhamdulillah we do this a lot of the times but sometimes in some countries they don't have the nikab and you will find women mixing with men and the likes but the message has to be given so as long as you are giving the beneficial knowledge without you're being Afflicted or affected negatively by lowering your gaze and not looking at women that's okay what's not okay is to share the stage with sisters and people are looking at the sisters and you're sitting next to them this is not permissible and Allah knows best you choose I'm I'm not going to what are the conditions for a woman to give herself away in marriage without a m zero this is inappropriate how can a woman come and give herself to an UNM man relatives or this is indecent place that was accepted when a woman gave herself to the prophet Alat wasam this is mentioned in the Quran and this by Allah but for a woman to come and say she I would like to give you my myself in marriage what is this take two and and and one is free no this is not permissible it is indecent she doesn't have a male M She Talks by email or by letter to the IM and says W I would like to marry so and so if you would kindly speak and propose on my behalf yes the Imam comes and says well we have this sister she's this she's that and she's in um looking for a a husband are you interested maybe the guy says yes maybe the guy says no but her dignity yes [Music] sir Forex and and Bitcoin bit and the ruling is still the same the ambiguity is there the insecurity is there the fluctuation of the prices that are ridiculously done the loss of many people's savings due to loss of the hard disk or the likes is there so until it becomes backed and supported by the Central Bank my ruling is the same that it is not Halal to trade in Bitcoin Forex on the other hand we have a technical side and a practical side technical side is Hal you buy something and you sell it no problem as long as you've possessed it as long as it is not gold silver or currency why gold and silver were stipulated by the prophet Alat that you cannot un simultaneously meaning physically take and I take the the price if I go to a gold smith or a a jewelry shop and I buy a bracelet of gold through credit card this is Haram why because I will take the bracelet but the money money will not be deposited in his account except after a grace period or some time so this is not permissible it has to be simultaneous given take and cash takes the same ruling so three things Gold Silver and cash other stocks like stocks in uh oil companies uh stocks in Dairy companies I buy and sell technically it's whether I pay immediately or pay later as long as there is no margin as long as there are no leverages nothing of the sort it's and I'm buying it and nobody's forcing me to sell no option all of this is Haram and RBA is this real or is it just on the screen am I buying in Shell am I buying in um aramco companies or it's just on the screen showing me that okay you possess 1,000 shares and after 2 days they raise the price a little bit and I sell oh I made profit and after one week I sell I buy again and then they drop and I lose for you to find out so I hope this any answer uh you know yes correct ABD stands on photo and the reason of the difference of opinion is the Hadith of the prophet in cursing the and stating that they're the most severely punished now in contemporary language means Arabic today anyone who applies a camera is known as in Arabic M so they talk took this the old Hadith which is their what is the reason or before that what is meant by m at the time of the Prophet it means who makes an image and and this is done either by drawing or by sculpturing correct now when I take a photograph of you and I show you the photograph would you say Mall you created an exact image of me or would you [Music] say when you sign a check for for2 as a proof I go and zerox it so would you say no no this is not mine or would you say mine of course you would say this is mine when I look in the mirror would I say h here I am but in the mirror is it me yes or no it is because it's a reflection of light and a photograph is a reflection of light this is your picture this is Allah's creation I'm not emitting now if I use Photoshop and I move the pimples and the white hair and the wrinkles and I become Tom Cruz ah this is different now this is manipulating Allah's creation and I am sinful for that so this is why Scholars differ I'm inclined to say that as long as it's a photograph of men or children there's no problem women cannot be filmed or photographed period because it defies the uh camera is theirs nobody's going to see it I still believe that this is not permissible and Allah Knows Best [Music] I cannot hear [Music] you you see he doesn't and [Music] when you're when you're praying and you're saying okay ah so a person praying in the standing position instead of saying alhamdulillah then he remembers then he remembers after this pillar of the Salah if you don't offer the faat in the standing position this is void so if you remember it before the follow what the heck I didn't rece the crazy you stand up immediately ignore the the andite the fa and do do your and finish your prayer normally offer Salam then why because I added a that was not accepted so I added something in the Sal so I offer my after the I I I see so many hands so the brother with the microphone is the one who chooses if they give you money fear Allah question no this Dua is not authentic that the prophet said the meaning is good you're asking what when you say Allah oh Allah forgive me how do you know that you have sins oh Allah free our necks and the necks of our mothers and and fathers from Hellfire yes if you're destined to go to Hellfire Allah will accept if you're not destined it's a freebie the this is an Arabic word it's not the neck and leave our faces and bodies is usually mentioned with slaves so if I have a slave and I want to set him free in Quran so I set him free so one will doesn't say okay I'm going to chop the head and chop the body and just take the the neck and set it free no this is the same with the whole body uh when I say may Allah make your face white this is a metaph says oh I'm black I don't want to become White this is not something intended it is something that Allah would give you light on the day of judgment regardless of your color so the neck means the whole and Allah knows best I don't take the second questions only one huh the brother okay the S is not in a bottle so they say that is it permissible for women to the answer was given by the prophet he said once in a gathering like this to the comp for a woman who believes in Allah and the day of judgment to travel without a Maham so one of the companions stood up said oh prophet of Allah my wife went for Haj without a Mah and my name was drafted to on an expedition what should I do the prophet wasam did not ask him is your wife beautiful or ugly he did not ask him is she young or old he did not ask him is she alone or with [Music] trustworthy and catch up with your wife leave Jihad which means that it is not permissible for a woman no matter how ugly how old or how for or without the companionship of a male Mah this fat is from whom from the prophet you have beef with him the microphone brother where is he well he run away okay where is the microphone [Music] [Music] after after not true yeah not true yes it's not J the of is attended the of is not mandatory whoever wants to sit and listen alhamdulillah if you want to just leave and go uh mind your own business no problem your namas is okay yourid is accepted without any problem it's optional [Applause] access why I don't know your parents okay first of all I the first uh part of the question was about clothes Quran okay so why his parents Clos the Quran after reading it and fold the prayer mat when they're not sitting on it this is part of the culture people think think that having the open Shan May read it so he may repent so the door is open if he can rep yeah do you think if shitan repents Allah will not forgive him Allah will forgive him Allah doomed him in Hell Fire and he would not accept repentance but Allah would accept even butan is so C so so deviant he doesn't want to so our elders close the they don't want him to uh read and they also fold the prayer mat because they don't want him to prostrate and he will never prostrate he was asked to prostrate to Adam and he refused you think now he's going to and he needs a prayer mat he can pray on all of these are not part of Islam but sometimes if someone prays on a Prayer mat he doesn't want people to step on it so they fold it out of having it clean and there is nothing wrong in that inshallah Allah knows best now some of young guys are yes the label I could label myself as Superman that doesn't mean I'm going to wear a cape and tights but I can label myself as what are you going to do you call me Superman salaf is not a label that you just and put it on your pocket Sal is an etiquette is a manh is knowledge is the way of the Prophet Alat wasam these super salafis they're you know you have premium fuel you have regular these are whoa mashallah of Islam and I hate this myself person when people claiming to be salais and they engage in chitchatting on the internet oh shik so and so is wrong he's deviant he's corrupt and the other says no look and they bring a clip he said this he's a liar he's a deceiver and he and the other one refutes that these are not Scholars these are gossipers and maybe if they wear hijab and uh no I sisters don't be offended come onas erase this please edit it from all I'm not finished so you judge people by their rhetoric by their actions by their knowledge the impact these people have on others the it's not a scholar who memorizes 20 books a thousand book mashallah is good photographic memory but his eate his moral conduct his AK is zero no this is not a scholar a real scholar is when you look at the benefits of that individ ual on the community on the society what positivity he has brought to it and oh this Isani this one is this one is Sufi this one is super Sufi this one is my is cotton not not SF from suf and this guy is this this guy okay who's left undermines everybody so that only he remains no follow those who follow the footsteps of the Prophet those who are kind who are generous who do not use profanity who do not hold grudges and who follow the Sunnah to the letter these are the ones who you should look foring Islam we have severals comp where the central [Music] ofes when you say claiming my comes from the fact that most of the conventional B right now have a sh few years ago when we had the P two [Music] Islamic the system they have all these to support there is nothing wrong in that see you cannot come out of thin air and we have an Islamic Bank alhamdulillah we have regulations and processes and fund uh Capital money and all the employees are big beard and they're all Mah knowledgeable and the central ever be the whole monetary system is based on riba so the only way to shift is to gradually do this how I'm a conventional Bank Windows as they call it Shar compliant how as a conventional bank I give you 100,000 you return 110 what you do with it is none of my business you don't give me the 10% when you pay off the loan I'm going to take your house I'm going to take your car I'm going to take your dog everything this is R Shar compliant says we don't lend money lending money with interest is Haram so what do you do I'll sell you this iPad this iPad cost 10,000 I'll sell it for you because I possess it for 11,000 you pay me installments here you go I take the iPad and I sell it outside for $9,000 500 I have the cash this is called I'm happy I'm giving him 100 every month he's instead of the money staying without any benefit it's Halal circulation this is halal so when he comes to the GM of the corporate banking who deals in riba and he tells him listen these are the guarantees it's much more profitable most if not all and he finds that this is true and he's opening a window of Halal now this is to grow and to become possible this is alhamdulillah permissible providing that the Shar board are people who fear Allah real not Scholars for dollars you know they sign in stamp y what's how much is the bonus no they fear Allah and they say no this is Corporate banking this is riba don't even if you change the names it's RBA or no this is halal this helps to change and Allah knows best question from the women question for the sister from the sisters why is it okay this is a commonly asked question why is it an innovation Salah now this is very very famous in the subcontinent India Pakistan Bangladesh they always do and it is a cultural thing because when you come you say this is oh you you're wahhabis you hate the Prophet come on what what what did they do no you you this and that listen what is the def thing that the prophet did not doat and you do it with the prophet had never done it before now my question one evidence proof from the Quran or from the Sunnah the prophet prayed for 10 years in Medina every in where he put his hands how he prostrated how he stood up how he made Ru everything is documented even how he sits so can you bring me one Hadith please that after Sal he used to make for himself no did he ever wash his face and body did he make congregational prayer and everyone behind him says a mean a mean mean if you can thumbs up I'll do it yeah why do you think I have something personal against Dua after Salat I have a whole series on Dua when to make Dua in make Dua before concluding the Salah after salutation of the Prophet sh make Dua between and make Dua in the last thir of the night make Dua when it trains make Dua when you hear the uh uh huh the rooster The Roaster when the the rooster makes it sound make Dua in the last hour of Friday I'm telling you make Dua come on okay sh after Salah no ah Wabi again so I have no problem with making Dua after Salat you have a problem doing something Muhammad did not do his companions 20 of the companions did it no so excuse me where are you bringing this oh so and so said andama so and so said and Moana so Muhammad the companions the and you know better than them be my guest but I follow their footsteps because I know where it leads where Jenna so if you know better be my guest but H there's what the brother has a question no I can't read you read it there will be Muslims that will come with the religion is we with with the religion is weak I'm confused I thought that there was AI also where the Prophet said that the best generation is his than the ones after them okay the Hadith the is where the Prophet said there will come people who did not see me and they wish they had seen me the Deeds of one of them equals the Deeds of 50 of you how is this possible so the brother is saying I'm confused because I thought that the best of generations is the generation companions yes they are the best of the generations but the rewards given by Allah is multiply and generosity not related to who's better that one companion is better than everyone else no matter what you do of good deeds and the evidence is When Heaven bound had a fight and a quarrel with who's KH sa the sword of Allah when the prophet knew about this he was outraged from whom from khed do not harm my companions he would have said I'm your companion but he is one of the 10 heavenbound he's very very high compared to you you gave in charity the mount UD you know how big the mountain is if you give mount uhud in Gold this would not even be equivalent to one mud from abdb Mountain is not equivalent to this so this shows you what that even if the Deeds are 50 times multiplied it would not come even to half a hand of barley or of wheat coming from the companions so I hope this makes sense well you saying good okay yes sir [Music] okay the difference of opinion is related to Scholars and schools and and and students of knowledge one cannot have a decisive decision without proper knowledge unfortunately nowadays we're all using Sheik Google and we think we have qualification to identify so flip a coin okay what are you doing oh it's an of dispute Subhan Allah it's like someone who reads medical journal so he likes to read Mayo Clinic and the likes he reads medical journals and his younger brother comes and says I have this pain in my stomach it's very hurtful said I read an
