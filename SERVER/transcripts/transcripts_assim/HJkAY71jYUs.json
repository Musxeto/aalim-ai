  "transcript": "gorilla says I want to ask a question regarding washing impure clothes in automatic washing machines is it sufficient to wash them in a machine with pure clothes and they would become pure as I've heard that the washer when comes in contact with impure clothes it also becomes impure and in the end clothes remain impure after washing and if stains of impurity remain on clothes after washing such as stain of MIDI or many and menstrual blood are the clothes considered impure first of all rhythm we have to understand that purity is defined into two types of branches and that is removing of the filth and uplifting the ritual impurity and in Arabic it rhymes so they say at Pajaro to referral hadith ii what is a little habit and I will not go into details but if there were to have stains on this head cover that I'm wearing and the stain is here and I put it aside and it rains and I come after it dries and the stain is gone the impurity is gone of course the same is a result of an impurity I did not intend it to be clean it was just cleaned by the rain by itself is this sufficient the answer is yes because removing the filth the impurity does not require an intention anything that removes the physical impurity is sufficient and to the extent that scholars say that removing an impurity does not even require water if it was removed by another liquid another thing this is sufficient unlike wood you cannot perform wood oh except with water but removing the filth than ajasa the impurity can be done with any substance now as you have stated RIBA scholar said that the amount of water to remove an impurity must be overwhelming this is what the scholars say however overwhelming does not mean 10 15 20 litres of water the nomads who came and urinated in the Masjid the Prophet told the companions to bring a bucket of water and pour it over it he did not order them to dig it out and take whatever is there or wet and put it outside of the Masjid no just pouring water over it was suffice because the water would mix with urine dissolve it and it's gone now scholars also say that if you put impure if you put nature's clothes in a washing machine with other dirty clothes that are pure in themselves but the Delta they stink they're they have stains of oil or whatever and you wash it in a washing machine this is sufficient why because it's soaked in water it is washed thoroughly the water is rinsed it's spent then again clean water is put in the same process is done it spend then rinsed this by itself is sufficient to clean your impure clothes now we come back to the issue of stains now stains of menstrual blood is normal because even if you wash them thoroughly so many times the stain the colour would remain but the impurity itself is gone so the scholars say that the stains that remain after washing it has no impact they have no impact on the purity the garment is pure though there is stain marks but it was washed and this is sufficient for it to be clean to be used so don't have the whispers of Shaitaan messing up with your mat with your head this is inshallah all legit and it is clean"
