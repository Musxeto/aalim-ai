  "title": "Ruling on Hair Donation in Islam (Wigs for cancer patients) - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Sabrina says what is the ruling on her donation in Islam is it permissible what if we donate our hair for cancer patients wigs donating hair is problematic if you're gonna cut your hair and you're gonna give it to a particular cancer patient to make a wig of it this is hella giving it to banks or companies that claim that they will do this for cancer patients is not permissible because we do not guarantee that what they're claiming is true a big possibility is that they make 50% wigs to those who underwent chemotherapy and lost their hair and other 50% they sell so it is not permissible to be assisting them when it is doubtful and dubious"
