  "title": "When to make sujood as sahu, prostration of forgetfulness? (mistake in ruku) - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "zayn from bangladesh went to prostrate for forgetfulness and this is a frequently asked question to know the rules of prostration of forgetfulness you need to learn what are the pillars of salat what are the mandatory acts and words to be said in salah and what are the voluntary acts because if you make a mistake in voluntary acts or deliberately abandon them your prayer is still valid and there is no need for sujudis so if every time i don't raise my hands or if i raise my hands every single movement even when going to sujood when rising from the sujud this is a voluntary act it does not require sujude pillars you have to identify so that when you miss one by mistake your prayer is invalid even if you missed it out of forgetfulness it's invalid unless you retract that and attain it and of offer it in the prayer itself before it concludes but if i went home and i and i dope slapped my my head and said oops maghrib i prayed three raka's with only five sujud i missed one sajdah khalas it's over the prayer is invalid i have to repeat it but if i remember that i missed one sujud while in prayer that raka is void and what comes after it takes its place and i have to uh of offer a new raka in addition for that missed and invalid one so it's a long process i don't think we have the time to explain it but if you go to my youtube channel you'll find it explained if you go to my playlist in the youtube channel in the islamic series or in um series you will find in details what are the mandatory acts what are the pillars and what are the voluntary and then you can figure it out but to sum it all up if you make a mistake in your rook and this is your question if i'm not mistaken so instead of saying subhana rabbil you said subhana what to do you cannot rectify it because you're already standing now so the wrong thicker was said in the wrong place which means that you have to prostrate two prostrations of sahu before the salaam and immediately you said subhana rabbil subhana rabbil there is nothing to do no sujud required because you rectified it on the spot and you've added subhana rabbil which is a voluntary vicar there's no problem in that so i hope this answers your question a fan from you"
