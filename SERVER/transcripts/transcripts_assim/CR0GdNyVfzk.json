  "transcript": "[Questioner] from the Emirates   Sheikh my question is some people in my family \nthat are older than me they do some haram things   and I want to tell them that they're doing haram \nthings but in a respectful manner how do I do it   well there is an art for dawa and \nAllah azzawajal praised Prophet   Muhammad (Peace and Blessings be Upon \nHim) in the Quran in chapter three it is by the mercy of Allah that you are soft \nwith them had you been rude and hard-hearted   they would have dispersed away from you \nso Point number one be soft and lenient   and this is also mentioned in the Quran by \nthe terminology Fair preaching so it's not   rude preaching it's not Simon says you have to \ndo this I'm not speaking to the people from my   Ivory Tower I'm going down to their level being \ndiplomatic being a wise knowing when to choose   how to give and when to give advice is very \ncrucial this comes with great amount of knowledge   and experience it comes by asking the elders \nasking the scholars the students of knowledge   it's not just dump all the information you have \non them and say I did my due diligence I told them   this is Haram no you have to prioritize sometimes \nyou have to turn a blind eye to some of their sins   in order to focus on a particular sin that you \nthink is most important and address it instead   of listing 20 sins that they're doing and telling \nthem don't do this don't do this don't do this   and the end of the day they would not listen or \nadhere to any of them so actually it's an art it's   a science it's a gift from Allah that you have \nto ask Allah every time in sujud and at the times   of where on Allah says your Dua so that Allah \nwould make it easy for you to open their hearts"
