  "transcript": "uh sh inshah I'm going to uh Saudi Arabia next month to perform umra so I'll be going to Madina first then I'm coming to Makkah by train so my question is is it okay for me to go to zul mikat First make the intention and then go to train the answer is yes this is what you are supposed to do you are obliged to assume youram from the mikat of the people of Medina known as or nowadays is called AB Ali but due to the fact that it's so close to Medina it is more convenient for you to put on youram clothes from the hotel in Medina and then when you go to the train station you ask the taxi driver that takes you there and at the train station where is the mik and they'll tell you it's close by so even if you assume youram from the hotel itself or from the train station that would be sufficient inshallah and safer"
