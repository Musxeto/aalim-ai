  "title": "How to lower gaze when you have to talk to non mahram women like doctor, teacher, receptionist Assim",
  "transcript": "this question is from faisal he says we are ordered to lower our gaze so how do we deal with situations where we have to talk with women like receptionists sales women air hostesses doctors teachers etc the rule is general allah says and lower some or part of your gaze allah did not say lower your gaze completely because then you're gonna uh smack a light pole or maybe run into another car no you have to distract your gaze if there is another movement but this cannot be done unless you take the first glance and the first glance is yours so i'm driving a woman crosses the road i do this i realize she's a woman i lower my gaze look the other way not do this and say oh it's the first gaze i'm still enjoying it no this is haram this is predetermined this is intentional and it's haram lower your gaze now some cases you're permitted to look as in the case of a doctor who is allowed to look where it is necessary so a female patient comes and he has to examine that specific place a her hand her ear he only is allowed to look there not elsewhere but also a person proposing so you propose to a woman you're entitled to go in the first interview to look at her and to to take a good look not to pretend that you're shy and look downwards and not see her no take a good look examine the merchandise because she's going to do the same to you she's going to examine you and if she doesn't like what she sees well then we don't have a green light likewise some jurors say that you are entitled to look at a woman who's coming to the shop to buy because this woman when she buys a product and goes and comes after an hour and she says i bought this product from you it was defected and i'd like to return it if you didn't see her he said i don't know i i didn't see you i don't know you. and then this would not do a good job you have to see her so that you can recognize that she it was the one that bought it from you but in general doctors receptionists nurses etc you have to lower your gaze one feels a little bit embarrassed how can i share speak to someone and do this excuse me can you give me this or exchange this and have an appointment and not look at them they will be offended so what let them be offended they're there not to be courteous and socialize with me they're there to do their job likewise if a teacher and i'm compelled to go to a university and the teacher is a female i have to look at the board all the time i have to look at my notebooks i have to look elsewhere not on that teacher especially if she's not properly dressed and even if there is fitna then it becomes haram for you to be in such a place as your religion comes first so you have to weigh the pros and cons and allah knows best"
