  "transcript": "Munib from Brazil Hello, yes Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So this question I'm about to ask I have asked many knowledgeable people and they stated that this This there's no answer because there's not much evidence found. So I'm gonna state my question I'm waiting. In Islam it states that all people of Jannah will be recreated with a new body form that is none like this worldly life and That is it enlarged and which is which will resemble Prophet Adam peace be upon him I was wondering will all women in Jannah be made of one body structure I believe all men in Jannah will be made of one Exact body figure resembling Prophet Adam and all women in Jannah will be made of one body figure resembling Hawa Prophet Adam's wife, so there would only be two body forms in Jannah. How would how would they know each other? They would have like name tags or what? How did you reach this conclusion to begin with? Munib Hello, yes, how did you reach this conclusion to begin with where did you get this information from? I Just came across this online. Yeah, do you believe anything you hear online? Then you should believe in Bigfoot This is not logical a key we don't take our knowledge about Islam About things that we don't have any information of from the unseen from the internet from Tom Dick and Harry What we know from the Sunnah that the people will be recreated in the best of form they'll have the height and There be like 60 feet tall as Prophet Adam not resembling Prophet Adam or our mother Hawa Eve so to claim that they all have only two forms, this is baseless and based on Whims and desires no Information from the Quran and Sunnah, they will be in the best of form. They'll be beautiful gorgeous handsome beyond Imagination how this is in Allah's hands not only that every single week They are increased in beauty where you just thought that this is the ultimate of beauty Next week, it's more The following week it's even more and this is for eternity something that blows your mind away So as they say in English the devil is in the details Don't go to such details that you don't have any knowledge of and say, okay If they're going to do this, then they require this amount of calories. How much food are they going to consume? It's none of your business Don't focus on the little trivial details that you don't have any information of about and make up things and Focus on reaching there and Allah knows best"
