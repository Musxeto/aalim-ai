  "title": "Can we offer sujood on the back of the one who is praying in front of us on Eid if space is limited",
  "transcript": "brother uh hamza from bosnia how are you doing sheikh i do alhamdulillah masha'allah so sheikh in my country people pray the eid prayer in the mosque instead of doing it outside as per the sunnah so the mosque gets filled with people very easily until there is no space for one more person to join so the imam says that we should tighten our rows and make the roads closer to one another and he also says that we should offer the sujud on the back of the person in front of us and not on the floor i don't do this myself but is the prayer of people who do that valid well this is a an issue that was mentioned in the schools of thought when the place is too tight and you are unable to prostrate on the floor that you prostrate to the best of your ability even if it is to to prostrate on other people's backs but i see that this is not a legitimate reason for a number of uh reasons one of them is that the salat is not mandatory if it is that tight so if you come to the masjid and is filled you don't have to pray standing up so yes okay now we're this close and when we prostrate we have to prostate on our brother's back but if we sit real tight like in a bus or in in a train that is packed then we can just nod nobody says this so pray normally have the rose normally let the people prostrate on the ground normally without agitating and annoying anyone and going out of the norm because this is not a fart first of all it's the most uh the majority of scholars say it's a recommended sunnah secondly they can pray outside alhamdulillah and if they miss the prayer they can pray while the imam is giving the khutbah on their own or in another congregation there is no problem in that and allah azza knows best you"
