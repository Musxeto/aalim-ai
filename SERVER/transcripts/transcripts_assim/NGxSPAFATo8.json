  "title": "Hadith: I will accept Islam but only pray 2 times a day. Is this applicable today? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "clerics s is the hadith authentic and if yes how to understand it we have been informed from her ok the narration narration that a man came to the prophet Aristotle Salaam to embrace Islam with the condition or making a condition not to pray except two prayers per day and it was accepted from him reported by a man a highly Muslim this hadith caused a lot of confusion among the Muslims one hadith stating that this man says I will not pray five times a day I'll pray only to fight two times a day and the Prophet accepted that other hadith people came and said we will not pray at all and we will not perform jihad but everything else we will accept it and the Prophet said if they become Muslim they will pray and they will perform jihad others said that we don't want to give the cat so these hadith were confusing because some scholars say that this is permissible as it is part of gradually calling people to Islam such as in the case someone comes to me and says chef I mentioned this in Islam but I am addicted to drugs and I can't leave drugs as a Muslim I would say embrace Islam and insha'Allah through time you will be able to kick this habit others would say no either you take the full package or leave the full package and this is wrong we have to call people gradually some scholars say said that yes we have to call people gradually but this is not calling them gradually these are putting hurdles in front of accepting Islam as a whole not stating that they have weaknesses but they're rejecting the concept of Islam so this is not accepted and the most acceptable interpretation for this hadith is that the one who accepted it was the Prophet isosa he's the one who said once they are Muslim they will pray they would perform jihad they will give zakat and this cannot happen except to someone who's getting revelation from Allah because this is from the unseen besides when the Prophet sent more Adam the javelin may Allah be pleased with him to Yemen he told him tell them that Allah has obliged them to pray 5 prayers a day if they accept this then tell him tell them that Allah has put a percentage on their wealth taken from the Pope from the rich and given to the poor so the Prophet kept on saying if they accept this then tell them which means that it's a it's a package deal they have to accept it so the most authentic opinion is that if someone today comes and says I will accept Islam but I will not fast from about we tell them that this is not acceptable so it is not permissible for someone to pick and choose though other scholars said accept it from him because the Islam is valid and the condition is invalid and once he accepts this in him and he says ok I'm not fasting tell him if you don't fast we're gonna chop your head off because you're not a Muslim this is not fair this is not part of fulfilling your commitment he says I'll accept Islam but I don't I will not fast Ramadan cuz I don't believe in it to say sorry either take it all or leave it all if he says I'm addicted to drugs I said okay but you have to acknowledges is prohibited and you have to try your level best to leave it but till then you're still a perfectly good Muslim and Allah soldier knows best"
