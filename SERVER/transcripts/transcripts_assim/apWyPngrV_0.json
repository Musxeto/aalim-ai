  "title": "Made a mistake in Fateha or Tashahhud, should I repeat whole Ayah or the single word Assim al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "from the uk he says if i made a mistake in fatiha and the mistake is in a single word should i repeat the full verse or into should i repeat the full phrase or only the word so if i said what a valine i said instead of okay it's accepted in some dissertations and it can work but if i made such a mistake so should i repeat it's best to repeat the whole phrase so that the meaning would fall into place but if you just repeated the single word and corrected it corrected it and rectified it this does the job in sha allah and allah azza knows best this"
