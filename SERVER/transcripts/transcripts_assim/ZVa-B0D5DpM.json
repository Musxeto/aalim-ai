  "transcript": "singapore if i understand her question correctly she's asking about wearing the hijab you know the hijab can be very short covers only the uh head and the neck but shows the bosoms and it can be ample that covers the whole area and the shoulders so if i understand her question she's asking about what about the back side because if i cover my hair and head only the neck would be covered but the shoulders my uh back would not be covered no the best hijab for a woman is to wear ajilbab to wear a himar this ample head cover that covers all of her body up or down to her waist so even if i look at her from the back i cannot see and distinguish the size of her shoulders i cannot see how wide or thin she is because of the ample ghana that's going down like you guys can't see my shoulders and what how thin or how fat or how wide i am because of what i'm wearing but if i take it off you could you could see it so for a woman it is more needed to be concealed so that no wrong ideas would be converted in some sick people's minds you"
