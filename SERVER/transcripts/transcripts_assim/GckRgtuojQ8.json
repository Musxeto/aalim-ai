  "title": "Is it suicide if he refuses Cauterization  because he wants to be among the 70,000?",
  "transcript": "I just want to know if a person has some medical condition to which the doctors tell him that the only option available for treatment is cauterization but the person does not want to cauterize because he wants to be among the 70 000 on the day of human who will go to Jannah without accountability so the the what the person does he takes every other form available like drinking zamzam doing cellophobia uh and making a Dua but he dies because of this medical condition but he does not want to cauterize will this be considered as suicide no it's not suicide unless all doctors say that if you don't do this you will die meaning that someone has continuous bleeding as in the case of for example he was injured in the battle of the trenchal handak and he kept on bleeding for a whole month and the prophet salallahu himself had to cuterize him accusation is done by getting a piece of metal warming it until it's really hot and then placing it on a certain place or on the wound so that it would stop the bleeding so the prophet himself did this and if it was not permissible the prophet would not have done it also the prophet said to us Islam that one of the three forms of medication is cauterization so this is part of the Islamic healing though it is not recommended until it's the last option so when the doctors say that your illness can only be cured by this procedure and you say no I don't want to do it and they'll tell you it will cause you to die you're sinful because you chose what was certain to cure you the grace of Allah and you rejected it but if they say well I will take this procedure but it's 50 50. we're not sure if it's going to work or not and you abandon it trusting Allah and depending on Allah there is nothing wrong and there's nothing silver all that insha Allah [Music] and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and the evening I will uh try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah"
