  "transcript": "um mm-hmm alhamdulillah I mean a group of men came to the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam came to Medina and fell sick they accepted Islam but they had this starving and hunger in them before they came and they felt sick because of the fever that was common in Medina they requested the prophet for assistance so he told them to go out of Medina where the camels of of Charity is there stayed there and he instructed them to drink from the milk and the urine of the camels you did not hear that wrong he instructed them to drink from the milk and the urine of camel that one would say urine of camels what is this well nowadays with the grace of Allah it is scientifically proven from the states and from Europe that the urine of camels cures a lot of diseases and even if it was not proven we believe in this because our Prophet instructed them to do this he did not instruct us to do anything with the urine of cap of cows or sheep but specifically only camels a question comes and and this question is is logical is the urine of camels nudges impure or is it pure the answer of course as long as they were instructed to drink it it means that it is pure because it is well known fact in Islam that you may not treat yourself you may not not consume anything as medicine as long as it's forbidden or as long as it is impure nudges so they went and before they knew it they were well and healthy again they did not thank and praise the blessing of Allah they were not grateful to the kindness of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi instead they went to the man who was taking care of the camels and they tortured him before killing him and they ran away with some of the camels of the prophet once the prophet came to know about this he sent behind them Jaber al-fairi to go and Salvage the camels and to get them back to Justice they were from the tribes of vocal and orina and their story is known as the story of the arani Yin and they were brought to Justice the prophet sallam was very angry with them so he ordered his companions to Heat nails of iron and to do to their eyes what they did to that man whom they had tortured and killed and he ordered their hands and legs to be chopped off and they were thrown on the open a volcanic rocks the hot black rocks to to bleed till death and he left them to die some narrations say that he he crucified two of them and did uh the things with the eyes to two and he to the other two he chopped off their hands and legs Scholars say that this was before the prophet was ordered not to mutilate people and the only reason that the prophet did this that it is exactly the same thing they did to that Shepherd who was taken care of the camps so in Islam if someone harms you or oppresses you you may treat him in the same fashion and manner and that is why there was a report that a Slave woman was killed by a Jew and the Jew smacked her head with two stones and just as she was dying the prophet sallam came to her and told her did so and so killed you she said no she just moved her head he named another man she moved her head saying no it was not him he named the Jew and she nodded her head saying yes he's the one so the prophet sallam instructed the companions to kill the Jew in the same fashion that he killed that woman by smacking his head between two big stones so one would say why does not Islam forgive people if if they did such a thing why do you have to retaliate because if Islam came with forgiving this does not fit everyone and this would encourage people to do more and more killing and looting imagine if someone did this to your sister and Islam tells you to give would you forgive no okay if someone rapes another another one's daughter and we tell them okay come on it's a mistake he's young he's only 16 he's only 17. he was under the influence of drugs let him go do you think if you see him walking on the street he would let him go no so Islam does not want chaos to be the rule he wants the society to be governed and protected and the only way to do this is to have the rule of law upon all it's like setting an example for people to to fear well it's not only fear it's Justice because if you want them to be afraid instead of chopping the hand of a person who steals you could kill him you could mutilate him you could crucify him this would make them more fearful but Islam is the religion of Justice it tells you if you do this this is what's going to happen and if you look at the prisons in the West and look at the prisons in countries that practice Islam and and has Islam ruling her uh judicial um and courts and so on you would find that there is no comparison none whatsoever in the United States of America I think that was in 2003 or 2002 not less than 2 000 women are being raped every single day and this is in accordance to the Department of Justice you can visit their website don't quote me just Google it website to the Department of Justice and look at the time table at the table they have for the rates of rape that were announced in the United States of America alone Imagine This and what usually and I'm not talking about the things that were not reported what happens if a person does such a crime he would probably get a very strong Court uh trial the victim would be scrutinized and intimidated in so many different ways by the by his lawyers and then if indicted then he would be sentenced to two years three years in prison with good behavior probably he would be on the streets after nine months or one year and this tells you he would go on and on and on doing his crimes because he's not afraid of anything in Islam drop his head off end of story so before you think on doing such a thing you think more than twice because you know that it's not it's not a game it's not something easy for you to go in the battlefield we know that we are not allowed to kill children women and stuff like that where if the having from the Jews or from the our enemy if they kill our woman and children are we allowed to do the same no again it is forbidden in Islam to punish someone who is innocent for the wrongdoing of someone else so if someone kills my son it is not lawful for me to go and kill his he's the one who did the crime he's the one to be killed and punished for that his son has nothing he has not done anything wrong so completely in Islam it's forbidden to punish someone for the wrongdoing of someone else so now the only the only thing we have to fight is the the the words only the Warriors yes only those who are fighting us we are allowed to fight and that is why when the prophet salallahu as mentioned before sent his companions to kill uh the Jew and and so many others he always told them do not kill any child or any woman only those who are you going to kill who inflicted so much harm on the Muslims and wanted to attack the Muslim and collaborated in attacking and undermining the efforts of Islam but to kill a a child or a woman to kill an elder elderly or a priest or a monk this is unacceptable in Islam so the prophet saws because of their wrongdoing he instructed the companions to do such severe punishment on them the scholars say this was at the very beginning but then the prophet saws was given the uh Ayah the verse of hiraba of those who spread may have in in in the land and intimidate and terrorize people he is given the choice of either killing them crucifying them chopping their hands and and arms from uh opposite directions or uh he has the fourth choice which is to uh set them to Exile or imprison them and after that the prophet sallam did not do any a similar uh mutilation well actually before that he didn't even do anything that was even close to this this was the only time because of what they had done with that man again before it was okay and permissible for the prophet is to burn people to death and this may have happened once or twice and then Allah instructed him that this is completely unacceptable and no one punishes with fire except the lord of the fire who is Allah the Almighty I believe we have a short break stay tuned insha Allah we will be right back hmm so this is an open invitation for everybody to recognize God and enjoy his blessings in this life and his Mercy in this life and in the Hereafter as well Allah each name has a meaning each name signifies a nature of Allah the Almighty which no one shares or is compared to Allah in it and welcome back one night the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam had a dream and we know that the dreams of The Messengers of Allah are prophecies they are not only dreams because dreams that are Fabrications are the result of Satan and they don't get Satan to influence them so in his dream that he was wearing the Haram and it's the Garment that a person who intends to perform umrah or to perform pilgrimage must wear so he saw that he is he was wearing and that he went to Mecca to perform umrah and that he had the keys of the Kaaba the holy Kaaba and he told his companions about this and they were very happy they were very joyful simply because it's been almost six years since they've seen the karma and you can imagine the the the feeling they had they were homesick after spending all your youth All Your Life Born raised in Mecca where you can go to the holy mosque and go around the holy Kaaba in tawaf pray to the holy Kaaba and see the holy shrines of the Haram and all of a sudden you had to migrate and leave your Homeland to a new country so you can imagine the feeling the feelings they had once they heard this so the prophet salallahu gathered those whom were with him and about 1400 men went to Makkah for umrah now it was obvious that the prophet sallallahu did not go to market to invade it because he had very light arms with him they had only their swords they did not come in armor on the country they came waiting the garments of a Haram and also they had the camels with them that were to be sacrified in Mecca and these camels usually are driven by those performing polygrimage and they were known to be for sacrifice so no one would use them and it would be honored and the minute you see such a a caravan you would know that this is a holy Caravan headed for pilgrimage or for umrah they had few marks or things indicating signs indicating that these are for sacrifice and the prophet saws went heading to Mecca all around Arabia the word was the people of quraish do not prevent anyone from coming to the holy mosque to the Kaaba because this is the house of Allah so we have no right to prevent anyone from coming in now the prophet went and the people of quraish heard about this and they were outraged not because the prophet is coming to perform umrah but because the prophet salallahu is coming and they thought that over their dead body you would not accept this and that was very strange because this is the house of Allah who are you to prevent him from coming and worshiping he's not coming to stay he is coming to worship the Almighty again their arrogance prevented them from seeing the truth so they sent Khalid one of their great warriors and Fighters and leaders in a Detachment of 200 writers they wanted to intercept the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and the prophet heard of him coming so he went out of the normal Road he took right and went up West and went through a very narrow and hard Trail was very difficult but still the prophet sallam went there because he wanted to avoid fighting he did he is not there to fight though he could have easily fought kharid and the men with him and killed them all but he was on a holy trip he was not there to fight and when he reached an area called al-hodabia the camel sat and stopped her debia is close to what we know now in present days as shimasi it's a checkpoint if you going from Jeddah to Mecca it's the checkpoint there this area is called herdevia so the camel sat and refused to continue so the companions started pulling the uh uh the camels and as you can see on the map this was the route where the Prophet sallallahu came and and and and these are the different areas of course to the West is the Red Sea so Mecca is not that far from the Red Sea it's about 100 kilometers to the east of it and this is where it all took place now the prophet Allah told his companions that let go of my camel and they were trying to make the camel stand and move and that he told him that let go of it it was prevented from moving by the same person or by the same power that prevented the elephant from attacking Mecca and as you recall that the people of Yemen wanted to destroy the Kaaba on the year that the prophet sallam was born known as the year of the elephant and they sent all their soldiers and their elephants to attack the Kaaba and destroy it because they had a church in Yemen and some Arab went in there and he uh put filth into it because they wanted that church that big uh Monument to replace the Kaaba where people would come and perform pilgrimage instead of going to Kaaba so the king of that country got Furious and he wanted to attack the Kaaba and destroy it and you know the story as we it was mentioned before where Allah sent these birds and they were all killed and attacked so the prophet is telling them that Allah who prevented the elephant from proceeding forward had made my camel stop here so we will stop and set camp and by Allah whatever treaty an agreement they ask of me in order to glorify the holy shrines I will accept so the prophet saws had an idea of things that will progress in a in a certain fashion once the prophet Allah reached that stage they sat they had their camp near a well but unfortunately the well ran out of water so the enemy the the people of quraish and the Habib Army was closer to the Wells that had all the water and the prophet sallam had only one well and it was out of water so the companions of the Prophet sallam complained that we have a problem we don't have water one narration says that he took an arrow from his back and he asked them to throw it in the well another narration says that he himself spit in that well and subhanallah all of this is authentic the well was flooded with water and they drank and they filled their uh water uh bags or water containers and they washed and they did whatever they wanted with so much water that was more than what they needed and this again was a miracle from Allah to his Prophet sallallahu alaihi along so many miracles came in a group of his tribesmen as we know he is from the tribe of Jose that's why he's called so they usually make the last name referring to the tribe so he came to the prophet saws and he told them told him that you know that I'm your ally but I'm telling you know I and his people the old the people of Campbell with the habish came next to the water wells of her Debian and they brought with them their wives and children why would anyone do that what do you think for war but why do you bring your wives and children yes it's not to encourage them it's to show them that this there's no going back if you lose they will enslave your children and wives so fight till the death so this meant that they were really serious they came with their wives and children to say that we're going to die before allowing you to come to Mecca so the prophet saws told him that we didn't come or I didn't come to fight anybody I just came to perform umrah and it's very strange the people of Christ are weakened by so many fights they are weakened but we are stronger the people of quraish are weakened by the fights so why not put a time limit between the both of us why not have a truce and if Allah azzawajal makes me Prevail over the people then they have the choice whether to join me and accept Islam and be part of this Victory or to reject it and this is this sounds acceptable what's wrong with you the people of quraish and he told them he told this is a choice they could have a truce and await until things materialize if I'm Victorious they can join me if they want but if they don't want to have a truce and they decide to fight me and to prevent me from entering Mecca by Allah I will fight them till the death until my head Falls and and it's not on my body so Buddhism went to the people of Makkah and he told them all of this and he told them that he is asking you for a very well and sound plan you should accept I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program until we meet next time oh oh foreign"
