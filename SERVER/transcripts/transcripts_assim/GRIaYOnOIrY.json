  "transcript": "[Music] all Allah Allah Allah what is the ruling on patience do I have to be patient it has the five verdicts or rulings that we have in it can be mandatory it can be forbidden it can be recommended it can be not recommended or disliked and it can be permissible five categories everything we do falls under these five categories and depending so if someone says what's the ruling on being patient on praying F in the Masid you say this is W you have to do this what's the ruling on being patient from listening to music or watching uh uh scrubs or soap operas and we're in hospital so they watch a lot of Scrubs so what's the ruling on that oh it's Haram it is forbidden for you to be patient yes but it's like in half an hour wrap up the program and let's watch it I I cannot be patient no you have to be patient here and if you're patient on going and watching it and doing the Haram this is Haram and likewise with the recommended and not recommended and with the permissible thing okay then we we Muslims say we have it figured out right we are the most patient people on earth is this correct yes or no whisper it to to the man on your right no I'll will not do that huh come on guys is it right are we the most patient people on Earth no no even the kufar the disbelievers have patience some of them have greater patience than us Allah mentioned theah Surah that they're advising one another to move on and to be patient on worshiping your Idols don't listen to these people who are telling you worship only one God so they are recommending one another I remember and I think I have some time to reflect um few years back like 14 years 15 years ago Christopher Reed was Superman mashallah okay okay and was okay let's not go there okay Christopher ree was Superman the guy was a handsome goodlooking athletic actor and he had a beautiful wife and he had four children and he was um I don't know how they call it in Arabic in English he used to ride horses and jump fences there's a a terminology for that whatever so so the guy was a professional I he used to compete and one day out of the blue while he was attempting to jump off fence the horse thought that there's a rabbit or something that crossed by so it froze and this happens and when you are you know running in a high speed trying to jump and then all of a sudden your car breaks or your horse just freezes you start to feel like a real Superman so the guy started I was leave I can fly and the poor thing fell on his neck broke it and he was paralyzed neck down and within 6 to8 weeks the guy was participating on his wheelchair unable to do anything unable to move except to speak not even to breathe he participated in the par Oly Olympics I think this is for the the uh uh physically challenged or whatever they call them and a week later he participated in a yak or a a a boat race that was in and he they were showing his picture just sitting there with all the makeup and and the guy kept on doing donations and doing so many good things on his life and he was not a Believer he was not a Muslim and this brings us to the classification of people as the scholars say when it comes to patience and is and IM people are divided into four types one those who have IM and patience and these are the Elite of the human race these are the Muslims who have Islam who have belief they are all and they're patient on all the three divisions that you've mentioned and we will elaborate a little bit more category two those who are believers but they are not patient and this is the majority of Muslims they elaborate and they say the majority of us are from this category meaning that we are Believers we pray we fast we attend Mah lectures and we give donations and we do tahajud unless we are tested and when the test Comes This reveals our true identity this reveals our true IM and may Allah conceal our shortcomings and not expose us because W I've seen people being exposed like this and I'm afraid that I would be exposed as well so we pray to Allah to conceal our uh uh shortcomings and to make make us steadfast on this te the third category are those who are disbelievers but they are patient they have the sub in them to tolerate and one of them is Christopher Ree and the worst of all categories are those who don't have Iman and they don't have uh uh uh patience and that's why if you go to Sweden for example beautiful country Beautiful People beautiful uh economy yet the highest rate in committing suicide why no Ean no patience so I have I had done everything so what's left let me try to jump from 120 stories high building and see maybe I would blind on my feet so alhamdulillah for the grace of Allah now going back to the original question is patience a Char a characteristic of only the Believers the answer is no disbelievers may share this with us but it is a prominent sign that this person could be a believer so the majority of Muslims inshallah they have patience in them and their role model are the prophets and messengers of Allah take a look at n and this is uh role model for every how long have you been doing da talking about myself very little how much do you devote for dawa from your day well a week maybe yeah an hour for da but I convinced myself that I'm doing something good by playing around okay what about you the same thing no you have to raise the level of your Daw commitment by looking at n no peace be upon Him Allah mentioned in the Quran that he stayed for a whole 10 uh uh centuries except 50 years 1,000 years except 950 years he kept on giving dawa look at the uh uh patience of ibraim ibraim is a chapter on his own he is the father of all Messengers and he is no one is the best friend of Allah except two ibraim and Muhammad peace be upon them all and we mention his name every time we pray in the T so ibraim is is is a category of his own and he is an umah by his own when he was a teenager they threw him in the fire that was so huge people say tales about it and he did not even blink do you have anything do you need anything is sufficient for us subh this is what all what he said and Allah saved him M also tolerated the harassment of the sons of Israel and their blasphemy and their rejection of every everything he had brought them and that is why the prophet was he was told that they said this and that about you he was frustrated but then he said may Allah have mercy on my brother Musa he was abused more than this and he tolerated it he was patient so we learn from Musa we learned from Isa peace be upon him we know what they did to him and they the last thing they tried they tried to crucify him to kill him but Allah ascended him to him patience is not to complain and not to do something that shows that you are not accepting what Allah has decreed upon you Allah told us that calamities will take place will take place whether you like it or not it's going to happen Allah says subhanahu wa ta'ala and certainly we shall test you with something of fear hunger loss of wealth loss of lives and loss of fruits but give Glad Tidings to the the people who endureed the patient the tolerant so all of these calamities will happen to you maybe you've lived 40 years and nothing happened it will happen maybe it happened and you did not feel it maybe Allah punished you and you shrugged your shoulders and walked away it happens to each and every individual but once it happens how should we react the minute someone bangs my car and I come out you son of a so and so I'm going to hit you I'm going to step on you I'm going to kill you I'll kill you huh then what happens after everything and Naim comes after 6 hours to record what's happening and then he tells me oh he doesn't have insurance you have to go to the police uh department and I spend like a day and a half and after everything that happens and I go back home [Music] alhamdulillah does this work no it doesn't why doesn't it work because it has to be at the first incident at the minute it happens it was reported in the authentic Hadith that a woman lost her child so was she was at his grave weeping and the prophet walked behind her and said oh a slave of Allah fear Allah and have patience have tolerance to what calamity had uh struck you and the woman threw out her tears and and and and sobbing and she said go away you were not struck by a Calamity like mine go away leave me alone so the prophet left now if someone said this to the Sheikh what would I do with him I'm going to bench press him like six times and then why because I'm not the Prophet The Prophet left and the companions came to her and said woman are you crazy this is the prophet and the woman was depressed and and shocked again so she rushed into the Masjid to meet the prophet and said oh prophet of Allah oh prophet of Allah I have become patient I have become patient and the prophet said the uh patience is at the first shock of a Calamity this is what's acceptable not after 5 days or 6 days and that is why the scholars say that a real wise man A True Believer is behaves when a Calamity takes takes place exactly like a fool after 1 month when a a fool is struck by a Calamity what does he do bangs his head in the wall tears his clothes tears his his hair slaps his face says obscene things after one month what would happen to him he's he's cooled he's calmed down he's cool now he forgot everything a wise man or a Believer does this on the first day not waiting after a whole month so when a Calamity takes place yeah you do whatever you want will it change I lost my child my child died may may Allah protect all of our children what should I do why why me I do this I heard it Allah from people so it's it's done so what what are you going to do so you have to be uh patient and tolerant and this doesn't mean that you have a Heart of Stone no you can react you can cry you can uh uh uh feel sorry the prophet Alam when his son ibraim died what did he say the heart is saddened and the eyes are watering and and and crying and we do not say except what pleases Allah and by Allah by your departure we are saddened ibraim he he was sad he was crying and the companions are telling him you do this prophet of you cry said yes this is Mercy from Allah but what comes out of your mouth is what your hold held accountable uh with [Music] [Music]"
