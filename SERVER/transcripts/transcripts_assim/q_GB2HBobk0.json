  "title": "Can we donate Breastmilk? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so Hannah says it is it permissible to donate breast milk we have such breast milks donation banks in the West in Islam when a woman suckles a child this is an act of charity but it is also a very sensitive and important issue because the Prophet told the Saudis a lot of serum that if a child suckles from a woman when he is below two years of age and he suckles five meals he becomes automatically a child a son of that woman a son of her husband and a sibling to all of their offspring those who came before and came after the suckling which means that it is extremely important to be careful when donating such milk or when suckling other children so even if you suckle a child randomly you have to know who that child is so that in the future your son or daughter would not marry this boy or girl because then they would be marrying their own brother or sister and therefore donating breast milk human breast milk to such banks is totally prohibited now if it is not a human breast milk bank like if they have a bank for cow milks or the likes there is no problem in giving that to them because animal milk does not spread such muharram issues between the humans only human breast milk does that"
