  "transcript": "Sahil from India. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi. Sheikh I have OCD with Salah and Wudu which really with mandatory actors such as wiping forehead, Fatiha etc. All this is making my life very hard. Sheikh can I ignore these thoughts and for how much time should I ignore these thoughts? You must ignore it for eternity. Whenever there is hardship and you're suffering from it, you have to acknowledge that this is from Shaytan, it's not from Islam. So the moment you feel that this is becoming out of hand, this is from Shaytan, he's messing up with your head. The best thing to do for people with OCD is to ignore. The moment they fail to ignore, they have opened the Pandora box. They've set themselves right into the trap of Shaytan. May Allah protect us all."
