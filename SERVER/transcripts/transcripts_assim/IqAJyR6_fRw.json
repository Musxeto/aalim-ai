  "transcript": "Medina from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So I hope this question isn't like bad or something but I wanted to ask if I could for example go to like this Bid'ah Mosque with my friend for the sake of like learning something I don't know about Islam or just hanging out because I don't know it's like better than being outside no of course of course when you go to a masjid that teaches Bid'ah and we know that Bid'ah is below shirk and above major sins and it's dangerous it corrupts your religion it corrupts your conviction it corrupts your association with Islam because they are teaching you something that is not related to Islam this is uncalled for and it is not permissible so you say I have a choice between going to a masjid that teaches Bid'ah or going out and not doing anything no go out and do not do anything rather than corrupt your Islam and your knowledge about this beautiful religion and Allah Azza wa Jal knows best"
