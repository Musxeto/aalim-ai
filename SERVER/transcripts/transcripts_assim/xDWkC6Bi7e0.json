  "title": "Ruling on investing in Mutual Funds and the transaction called Mudarabah - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Anjem is saying what is the ruling in Islam about investing our funds in mutual funds some say it to be halal please confirm and also from Quran we understand that if we don't put our efforts then we cannot take any profit from it so how does mutual fund help in this regard well first of all it doesn't say in the Quran that you have to put some effort into a transaction to be Hallett transactions are different types and categories one of the most famous and known to people is mobile ABBA and what is mobile abba madaba is it a company it's a collaboration between two one has the capital and the other one has the know-how and the management and the work so he comes to the guy with the capital he shows him the plans for their company and he says that I'd like to invest so-and-so from your wealth in so-and-so in what we have and this is my project you have you get X Y Z percentage of the profit and I get X Y Z of it so you have the capital you get thirty percent of the profit I have the know-how and the connections and I'm the one who's gonna manage it I get seventy percent they agree and hamdulillah the business begins this is called mu Barbra the profit is divided according to the percentage laid in the beginning and agreed upon however the loss is encountered only on the capital because the other guy will lose his effort his time his work his know-how which he had invested this kind of transaction is hella we cannot claim that the man with the capital did not put any effort hence his profit is Haram he did put effort he put the cash and he is investing it so this is to answer your second part of your question as for Anjali your first part what is mutual fund mutual means that a number of people are involved in it and fund means money is involved it so what I understand of mutual fund is that people give them money to someone who runs and invests their money for them usually by buying stocks or bonds and he knows when to sell and when to buy he knows what to do with the dividends and he gives you interest or profit accordingly so what's the ruling on establishing such a portfolio or investing your money in it this is like stocks of a company it all depends on a number of factors the most important would be the line of work so if we have a portfolio and someone is running it and investing my money in it what is he investing in if he says I'm investing in banking in insurance companies in entertainment movies and music and the likes in tobacco in liquor all of these are totally prohibited and Haram to invest in and your money is Haram so this is not permissible he tells me that I'll invest your money in buying stocks in pharmaceutical companies that sell halal products in dairy products in farming in manufacturing and industries that are halal in this case this is Helen depending again on how these companies are financed because if they are totally financed by RIBA or the majority by RIBA this means that I as a partner I'm investing in allowing I'm accepting my money to be invested in RIBA based transactions and the likes and this is Haram so it's not complicated but definitely it's it needs your due diligence in looking into the details of such a portfolio because at the end of the day it's your wealth it is your money and you'll be held accountable where you have invested it as in the hadith of the Prophet array so it was salam that the feet of the son of adam would not be removed on the day of judgment until he's asked about for in another narration about five one of them is his wealth where he gained it from and where he had spent it in so this is something that we need indeed to be careful about"
