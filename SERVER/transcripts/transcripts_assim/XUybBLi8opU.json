  "transcript": "e for e e PR e e e about transactions why because this is the most important thing to eat and drink and how can we eat and drink without buying and selling so they start to speak about the conditions of buying and selling what is halal what is Haram I think I'm very audable outside the c ah okay no no no no some people may assassinate me put electrocution and I don't life is short don't you never know my wife you know she doesn't love me that much anyhow no she does she does yeah so after you know how to worship Allah you need to eat so you start they started to speak about selling buying what is Haram there are so many forms of Haram in transactions there is things that to do with and and the likes now after we eat and drink and our batteries are filled what do we think of marriage yeah not women we're in the Masid we think of marriage in halal so they speak about the chapter dealing with marriage the conditions of marriage and if God forbid something happens the what happens in divorce if divorce happens what is the the of someone who's divorced someone who's taking someone whose husband has died when is the one month one monthly period three monthly period 4 months and 10 days after she gives birth whole chapter of knowledge and how to suckle your children and what happens when they're suckled and what is the mam of of suckling and the likes then afterwards when you eat and drink and you're married what happens you start to think aggressively you start to be greedy you may kill someone you may steal from someone you may do something becauseas everything is fine alhamdulillah so they put a chapter dealing with compensations retaliations if someone injures someone what is the retaliation an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth a life for a life all of this is put and uh uh found and finally they speak about if we dispute you put your car in my parking spot we are renting we are doing this are doing that we have dispute we have to go to the judge so what would the judge do what would the judge say different cases different scenarios so the books of f are not found in any other religion but in Islam go and check Christianity do they have F they don't even know what to do they have nothing that governs their lives the Jews the Christians the Hindu nothing the only religion that is so perfect that it governs everything in our life is only Islam and this is why alhamdulillah we are growing in number we are improving in quality and we're here to learn our religion okay I hear that we are in a commercial District area mallah everybody here is a millionaire Mah I can see your faces mallah very very interesting so what is the role of trade in Islam do we have this well our role model was a merchant since he was a young boy he went with his uncle Abu Talib to trade to Syria and when he got married to Mother Khadijah before that he was working for her and she was impressed by his honesty by his integrity and by the blessing he brought to her business so she married him the prophet as per the Arabs they are wellknown Traders they had special Market areas like and the likes these area in Arabia were known to have a certain season where everybody from all over the world come and they buy and sell this is their livelihood and they had two Journeys in the winter and in the sun was safe so they used to have these trips of Trades the prophet sometimes used to buy himself and sometimes he used to delegate so in the case of buying we have authentic Hadith where he himself once bought bought the camel of jabir abdah may Allah be pleased with him and with his father jabber says I was in Expedition with the prophet Alat wasam and I had the worst camel on Earth it was the last in the Caravan but Subhan Allah it wouldn't work so the prophet wasam said to me jabber would you sell it I said the prophet of Allah take it it's yours for free I don't want it it's cing costing me money take it he said no no no I will buy it from you so jabber said I'll sell it to you and the prophet hit the camel with his stick and mashallah it became a Ferrari and it went all the way to the beginning of the Army and went ahead and he's trying to slow it down it wouldn't so much energy I don't know maybe Red Bull I don't know the it was is nuts when the prophet Alam came to Medina he sent B telling him let jabir come and bring the camel so jabber came becauseas we made the deal he came to the prophet with the camel the prophet gave him the money gave him something extra and he said do you think I was bargaining with you to keep the camel the money and the camel is yours so the prophet sometimes by himself sometimes the prophet delegates like in thei ofik was one of the companions who was a great and Keen businessman the prophet gave him one din told him to go and buy him a she me one of your sheep he said okay I'll sell you but for one dinar so the man took a sheep and gave him one dinar he went to the prophet Alat wasam he said you Prophet of Allah you gave me one dinar to buy a sheep here is the sheep and here is the din so he made a good good business deal the prophet said may Allah put Baraka in your transactions the companion say and he was the best businessman if he were to sell soil and dirt he would make money and this is the Baraka of Dua Dua when you are a good businessman you cannot do business without yeah Allah you make Dua as much as you can and Allah would put Bara in your transactions also the prophet Alat used to order the merchants to be truthful to be faithful and to give a lot of Charity says the prophet said the the two parties to a transaction have the option of canceling it until they part in they call meaning you and I in a transaction now in Islam by the way transaction is not authenticated it's not written in Islam you as a Muslim are B found by your tongue so it's a transaction like marriage like contract any contract so someone says sheh how much do you sell me this card I say to him I sell you this card for 100 shillings he says I accept kalas it's over the transaction is done however we have an option of choice what is it him and I are still in the same area in the same room after 1 hour we're in the same room I said to him listen I think I changed my mind I take my card back he said no you sold me and I bought I said no the prophet says we have the option until we part physically and leave as long as we're still in the same room you can cancel the transaction I can cancel the transaction but if he leaves or I leave it's binding so the prophet saysat if they are honest and disclose any defects their transaction will be blessed Allah will put Baraka but if they lie and conceal defects the blessing of their transaction will be erased as a Muslim you always show the defects in the thing you're selling most of the Muslims today when they want to sell something what do what do they do if you have a car what do you do number one go wash the diesel with the engine with diesel number two bring some tea and clean the wheels number three vacuum the car put perfume put this put that why so when the buyer comes and sees it what will he say m Allah excellent car it's brand new said yes and you know that you're lying you know that there are leakage of oil in the engine you know that this body is not the original that it was crashed and fixed and painted but you do not disclose this Allah will take the Baraka away maybe you fool him to buying it Allah is not fooled you made a profit of 10% 20% more Allah will take this from your health or from the health of your children or from the Baraka of your house yeah it's not worth it come up front you're not a Believer until you love for your brother what you love for yourself when you buy a car how would you feel if the seller says to you the engine was rebuilt this happened to the car and there is something I could not fix it how would you feel you will feel appreciating and gratitude this brother is not lying to me you will buy it you will fix these things and Allah will put Baraka in both of your transactions number two the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam once went out of the Masjid and he saw the people buying and selling in the market so he said oh Merchants oh Traders so they all looked anticipating for what the prophet is going to advise them what is the prophet going to tell them the prophet then said to them the merchants will be raised on the day of judgment as evildoers all businessmen all Traders all shopkeepers will be raised on the day of judgment as evil doers Sinners bad people apart except the prophet says except from those who fear Allah and are sincere and honest so many times we tend to con others and when we fool them and get them into buying from us we go back to our people's well I made a good deal this fool he bought it for so much it was so cheap but I managed to fool him and you think you made profit and you made gains and the prophet says you will be resurrected as an evildoer and the prophet also used to keep on preaching the Traders and the merchants not once or twice daily bases he says oh merchants selling involves Idol talk and Oaths W I bought it for five and he's lying he bought it for three W it cost me so much and they swear because you look Pious you look God-fearing so if someone says to me W what will I do I believe and he goes I managed to fool him W you fooled yourself wah you're eating Hell Fire in your stomach with this money but you're MK you think that you're growing in business and you're not Allah is taking all the Baraka away from you so the prophet Alat wasam said oh merchants selling involves idle talk and Oaths so what should we do stop selling and buying he said no mix it with s mix it with Charity the more you see a merchant a businessman a Trader giving charity building Masjid feeding orphans giving Daw the more Allah put Baraka in his wealth one of the richest men in Saudi Arabia his name is Raj he has a bank called araj bank one of the most the most richest people this guy yeah I wouldn't say he's crazy any but what he does we would not do he spends literally billions every year on charity and when we speak to him say this is crazy why you do this he asks the people around him so and so you know this land we gave for Masjid Bas one of the biggest masjids in meca I gave it for free for a Masjid what happened that the following day he said to him the following day you got 10 times more valuable plot given to you he says I I don't know I'm trying to get rid of the money and Allah keeps on giving me tens and tens of times more so you are trading with Allah a good Merchant doesn't think of my balance uh uh uh paper how much do I have how much did I get how much did I SP no no no with Allah you just spend and you are certain that Allah will give you folds and folds and folds the prophet Alat wasam used to order the Muslims to be tolerant and easygoing in trade why because usually good businessmen unfortunately this is the norm are rude are like shark loans and they wait for the right moment to break your legs usually and this is a sign of a good Merchant no the prophet says may Allah Subhan Allah when the prophet makes Dua will Allah accept maybe maybe not definitely Allah will accept look what the prophet says may Allah have mercy upon a man who is easygoing when sells when he sells and when he buys and when he asks for for payment easygo sometimes you go to a brother how much 10 no no no make it nine 10 come on make it nine yeah you in I benefit you 10 don't talk to me Subhan Allah be easygoing sometimes you lend people this is $10,000 loan and the moment you give him the loan he's just taking it huh when are you going to give it back I I just took it from you and he calls you at night are you home say when are you giving it back and he keeps on calling you every single day the prophet says may Allah have mercy upon a man who is easygo when he sells and when he buys and when he asks for payment when he asks for his loan lending is one of the most beautiful in Islam do you know that in Islam if you lend someone money and he gives it back I lend the brother $100 for one week after one week he says here's your $100 I have the $100 in my my pocket what will happen the prophet saysat $50 in charity are awarded to me I give him 10,000 5,000 charity if he brings it back the prophet says and if he does not bring it back on the same date after a week and pays it after two weeks I got the full money charity so instead of receiving it in one week I received it a week later 10,000 in my pocket is a charity with Allah and if he apologizes and says after two weeks wah I don't have the money with me now please give me some time the prophet says every day I get $10,000 second day $20,000 10 days crazy anybody wants to borrow money Mah so many hands alhamdulillah I did not bring my wallet Subhan Allah it is beautiful to land in Islam but don't be crazy and anyone who raises his hand you give him your money because they're going to run away but around us so many people we know who are in need and we know them for so many years and we trust them how much do you have in the bank don't ask Sheik okay why don't you lend them instead of staying in the bank lend it lend it to anyone you know but you trust and you get this reward and your money is coming back to you but people don't think feasibly they don't think about the reward they just want to check before they go to bed on the app how much do I have five Shillings missing why and they spend the night thinking of the five Shillings until fan just for five Shillings yeah don't let the money in your heart because if it's taken away your heart is torn let the money and the Dy in your hand whoever wants it give it away it's not going to kill me but whoever gave it to me will give it in more the prophet Alat wasam was really tolerant and really easy going imagine once he borrowed from an a nomad from a bedwin a camel he needed a camel he borrowed it the camel was 2 years old after 5 months the man came and said oh prophet of Allah give me my camel back so the prophet said to the companion Ians may Allah be pleased with them give him same age of his camel so they looked around we have no camel that is 2 years old but we have a camel that is 3 years old and this is more expensive so the prophet said give it to him and when the Nomad so that the camel he got in return for his loan much better than the one he gave he said to the prophet Alam may Allah reward you as you have rewarded me then the prophet saidat verily The Best of You are those who are the best in paying off debts there is no collaboration otherwise it would have been what people are asleep let me repeat there is no collaboration otherwise it would have been RBA if I give you 10,000 you give me 10,000 back but if I give you 10,000 and say when you give it back if you give it back 15 Allah this is there is collaboration but if I borrowed something from the brother no collaboration 10,000 and next year when I'm paying him back I give him 20 he said sh no I give you only 10 he said I know but the 10 extra is a gift from me this is halal no collaboration and the prophet said the best of you are those who are best in paying off debts also the prophet used to encourage being tolerant and easygoing in trade I'll give you an example in Saudi we have this a lot people sell and buy on the phone so I see a plot that I like alayum the plot you have 400 squar meters how much X money he saidas I'm willing to buy he said I'm willing to sell so I bought it for x amount the man says I sold we hung up tomorrow we're supposed to go to the court give the money and take my deed of the land two hours later the man receives a call from another customer another neighbor he says I'm interested in your plot he said he said I sold it for 500,000 I'm willing to give you 700 now the seller is having Goosebumps 200,000 in two hours Haram so next day he doesn't go to the court I called him we had a deal I bought it and you sold it he said no no I wasn't sure maybe I was sleepy maybe I was drowsy maybe I had too much to eat I don't know maybe maybe it's not me who called told you may you sure it's me it's not my younger son and and he wants to get out of it it's Haram the deal is done islamically yes according to the law you can run away with it because if you go to the law he says no I did not call him okay the LA the the judge will set you free but Allah will not so here listen what to the Prophet saysat The Prophet says who whoever lets a Muslim off a transaction Allah will relieve him of his distress on the day of Resurrection if he were to call me and say a I changed my mind please set me off relieve me of this deal and I know this Hadith and I said you're Allah would relieve me from distress on the day of judgment but who thinks about this no no no no I don't want to be relieved from distress on the day of judgment I want the 200,000 I want my profit this is how Muslims deal and this is why Islam spread to Indonesia 250 300 million Muslims how many soldiers set foot zero who went there the yeny thei Traders and Merchants went there and dealt with the natives with honesty with integrity and they said wow these guys don't cheat these guys don't lie these guys don't do Haram I love this religion what are you Muslims what is Islam do this this and the biggest Muslim country in the world is Indonesia almost 300 million Muslims because of what traders who were honest unfortunately this this type of real Muslim practicing honest Traders are rare but they're found alhamdulillah we can find them but it's not the norm why because we're not walking the talk also the prophet Alam used to always relate trade and payments to the day of judgment he says whoever waits for one who is in financial difficulty to pay his debt or waves it for him Allah will shade him in his shade on the day of judgment Allah great reward but nobody thinks about the here after we only think about the balance about our bank account how much we are doing and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam prohibited many many many Haram transactions number one riba is riba prevailing yes or no unfortunately even Muslims nowadays when you just want to sign a contract Below in very small letters if you're late for payment you have a penalty late payment fee what is late payment fee riba if I'm not paying the rent on time and you take 500 Shillings riba automat IC and the people don't care mortgage she I bought my house to live in mortgage mortgage is RBA yes but I did not have a house sh still it's the prophet wasam said may Allah curse the one who takes riba the bank the one who gives riba the borrower the one who writes the riba the accountant the one who witnesses the riba The Good samans the witnesses they're not getting any money but you're just there for the contract and some ship K maybe I don't know they're just there to witness they're cursed the prophet says all of them in the curse of Allah are equal but we're dealing with RBA day and night she I have a credit card okay I have a credit card yeah but Sheik I borrow and I buy everything with my credit card and sometimes I can't pay on time after the grace period so they take 7% interest okay you're cursed but I did it by mistake you're cursed Allah curses you who told you to use it you have ATM yeah I have but I want to get points cash back I want the curse of Allah has come to you and you have go you go on and on riba is Haram selling something with ambiguity Drop Shipping selling something to people and saying listen whatever is in my pocket what I'll give you a better example but if I take it the people who ask for loan maybe they will say oh you have your wallet yes I have my wallet whatever is in my wallet I'll sell it to you for $1,000 she comes from Saudi definitely he has like $5,000 and he has an oil well in his backyard so definitely has I'll buy it this is called it's Haram because you don't know what's in it I big I bring you a big bag whatever you insert your hand and touch is for five Shillings okay maybe I get silk worth of 5,000 uh uh Shillings maybe I get nothing salt for zero this is Haram these kind of transactions people think I'm smart I'm winning multi-layer marketing you know this huh people in Kenya people in Nigeria they have Forex they have multiple multi- uh layer marketing Ponzi schemes uh pyramid schemes they just want money they don't care it's Haram there is ambiguity there is fooling people there is money that is earned without I want money who cares so all of this the prophet prohibited in addition to cheating in addition to uh fooling others because he was the the role model for us let me put this before I forget it people are looking at it everybody's not for not looking at me look at my wallet there's nothing in it anyhow the prophet was the role model listen to what Allah says in the Quran indeed Allah commands you to render trusts to whom they are due so you have to give the trust to the people that there it's due for them and the prophet saidat there is no Iman there is no faith for the one who cannot be be trusted and how many of us Muslims can raise their hands and say I can be trusted the people in the community know me the people trust me because they've tried me so many times I don't lie I don't cheat I'm a real Muslim rarely you will find people who would you get such compliment and recommendations for and so many times Shan may play with our heads thinking that this is smart this is uh uh Market Savvy the prophet saysat place trust in him who trusts you if the brother trusted you with money bring it back to him but do not cheat him who cheats you and we're very good in this the government cheated us we know how to take our money from them the neighbor cheated us the partner cheated us I know how to to cook books and take from the partnership without him knowing all of this is Haram and not permissible but I leave you with this you want to be in Jenna may Allah make me and you in Jenna you want to be in Jenna you have to follow the footsteps of the Prophet Alat wasam who was the trustworthy who was the honest who was known before Islam not to have said one lie and not to have cheated in his life without that you will not be ever able to be with him huh they want what loan I don't I can't hear there the reception is not very good I don't I hope you did not sleep no I was gathering the question I've received several questions but I'll start with the written one uh this question is saying asalam Al on theith of which says that Satan establishes his throne over water and sends his troop to lead people astray how occasionally does the congregation of Satan happen I don't have any updates has tell you the truth yeah I don't know do you think I watch CNN this is a Hadith from the prophet sometimes you have to think before you speak the prophet says Satan erects his throne on water dispatches his soldiers to deviate and yeah lure people to sin how often does this happen did the prophet say no did he say it's monthly basis weekly basis daily basis no so why are you concerned you're afraid to miss the next congregation yeah give me a break some questions see seriously seriously you shout these questions shout please don't speak so no I don't know when this congregation takes place but it is an authentic Hadith the prophet said one of them comes back and says I whispered in his ears until he stole money Shan says you didn't do anything tomorrow he's going to repent the second one says I whispered in his ears until he fornicated committed Zena said you didn't do anything tomorrow is going to rep the third one says I whispered in his ears until I separated between him and his wife Satan says you are the man you are the man and he makes him sit next to him on the throne so if you're married look into your marriage is Satan happy with you why are you having so many problems with your wife oh she's nagging she's doing this she's doing that and what about yourself when was the last time you looked in the mirror you are also not a an angel Subhan Allah you are also doing so many bad things abusing your wife being dirty foul mouth and you're not respecting and you're not encouraging and you're not praising any of her Deeds but this is not our topic yes question is asking the most hated permissible Halal Act is divorce this is not true this is a fabricated not authentic Hadith this is not a question though yeah so the question is what if the divorce was genuine what if the divorce was genuine was genuine this is why I'm saying to you the concept that the most hated act to Allah is divorce is not true there is a chapter in the Quran by the name of and sometimes divorce is mandatory if your wife doesn't abide by the hijab free mixes has boyfriends in you're you're shocked don't be I have counseling sessions men W he coming to me yeah in the counseling sessions but it's in Zoom luckily for them it's not life because I would have the guy says she my wife cheats on me she has boyfriends sometimes she goes out with them spend nights I said okay but I love her she and in Arabic we say May the house lizard Loves You When are you crazy you're not even a man how dare you do like I love her I I forgive her I forgive her I say may Allah not forgive you because the prophet said the youth the one who allows such sins to be prevailing in his wife attitude and and character he will not enter Jenna so coming back to the what was the question all I forgot what if the divorce was genuine yes sometimes the divorce is genuine in this case is genuine sometimes it's highly recommended how if your wife is someone now the sisters will be angry because in order for me to give this equation I have to give the other equation which is when are they allowed to seek but this is not a marital issue but again it is recommended for you to divorce your wife if you see the trajectory of marriage going down how long you've been married three years and how are things worse to worse we had so many reconciliations we sat with therapist Mar marital uh uh counselors and we brought her family my family she she is having rage issues issues she's always breaking things disrespecting me in the street calling the police oh she called the police six times upon me sh and they've investigated me in some cases put me in jail for two three nights okay what are you waiting for diter get married to someone younger more beautiful more religious and then move on the same T goes with the sisters HH if your husband is like this but I don't have to time to elaborate more sometimes the divorce becomes Haram why because she is nikab she is righteous practicing and you want her to serve your friends to go and mix with you in couple retreat and you want her to come with you to the beach in Mombasa in Nairobi they don't have beaches know yeah alhamdulillah anyhow so in this case yes divorce foring her because of this reason is totally prohibited and you are sinful for that and so on the question is asking marrying non-muslim we are told to marry and eat from aab but which non-muslims are we talking about first of all the Quran does not say non-muslims it says women from referring to the Jews and the Christians so a Muslim man is allowed to marry a woman from the Jewish faith or from the Christian faith providing that she is chased not someone who has boyfriends and goes out to clubs no she is chased and this is permissible in Islam but any other Faith it's Haram a Hindu a sik an atheist um fire worshipper Buddhist all of these are not permissible for a Muslim man to marry from now a brother has been insisting say she can I have a picture with you and she askim and he said in the name of Allah I said okay I confirmed on your behalf no you will not have a picture of me because you dared to ask by the name of Allah for something so stupid and trivial like this this means you don't know Allah you should not ask with the face of Allah except Jen for a trivial thing like this taking a picture with me with the Sheikh you will even burn your teleph telephone when you take a picture of me what is this we have to honor Allah not to use Allah's name asking Allah for something trivial and sin like this had you not asked I would have approved but now no I'll tell him now okay what is the ruling when if someone misses Salah does praying the Salah out of its time considered permissible okay this is an issue of dispute among Scholars I'll explain it to you so that you don't have to ask someone else afterwards the pro Allah says in the Quran which means that Salat was prescribed at a specific time it has a beginning and it has an ending correct the m is due when the sun disappears and sets if I come one minute before the sun sets I can see the tip of the Sun and I say allahar and I'm praying is my prayer valid why because I prayed it before the time is due likewise if I want to pray and the sun is down and has disappeared and I say allahar is my valid no because the time has what expired now the prophet said in an authentic if you over sleep over a prayer or forget it then you must pray it as soon as you remember it there is no experation other than praying it as soon as you remember it what's the meaning of experation something to expiate your sin but I was asleep and when I'm asleep the pen is uplifted there is no sin and likewise when I forget Allah says so there is no sin the scholars said ah yes there is no sin but once you remember or you wake up it is mandatory to pray it on the spot to be accepted otherwise it will not be accepted Islam says says in this Hadith a clear directive and a manifestation that when a person deliberately skips Salah without a legitimate reason such as forgetfulness or sleep but because I'm watching the World Cup because I'm playing game with my friends because I was reading an interesting book and the Salah time is coming to an end and it's expired it's gone so can I pray it make it up I pray it said nope because because you did not skip it for a legitimate reason but this doesn't make any sense I am doing it I'll give you another example you go to mekah for Hajj you fly SV Saudi Airlines 430 Bound to jida You Reach on the 7th of when do people go TOA e nth not eth on the ninth araa is the ninth so you reach 7 you come with your with your belt mallah and all the people in the airplane giving I was shocked when I came to Nairobi and the airplane landed all the people in the economy women started shouting maybe someone is hijacking the car or the airplane I was in business class in the first I was you know ready see someone char charging at the pilot maybe I try to tackle them and maybe give they give me a reward I don't know and they were very joyful and happy I said maybe someone was married and I asked the people when I came why are they doing this they says they're happy the plane landed Allah what will happen if there was turbulence anyhow so the brother went mallah in gave the passport officials this Visa is not correct Go please and they they detain him they put him in detention for 4 days on the 12th of after after first day second day of mina they said okay we're sorry we were wrong you can go so he moves immediately TOA and he goes TOA standing there alone nobody's in what are you doing he says I'm standing Ina for my Haj my frienda is on the ninth day on the 10th is is over he said but they detain me I'm making K is this ha going to be accepted why because it is p the time likewise your Salat you you you deliberately skipped there is no way it can be accepted no way pray at 10 times 100 times Allah will not accept it so what should I do she no what you should do is repent be remorseful fear Allah ask for forgiveness and never skip a prayer and Allah will forgive you another question is asking is it permissible to forgive a brother who died without paying my debt is it permissible it is highly recommended it is one of the best Deeds if someone dies and he owes you money you say it's for Allah you will come on the day of judgment and you will the one who's going to be saying when you say this money when you see it w I wish I forgave everybody it is one of the best deeds in Islam to to let a go of debts so definitely a deceased when you forgive him Allah will forgive you I hope the sisters don't do this in the M no no they another question another person who sent a message and said she uh I have no question but I just wanted you to tell you that we love you for the sake of and if you materialize this financially I would be more grateful may Allah loves those who love me for his sake and may Allah asael gather us all on the day of judgment and the flagship under the flagship of Muhammad we will enjoy every moment in Jenna and when we reflect on this D and what we did and how we were patient and did what we did for the sake of Allah we will enjoy it another question is asking and said sometimes I just feel heart broken without any reason yet I pray my five daily prayers so what am I supposed to do sh his what is broken heart broken yeah your heart broken can be attributed to shitan definitely this is why part of the Dua of the morning and the evening every Muslim should say every evening and morning the first sentence the prophet says oh Allah I seek refuge in you from grief and worries grief is something in the past worries is something in the future if you are heartbroken it's one of these two either your heartbroken because you lost a loved one and I'm assuming it's Halal we're not going into Haram it's you lost a loved one you lost an opportunity you think that it was a very good opportunity for your career but you've lost it so you grieve on it no Allah chose the best for you move on worries are of something of the future Ya Allah how am I going to pay the rent the brother said I love you for the sake of Allah he's going to financially compensate me alhamdulillah now I don't have worries or I have worries of my children how will they grow up or I have worries will they kick me out of my job because my company's contract is not renewed so many things in the future if you have trust in Allah if you have tul Reliance and dependence you will not have these things because your heart is content whatever will happen is by the will of Allah and Allah chooses only the best for me I trust Allah so this is from Shan trust Allah and it will all go away this question keeps on coming from different people it's about online Forex Trading is it Halal and what is the H Everywhere I Go go in Kenya they ask me this question and I seriously don't want to reinvent the wheel please go back to the lectures you'll find the answer in my YouTube channel I explained it most of Forex Trading is Haram especially if it's dealing with the margin of futures or with uh uh them giving you money and Etc or when you're dealing with gold silver or currency totally har because these transactions Gold Silver and currency it has to be simultaneous take and give physically online it's not permissible along other things and Allah knows best the question is asking the Muslim is so divided at this time and the sh have talked about it so many times can you tell us the reason to that and also the solution and the way forward no I can't in a nutshell how do you want me to tackle the um's problem in one or two lines Why is the um divided we have to go into the history what is the solution we have to look into our own homes when you change yourself positively according to Islam your household your community your neighbors your city then everything would fix but when you sit back home and your home is filled with Haram and you're watching Netflix and you are listening to music and your children are not praying in the Masjid and your daughters are not abiding by the hijab and you're dealing with RBA and you're cheating and lying and then say why is the umah so divided You're the Reason f fix yourself Allah will fix the whole um and therefore don't look at floor number 100 in order to reach there you have to take the stairs from ground floor first floor but people unfortunately are focused on why are the rulers like this they're corrupt okay we put good rulers what will you do they closed all night clubs and bars they're bad rulers where will we have fun Subhan Allah so that damn if you do damn if you don't no this is not the right way of doing it you want to start to fix the umah fix yourself observe your Salah in the Masjid your night prayer your memorization of the Quran fixing your children and your loved ones and their Community W everything will be fixed but it is not an easy switch you just P push and it it works it takes a lot of hard work and dedication and and and you have to be have this patience and tolerance so that Allah makes it happen another question is asking what is the best advice you'd give to someone who wants to be loved by Allah Allah says Allah says in the my servant would never never ever get closer to me with things more beloved to me than what I have obligated upon him so you want Allah to love you fulfill the commands Salah on time in mid fasting Ramadan giving zakat then Allah says and my servant keeps on offering voluntary Deeds huh until I love him Allah abbar so this is what Allah says you want Allah to love you offer a lot of huh voluntary Deeds how many hours do you pray at night why would I pray at night I sleep okay now we know what's the problem how many times do you memorize finish the Quran recitation a month maybe every six years we have problem what about your AAR in the morning in the evening before going to bed after Salah before leaving the house I don't know anyar okay then what are you I'm a Muslim what kind of a Muslim you definitely are far far away from being loved by Allah Allah says and my servant keeps on doing and offering voluntary Deeds until I love him okay and when I love him I become his sight that he sees with I become his hearing that he hears with I become his hand that he beats with I become his foot that he walks with and if he were to ask me I will give him and if he would seek refuge in me I would give him Refuge this is this is the servant that Allah loves you want Allah's love this is the way to it may Allah makes me make me and you among those whom he loves another question is asking what does what does the Islamic Shar ruling say about letting out leing a house or letting your house on through a Airbnb airbn BNB and BNB I don't know what they call it you whatever you know is like renting your house so when someone rents your house for a year you don't don't give them a placement test or examine them or tell them please take off your clothes and you you just want to this is not your job someone on the surface wants to rent your car give it to him someone wants to take your house for three nights Airbnb give it to him there's nothing Haram in it this is why in the books of f in the transaction section of rent you are allowed to rent whatever you want because everything is halal till proven otherwise I don't have the authority to judge people say okay you want my house for Airbnb are you married uh show me the marriage certificate are you coming with your wife or with your girlfriend will you smoke will you drink will you listen to music do you watch TV n do you masturbate is you're not his father what are you doing so sometimes we overthink and we think that we have the right to judge people no you want to rent your apartment go ahead and rent it alhamdulillah yes sir another question is asking my question is my ex-wife refused refused for me to have contact with my children who are with her so do I have respons is there any responsibility upon me of course you take her to court some people don't have shame in their face they don't fear Allah they think that they can do whatever they want such people you take them to court and drag their feet from one Court to the other let them pay money to lawyers until they know what is the ruling of Allah you and I were married for a number of years we had good times Allah says in the Quran do not forget the good times yes we were married for 10 years we had ups and downs but we had ups we enjoyed many good moments why do you all cross it off as if I am the demon and the devil let's assume I'm a bad person what is my god-given right these are my children like they are your children yes Islam gives you the right of custody but it also gives me the right of part custody I have the right in Islam to see them in the weekends I have the right to see them for one month in the summer holiday I have the right to uh uh take them to something they want me to share it with them as I have the responsibility to provide for them a shelter food on the table clothes Medical expenses and the likes so if she says no you have to do all of this but you don't see them take her to court and sue her another question is asking he said I love my mom so much but he has a habit which is displeasing to Allah I have tried to talk to her to leave this act of disobeying Allah but she's not listening to me I have also tried to talk to her sisters and friends to also talk to her so that she avoid disobeying Allah but she also refused to listen to them as the son what should I do after all this effort again this is something that is way above your pay grate you as a son do not have authority over your mother so if she's not wearing the hijab and I don't know what the act that she is involved in but if she's not wearing the hijab you don't have the right to beat her up you don't have the right to lock her in her house not going out because she's your mother you have the responsibility and right to advise her if she doesn't listen you've done your duty in front of Allah make a lot of Dua try to choose the time where you can advise her where she is accepting maybe you need to leave her alone for five six months and not talk about this particular sin so that she would accept it after 5 six months months and meanwhile in these five six months be a dutiful son obedient respectful do whatever you can to make her love you and respect you after 6 months when you bring it up maybe Allah will open her heart to accept a question is asking how can someone pay for zakat Mal when the business records are missing or lost you have to do whatever you have to do because this is Allah's right now if it was something between you and others you will look to the best of your ability because you know that others will take you to court but because it's between you and Allah okay Allah no Allah as mentioned in [Music] this is for those who do not give zakat this wealth will be heated in Hellfire and then you will be scolded in your forehead in your side in your back with Hell Fire so now what to do my books are lost you can estimate it's your money so if I tell you is it a million Shillings no no no it's too much is it five Shillings so no it's too little 500 Shillings 500,000 said too much uh 10,000 too little and we go down and up until we reach something in the middle you say I think it's this much put another 10,000 extra Sak and give it for zakat a question is asking uh I am a revert and I have tattoos so whenever I pray and they're showing I get just judgmental comments and some brothers tell me I should pray with them so is it true my Salah not valid and since you can't pray with them no no no ignore these ignorant imbeciles whenever someone comes to you and say your Salat is invalid just smile and face it Z ignore them like a fly when a fly comes what do you do start to fight just do this and move on you're a revert everything you did before accepting Islam is erased and wiped off Allah has forgiven you who dares and comes and says no no no no your tattoo is bad you your prayer is invalid you shouldn't pray with us it's not your Masjid it's not your father's Masjid you don't want to pray with me you go but this is Allah's Masjid I come and pray in the first row nobody can speak now if you can remove the tattoo good but if it's not possible or it's too expensive or it's too painful alhamdulillah if you can cover it do if you can't cover it is no problem come and pray you're more than welcome you're our brother in Islam we have two more questions a question is asking uh do if I'm asked to give money that is there is corruption here if I'm asked to give money to give money out as a form of bribe so that I can get the letter of appointment or to be given a job opportunity what is the ruling of that the prophet saidat may Allah curse those who give bribes and take [Music] bribes say a mean the people that's why you heard only two people say I mean but then what are you doing I didn't understand he said I mean I said I mean so this is a major sin however Allah had made life easy and when when things get real tight Islam makes it wide and when it's too wide Islam restricts it and makes it tight meaning if I am forced to give a bribe to get what is lawfully mine or to protect myself from what is unlawfully being put on me it is halal meaning I bring a car from Japan and when it comes to the Customs all the paperwork is good everything is kosher according to the the official is sitting there smoking and they says uh papers are missing you have to pay a fine of 1 million Shillings or we have to take your car back to Japan and you have to pay the price of the fright and blah blah blah everything is legal said no it's not legal what are you going to so you know definitely he's not going to release your car which is your car which is everything is legal and Halal until you give him something from underneath the table what should I do give him because I have to get my rights this is my right this is my Halal likewise I'm sitting in my office in my shop and the municipality inspector comes and and looks the lights are broken you have to pay a fine of 100,000 Shillings it's good so no no I see it broken what are you going to do so what do you want give me$ 500 Shillings I will go away what should I do I give him 500 Shillings and a cookie send him away but when it comes to business transactions for a company and there are 10 companies coming and the purchasing agent and usually the purchasing officer is the most corrupt unfortunately with all do respect I don't no offense but this is what's happening because anyone they want to buy something from they have to give something had we call it and they say you have to give us this or we will not award you the contract although your prices are the cheapest and your quality is the best what should I do no don't give them a bribe but she my business will not be awarded well Allah did not make your risk with them go somewhere else because this is not your god-given right to take this is not your H unlike your car which is your H unlike defending your shop from a Haram fine because of a light this is different so I hope this answers your question because of time we'll ask one last question what if the father doesn't provide but still wants custody of the children this is something that is attributed to the Muslim K if the father does not provide for his children he has no right of custody to begin with the custody is for the mother in Islam when they're separated and divorced the custody of the children goes usually to the mother unless she gets remarried if she gets remarried automatically the father takes the custody this is Allah's uh uh religion now if he does not provide and I think this is what the question is about the father does not provide for his children who are living with their mother so as a punishment the mother wants to deprive him from seeing them no this is what we were just saying in the Hadith so don't betray who betrayed you he will be held accountable on the day of judgment for his negligence of his children but you don't have the right to prevent him from his right of seeing his children and Allah Knows Best please he's the she he's bigger than me he beats me up uh the messenger of Allah and sahu alai wasallam has taught us that whenever you finish doing a good deed if you've completed your your your you say alhamdulillah all praise is due to Allah subhanahu wa taala and it's through his bounties that we've been able to achieve and complete the good deed that we've done we ask Allah subhana wa ta'ala to accept the da to had and we thank him for giving us time with considering that he has a very busy schedule and S alai wasallam also says whoever who does not thank people does not thankful to Allah by the grace of Allah the coming of the Sheikh was made possible by young people who sent the invitation to the Sheikh who uh invited the sheh and took the responsibility and took care of the Sheikh while he was here this invitation was made by two groups we have our brothers from P path project from Mombasa and we have our brothers from amuk Association of Muslim universities Muslim un Muslim universities and colleges of Kenya so all the Muslim Students in all the universities and colleges in Kenya they came together they have this umbrella known as amuk and then they send the invitation to the Sheikh they are young people there people who just finished from for and started University the other day so alhamdulillah if anything but I'm very proud proud of them and I'm very proud of our brother's P path from Mombasa who made it possible
