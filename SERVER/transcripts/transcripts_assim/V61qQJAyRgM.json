  "transcript": "Salam Alaikum. In the name of Allah, the most gracious, the most merciful. Dear brothers and sisters in Islam, Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh and welcome to this new episode of The Role Model, Sallallahu Alaihi Wa Alihi Wa Sallam. Speech is a gift from Allah Azza wa Jal. And Allah favoured us over other creations of His with this blessing. And the way a person talks is indicative of his intellect. Amr ibn al-Asim, may Allah be pleased with him, said that a person's tongue is a piece of his mind. Which means that when you speak, this is an indication of your calibre and what a person you are. Jabir ibn Samur, may Allah be pleased with him, used to describe the Prophet, alayhi salatu wasalam, as a person who would prolong his silence and laugh a little. And this is a sign of wisdom, of dignity, that you don't spill your guts all over the place. You maintain your honour, you don't talk without any legitimate reason, and when you do, you don't take the whole hour or the whole event, spending it on talking just for people to look at you and to listen to you. Without any doubt, the Prophet, alayhi salatu wasalam, was the most articulate person to have ever speak in the language of the Arabs, or any other language. He said about himself, alayhi salatu wasalam, I was given the concise of speech. Meaning that it's a gift from Allah, azza wa jal, to speak few words and these words contain so much information and value that you may need volumes to write them down in. For example, innama al-a'malu bin niyyat, one of the most known hadiths to everyone. Verily, deeds are judged by intentions. There is no form of worship that this hadith is not involved in. And every single book that Muslims have written include this hadith. Also the beautiful phrase, the beautiful sentence, the legal maxim, la dara wa la dharar, neither causing harm nor reciprocating harm. Don't do this. This is a law in two words, la dara wa la dharar, and you can cascade this to all aspects of life. Also the beautiful legal statement that all jurors and judges and those dealing with the law know, and this is one of the most needed laws to be implemented. Al bayyinatu ala man idda'a, wa al yameenu ala man ankar. Someone comes and accuses me of taking his money, of raping his sister, of a shameful act. Anyone could accuse me of doing this. Should we listen to him? The Prophet said no, alayhi salatu wa salam. He has to provide the evidence to prove his allegation. Al bayyinatu ala man idda'a. Imagine a woman coming and pretending that or claiming that someone raped her. Should we hang him? Of course not. She might be a big liar. Give us the proof that can stand in a court of law, not just allegations and tears and the likes. If that person claiming is false or is unable to bring evidence to back his claim, the Prophet says alayhi salatu wa salam, wa al yameenu ala man ankar. Then the accused must swear by Allah that he did not do this. End of story. 95% of people's allegations and cases are solved through this magnificent phrase. He was given the concise of speech. And the Prophet alayhi salatu wa salam as described by mother Aisha, when he spoke, he didn't speak like 60 miles per hour. He wasn't fast and just throwing words right, left, left and center. Rather he used to speak in a very eloquent and articulate fashion that everyone understands every single letter that he is saying. And she says that if a person wanted to count the number of words that come out of the Prophet's mouth alayhi salatu wa salam, they could have done that. Anas bin Malik says when the Prophet spoke salallahu alayhi wa salam, sometimes, not all the time, sometimes when needed he would repeat what he had said three times so that people would comprehend it. And this is a form of drawing people's attention and ensuring that what was said is not to be neglected. Once he came and saw his companions performing wudu and they were very tired after a very long journey. And he noticed that some of them due to being so tired, they were not washing their feet and heels properly. So only the top of the foot. So he said three times, wailun lil aqabi minal naar, woe to these heels from hellfire. And he repeated it thrice. And you can guess what impact this left upon those who were making wudu. Also the Prophet salallahu alayhi wa salam would give salam three times when wanting to enter a house. And this is like ringing the bell. So it would say assalamu alaykum, a-adkhul, no response. Assalamu alaykum, a-adkhul, shall I come in? No response. Assalamu alaykum, a-adkhul, if there is no response he would go and leave. And also the Prophet once was sitting with his companions, in the well-known hadith to all of you, and he said, shall I not tell you about the biggest of all major sins? And he repeated this question three times. So you can imagine the audience's attention to what was coming afterwards. And the Prophet salallahu alayhi wa salam's rhetoric was straight to the heart. Because he used to select and choose the best of words. Dhamad ibn Tha'labah, when the Prophet was in Mecca alayhi salatu was salam, heard of a man and they told him that he's crazy, he's insane. And Dhamad was someone who did ruqya and did exorcism. He dealt with taking the jinn out of the people. Though he was not a Muslim, but he had this ability in him. So he went to the Prophet and said, listen, I know how to cure insane people, so would you like me to help you? The Prophet alayhi salatu was salam did not say to him, what do you think? You think I'm crazy? I'm mad? Get out of my face. No. The Prophet replied to him with these beautiful words. Inna alhamda lillah, nahmaduhu wa nastaeenuhu, man yahdihi allahu fala mudhilla lah, wa man yudhlil fala hadiya lah, wa ashhadu an la ilaha illallah wahdahu la sharika lah, wa ashhadu anna muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluhu amma ba'd. The man said, whoa, hold your horses down, repeat this. And the Prophet salallahu alayhi wa sallam repeated it three times. Then the guy said, listen, I've traveled the world. I heard soothsayers' wordings, fortune tellers, those possessed by jinn. I've heard the poets, I've heard orators. I've never heard anything similar to what comes out of your mouth. And this is the most optimum of all rhetorics. And the man accepted Islam on the spot. Beautiful words that come out of his mouth. And the Prophet salallahu alayhi wa sallam was also in a way, as we use this terminology, diplomatic. In the sense that whenever he wanted to say something that might be repulsive to some, he would pave the way. Because it has to be said. So in a hadith, once the Prophet addressed the companions, he said, listen, I am to you as a father to his children. So I teach you, when you defecate, do not face the qibla or give your backs to it. And he orders of three stones to cleanse yourself with, which is like toilet tissues and three wipes minimum. And he forbade them from using dung or bones in cleaning themselves. And he prohibited a person to clean himself using his right hand. So the Prophet gave an introduction to his teachings with these beautiful words, I am like a father to his children. Because when he spoke, he used to swear by Allah Azza wa Jal, to put emphasis on what he says. Though everybody believes him, but this is needed to draw your attention and to give importance to what you're about to say. And he usually used the word or the phrase, wal ladhee nafsi biyadih, by whom my soul is in his hands. In other incidents, the Prophet ﷺ would pause a question so that he would draw their attention. Like in the well-known hadith, Atadroona man al-muflis? Do you know who is a person who's broke? And they said the one who doesn't have money, then he clarified it to them, said no, he's a person that comes on the day of judgment with lots of prayers, fasting, charity, but he slandered this man, hit that one, back bit this one, shed the blood of that one, took the money of this one. So he comes on the day of judgment and he gives each one he had wrong done from his good deeds. And if his good deeds are over before giving back what he owes to people, then they give him from their bad deeds and then he would be thrown into hell. This is someone who's truly broke. So was the Prophet ﷺ a person who's described as loud? So that we know people when they speak in gatherings, they're so loud, they're so dominant, you can't hear anything except what they say. Was he like this? Well, Al-Miqdad, may Allah be pleased with him, says whenever the Prophet ﷺ entered a gathering or a room or a hall, he would give the salam to a level that someone who's awake can hear, but someone who's asleep would not be awakened by. So the Prophet's tone was very moderate and very delicate. He would not enter like every time we're in the masjid, especially in Ramadan, before prayer time or during between Adhan and Iqama, people come into the masjid, As-salamu alaykum wa rahmatullah. Why are you shouting? Why are you giving salam as if you're the imam for everybody? And this is not a single person, you get like 50, 70 people coming in, everybody's shouting his head off. This is not from the sunnah. Yes, if you come and pray two rak'ahs and there's someone you know, you privately say As-salamu alaykum wa rahmatullah, shake hands, no problem with that. But the Prophet when he entered the room, he would say As-salamu alaykum wa rahmatullah, so those who are awake can hear, but those who are asleep would not be bothered by his salam. And when it was needed, he would raise his voice, as in the case of Friday khutbah. He's giving a speech, he's addressing thousands of people. It's not logical to speak about hell and heaven and about warning people of the day of judgment, from the day of judgment by saying, and you have to fear the day of judgment. And hellfire is frightening. It is so hot. It is so intimidating. People will fall asleep. No, the Prophet, whenever he gave a khutbah, he would raise his voice and his cheeks would grow, and his veins would appear as if he's warning the people, there's an army coming to attack you. Just now, how would a person warning people from an army coming to attack them? He would definitely shout at them, and this is also to draw their attention. The Prophet, alayhi salatu was salam, would use a lot of parables or examples. So he would say, and he would use his hands gesture to illustrate. So he would say, those who remember Allah and those who don't, or the house that people remember Allah in it, and the house does not remember Allah in it, it's like a dead person and a living person. And he would show it and illustrate it through gestures by saying, I was sent and the hour like this, and he would show the resemblance between the index and the middle finger. So this is him and this is the day of judgment. The distance or the timeline is very close to one another. And sometimes he would throw puzzles, also to draw people's attention. The Prophet said once, alayhi salatu was salam, there's a tree that its leaves never fall and it's like a Muslim. It resembles a Muslim. Tell me about it. So everybody was giving their guesses about the plants they know. And then the Prophet said, it is the palm tree. And this shows you that the resemblance between a Muslim and a palm tree. And finally, the Prophet salallahu alayhi wa sallam used a very needed etiquette for us today when talking. He would not publicize people's names in the public. So Aisha says, if the Prophet alayhi salatu was salam was told something negative about a person, the Prophet alayhi salam would never go and say publicly, why did so and so, and name the person, why did Abdullah do this or say this? Like in the hadith of Ibn Lutbiya, a man, the Prophet dispatched salallahu alayhi wa salam to collect the zakat money. So the man came after a few weeks and said, Oh Prophet of Allah, this is the zakat money I collected from all the different tribes. And this is a gift that was given to me. So the Prophet alayhi salam got onto the pulpit, praised Allah, offered salutation upon the Prophet alayhi salam and said, why do we employ people to collect the zakat and they come back to us saying that this is your zakat and this was given to me. On what basis they were given a gift? Shouldn't they stayed in their father and mother's home and see whether people would give them a gift or not? The answer is definitely not. Because this is a bribe. Had you not been an employee by the government or by the Prophet alayhi salam, nobody would have come to your house and said, listen, this is a gift for you. But because you're collecting zakat, they're wanting you to cut them some slack. And this is why they're giving you something underneath the table. And this is a bribe. In this hadith, the Prophet did not say, why did Ibn al-Lutubiyyah did so and so and so. He just simply said it vaguely and generally. And this is an etiquette we Muslims need. If you go to YouTube or Instagram or whatever they call them, snapshots and social media, you will find brothers mentioning by name this da'i, this scholar, this individual and stripping them actually, metaphorically that is, otherwise it would have been a rated R. They were stripping them and exposing them and they said this and they said that and they said that. And it's back and forth between them. It's like volleyball, throwing the ball from one court to the other. And they're wasting the Muslims times. And they're slandering one another. And they're losing a lot of good deeds. And each one of them say, I'm doing it for the sake of Allah. I'm exposing him so that I would warn the Muslims. And it's all a private vendetta. It's all something inside their hearts filled with malice and envy and may Allah protect us all. Ya Akhi, you want to warn against someone, don't mention them by name. Just say, generally speaking, don't follow this way of thinking. Follow the mainstream of scholars, trusted scholars, someone who's not controversial. Instead of saying, Sheikh so and so or Doctor so and so or Da'i so and so. And you fill people's hearts with malice and hatred rather than filling it with peace and deen and proper knowledge. We have a short break. Stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back."
