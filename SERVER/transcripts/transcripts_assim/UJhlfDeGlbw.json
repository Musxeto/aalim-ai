  "transcript": "Sayyid from Singapore Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Yeah, so my question for today is I had a number of my non-Muslim friends and colleagues who had difficulties in pronouncing my name So if I were to adopt an alias where, for example, I prefer them to call me as Anthony although the name itself is neither from a Muslim origin or an Arabic origin but it does not contain any elements of Shuyukh or Kufa, Jazakumullah Khair Is it permissible? Sayyid, it is not logical to change your Arabic Muslim name into Anthony which is a Christian Kafir name Even if there is difficulty in pronouncing your name they should learn how to pronounce your name So don't lower the bar Don't compromise your dignity and pride of being a Muslim and taking such a name If you say, Wallahi Shaykh, I have difficulty in them pronouncing my name So I go to Anthony No, instead of going to Anthony, go to Abdullah, go to Ahmed This is not difficult for them to pronounce And again, Anthony for Muslims and for the Arabs would be difficult to pronounce So why are you favoring them instead of those? This is not logical, Akhi You have to be proud of your religion and Allah knows best Is it permissible to take counselling sessions? Without a problem, a full half an hour So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah Within the following two days or three days And bi-idhnillah azza wa jal I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah"
