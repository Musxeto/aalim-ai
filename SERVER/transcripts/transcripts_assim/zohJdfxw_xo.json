  "title": "Daee visited Companions' grave & said he could smell fragrance of heaven, Possible? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so I want to know about an issue that is recently a die of Islam visited the grape of the companion so he described their status and he described how much they sacrificed their life in Islam and after that he said undoubtedly I feel the smell of Jannah from those grave so is it possible first of all there are things that can be metaphorical and not intended as a reality so when a person visits the grave or the graves of the companions whether those buried near uh Mount or those buried in al-baqir near the prophet's Masjid and he feels overwhelmed with emotions and he says that I can smell the fragrance of Jannah being in such a place because of all of these righteous Heavenly bound Companions and so on this is metaphorical Maybe most likely he did not smell it maybe his mind is playing games at him and he does smell such a fragrance so there is no sugar or any of that thing because metaphorically poets say many many things even worse than that and it's accepted because saying things metaphorically for the purpose of art and literature is so many times accepted and Allah Knows Best"
