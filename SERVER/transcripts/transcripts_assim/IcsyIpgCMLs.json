  "transcript": "Miraj from Bangladesh allum I saw a video where a man asked another Muslim man that what is his name that guy answered my name is eunus then the questioner said his name is what yunus yunus yunus okay then the questioner said if you can decide the Surah unus then you will win $100 that man didn't know how to recite the Surah so he said oh sorry I forgot my name is actually Kar not yunus like he lied about his name to get the money and both of them started laughing what is the ruling on making such funny videos using Islamic elements in it this is inappropriate because this is making simil almost making fun of the Quran though the intention was not to make fun of the Quran rather to make fun of the incident that he cannot memorize such a long Surah as yunus and instead alur which he memorizes is easier so he lies about his name to make people laugh this is inappropriate and very shaky and Dangerous Grounds Muslim must avoid anything that has to do with making fun with Quran or with the Sunnah or with the uh names of Allah or of Shar in general and Allah Knows Best"
