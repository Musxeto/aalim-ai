  "transcript": "oh [Music] Lord most of the times we may every now and then get something of good news not rarely but occasionally so what to do upon receiving Pleasant news Hadith 242. Canada would prostrate in gratitude to Allah upon receiving news which pleased him or which caused pleasure so this is a confirmed Sunnah that when you receive good news however the scholars stated that this news should be something new not frequent so not every month when I receive my paycheck not every day when my wife cooks a good meal I prostrate to Allah azzawajal because this is not from the Sunnah rather if my uncle is at hospital and he's undergoing a major surgery and I received the news that he made it and he's healthy alhamdulillah I prostrate when I hear that the Muslims have gained victory over their enemies I prostrate so what we see in like football matches which is becoming a trend nowadays when they score a goal they prostrate this is not part of the Sunnah definitely and this is not appropriate one one may say oh Sheikh they're exposing their Aura well actually this is not the point because prostration of gratitude does not require facing the Qibla does not require covering your aura does not even require being in the state of wudu because these are conditions for prayer and prostration is not a prayer so there are two different uh things all together the following chapter is to deal with something that we all the time pass through and that is when we feel pain in our bodies what to do Hadith 243 most of us immediately go for painkillers or antibiotics or to the doctor neglecting the main source of healing that is Allah azzawajal in the Hadith of us may Allah be pleased within the prophet directed him and said foreign on your body wherever your body is aching you place your hand and say Bismillah in the name of Allah three times and then say I take refuge in Allah and within his omnipotence from the evil that I feel and I'm wary of and you say this seven times this is something that I have practiced myself and a lot of my acquaintances relatives and loved ones have practiced and it is perfect with the grace of Allah it needs conviction and total Devotion to Allah and Allah azzawajal would help you and cure you now so many times we see things that we like and we know that evil eye exists it's not of the superstitious things that people believe in it is mentioned in the Quran and it is mentioned in the authentic Sunnah so what to do to block my evil eye from harming others Hadith 244. the prophet said if you see something from your brother that is something you like his car his body his job his wealth his children so if you see something from your brother yourself or wealth which you find impressing then invoke blessings for it for the evil eye is indeed true what is meant by this Hadith it means that if you see something even if it belongs to a non-muslim you should not say whoa look at these wheels and all of a sudden boom four flat tires sometimes you say wow look at this son of his he's so healthy and young and he falls sick this is an evil eye you say you get how much per month as a salary man that's a lot and the guy is kicked out of his job the following day this is your evil eye so instead whenever you like something you should say Allah this is the Dua to ask Allah for blessing this blocks your evil eye and it stops it with the grace of Allah and there are a Hadith about this and there's nothing wrong when you hear someone saying this to you said whoa look at this and that which you have you say Rick say Allah say it in his face don't be shy or ashamed say it so that you block his evil eye with the grace of Allah this is why the prophet Allah said in another Hadith the evil eye is truth is a reality it can drop a man from the top of a mountain and it can insert a camel to the cooking pot meaning it can kill a camel by just giving it an evil life and we have hundreds and thousands of stories that prove this therefore whenever you see something you like say this is all the time we have until we meet next time [Music] foreign"
