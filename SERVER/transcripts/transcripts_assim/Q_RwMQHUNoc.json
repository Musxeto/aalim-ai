  "title": "Can I go to an Iftar for single Muslims if I do not free mix with women? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Usama from the US. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. So in the past I have attended iftar gatherings that have a separation between the men and the women. Recently I've been invited to an iftar that has been specifically advertised to host single Muslims in the community. So I know the host through a pre-marital course that I took. So from your past videos I've learned how it's not advisable to attend marital events and how people have used different ways to make it halal. So is it okay for me to just go when I'm strongly intended to just break my fast, hang with the brothers for a couple of minutes, and then leave for Isha soon, provided that there is a separation between the men and the women, and I'm only there to break my fast and enjoy good food without any other ulterior motives? So do I understand that the men and women will not be dating or having interviews during that event? Yes, I mean it's just for breaking the fast. I mean I'm also a reserved person, I only keep with the brothers, so there's going to be a separation. Yeah, this seems to be permissible, Akhi. There is no problem in that, Inshallah. Thank you. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it, Inshallah, within the following two days or three days, and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
