  "transcript": "and drama from the from saudi uh sir if a woman before her next period get some blood spots or very little bleeding so is this opinion because this blood is coming after almost nine to ten days of her previous uh period okay i will answer from saudi arabia she says if i before getting the period uh get discharged so i get the cramps i get the back pain and i get color discharge sometimes a spot or two of blood maybe a thread of blood do i consider this to be part of my menses and i stopped praying noting that this starts nine days after my previous menses the answer is it doesn't matter when it starts what matters is that the discharge the color discharge that you get before your period is not menses but the color discharge that you get during your period or after it before seeing purity this is part of your menses so a woman sees a thread of red line or a spot or two of blood or brownish discharges before her period we say every athan go clean yourself perform mudo and pray you have no problem this is not just breaks your wudu but it does not stop you from praying then after three four days she gets her period because the period is known with the flow of the blood if the flow of the blood did not start you disregard the colored discharges once the flow of blood starts this is your period you cannot end this period until you see your purity so after five six days there's no blood but there are colored brownish discharges these are your periods still until you see your purity which is recognized by a white thread like discharge or by total dryness nothing no colored this choice no colors at all only then you can have russell and start to pray and whatever comes after it it doesn't matter allah knows best you"
