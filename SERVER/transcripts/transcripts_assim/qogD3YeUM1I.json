  "title": "Abayah sleeves go up revealing her wrists when she raises her hand to say Allahu Akbar",
  "transcript": "khadijah says i pray with an arabia over my normal clothes what is an abaya it's the black outer garment that women wear when they go out so she prays with abbaya but when i raise my hands for saying the takbir or rising up from sujud my sleeves move a bit and expose some part of my wrist is it okay so a woman must conceal her arm and only expose her hand this is a must the area inside must not be seen if she does this while doing allahu akbar this area is and this is not permissible it manages to nullify her prayer if done intentionally or she can do something about it so if she does this every time she goes you know some women pray with sleeves like mine so even if she's praying this area is exposed she says no yeah but i'm covering my up to my wrist yes but when you do this this area is your hour it's exposed you can't pray in this your prayer is invalid so is it okay that says no this is not okay she says if we have a stretchable cloth near the wrist it's tight and the shape of our wrists and little shape of our arms is visible will that be okay i don't know what she meant by this but if she means that underneath she has a sleeve of a pullover or whatever she's wearing underneath but it's tight yet it's covering this area so when she does allahu akbar you can see this uh the stretch or the cloth underneath and it's showing the shape of the wrist and the arm is it okay this is okay because it's covered with the abaya and it's exposed only at these moments which inshallah does not impact the validity of your prayer you"
