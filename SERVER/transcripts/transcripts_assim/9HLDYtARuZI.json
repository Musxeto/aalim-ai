  "transcript": "shakaal our first question here is from brother fallin and he's 15 years old he's from the UAE and he said he would like to thank Hooda for the very good programs we've been producing the circle affair but the father he says my first question is playing chess halal or Haram subhanAllah him Hamden arrabiata mean Salameh Hosni Mubarak honor of the you are soo I mean nabina muhammad in why the early he was happy he remain the ruling on playing chess is an issue of dispute among scholars some scholars said that playing chess like any other recreational game that has no benefit except wasting time and in a lot of cases wasting prayers so that people who are engaged into it are so possessed by it they made postpone or delay praying prayers on time and that is why they look at such games to be a waste of time and means of neglecting remembering allah azza wajal mm-hmm other scholars say that chess specially gives boost to the intellect because it builds in the individual how to strategize his moves and how to think in advance and if a person is balanced and he knows when to play and went to quit if the no noes are avoided then it shall not it is permissible and what are the no knows the things that you're not supposed to have among them is that you should play in times that would not conflict with prayer times you must not play for compensation or reward in the sense that there shouldn't be any form of gambling if I win that it's your treat mmm you will buy me dinner for example if thirdly it a person should not be possessed by it so maybe he would not play it at the times of but it would consume like five or four hours or six hours of his day and this is not permissible because definitely he would neglect remembering Alonso and fourthly some of the scholars lectures and albana may Allah have mercy on his soul said that if we remove the Horsehead because it's a statue it's a living creature if we break it or remove it and replace it with with something that does not simulate the creation of Allah then insha Allah it is permissible the previously mentioned conditions but can we take the same ruling for other games once it falls fall into the category that you just mentioned it's okay it is okay if there is benefit out of it for example there are certain games that were forbidden to play such as backgammon for example not because of that gamma but because of the dice hmm the Prophet Alice also forbade us from tossing and throwing the dice and playing with it and he said that it is better for a person to dip his hand in the blood of a swine of a pig rather than to play with dice so any games that involve dice it's not permissible because such as monopoly but gammon etc there are nowadays new Islamic games like the the game of life I think it's a it's a new game now that just recently was was produced and it is not a nice game that takes a child from childhood into his marital life and how to gain reward how to walk to the Masjid and it's like it's based on the monopoly thing but it does not include dice and it is with an incest lamech concept such games fulfills the need in people for recreation and at the same time it does not break any rules now there are games that would be considered just simple waste of time like playing cards so if you play cards I'm not talking about koror something that is haraam totally Harlan because of the gambling in it I'm talking like normal card playing so if it involves wasting time and it involves being possessed with it it takes the running of harm that it is forbidden not allowed but if someone does this like once a week once he gathers with his family or with his friends for half an hour for an hour inshallah this comes within the permissible things providing that we try our best to limit ourselves to the Islamic way of doing it which is even the the deck of cards you have a jack a queen and a king and they all have faces so it is recommended that you it wouldn't take anything from you you just put a marker on the face in inshallah that would do the job"
