  "title": "Is it an innovation to turn on the lights at maghrib? (Killing mice) | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "of fat he says is it an innovation that we should turn the lights on at the time of maghrib it's not an innovation it is a necessity for you to see because when it's night time if you keep on the lights off you'll bang your head and your leg in everything that is in your way so the norm is to turn on the lights now some people think that it is part of the sunnah to turn off the light when it is and this is not true the sunnah according to the long hadith is to turn your lanterns which is lit by lighting a fuse with fire so the prophet says when you go to bed make sure that you extinguish all types of fire and in another hadith he explains the reason when he tells us that the people when they go to bed and this happened in front of the prophet as he was sitting with his companions a mouse with a thread in its mouth came running went to the fire lit that thread and ran to a place where there was cloth or blanket or whatever and started the fire so the prophet assam explained to us why we should kill mice whenever we see them even in the haram mice are horrible rodents that carry illnesses diseases pandemics and at the same time they're evil they are smart they corrupt things they destroy things and they would set a house on fire so this is the reason of turning off the lanterns or the uh um the fire whenever you are um in night time so that the mouse would not let your house on fire"
