  "transcript": "islam from australia he says what or how do we respond to people who claim that other than allah know the knowledge of the unseen first of all allah azzawajal mentioned as in the hadith that are authentic in sahih al-bukhari and elsewhere where the prophet saws said that the keys of the unseen are five and these keys only allah has them and allah only as mentioned in the quran may show glimpses of them to whomever he wishes from his messengers and prophets so the angels may be informed the prophet may be informed of a glimpse with allah's permission of course because no one knows the unseen except allah now to claim that the shia there are 12 imams actually there are 11 and the 12th one is a fabricated one he does not exist because he is supposed to have been born to a barren father which is he had never had any children and he is in the tunnel for the past like 12 centuries eating from rivers of milk and honey all this nonsense that they have fabrications in their religion which is not related to islam so to claim that they know the unseen this is total cover and blasphemy anyone who claims to know the unseen who claims to know the future anyone who believes that a person an individual knows the future he's an apostate disbeliever because no one knows the unseen except no one knows the unseen except allah so to claim someone knows it indefinitely this is blasphemy now having said that the unseen is relative so what i have in my pocket is unseen to you you don't know what's in my pocket so if i know what's in my pocket does this mean that i know the unseen no and likewise people come to the things that allah knows and allah knows what are in the wombs as in the last ayahs of of surah man and they say well we're physicians with ultrasound we can determine what is in the mother's womb first of all this is not true because before the signs appear you could not tell that so in the first week or so you don't know if it's a male or a female other than that knowing what's in the wombs is not limited to the gender of the child allah knows what's in the wombs in this in the sense that whether it's a boy or a girl and and there is no third gender as now they're promoting it everywhere in brain washing everyone to believe so there's a boy or a girl is he going to be a happy person or a wicked person what is his provisions when is he going to be born when is he going to be when is he going to die what is he going to do throughout the span of his life this is what in the wombs that only allah knows about and no one can claim that they would know would he be healthy or fall sick after a month a year or a decade this is all in allah's knowledge that no one can share so anyone who claims to know the unseen akhi is definitely a kafir masood"
