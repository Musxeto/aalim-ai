  "transcript": "Another Questioner says; The hādīth says, Qur'ān \nrecited after Fajr prayer is witnessed by angels.   If we recite Qur'ān during the day, won't it be \nwitnessed by angels? First of all, correction. The   āyah does not say 'Qur'ān recited after Fajr', \nrather, āyah is 17:78 - Surat-ul Isra āyah 78.   Allah says, what translates to, 'Establish \nprayer at the decline of the sun from the   meridian until the darkness of the night, \nAnd also, the Qur'ān the recitation of   dawn. Indeed, the recitation of dawn is ever \nwitnessed.' The scholars, the companions said,   the recitation of dawn meaning in Salat-ul Fajr. \nThis is the recitation that is witnessed. 'Okay,   so isn't it witness the rest of the day?' \nYou did not get the point. The point is,   you cannot understand the Qur'ān without \nunderstanding the sunnah and knowing the   sunnah. And this is the biggest problem a lot \nof those 'interpreting the Qur'ān' fall into.   They think that, they have the tools necessary to \nunderstand the Qur'ān while neglecting the sunnah,   not paying heed. So they don't want to have \nanything to do with the sunnah when they come   to interpreting and explaining the Qur'ān and this \nmakes them fall into a lot of wrong things and a   lot of major errors. There is an authentic \nhādīth reported by Al-Bukhari and Muslim,   where the Prophet (aleyhi salatu wa \nsalam) said, [عَلَيْكُمُ يَتَعَاقَبُونَ]   'The angels, they have shifts. They \nhave shifts coming, observing you.   And these shifts in the day and at night, they \nmeet at Fajr time and at 'Asr time. And then   they go to Allah Azza wa Jal. And Allah asks \nthem, and Allah is more knowledgeable than them,   but this kind of rhetorical question to show the \nwhole world, and He asks him, 'How did you find my   servants?' So the angels collaborate by \nsaying, 'We came while they were praying,   and we left while they were praying.' Meaning Fajr \nand 'Asr, they were praying in the day and night   and the evening. This is one of the \nevidences where scholars say that,   the adhkar of the evening should be after \n'Asr. This is one of the evidences they use.   And it's an issue of dispute, regardless. So this \nmeans that it is witnessed because of the meeting   of the angels in the evening and \nthe morning. And 'Qur'ān-ul Fajr',   the recitation of Fajr at the prayer of fard \nof Fajr prayer, is the one that is witnessed.   Not that they don't witness other times, they \ndo witness other times, but it's like saying,   'It is most likely to your dua to be answered \nbetween adhan and iqamah, when when it's raining,   at the last hour of Friday, at the last third \nof the night, in Tahajjud, while in Sujūd.'   'Okay, but if I make dua outside of these times, \nisn't it going to be answered?' The answer is   'Yes, it's going to be answered, but it's more \nlikely to be answered at these preferred and   recommended times. So, it has a greater and a \nbetter value. And Allah, Azza wa Jal, knows best."
