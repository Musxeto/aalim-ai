  "transcript": "my question for today is uh I had a question regarding uh like the prayer room you know how sometimes uh modern day they build houses uh and Muslims often add a prayer room is this a b or is this permissible well this is an issue of dispute Malik may Allah be pleased with him because he used to live away from the Masjid and it was difficult for him to commute there he requested that the prophet Sall wasallam come and pray in his house so that they would take this place as a m or a Masjid and the prophet did this and the prophet also prohibited the Muslims from taking alah in their homes and the scholars explained that Al are the plural of and it's a place designated for prayer so to combine between the two it is not permissible to designate a room to be a prayer room when there are masjids around and where are people can go to the Masjid this is not from the Sunnah the Sunnah is to pray wherever the prayer is due upon you in any room in any place and on any piece of ground and thei of may Allah be pleased with him is that he wanted that place to be a Masjid for his people and tribe because they lived far away from the uh Haram of the Prophet alam's Masjid and Allah subhana wa tala Knows Best"
