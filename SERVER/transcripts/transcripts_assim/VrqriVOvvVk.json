  "transcript": "muhammad from the emirates he says can we change the creation of allah by using lotions and creams this is a temporary change of creation which is a form of adornment if a person applies creams or lotions to hide spots or dark places under their eyes which would only be concealed for a couple of hours or six hours at most there's nothing wrong in that it's like applying makeups and adorning one's self what is not permissible is the thing that changes the creation of allah azza either permanently or for six or months or a year etc this is becoming haram so when someone comes and changes the tone and the color of their bodies for uh uh a long period of time like mj did this is definitely prohibited and the one who does it is cursed by allah azza but applying makeups applying a creams that would work for five six hours only there's no problem in that inshallah but you"
