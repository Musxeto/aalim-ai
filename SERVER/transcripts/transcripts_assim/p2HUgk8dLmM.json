  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] can [Music] [Music] dear brothers and sisters in Islam an may Allah be pleased with him said that the prophet sallallah alaihi Ali wasallam would so often say and supplicate to Allah asael by saying oh Turner of Hearts make my heart steadfast on your religion so anast asked him once and said oh prophet of Allah we believed in you and in what you had brought to us so are you afraid that we may turn back on our heels the prophet saidat wasam yes the heart hearts are between two of Allah's fingers and he flips it as he Wills this beautiful Hadith puts a great deal of Hope and at the same time a great deal of fear as for the fear we fear Allah's actions because one of Allah's actions is to flip to turn to redirect the hearts so the source of fear is that we fear Allah's actions of flipping our hearts and of course flipping our hearts from guidance to misguidance the fear from flipping our heart from into shik from worshiping Allah Asel into committing sins from being in light and going into the darkness this is what scares us the most while we have Great Hopes in Allah subhanahu waala that that he may guide the misguided so on the positive side we're hopeful that those disbelievers would Embrace Islam those Sinners would come back into the line of the righteousness and piety of Muslims and likewise so the this Hadith makes us balance between fear and hope at the same time now the prophet saidat that the hearts are between two fingers of Allah's fingers and the fingers is an attribute that is authentic proven by this Hadith and many many other hadiths as well narrated by anas by um Sal by IB Mas and other companions may Allah be pleased with them and the scholars of have accepted embraced and believed in such an attribute Imam Abu bakar in his book the book ofed made a chapter where he compiled the Hadith that spoke about affirming the attribute of fingers to Allah likewise Abu Bakr Al may Allah have mercy on his soul in his book he compiled a chapter by the name of the belief that the hearts are between two fingers of Allah's fingers without simulation or asking how IM in his book a beautiful book that is in many volumes he said that the finger mentioned in the Hadith is an attribute of Allah and likewise every attribute that is mentioned in the Quran or in the Sunnah we believe in it in in such a fashion so the attributes of Allah asael such as the face the eyes the hand the foot when Allah talks about his actions of coming of descending to the lower heavens and to be upon and above his throne and to laugh and to Rejoice all of these are confirmed attributes of Allah that he mentioned about himself in the Quran and the prophet mentioned it in the authentic Sunnah the issue of flipping the hearts is a action of Allah Asel that intimidate us that makes us afraid we don't know what an ending we will have Allah Allah says in the Quran and know that Allah intervenes between a man and his heart and that to him you will be gathered Subhan Allah Allah intervenes Allah flips your heart this is on the negative side in the sense it's not negative in the sense that we're afraid of it we don't want it to happen to us we would like to live as Muslims and die as Muslims we would love to live on offering forms of worship and dying on forms of worship and not flipping to the dark side as they say without any doubt Allah's power and ability is second to none how many people who abandoned prayer how many drug addicts how many people people who commit heinous sins that people at the end of the day gave up on them being guided how many of them are guided in seconds Subhan Allah there was this individual who made films ridiculing the Quran ridiculing Islam and making fun of it all of a sudden he accepts Islam and he becomes a dii calling others to Islam showing them how wrong he was and he has a great influence upon the non-muslims may Allah forgive his previous sins if we look in the Quran we will find Allah flipping the hearts of people in seconds look at the great story of prophet M MSA Moses peace be upon him his story with the sorcerers and magicians of pharaoh when they gathered the people and they wanted to defeat MSA peace be upon him and show the people how strong their magic is is they threw their staffs and their sticks and they eluded to people they made them delusional and think that these are snakes walking on the ground when MSA threw his staff and it turned to a real snake that consumed everything that was on the floor the sorcerers knew that this is not magic they knew that this is a miracle only from from Allah in seconds they turned from Sorcerers and magicians into Martyrs righteous and Pious Allah says so The Magicians fell in prostration to Allah and they said we have believed in The Lord of the worlds we've believed in a second seconds ago they were there to prove that m was an impostor and Subhan Allah in seconds they turned into Believers not only that they turned into firm Believers with sound a and they even preached they preached Pharaoh himself when he said to them I will kill you I will torment you I will crucify you they said do whatever you do it at the end of the day it's all in Allah's hands you have nothing that you can do to us if Allah does not will it and they called him to Islam and toed Allah subhana T is the Turner of hearts and this is why we say in our Dua our Lord let not our hearts deviate after you've guided us we are in need of Allah's guidance even prophets of Allah needs this guidance and to be steadfast Allah says in the Quran and if we had not made you steadfast oh Muhammad you would have almost inclined to them a little so this flipping and turning of the hearts happens on only in accordance to Allah's wisdom Allah's Justice now it is totally unacceptable to think negatively of Allah how it is not permissible for you to think that Allah would misguide those who come to him and white gu want guidance Allah's Mercy overwhelms everything to the extent that those who want guidance Allah would never set them astray Allah says in the Quran and those who strive for us in our cause we will surely guide them to our ways so this is a promise from Allah yet those who are misguided it is because they chose to be misguided Allah says in the Quran and when they deviated Allah caused their hearts to deviate they drew first blood they were the one who were inclined to deviate No One turns back on their heel without a cause and a reason from himself no one would all of a sudden flip except if there comes a dubious matter a Whispers of the Shan and he entertains it and endorses it or he gets something that is lustful a desire a s sin and he rides the wave he chose to be deviated while if someone wants to go to the Masjid it is illogical and irrational that all of a sudden he will find himself in a nightclub he's going to the Masjid but if he's going to the Masjid and he sees something that lures him and he gets inclined to follow his whims and desires and he goes right and left when this is it this is what he has chosen for himself this is what he had done to his him himself and this is what Allah mentioned in the Quran and as for thud the big tribe of thud whom Allah had sent to as for pre peace be upon him as for thud we guided them but they preferred blindness over guidance they chose not to be guided it is unfortunate when you've lived as short as I have and I've seen so many scholars not a lot but I've seen Scholars I've seen di I've seen righteous people flip and go Rogue may Allah protect us I've seen people who memorize the Quran now engaged in singing and music I've seen people who were in the first draw of the Masjid now they're watching movies and spending their times at movie theaters and and and plays and the likes I've seen people who used to be righteous and practicing with the wrong concept of Life some of them turned atheists all of those were misguided because they chose to be misguided had they chosen Allah had they they asked for guidance they would have been guided how many do we know who were among the Sunnah who were preaching Islam who had solid AA now unfortunately there as they are as close as Hypocrites as close as enemies of Islam you like what you hear and what comes out of their mouths but it has nothing to do with correct a or Quran or Sunnah all what they seek is Fame recognition the number of followers and they will get this in this life but may Allah asael keep our hearts steadfast on Islam may Allah direct our actions towards him direct our hearts towards worshiping him in accordance to the correct and valid a that pleases him we have a short break stay tuned and we'll be right back"
