  "transcript": "so the question is from a brother that sells newly imported cars now they themselves don't don't provide any loan system directly if anyone wants to buy buy they pay the full amount up front but some people take loan from some people take loan from the bank to buy the to buy car now the thing is the bank is not just going to give them a loan so they need a written quotation from the seller to seller to show show to the bank to get their loan so if the seller give them the written quotation will that be considered as helping in RBA giving a written quotation of the product I am selling is permissible and if it was used to get a interest based loan the sin is on the person who got it this mug is being sold for $10 someone asks me can I get a quotation I say sure here's the quotation whether he gives it to his company to get an advanced loan or he gives it to a bank to get an interest based loan or he gives it to his wife to approve it for him it's none of my concern I didn't assist him on Haram it is his doing of doing it I just gave him a quotation of how much this mug I'm selling for would cost cash and this is halal inshallah"
