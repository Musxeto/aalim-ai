  "title": "Must the one who gave khutbah lead the Friday prayer or can someone else also lead? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "it is part of the recommendation that orator the one who gives the hutbah is the same one who leads the prayer but this is not mandatory which means that if I gave the khutbah and I finished the sermon and the iqama was given and I appoint someone else to leave the prayer this is totally legit and there's no problem in that insha Allah"
