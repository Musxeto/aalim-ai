  "transcript": "she says that when we traveled to India and the question was not clear so I would presume that she's saying that from Egypt to India we're traveling East and the day is much shorter so so when do I break my fast you break your fast the minute the sun sets if you're on the plane and the sun sets you break your fast if you land and then it even in Egypt they did not uh uh break the fast yet but because you're traveling East the day is much quicker you can break it fast and the day is valid"
