  "title": "Is it permissible for a business sales person to get a salary AND commission? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Muhammad from Saudi Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh my question is related to a job, a profession, which is called as a sales development representative or also a business development representative in which a person do sales of the company he is working for where he with the employer makes a contract of a base salary is given for example $400, $500 and apart from that he is also given commission for the sales he is doing so is it permissible to take the salary and the commission and what is the ruling for me regarding this and what is the possible way to work as a salesperson in this regard? Jazak Allah Khair Jazakum. If there is a fixed salary and you agree to that, this is permissible as long as your job description is halal, the line of work of the company you're serving is halal, this minimal wage or whatever salary you're getting a month is halal. The commission is a bonus so it's a form of incentive the more business you bring in the more development you execute we will give you an X amount of percentage on top of your salary this is totally halal insha Allah. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it insha Allah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
