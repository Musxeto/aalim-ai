  "transcript": "sent us a question saying is it permissible to polish our nails in any color if none does not see us so salma is asking about the ruling on wearing nail polish and selecting any random color of choice would that be permissible nowadays it is unfortunate but this habit of wearing nail polish has spread among the muslim women and i cannot give my preference as a man because this is not something that i'm wearing alhamdulillah in the beginning this was a habit of the non-muslims it was a custom of the non-muslims so at the beginning the women so-called the pioneers who adopted it were imitating the disbelievers in their customs and and their traditions and their sinful and they were sinful for that reason and allah would hold them to account nowadays unfortunately it is so spread that muslims and non-muslims alike are wearing it my preference as an individual i do not like nail polish regardless of the color especially when a woman has long fingernails and she puts reddish nail polish on it alongside with all the cosmetics on her face and the paintings she looks like a monster who had just finished attacking its prey with fingernails and and all red etc it's i don't know this is my own preference but don't take my word for it we are talking about islamically nowadays it as stated earlier most of women muslim women wear this so what's the ruling on it inshallah it is permissible this is islamic ruling it is permissible providing that no strangers male non-mahram would see it why because this is a form of adornment some people like it some people would be lured into it or turned on by looking at it so women must cover it secondly of course when she applies it she cannot perform wudu afterwards so she cannot pray afterwards but if she is in the state of wudu and she puts it on she can pray until she nullifies her wudu thirdly when we come to the colors now up till this moment the colors are regular and normal among the muslims but when a woman comes and wears for example black nail polish even among the non-muslims they will probably consider this to be like satan worshipers this is something repulsive they do not accept it to be the norm though lots of punks and and hard rockers wear it males as well but this doesn't mean that we muslims should follow their footsteps all the way secondly the concept of nail polish nowadays has reached levels of extravagance i have my nieces and some of my daughters sometimes they spend hours doing one nail and you see some decoration on it and sometimes they may draw a face or give it six or seven colors at the same time what is this is this part of adorning yourself and making yourself beautiful but this is following the footsteps of the disbelievers so i would not recommend it and if it is extravagance it becomes haram but if it is not and someone wastes her time doing this just for the fun of it i would not say it's haram but we should have higher aspiration to things that would benefit us in this life and in the hereafter as well"
