  "transcript": "Sadiqa from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Barakatuh. Some months ago I got a counseling session from you and you suggest me to divorce my husband. But my father, after one month my father said not to divorce him. Give him a last chance. So I started living with him. He started providing for me. But the problem is in a little small thing I started fighting with him. Last week, I also got pregnant on that time. So last week I fight with my husband and said him that I want to go but I cannot leave because of this child. And he said after giving birth, if you want you can go. But I know his intention because before saying that he said that I get married to you. Whether you are good or bad, there are no option. I am not going to leave you. So I said I don't want to leave. What's the question Sadiqa? Sadiqa, what is your question? My question is that I am having lots of whispers that I already divorced him. No, no, this is not to you. Issues of divorce are not taken from women. Because through my experience in counseling sessions, I sit with a lot of women. And they say things. And they say my husband did this. I know his intention and he intended this. This doesn't have any weight in a court of law according to Sharia. Because what counts is the husband's words himself. So you bring your husband. Let him talk to me. Let him tell me what he said in your presence. And then he tells me about his intention in your presence. And then we can give you the verdict. But to listen to you and give you a verdict, this is definitely not feasible or acceptable. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days. And I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all."
