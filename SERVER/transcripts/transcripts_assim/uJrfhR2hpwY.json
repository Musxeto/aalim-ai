  "title": "Can I advertise an Apartment if it has chruches by it",
  "transcript": "Yusuf from the Emirates Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi And he has an apartment in a country and he wants me to promote it online for like Airbnb and advertise it. But the thing is I've been there and I've been in that apartment and I saw a book that has like a map for like guiding around the country like it has multiple places for worship like it has a church in it and I saw a cross in the church obviously. So I don't know if I can advertise the space and has other places of worship to it. There is no problem in advertising an apartment. I don't see any relationship between the apartment and the book. Because your friend owns the book. Your relatives may have hundreds of books similar to that or encyclopedias or something on their computers that would lead to such thing. You have on your phone Google Maps that would take people to churches and synagogues and temples. This has nothing to do with renting or leasing or selling a property. This is not related. Yes if you tell me he wants me to advertise his apartment as a temple or as a place where people go to worship their false gods, I said yeah this is haram. that inshaAllah."
