  "transcript": "from Algiers called and says why do we recite loudly in federal prayer and memory Benicia while we recite silently in Lahore ah sir and in the last raka of Madrid and the to last Rakas of Elisha why is that and this is a good question to answer it we have to realize that our religion is based on submitting our wills to Allah a solution so for example the last two or three verses of Surat al-baqarah chapter 2 the last three verses allah azza wajal tells us in the beginning that whatever goes through your mind Allah will hold you accountable for it the Companions came to the Prophet Allah saw Sam and said o prophet of Allah we were instructed to do jihad to fight in the cause of Allah and face the possibility of being killed or injured we were ordered to fast pray and to give zakat and all of this we comply we have no problems but to be accountable for what goes in our minds this is beyond our ability so the Prophet said to the master Sam do you want to do and say what the Jews had said that we listen we hear and we disobey say we hear we listen and we comply and obey so they immediately said that they didn't hesitate so Allah as usual abrogated this by saying that Allah so gel does not burden a soul beyond what it can bear so what goes in your mind alonzo gel forgives it what do we learn from this we learn that Islam is based on compliance with the Quran the Sunnah it is based on submission your will to allah azza wajal which means that the prophet salah salem when he says pray as you have seen me pray and we look at how he prayed we find that he used to recite every single feature the quran in the prayer loudly and in the first two records of Maghreb and the first two records of Asia he used to recite loudly and in the four records of Lahore the four records of a sir the last raka of Mallory and the last two rakahs of Asia he used to recite silently now we look in his teachings never ever he explained that to us we look into the companions may allah be pleased with them and never ever we will find any of the companions asking why therefore we understand that this is how religion is and we have to take it as a package deal we don't have the right to say why is it loud and not silent or why is fujitora cos and malorie three rocailles why not all of them are four or two or one or why do we have in every unit one bowing and two prostrations why not having to 2 or 1 1 this is how it was given and relate to us and we have to comply to it and Allah so Jill knows"
