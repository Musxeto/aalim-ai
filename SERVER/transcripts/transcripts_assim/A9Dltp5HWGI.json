  "title": "After praying Isha, do we pray Witr at Muzdalifah",
  "transcript": "from germany uh sheikh we know that in hajj when we go to muzdalifa we play maglev 3 raka and shorten asia by praying to raqqa at the time my question is after praying salatullah do you need to pray salatul wither at mustalife it was not reported that the prophet allah is night prayer at muzdalifa but not being reported does not exempt us from offering it because we know that the prophet haslam had never left night prayer and witter whether he was residing on traveling and muslim is not an exception therefore scholars say if you're fit and you can pray night prayer it is highly recommended that you offer night prayer or at least offer winter and good get a good uh rest in order to carry out the tasks of the day of read which are plenty and many and maybe tired some to some but it wasn't reported that the prophet prayed it or did not pray it it was left open and the default is that he never left with her whether he was residing or traveling and allah azza knows best you"
