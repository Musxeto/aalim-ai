  "transcript": "norine says can fathers change the nappies of baby girls and give birth to their young daughters this is an issue that the vast majority of schools of thought say it is totally permissible not only that they stated that there are war the private part of a child is not restricted until the child reaches the age of seven so if a boy of an age of six dies it is permissible for his mother and other women to wash shroud that child if a girl of the age of six or six-and-a-half dies it is permissible don't not recommend it but it is permissible for her father other men to wash her and to shroud her because her aura is not respected meaning that nothing moves for a man or for a woman for seeing such a child in that hour and therefore there is nothing wrong in a father changing the nappies of the diapers of his own girl or of other girls as well because they are infants and children and Elijah knows best"
