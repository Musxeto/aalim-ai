  "transcript": "now part two what is the dress code of a woman that she must observe while in the gym in front of other women so this is a segregated gym that is only for women and this is a good thing and hamdulillah but what is the dress code the dress code scholars all agree that a woman should not wear transparent clothes she should not wear naked clothes or fitting clothes that makes her look like as if she is not wearing anything and she should not imitate the disbelievers and what she wears this means that if she wears regular pants or jeans or loose trousers or whatever the trainers whatever they call them and a loose t-shirt this is okay this is fine unfortunately this is a trend in human nature whenever you feel good about yourself you want to show more flesh for example fat women who undergo this bypass stomach surgery or something like that and within couple of months or three months they lose like 30 or 40 pounds and some more so they are reduced in size drastically now these are practicing Muslim women but as it's human nature when they feel that they've lost so much weight they want to show that to the world so they go to weddings and they go to gatherings segregated only women wearing very tight clothes which is how long but they don't pay attention usually to this fact unfortunately likewise women who go to the gym if they feel good about their body they would not cover that rather you would find a woman wearing a sports bra wearing very tight leggings or whatever they call them or putting something that reveals her curves and body because she's proud of it men on the other hand are different you see bodybuilders usually put on their hoodies and they cover their body and they workout they don't want to expose it not now maybe later on but unfortunately this is human nature these kind of scenes are prohibited for us as Muslims to watch so a sister must try her level best to choose the times where she does not see these sceneries among women so if she goes usually in a segregated gym for women if she goes early in the morning there's nobody there but if she goes in the afternoon or the evening it's fully packed and this is not permissible for her to attend such places and Alonzo Jian knows best"
