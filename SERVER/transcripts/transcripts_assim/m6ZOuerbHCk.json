  "title": "Invested in Marijuana (medical) but laws changed, its used as recreational drugs, sell my business?",
  "transcript": "the um this has to do with Investments I've been a student of Islam since 2010 I was born in America I for Investments um our retirement the there was medical marijuana that was legalized and I had put I had invested in the stock for medical marijuana to be used as medical um and I did my research and all that and the stocks fell and as it fell they they switched they changed in this a lot of Canada they changed to recreational and then purchased a bunch of liquor stores so as the stock fell it went from what I felt was Halal um downed quite a bit of money and now it's like I'm trapped and I'm stuck because I feel like now this is for sure her mom and I've lost money and I have to wait another year if I want to sell to even break even do I sell now and Trust all that fix the mistake I don't know what to do and I feel sick to my stomach over this um I I made a mistake my intention was to save money to my kids with to Medina which it's all things are going good on that but now I have this issue um and I would appreciate your Consulting and also you're appreciated very much by many don't listen to the critics this by itself makes my day the Canadians are a lot alhamdulillah but yeah yeah inshallah have a thick skin and it would wouldn't inshallah bother me a lot uh you do trust Allah and you are students of knowledge for 13 years and you want a noble cause to go to Medina and Allah will make this happen soon don't worry about that risk is is in Allah's hands yes when you did your research and medical marijuana at the beginning was legit now it's shifted into recreational marijuana and to be sold in uh liquor stores and a lot of the states have permitted it to be consumed by the public for recreation in specific dosages or weights now this becomes Haram without any doubt so my advice to you is to sell immediately and whatever you lost Allah will compensated for you without any doubt but waiting for the prices to go up while knowing that without exaggeration eighty percent of the incomes Haram because it's used for basically recreational purposes nobody uses it as a medical substance except maybe 15 or 10 maybe 20 percent at most the rest would buy it for recreational purposes then I would suggest that you bail out and Allah azzawajal would compensate you for that without any doubt"
