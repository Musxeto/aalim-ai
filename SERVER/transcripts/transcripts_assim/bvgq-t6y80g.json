  "transcript": "foreign and welcome to the 18th episode of the islamic faith we will study today inshallah chapter 10 which deals with a very important topic in aquidan a topic that a lot of the muslim a lot of the muslims have gone astray in their beliefs and they have differed hugely to the extent that they became one of the 72 sects and their difference to allah is not based on anything other than following their own whims and desires so let us go through this chapter which is quite concise and short but we will inshaallah learn and benefit a lot of it the sheikh says allah has assigned their lot to all creatures before they were created and every creature was created by allah's determination that preceded its creation and this is something we all know by default everything has been predestined 50 000 years before allah created the universe we all know this the hadith is very famous and well known to people when allah first created the pen he instructed it to write so the pen said what should i write o my lord so allah said write the predestiny of everything and that was the prophet says 50 000 years before allah created the creation so this is something we have to believe in and the evidence is backing up allah's pre destiny or al-qaeda are a number of verses of the quran so the first verse and you will find that i'm quoting from sahih international not the translation of the book because i feel more comfortable with it allah says and he has created each thing and determined it with precise determination and allah says in surah in indeed all things we created with predestination now all things and allah says in surat al-azab chapter 33 is the command of allah a destiny created so allah azzawajal has determined all matters has predestined all matters and all things good and bad in an authentic hadith the prophet was states that an essential part of faith is to believe in divine destiny both the good and the evil of it or the bad of it and this is also one of the pillars of iman you know it is the sixth willard of iman now when imam ahmed was asked about what is destiny so he said it is allah's knowledge so the sheikh says allah's knowledge is essential for his determination of destiny no one can determine things except the one who knows them so these are two very related things tada and pre-destiny and knowledge no one knows their fine details places changes beginning and end except for their creator allah says that we must learn that allah has power over all things so you may know that allah is over all things competent and that allah has encompassed all things in knowledge so this is and also allah says does he who create it not know while he is subtle the aware so this is a beautiful verse that we always have to remember and use when people say to us that times have changed we cannot implement the same rulings at the beginning of islam 14 centuries ago this is not logical this is not practical we always tell to them that does he who created not know so isn't allah all knowing of his creation and what things are going to materialize too so when allah azzawajal sets a religion for us and tells us that this is for the end of time till the end of time is it possible that after 15 centuries or 20 centuries we come to say that um i think it was a mistake we have to change this we have to amend this this is impossible otherwise the whole religion is not true and not practical and this is the power of islam that it existed firmly and strongly for the past 15 centuries and it will still exist and thrive until the end of times because it is from the one who created the humans now knowledge and predestiny are related whoever denies allah's determination of all things then he denies his knowledge and whoever denies allah's knowledge denies his determination what allah determined for his creation is all recorded in a book kept with him allah almighty says we have not neglected in the register a thing then on to their lord they will be gathered allah says [Music] and also says all things we have enumerated in a clear register now this is the clear register that is known as the preserved tablet that only allah azzawajal knows what's in it and a lot of the time i get questions on my website people asking me why is allah forcing us to do this and that why allah predetermined that i fornicate or consume wine and intoxicants and that i don't pray and this is quite weird because first of all you are a slave you are a servant you are not a peer to allah to question him second of all how did you know that this was predetermined wasn't the choice yours in the beginning didn't you choose to fornicate or someone forced you to do that it was your choice the friends who were hanging out with you reminded you and told you to fear allah and they left you why did they leave why didn't they participate in fornication like you did because they had a choice and they made the right choice so do we have a choice of our own or are we compelled to do everything like robots this is an issue that made people misunderstand khadar the sheikh says allah's creation is of two types the things that allah have created are divided into two types one creatures that have no will of their own such as planets stars mountains oceans etc secondly creatures that have a will and freedom of choice such as the humans the jinn and the angels allah has not set them on their respective courses without giving them a choice so as to force them to disobey him and then punish them for that the sheikh says this is not possible that allah make them sin without any of their own choices and then punish them for that that is not logical but also the opposite is also true nor did he give them total freedom without any aspect of subservice subservience subservience so that also as to enable them to be his partners in will and action so they don't have their own free will where they can do whatever they want against allah's will because then they would be partners to allah they choose and they do and they act against the will of allah and allah can't do anything about it that's that's not possible also it's not possible that they're forced to do what they're doing without any free will or choice of their own he has given them a will that is under his will as allah says it is not except a reminder to the worlds for whoever wills among you to take a right course and you we and you do not will accept that allah wills lord of the worlds so what does that mean it means that it is allah azza that has the final word the final say and it is allah azzawajal that has given us the freedom to choose allah says created people and their actions and we will come to the with some say pillars of predestiny and one of them is creation allah says and this is what ibrahim peace be upon him said to his people do you worship something that you yourselves have carved while it is allah who has created you and all you do so my actions are only created by the one creator in this universe and that is allah what i do when i when i move my hands when i make something allah has made me and the thing that i do and whatever actions i take this is created by allah azza he subhanah created [Music] causes determine their effects and this is the result of his perfect and complete knowledge as well as his infinite wisdom in establishing the universe in such a fine and perfect system everything has a cause and the means that cause these things have an effect it is allah who created the cause and the effect and this is how the universe is run with allah's predestination when allah causes the clouds to gather the air pressure to be at a certain level the wind to blow in a certain direction the temperature to be in a certain level then the rain falls no one says that oh rain fell because of this and that it is allah who caused this and that then the sheikh says it is not right for human mind to turn away from believing in what is in what it does not understand of allah's wisdom or its essence of allah's determination and subhanallah this is why one of the six pillars of iman the last pillar is to believe in without believing in predestiny if you pray and fast if you give zakat and perform hajj you are a disbeliever you are a kafir you cannot enter paradise for eternity because you denied one of the pillars of iman it is not right for the human mind to turn away from believing in what it does not understand of allah's wisdom or his essence of allah's determination we cannot understand everything that allah does and this is why he is god and he is the creator the owner the facilitator of everything and we are merely servants we do as we're told and if we fail we will go to hellfire and if we succeed and abide and obey we will end up in paradise for eternity the wisdom behind certain things may be beyond the capacity of our minds comprehension and this is a fact let us read this again the wisdom behind certain things may be beyond the capacity of our minds comprehension and the biggest example would be the story of al-khidr and musa peace be upon them in the end of surat al-kaff chapter 17 when musa was told to seek knowledge from a man whom allah has given him special knowledge said to him you cannot understand you cannot comprehend what i'm doing so my condition is that when you accompany me you don't ask me a question until i explain that to you so he agreed and you know what he had done to the boat to the ship and you know what he had done to the child and you know what he had done to the wall that was about to fall so these things on the surface musa who is one of the great will messengers of allah could not comprehend and when al-qaeda explained it to him only then he understood it and it made sense to him the human mind is like a vessel and some wisdom is like the water of the ocean meaning that the human mind is limited in size and ability while the wisdom is so huge and vast compared to the ocean should too much water be poured into this vessel it would drown it leaving it completely lost and the continued contemplation of some wisdom only increases man's perplexity just like the sun at midday hurts our eyes if we stare fixedly at it so sometimes when you want to contemplate and to think about allah's wisdoms over things that you are unable to understand this may backfire at you this may reduce your iman exactly like a person in midday light if i'm in midday light i can read i can see things i can commute from one area to the other without any problem now if someone says how are you able to do this when you don't have your spotlights on i say because the sun is there if he says okay how does the sun do this have you ever contemplated upon it my ability to see would be hampered if i stared at the sun because i will be blinded and allah has the highest example when we exceed and trespass in a territory that we're not supposed to be in when we exceed our limits and we would like to know why what's the justification why does allah make volcanoes and earthquakes why did the building fall on top of women children and elderly killing them or causing them real harm and injuries if you keep on asking you're staring at the sun and you will be blinded so when we come to the issues pertaining predestined the scholars say that pre-destiny is divided or based on four important pillars failing to believe in one of them takes you out of alison jamal and marks you as one of the innovators so pillar number one and if you would like to write this down that might be helpful for you pillar number one is knowledge and we have covered that so pre-destiny is allah's knowledge and allah's knowledge is not like anyone's knowledge and it cannot be compared or even imagined so when allah tells us that he had written things you can't ask allah interrogate allah or hold allah accountable for your own actions you cannot complain or object saying that oh allah you knew that i would end up sinning and going to hell why didn't you stop me this is ridiculous he gave you the free will and you were the one who chose exactly like he gave that person the free will and he chose to pray and stay away from haram now you cannot object to allah that he knew what this person was going to do or you what you were going to do you cannot object to that because this is allah's knowledge allah did not force you to do anything against your will as we have mentioned earlier otherwise it would have been unfair and unjust so how to calm this raging fire in my heart whenever i fall into a sin or whenever i see something bad happening to our brothers and sisters in burma the rohingya or the ogre in china or elsewhere how can i extinguish this raging fire in my heart by saying that this is something that allah has predestined by acknowledging the following one allah owns everything in this universe and the owner can do whatever he wants with what he owns so if allah were to take us all this universe and throw it in hell hellfire angels humans and jinn no one can complain or object as they say the creation is his number two allah is knowledgeable and we spoke about that number three allah is fair and just never wrongs anyone this is a fact when allah tells you this you have to believe in it so if you believe in all of this your heart becomes calm filled with tranquility your doubts becomes become numb because you believe in allah's wisdom in allah's knowledge in unless possessing everything and in allah's fairness so you need you believe that allah will not wrong you and it was your mistake that you have done what you had done so the first pillar to believe in predestiny is knowledge the second pillar is writing it down and we've covered this every single thing is written down so if i were to hold this cup it's written down if i were to put it back it's written down if i attempt in my mind to hold it back again it's written down if i decline from my thought it's written down nothing is excluded from the preserved tablet imagine how many trees there are in this on this earth and how many leaves down spirals to the ground every second everything is noted down in the preserved tablet about each and every leaf how it's going to fall down and what side it's going to be on the ground and how long it would take imagine a sandstorm in the sahara desert every certain specific grain of sand is recorded in the preserved tablet and the distance it should go and the trajectory and how it's going to be it is mind-blowing but this is allah's knowledge and this is the limit where we should stand and halt and say this is allah's other and we believe in it so knowledge writing it down divine will and we've covered this when you choose to pray the choice was yours but you would not have been able to do it had allah not given you the ability and power and guidance to choose it so your will is part of allah's will but you cannot complain and say allah will that i sin a man once was caught stealing so they took him to umar nu the righteous caliph and after investigating and looking into the evidences he said you stole what is not yours so we rule that we will amputate your hand which is a prescribed punishment for stealing so the man said o khalifa do you punish me for something allah has predestined 50 000 years so um was not fooled may allah be pleased with him with this tricky question and he said yes because allah predestined 50 000 years ago that we cut off your hand for stealing so it's all part of allah's destiny the divine will is one of the important topics but due to the fact that this course in apida is supposed to be very easy and it is for beginners i am reluctant in discussing it to you but generally speaking you will find it in my other videos inshallah and you insha allah would know it by yourself the divine will is divided into two types legislative and universal the legislative type refers to only what is recommended in sharia which allah loves so when allah says for example [Music] i have not created the jinn and the humans except to worship me so this is legislative will divine will why do we say legislative because there are so many gin and humans who did not worship allah so if allah willed that by creating the humans and the jinns that they would worship him and this did not happen how could that be this is legislative will things that allah loves they may happen and they may not happen but allah told us that he loves it and this is religion this is why it's legislative it is from religion the other type of divine will is the universal divine will meaning that the things that will happen regardless whether allah loves it or not so allah azzawajal legislatively ordered humans to follow islam there was abu bakr and there was abuja legislatively both were instructed by allah to follow islam when we come to the universal will we find that abu bakr followed the legislative will and hence allah azzawajal supported him and guided him in the universal will to become one of the greatest muslims in our ummah while abu jahl defied and went against the legislative will so the universal will coincided that he would become a kafir and he would be among the dwellers of hellfire it was his choice and allah chose that above him and facilitated that for him so this is what is meant by divine will everything that happens is by allah's will but is it the legislative will or universal will it depends on the action so if i pray maghrib prayer in the masjid have i fulfilled allah's legislative will the answer is yes because allah loves it have i fulfilled the universal will i say yes because i have prayed which means allah has made me pray if i were to pray isha prayer and i got my foot broken and i could not walk to the machine so the legislative will was fulfilled because i attempted to do something that allah loves but the universal will did not because allah azzawajal that i don't pray in the masjid whether he loves this or not this is something else but this is the universal will from this distinction we understand that when volcanoes happen when tornadoes take place when earthquakes when floodings take place all of these are allah's universal will we don't know what is the wisdom behind it but we know that it is coming from the one who knows the one who's fair the one who owns and possesses everything so we are content with that so these are the knowledge writing and divine will the final pillar of iman of al qaeda is the creation and this is essential because a lot of the deviant cults and sects said that allah does not create our sins we are the creators of our sins and they made themselves peers to allah partners to allah by creating their own action and we've said to stated that the is that allah is the creator of everything so when volcanoes take place allah created it when sins take place you chose it but allah created it even the idols that people worship allah created that as well it is essential because then we can understand what being allah is as the creator as the one with the divine will as the one who predestined everything in writing and in knowledge and if you manage to do this and find the content in your heart you will be the happiest man so we move on to the questions and we have fat he says is it an innovation that we should turn the lights on at the time of maghrib it's not an innovation this is a necessity for you to see because when it's night time if you keep on the lights off you'll bang your head and your leg in everything that is in your way so the norm is to turn on the lights now some people think that it is part of the sunnah to turn off the light when it is and this is not true the sunnah according to the long hadith is to turn your lanterns which is lit by lighting a fuse with fire so the prophet says when you go to bed make sure that you extinguish all types of fire and in another hadith he explains the reason when he tells us that the people when they go to bed and this happened in front of the prophet hassan as he was sitting with his companions a mouse with a thread in its mouth came running went to the fire lit that thread and ran to a place where there was cloth or blanket or whatever and started the fire so the prophet assam explained to us why we should kill mice whenever we see them even in the haram mice are horrible rodents that carry illnesses diseases pandemics and at the same time they're evil they are smart they corrupt things they destroy things and they would set a house on fire so this is the reason of turning off the lanterns or the uh um the fire whenever you are in night time so that the mouse would not let your house on fire uh michelle says can a woman use iron to remove hair from body parts answer is yes there's no problem and i always get this question from the subcontinent saying that their scholars tell them that removing the head of the arms or of the legs or of the pubic area or the underarm pit is not permissible using a blade and there is nothing wrong in that none whatsoever rasheed says in case of divorce by man there is a waiting period of three menstruation period but in case of hurler by a woman is there the same procedure as above or different please enlighten us in this regard this is an issue of dispute among scholars you see what he's asking about is known as and in all books of phil there is the book or the chapter of which is a plural of edda there is the of a divorced woman first and second divorce there is of the woman who is finally divorced the last and third divorce there is the idea of a widow there is a hidden of a one seeking there is the end of a concubine there is a of a child who did not reach puberty but was divorced and you can go on and you'll find that the differs from one case to the other so the first and second divorce the eighth day is three monthly cycles but if she's pregnant the idea is until she gives birth and if she has reached the age where she doesn't have any monthly cycles the monopoles she's 60 then her eight days three months instead of cycles and if she was divorced for the third time the edda is one monthly cycle and likewise if she filed for color her edda is the most as per the most authentic opinion of uh scholars is one monthly cycle why there isn't any prescribed or given answer for this scholars just figured it out it might be right it might be wrong they said that the first and second divorce that hidden period is three monthly cycles and the woman is prohibited from leaving the house her marital house and the husband is obliged to stay in the house how is that possible they're divorced yes but they are still in this transitional period where they're still man and wife if any of them were to die the other spouse would inherit the deceased so these three monthly cycles would act as a period where where they would revisit the possibility of staying together the vast majority of divorce cases take place at times of anger or rage and the vast majority of divorce cases are followed immediately by remorse and degrade so if we were to say to the couple who divorced to immediately separate they would rarely think about reconciling a man in his rage why are you disrespectful to me the woman is you're this you're that your mother always does this you're not a real man and he is boiling from inside and she is also boiling from inside because of the whispers she heard from her mother from her sister from her friends telling her that don't be soft and submissive be strong show him who you are so that he would fear you and at the same time the man hears these voices in his head she's accusing me of not being a man you're a woman you have to prove to her that you are a real man so when it reaches the right level he says okay i'm not a real man i divorce you you're divorced this bomb once it falls down it shatters both of them immediately from being enraged and disrespectful 180 degrees to crying and feeling weak and vulnerable you divorce me after all what i've been through with you after all the beautiful days and after all the love we had after all the children and she starts crying and he feels the gravity of what he had said and he's remorseful but she forced him to say this he claims and she says he forced me to be disrespectful because of what he had done in the past they're both remarkable if she packs up and her bags and goes to her parents house then most likely they're not gonna reconcile because both sides have human devils you're better off without him alhamdulillah he divorced you now you can be like a queen come to your father's house we will treat you like a queen we will give you we'll do this for you and his mother says you are better off she is ugly she's fat she's short she doesn't know how to cook i'll get you someone who is much beautiful much younger more religious and wealthier and she's right most likely and her parents are right what they don't know is that they both need one another but when the departure takes place this is when shaytan works allah says they are not to leave their homes and they are not to be taken out of their homes so what to do chef she lives in her home she sleeps in her bedroom you sleep next to her no kissing no intimacy no hanky-panky she wears whatever clothes she wants there is no hijab there is no aura and she cooks for you she cleans for you you buy groceries you go out with her no problem no intimacy now if this happens and she doesn't leave home ninety nine point nine percent after half an hour i get a call from the husband sheikh i divorced my wife and i'm regretful she's regretful you would like to get back what can we do maybe in worst case scenarios the following week but inevitably this would happen rarely you will find that three monthly cycles pass with them both living in the same house and not reconciling this is the reason of the iddah the one who's seeking hurler the one who's paying money and giving her dowry back to her husband to flee to run away from him she doesn't want him she hates his guts we don't expect the sharia to say stay in your home for three months maybe you'll reconcile no she doesn't want any so immediately once the horror is given she leaves the house and if she gets her menses the following day seven days later when she sees her purity she can get married and this is why this is the most authentic opinion because there is no point in delaying her getting married again after huller because there is no intention of reconciliation and allah knows best fahad says how to move index finger into shahood the sunna is to have the middle finger and the thumb making a circle and you make a fist with the pinky and the finger next to it and you point the index finger and you shake it in its place you don't go up and down and you don't do like summer brothers from africa doing circles like this you just simply point it to the end this is the most authentic opinion as described to us second question can we make any type of dua from the quran or and hadith in sujud of man mandatory prayers as well the answer is yes dua generally whether from the quran from the hadith or from anything else is permissible to be done in sujud without any problem whether this is your fault prayer or your nafel prayer and allah azza knows best then irish says how about me i marry to my husband he did not give me dowry or we don't have nikah it's okay the first part of the question is easy to answer if a man marries a woman the marriage is valid if it was by the proposal of her guardian in the presence of two muslim male witnesses and her consent and her consent as well now dowry is not a condition not a pillar of marriage so if the marriage took place without giving dowry the marriage is valid but the husband is sinful for not giving the dowry now what happens if they got married without calling or naming a dowry so her father says sheikh asam i give you my daughter in marriage i said i accept and there are two of my friends there and we leave can we consummate the marriage definitely but what about the dowry after a week i say um what about your dowry she said yeah okay give me five hundred thousand dollars what you crazy half a million dollars why so this is my doubt this is what i want i said well i was thinking of ten dollars ten dollars only she said what what do you think i am a pepsi can well so we have a dispute what to do very easy the judge the muslim judge looks into the average dowry the likes of her receiving her community so where she came from where we are in our community her average dowry is five thousand dollars so the share says you have to pay her five thousand dollars dundee this is the dowry part now your second part of the question or we don't have nikah i think you're asking that if we don't give a dowry or name a dowry is the marriage valid or not the answer is it is valid without any doubt maryam says i know hijab is mandatory by allah or commanded by allah but what about covering the face this is an issue of dispute and all scholars say that whenever there is fitnah then becomes manti whenever there is a possibility of men looking and seeing what they like and being lured or seduced by the face of a woman all scholars say that she has to cover her face now what is the ruling on nepal it's an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion for those who know me know that i've always stated that it is mandatory and that it is backed up by the quran by the sunnah and by pure logic all scholars say that a woman must cover her feet because her foot is aura so my foot my toes as a woman is aura and the majority of scholars agree upon that if not all of them so now you're telling me that covering the feet is more important than covering the face whenever someone wants to get married the first thing he looks at is a woman's face because it's the most charming and beautiful thing in a woman even if they tell her if they tell him that she her body figure is so and so and so and she has the body of a model a supermodel but she has a face of a gorilla nobody would marry her but if she had a beautiful comfortable face that fills your heart with peace and tranquility when you look at her that's a cause of marriage a reason to marry and this is why the prophet said that i said to the companion when he told him that he engaged to a woman he said to him did you look into in her eyes did you look to her face the man said no said go and look because the eyes of the ansar has something that may repel you from marrying her if the woman was not wearing danika why would the prophet ordered order us to look at the woman whom we are proposing to the prophet said if anyone wanted to marry a woman he should look at her to see what makes him drawn to her or attracted to her if women went by uncovered we don't need to go and look at them they're there in front of us so the most authentic opinion is that covering the face is mandatory and allah azzawajal knows best and finally waseem says i have a property which i've been thinking of building apartment with a builder however builders in india build according to vastu shastra which is a hindu equivalent of fing shui i did not understand to shatter to understand fing shui anyhow regardless of builder being muslim or not have no authority over it my question is is it permissible to partner in such project based on such concept will it lead to shirk or kuffer or is it permissible since i am not involved in performing vastu shastra according to wikipedia when i looked into this question it stated that vastu shastra is building the house and setting the foundation in accordance to the rulings of the hindus and the buddhists so they say what is the direction of the house the entrance what is the direction of the windows where the bedroom should be where the bathroom where the kitchen should be etc and if you defy these rulings death and calamities will take place the belief is totally bogus and ship it's fabricated it has nothing to do with islam nor with common sense or logic so one must not partner with someone who does this but if as you have described that there is no one at all willing to build according to normal engineering concepts without following this [Music] vastu shastra and you need to build a house and there's no one to build it except by following these rules insha allah as a necessity there's no problem for you as long as you do not believe in it and you abhor it and hate it with your heart and allah azza knows best this is all the time we have until we meet next thursday i'll leave you wassalamualaikum allah you"
