  "transcript": "Mackenzie from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum. So I always think I see like hair coming out from under my hijab during Salah even though I don't see any before I start the prayer so I try to feel for it and tuck it back in but can't tell if it's fully hidden or if there's any uh any out in the first place so sometimes I ignore it and when I go to check after Salah I find no hair out other times I find a few strands so if I don't ignore it and try to tuck it in during prayer I might I worry I might accidentally pull some strands out accidentally but if I ignore it and later find hair out I feel like my prayer is invalid and redo it because I thought I might have seen it and have just ignored it so what should I do you should act upon your gut feeling there is no easy way out of it you are an adult I'm not going to hold your hand and take you to the toilet to answer the call of nature these things you have to man up think of a speech and try to figure out what's right and what's wrong if you feel that satan is possessing you and confusing you with this particular issue so that you end up praying five times a day unable to find the sweetness of your prayer just because you're so worried about a strand or two coming out of your head this is insane shaitan is definitely having a blast and he's laughing his head off every day you pray if you come to pray and you look in the mirror you tuck your hijab everything is fine you go and pray khalas keep on praying until the end if a strand or two come out without intending it and you don't have knowledge of it your prayer is valid and Allah doesn't hold you accountable for what you cannot know of and would that would burden you"
