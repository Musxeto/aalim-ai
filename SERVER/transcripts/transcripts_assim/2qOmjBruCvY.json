  "transcript": "Safiyyah from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh My question is when you go to the Masjid and the Imam is reading the prayers like Maghreb, Isha, Fajr and he reads the surahs aloud and the surah that he is reading you know it. Are you allowed to under your breath recite the surah with the Imam? Allah Azza Wa Jal said to his messenger Muhammad Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam Oh Muhammad do not move your tongue while you're learning and hearing the Quran so that it would be faster for you to learn it. And also Allah says in Surah Al-A'raf Chapter 7 that whenever the Quran is being recited and this is referring to Salat whether it's Maghreb, Isha or Fajr whenever the Imam is reciting the Quran listen to it and adhere which means that you're not allowed to repeat with the Imam when he's reciting if you know the surah just keep your lips sealed and listen and ponder May Allah Azza Wa Jal accept from all of us. Ameen."
