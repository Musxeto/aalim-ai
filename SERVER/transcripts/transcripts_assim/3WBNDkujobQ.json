  "title": "Tajweed: Ashhadu (an laa) OR (alla) ilaha illa Allah? Which pronunciation is correct Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "muhammad from the u.s he has a confusion and a lot of the muslims have this similar confusion who are non-arabs why what he's referring to is an issue of tajweed so when we write we say ash hadu i testify and la ilaha illallah other than allah so the article or the proposition or whatever you call it and that which means that followed by a la negation uh uh article in writing we write it an separate word la separate word when we say it we have something called idram idram is when a silent nun we call it the nunus is followed by one of the six letters combined in the word yet so that el the lamb and the ra are of the little uh uh um words from the word the letters from this word so we don't say ash no we combine the n with the l because they're so close so we say we say ash instead of an la so if i said both ways no problem it doesn't impact your salat idram if you drop it your prayer is valid your recitation of the quran is valid tajweed is not mandatory it is not wagib it is recommended so if you skip it intentionally or unintentionally no problem at all you"
