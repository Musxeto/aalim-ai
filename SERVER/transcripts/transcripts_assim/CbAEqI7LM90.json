  "transcript": "sad man from bangladesh is asking about sheikh rabir al-madkhali which is very very inappropriate to do it is impolite it is inappropriate for someone to ask someone like me on live television about a well-renowned known chef whether we agree with what he says or not it is inappropriate it is out of etiquette manner ethics where is the respect of scholars when you come and ask a question like this so this is what i always tell people be uh um i wouldn't use the word yeah maybe polite be polite be wise in the questions you ask don't ask a sheikh and say to him so and so says something and you say against it what's the ruling on that may allah have mercy on his soul used to be furious when someone asks him like this and he says if you ask someone else why come and ask me and if you know who sheikh rabir is why do you come and ask people like me he's a well-renowned scholar he has his contribution he was praised by shaykh and basman athemin and also he has his own flaws and shortcomings like everybody else so it is inappropriate totally to ask such a question but unfortunately there are people with illnesses in their hearts that they frequently try to hit few birds with one stone so if they can't score a point here and score a point there tarnish the reputation of this one or of that one label this person of being hisby or this person of being murji or being khawaris or etc they like to play such a dirty filthy game which is totally inappropriate for a muslim who does not have a hidden agenda who does not play politics like many people do may allah protect us"
