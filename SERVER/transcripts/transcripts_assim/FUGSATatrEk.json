  "transcript": "Ibrahim from the Netherlands. Hello. Yes. Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum. Sheikh, I'm a big fan. May Allah promote you. Promote me too. Yes, you know. Promote me to an air conditioner. You know the drill. What can I do for you? Yeah, I know the drill. First of all, I would like to shout out to my cousins Adil, Hiba, and Ibrahim, Yusuf, and Abdullah. It was a really big request. So, anyways, let's proceed to my question, okay? Okay. I hope you're not going to ask for a song afterwards. No, no. Okay. Sheikh, so basically, it's been like nine months since I'm in India, and one thing that I've noticed over here is that almost 98% of the mosques over here, they delay the Salah for about like two hours, one and a half hours, like that. Like, for example, let's say, take Duhur, okay? Basically, Duhur must be like prayed at 12.30, but they delay it up to 2.00 p.m. I understand, Ibrahim. I understand. So, what is your question? They're Hanafi. Yes, so like, what's the solution to it? Okay, the solution is that you must pray in the masjids with them, though they delay the Duhur, and the Asr, and sometimes Fajr, but they still pray it within the parameters of the prayer. You know, every prayer has a beginning and the end. Their beginning is a bit twisted and late, unlike the other three schools of thought. And they're fixed on it. They don't want to follow the Sunnah. This is up to them. But as long as they pray within the accepted timing of the Salat, you have to pray with them in the masjid. If they delay it way off, in this case, no. So, for example, Duhur starts at 12.15 and Asr starts at 3.30. If they delay Duhur Adhan to 3.30, now this is not permissible for you to pray with them, because the time is expired. You have to pray on your own in your home. But if they offer the Adhan at 2 o'clock, so it's still an hour and 30 minutes before Asr, then you have to pray with them so that you would not miss the congregation, and Allah Azzawajal knows best. But of course, if you can go to Ahlul Hadith masjid, who pray on actual times according to the Sunnah, that would be a win-win, and Allah Azzawajal knows best."
