  "transcript": "I think I need a mouth guard just to protect myself very dangerous my old my old age these teeth are very expensive so what was the title What's the title of shift case so we're talking about the importance of mental health and the health of the brain the heart and these psychological things and the psychiatric aspects of it needs an expert I'm not an expert in this I'm not a sh I'm not a psychiatrist but what I know is Islam so in Islam we know that Allah says in the Quran the day when there will not benefit anyone wealth or children but only one who comes to Allah with a sound heart all what you have will not benefit you back accounts cars real estates children wives it's not going to benefit you the only thing that's going to benefit you on the day of judgment is what your heart now the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam told us and theith is Muslim Allah does not look at our bodies nor our wealth rather Allah looks at our hearts and our Deeds this is what Allah will hold us accountable for so our hearts again is a priority in our lives to purify them to cleanse them to ensure that our hearts are healthy purifying the heart is the message the core message of prophets of Allah all of them MSA said to Pharaoh M said and say to him would you be willing to purify yourself and this purification is not something that you can attain without Allah's will so you can be rich you can be healthy you can be wealthy you can be influential but all of these factors are a gift from Allah Allah gives this D to whom he loves and Those whom he doesn't love so many times we look at the richest man in the world he's a cafir why did Allah give him this we look at the strongest man in the world he's a cafir Subhan Allah all these muscles all this power we look at other European countries cafer countries they're handsome beautiful healthy wealthy everything is going for them why this is Allah's we he gives D he gives health and wealth to whom he loves and those whom he doesn't love but be certain that Allah only gives IM only gives Islam only gives purification of the heart to those he whom he loves you are among the luckiest on Earth because you are gathered in a Masjid to listen things that may get you closer to Allah things that may change your life and admit you to jna things that may open your eyes and save you from Hellfire how did this happen oh I chose to come no Allah guided you to come because there are thousands and hundreds and tens of people who fail to come and they instead are watching a football match or a tennis match or a movie or listening to music or sitting idle home so they've lost this opportunity so this is a gift from Allah to you this purification of the heart comes only from Allah who says and if not for the favor of Allah upon you and his Mercy one of you have been pever but Allah purifies whom he Wills so if Allah purifies your heart Allah has chosen you the most that corrupts our hearts is what sins these sins tarnish our souls and hearts makes them black makes them Allah says no rather the St has covered their hearts of that which they were earning these stains come from our sins and there is no Prosperity on life on Earth there is no progress there is no success except for those who purify their souls and hearts Allah says he has certainly succeeded who purifies himself but how do we purify ourselves purifying yourself requires a lot of work likewise you want to go and build a healthy body you eat well and you work out you cannot simply sit on your backside like I used to do and bring someone from the Far East you know a driver or a janitor or you know someone to to serve in the house and I take him to the gym I let him work for 2 hours sweat then I take a shower alhamdulillah I rest huh do I have muscles he was the one who's working out yeah but I paid for it will I grow any muscles no to purify yourself you have to work hard how to do this first of all you have to cleanse your heart from anything that may negatively impact it such as oh there are a whole list showing off arrogance Pride hatred enmity Envy anger stinginess being a coward all of these tarnish Your Heart Makes You the worst of the worst unfortunately lots of us Muslims may have these things and some of us may have all of these things you Muslims around you whom you say whoa this guy this dude is bad news I'm not getting close to him why he's really bad and this person whom everyone else Aid he is in real danger because he'll come on the day of judgment he doesn't have anything what does he have to show up for nothing he filled his heart with everything bad he's always envious giving people evil eye he's always holding a grudge against each and everyone he always has negativity filling the air around him so this person needs to purify his heart if he eliminates these negative feelings and bad things then that was step one there is step two then he has to fill his heart with good things that would make his heart shine and resonate so such as sincerity such as generosity such as truthfulness honesty humbleness returning back to Allah the fear of Allah the knowledge of Allah's beautiful names and attributes if you don't fill up your heart with knowing Allah you're the most ignorant person on Earth how many names of Allah do you know oh Allah has 99 Names okay this is the Hadith whoever knows the mean imp them and uh uh um apply them he will enter Jenna how many names of Allah do you know uh 10 maybe 15 mallah how many of these 10 or 15 names do you do you know the Nam the meaning no I know the names right I don't know what means I don't know what is I don't know what is I know but maybe I know two or three so how do you want to enter jna rather how do you even enjoy Salat when you say Allah abbar and your head is roaming all over the universe except the Salat you're praying if I ask you what did the IM recite in the first Surah in the first good you a good student people don't know I've asked this question once in a mid full of worshippers full and none of them could find the answer why because it was they take time 20 minutes later the Salah was so they could not know what the IM recited in the first Sak get it hopefully so we have a value we know Islam only on the surface the Islam we know how how many for how many for when should we prostrate for does this nullify my Salah is my all of this is what you know about Salah about Islam the essence of Islam how to get closer to Allah how to enslave yourself to Allah how to allow the and the to be your guide whatever Allah says whatever the prophet says he's my tutor my leader he is the one I follow my role model we don't have this in US this is why we only choose and pick from Islam what we like what we enjoy I enjoy having a long beard why because whenever there's a raw or a line and I come to oh uncle uncle come so I come to the first of the special needs no this is why I like a big beard but when people come and say we need charity for an orphanage I forgot my wallet sorry but you have a big yes yes but I don't have a big wallet so we have a problem we have to know have we purified ourselves have we cleansed our hearts have we filled it with feelings that will get us closer to Allah how would we know we would know by the amount of psychological and mental illnesses we have H interesting do you mean that a Muslim does not have a mental illness generally speaking yes all those who study psychology and their atrist don't sue me and wait because they hate this generally speaking yes to an extent Allah says in the Quran those who have believed and whose hearts are assured by the remembrance of Allah unquestionably by the remembrance of Allah hearts are assured now we have so many illnesses mental illnesses available on the market and this is why you go to any psychiatrist even if you're a good person they'll say you're bipolar you have schizophrenia you have borderline disorder you have depression you have this you have that the least they would say you're autistic you have autism she I'm 60 years old yeah yeah you have minor case of autism and you feel that W I'm I'm not alive this is what the n Muslim psychiatrists would usually do that's why we say you have a mental illness do not go except to a Muslim psychiatrist he fears Allah and he knows how to diagnose you and he knows what is best for you but you go to any Tom di harak gives you uh pills that would make you addicted to them and make you hysterical would make you par paranoid and this is a big problem in Islam Quran and Sunnah what are the basic mental illnesses that we would like to address we have grief and we have worries in Arabic we say Al the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam and this is part of the morning and evening AAR part of the morning and evening AAR which means that you have to say them in the evening and the morning every day many narrations this Hadith by itself would require a lecture but the first part of it is what concerns us oh Allah I seek Refuge with you from and grief this is a mental illness wor is something that took place in will take place in the future is something that took place in the past and this is what kills you from the inside the death of a loved one you can't get over it oh my father died my when 5 years ago okay so I can't get over it I always cry I always uh I always suffer I always say why why why this is grief grief of a mistake you've done grief over an opportunity that you've LED so it keeps on itching and eating you from the side if you don't treat it it will devastate you worries are something coming in the future and we have lots and lots of things to worry about how am I going to pay the rent next month how am I going to take care of a new job they give me one month notice how am I going to get married I'm getting married in 5 six months time how is going how it's going to be my children my risk my parents my sick relatives BL things that I worry about so when you seek refuge in Allah then you know that Allah will take care of it so you surrender to Allah's power and might and you're the happiest man on Earth when you depend on your intellect when you depend on your strength when you depend on your knowledge or your certificate or those you know you're the worst and the most vulnerable because this is when shaan will Attack you left right and Center also part of the mental illnesses Whispers of Shan does shatan whisper to us yes or no is anyone Exempted from The Whispers of shatan not a single one of us because this is the job description of Shan in his job description if you go to LinkedIn you will find that part of it is to deviate the Muslims from the straight path and to join and combine and recruit as many as he can in Hellfire this is the only thing he wants what does he want you to be with him in hell now depending on First Class business or economy he wants you to be in hell it doesn't matter even next to the shoes outside in the door gate is okay Enter Mission Accomplished how there are traps of Shan there's a lecture I did in Canada or somewhere I don't know where it's called the traps of Shan watch it on YouTube it's free and you will find how he attacks each and every one of us Allah says in the Quran indeed those who Fe fear Allah wow those who fear Allah Allah says when an Impulse touches from uh them from shaan they remember Allah and at once they have Insight which means each and everyone has this moment of weakness we get intrusive thoughts that attack us day and night depending on your IM I have counseling sessions paid of course I have to become rich so people come to me complaining for intrusive thoughts and each and every one of them very in in some of the righteous people get intrusive thoughts for 5 seconds and it's gone some of them get sit for 5 days it's killing them some of them get it for 5 years they're devastated they're lost so Shan looks at the strength of your Iman and he gives you these intrusive thoughts in these impulse touches and this is why Allah says and say my I seek Refuge from the incitements of the devils and I seek refuge in my Lord lest they present with me so they come and overwhelm us sometimes when we are most vulnerable and weak and this is why this is the right time when you should put your trust in Allah when you should Depend and rely on Allah only then you will be able to Prevail and succeed among the mental illnesses that are prevailing among the Muslims is despair a lot of the Muslims come to me in despair why did Allah do this why did Allah take the one I love why did Allah make me lose my job why did Allah put so much that on me I said you're coming to the wrong man why are you asking me this is Allah's Calamity and test for you and by the way I see it you failed miserably said but why said I don't know I don't care who could say to Allah why Allah says in the Quran asks Allah why do you do this rather all of you be questioned so despair is the tag name the definition of lack of trust in Allah it is the definition of thinking negatively of Allah ever despair no Prophet yunus three times his name comes to be thrown off the boat he's a prophet first time no no you're prophet of Allah how can you throw you but the the the the the storm is heavy and the whole boat will uh uh cap size or or or drown if we don't throw someone number two his name number three his name they threw him and he was swollen by the whale if a whale swollen me what are you going to do uh can I go to the Executive Club please this is a whale and he stayed in the belly of the whale for three days and three nights what did he do nothing else confessing who Allah is and of his own FLA and shortcomings what happened with these positive thoughts and ideology and Vibes Allah saved him and made him better than he was before this is what takes you out of Despair this is what takes you out of your depression and this despair happens either because Allah took a a favor a blessing away from you or tested you with a Calamity or something that is evil Allah says and if we give man A Taste of Mercy from us and then we withdraw it from him indeed he is despairing and ungrateful how many years Allah Asel had made you walk on your feet how many years Allah has blessed you with health and wealth the ability to see the ability to hear the ability to eat and when Allah tests you with little things you're ungrateful and you despairing of Allah's Mercy fear Allah and also if an evil thing happens to you Allah says and when we bestow favor upon the disbeliever he turns away and distances himself Allah gives him money he gives him wealth he turns away this is my own earning my own doing then Allah says and when evil touches him he is ever despairing so this is a yes to despair from Allah's Mercy there is no exit and there is no Lifeline from despair except by believing and trusting in Allah Allah says and Allah will save those who feared him by their attainment no evil will touch them nor will they gri among the mental illnesses that a lot of the Muslims have today is fear fear of What Fear of Everything the fear of death the fear of Scandal the fear of losing risk and wealth the fear of the future so many people come to me and say she I'm afraid of dying a brother came to me once and in a counseling session and he said sh I have this fear of death to the extent that my wife divorced me I lost half of my weight my job is threatening me of sacking me because of my poor performance and the sad thing is I haven't prayed for 20 days why you said I'm afraid to go to the toilet to have and I don't know sh I I don't know what to do so I said to him how long you had this fear he said Fe years say Subhan Allah and did you die excuse me I said you had this fear for 3 years did you die he said of course not sh I'm talking to you said then who's stupid you three years you're afraid of death and you didn't die what happens if this extends to another 15 years what will you do back in the streets please give me food I'm gonna die soon this is crazy look what is doing to you verily this is Satan intimidating you with his soldiers you should not fear them rather fear but this is the fear of death that does to you fear can be crippling and negative as in this case but it can be positive how if you fear death what are you going to do about it do good deeds so when death comes I'm ready I have nothing to fear I'm waiting for death to come so that I could meet my Lord I could meet my good reps in in the Grove I can beat Allah I'm happy to die because I have good deeds but when your fear is negative it cripples you the fear of Scandal you reap what you saw you had illicit Haram relationships who did it who did it so now you repent it good for you you started doing good de masallah keep up the good work but I'm I'm terrified of what I want to get married but I'm afraid I will be exposed to everyone because of my previous sins and this fear is crippling me trust Allah and if anything would surface this is a test from Allah you did it and these are the consequences of your actions but you should not let them deprive you and deter you from moving on you conceal my sins but if Allah did not conceal your sins be mad and face your consequences but if they do not show up The Graces from Allah the fear of you're working in a supermarket and you're selling pork alcohol and cigarettes"
