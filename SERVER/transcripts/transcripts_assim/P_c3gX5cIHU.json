  "title": "Can we pray Friday prayer at home with our family(during Coronavirus COVID-19 lockdown) Assimalhakee",
  "transcript": "Mortman says since the corona virus pandemic we are praying at home what must be done about Friday prayers can we give a small hood bah that is a sermon and pray Friday prayer at home with our family this is a controversial issue because now we are in a situation that was unprecedented meaning we don't recall any event in history that resembles it the whole world is almost in a lockdown and so many countries have not prayed Juma for three and some two four four weeks in a row so we get Muslims coming and complaining isn't this taking us out of the fold of Islam the answer is No why isn't three Fridays consecutively being missed something that is a serious offence in and slammed answer is yes the Prophet said Alice or some whoever misses three consecutive Friday's three Fridays in a row Allah will seal his heart but this hadith was referring to someone who is doing this out of his laziness out of his own will we are compelled not to pray Friday and this is what the authorities asked us to do for a short period of time until this crisis is over and I pray to Allah that it is over soon so this hadith does not refer to us but what is the ruling can we pray Friday home it's an issue that scholars differed due to the fact that some schools of thought require the permission of the Muslim ruler to conduct a Friday some schools of thought say that no Friday is accepted in normal cases unless the Imam delegates it so the Muslim ruler is the one who delegates other hundreds or thousands of messages in his country to pray jun-hwan to pray Friday and some schools of thought even don't consider what they pray in the masjid as friday and this is why they pray for rock has Laur individually afterwards and this is all wrong so the permission of the Muslim ruler is essential to some others say that the Masjid is essential you cannot pray at workplaces or at homes so it's an issue of dispute what seems to me to be closer to the truth and I don't pretend or claim that it is the truth is that in Muslim countries where the ruler is a Muslim if he says no prayer to be conducted in the Masjid then you cannot presume one you have to pray normal for in your homes because his permission is required and the essence of Joomla is congregation so if this is not there if four or five people pray in their homes in patches this does not fulfill the purpose of Jamaat but if you are in a kafir country where the ruler is not a Muslim and his permission to conduct Joomla or a Friday prayer is not required in this case it seems to me this is my own personal opinion it can easily be wrong it seems to me as long as you are confined to your home and you are three men or above then you can conduct a Friday khutba a Friday prayer in your home where one of you would be the Imam giving two sermons and then conducting the prayer and a lot of JAL knows best"
