  "transcript": "Burhan from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullah Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh I have a question like on the social media what's happening right now Is it allowed for the woman to speak publicly? Okay, we've said this so many many times Regardless of what's happening in the world Women speaking publicly Whether it's politicians or for da'wah Or for a press release or for an interview This all defies the purpose of the hijab And if you were to go back to the time of the best of generations ever And that is the time of the Prophet Alayhi Salaam And the companions You would find that the most intellectual and smart And highly decorated women on earth Such as mother Aisha, mother Hafsa And the wives of the Prophet Alayhi Salaam Had never ever talked publicly Though they far exceed in knowledge, in intellect, in eloquence They far exceed the vast majority of men among the companions Yet they've never delivered a lecture or a speech in the masjid Though they are the mothers of all those attending They can never marry them They are the mothers of the believers So how would it be possible for a woman Putting makeup and foundation on her face And maskara, or they call it maskara And the whole nine yards to come Slight lipstick, not a lot To come in a lecture which is videotaped And the camera is on her face With a zoom in, zoom out And she speaks and sometimes becomes emotional And sometimes she cracks jokes And the men are looking at that What kind of a dawah is this? So this is totally out of the question in Islam Other religions, it might be good But not in our religion and Allah knows best"
