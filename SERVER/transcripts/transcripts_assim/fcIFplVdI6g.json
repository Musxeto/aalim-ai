  "transcript": "a sister says is PDA and that is public display of affection allowed in Islam like a married couple holding hands while walking in public or sitting really close together when others are around but is the intention when a Muslim shows his affection to his Halal wife in public what is the intention one would claim oh to show his spouse his affection and love and compassion this is unheard of in Islam you want to show your affection and compassion and love and mercy get a room why do it in public this is not for showing your affection this is wanting to show off to have others look at you and say oh how cute how nice this is not manly your manners should be better than to show such affection in public first of all because it's not for the sake of Allah nor to show your spouse that you love her you could have done that 23 hours and 50 minutes a day not necessarily this 10 particular minutes so to hold back all of these emotions and have this Surge and flood of affection in public give me a break seriously get a room this is not part of the etiquettes and the modesty of Muslims to show such affection in public and Allah Knows Best foreign"
