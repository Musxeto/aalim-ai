  "transcript": "well in this case as long as you do not know as long as you're not sure in this case you have no accountability upon you in a sense that even if you were in a Muslim country and a couple come and they want to rent your apartment you say ok they're Muslims we're animals in country it's ok someone would say ok how do you know that it is ok how do you know that they would not have mixed parties how do you know that you do how do you know that they would not do harm think in it as long as you don't know you don't have proof then it is permissible Allah did not tell us to jump into people's chests and investigate Allah told us to judge whatever appears to us so if someone comes and rents the house and there's no need for me there's no indication for me that he would use it for something that's Haram it is permissible for me to rent it to them and Allah knows best"
