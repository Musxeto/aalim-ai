  "transcript": "assalamu alaikum and welcome to another edition of with the Prophet I'm Ali Coleman of your hosts and we are here with our guest from Saudi Arabia Sheikh Azam al Hakim assalamu alaikum and welcome Wadi from sanam la greca is definitely for having me yeah our pleasure to have you with us as we continue our discussion on various ways that we and our relationship with with the people around us should be with the Prophet this is the whole idea of the show looking at the Sunda looking for ways to be with the Prophet in our lives we have previously talked about various relationships at the Prophet peace be upon him had with people in his family his wives his kids grandkids today we're gonna be focusing on kids in general those people who did not have blood kinship to him but would nevertheless around him the kids of the Companions and others and what were the interactions that the Prophet had with these children without a doubt the Prophet of Islam peace be upon him is the ultimate role model and should be the ultimate role model for Muslims for all time the times that we live in it's typically sports figures in various kinds of entertainers unfortunately even among Muslims but we should we should know that we have the supreme example and we can use this for a role model for ourselves as well as for our children let's start from the foundation from the ground up a very basic and simple question why is it important for any society any nation to get it right when it comes to raising our kids so not amenable Haman Haman I mean I mean nabina muhammad invalid he asabi remain we all know that a community a nation a country is built on a foundation and this foundation is the population the people themselves so you can't have a nation without people and the quality of the people is what makes it or breaks it so if you have a bunch of lazy folks uneducated not willing to work you're gonna have a lousy nation hmm but if you have a nation that is populated with enthusiastic people yes well educated wanting to make a change in a difference then you will have victory and glory and this is why the prophet alayhi salaatu sam highlighted the importance of the children in our society to the extent that he himself saw Allah Arianna Salem said he is not from among us who does not respect the elders and have mercy over the youngsters so now the Prophet I racism is making us in the middle mmm there's always someone who's older than you you have to respect him yeah and there's always someone who's younger than you you have to have mercy for upon them because this type of dealing with the children will make them grow up to be merciful to other children if you abuse them if you misbehave or mistreat them the all or what they will have when they recollect their youth heard and when they were young was to abuse other children yeah as well I you know there are so many things that are contrary to the way we live that the Prophet himself peace be upon him did for example we know that he was respectful towards children we in our times we have a double standard when it comes to giving greetings peaceful greetings to two people we are careful to acknowledge the presence of adults but we readily unfortunately ignore children is that true and why is that and what was the prophet's approach to greeting and giving Salam to children well this is unfortunately true to an extent okay now the prophet alayhi salaatu as we have studied before and said it so many times he is the role model that Allah instructed us in the Quran to follow so the Allah tells us in the Quran that you have a great role model to follow and that is the Prophet Allah solution if you want the benefits in this life in the Hereafter now he was a fully accomplished person he was the perfect human being in a sense that he was the leader he was the ruler he was the Imam he was the teacher he was the companion he was everything you could dream of and when you look at him when it comes to children mm-hmm you would find that he allocated a lot of love and respect to the children and a thematic says may Allah be pleased with him I was once playing with the boys and the Prophet al-islam passed by us so children playing and they're having fun and the Prophet is walking by RA salat wa salam if he were to walk he would not have been noticed and no one would be angry with him mm-hmm for not giving Salam or for not treating us but not the Prophet isosa and it says that whenever the Prophet walked by he would pose stop and give each one of us Salam now what impact does this action have on children for playing around they would have a lot of respect because when you give respect you get respect yeah that's right so the Prophet is awesome is not ignoring them he is going out of his way to greet them and to show them that you guys though you're young and you children you have a position in Islam and in life you have your own status and weight so don't think of yourself lightly yeah so this is the message that the Prophet was giving to the children at I saw Sarah but better more the message is for us who are old and mature how to treat the children from now on so do not neglect them even if they're not your own do not ignore them show them the amount of respect maybe yes maybe you will pass by them you give them Salam and maybe you will not get a proper reply no problem hmm you're investing yeah yeah and they'll remember it even if they do the wrong thing in that time they'll file it into their memories and it may come to impact their lives positively in the future I'd like to ask you you were talking about the kids playing some parents don't see that it's their job to have close relationship with their kids and to play with them they have this concept that it has to be a like a corporate organization or military organization I'm the general and you're the the subordinates and it's a very dictatorial others fault as we discussed previously about grand grand children fault on the side of being too lenient that I wouldn't be a loving parent if I don't give them what they want and so the delicate balance to be made to be struck between these two extremes what was the approach of the Prophet in this regard and just generally if you'd like to talk about catering to the desires and needs of the children having order developing a relationship with them the the professional therapist these days they give us a formula they say if you give your kids a bunch of rules you don't develop a relationship with them you're gonna develop a rebel rules no relationship equals a rebel all right and so what we're talking about here is having the relationship and the example of the Prophet in this regard Lama solution the Prophet at least a lot was said invested a lot but again this was not something that he was making up or something that he was faking it on the contrary this was his nature so when you blend both together you got you get the perfect human being the prophet aerosol serum had objectives his objectives were to up bring the children who will be tomorrow's men in a way that would give them confidence and at the same time not to allow them to cross the red lines so in so many hadith my modem novella beer for example a five year toddler five your kid he says I remember only from the Prophet era so son because this is child that once he was performing woudl and I was within his vicinity he filled his mouth with with water and spirit right into my face you know what when you play with children yeah and you just put right motor into their face and he said he laughed and I laughed the Prophet I saw Sam played with this youngster mm-hmm so there was this interaction showing him that listen we're not that far apart I'm an old man you know a newer youngster but I have a lot of love and compassion for you he used to play with them a lot he used to bleat them whenever he used to see them he used to tell them I love you again in one hadith it stated that whenever the Prophet are some so the families the women and the children coming he would stop and say by Allah I love you the people of Medina by Allah I love you people of Medina by Allah I love you new people of the Medina expressing it publicly showing to them he affection means that this child would grow up with a lot to give because he was on the receiving end now if you treat your child like in a corporate organization or like a subordinate he will grow up to deal with others and maybe with his own parent parents who grow up old he would deal with them in the same fashion but this does not mean that it's a carte blanche do whatever you do because you're a child there are limits yeah and the prophetess Sam used to show the children how to be responsible so whenever a child did something wrong the Prophet would correct it al a sort of ceremony nowadays we don't have this his son-in-law Homer that is his stepson the son of umm Salama Umar even a bissalameh' or humble even a visa Lama narrates that he was eating when he was a child with the Prophet arezzo salaam and like all children they jump around and eat from the whole plate or dish because they ate from the same plate all together so the Prophet is some advise them in a very beautiful fashion he said yahudim Oh son Oh young boy say bismillah so the first thing don't jump to the food you have to learn that before you eat something you say bismillah eat with your right hand meaning that eating with your left hand is totally prohibited in Islam and eat from whatever is in front of you and don't invade other people's privacy and their own space by eating from in front of it so when you look at this you find that the Prophet erestrum is striking the right balance give unconditional love give your affection publicly show the people what you have for them the children that is but at the same time if they make a mistake you have to correct them you have to teach them you have to tell them in a proper grade we are ready for our break Shaykh will come back to continue our discussion show assalamu alaikum and welcome back to with the Prophet we are discussing the relationship that the prophet of islam salallahu alaihe salam had with children around him who were not his blood kins kinsfolk I'd like to ask you a Shaykh Shaykh Azam about a very important a growth and development topic when it comes to children you know there are a number of very important social skills that they have to learn how to cooperate how to work as a part of a team and the subject of competition is what I'm trying to get to there's a right and a wrong way to compete for kids to learn how to compete and a spirit of sportsmanship has to be developed kids have to learn how to not win and to celebrate the success of their fellow competitors that's something that takes practice and so my question here is about the what we can take examples we can we can take in this regard celebrating the success of those competing against you for the purpose of discovering and developing talents there all kinds of competitions nowadays athletic academic quran competitions so on and so forth what what about the Prophet on this subject well the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam used to encourage such competitions in the hadith he used to gather his cousins Abdullah obey the law the sons of his uncle ambassador Ogden ma Talib and others he and he would set a line for them to line up at and then he goes far away from them and he gives them incentives whoever races and wins I will give him so-and-so hmm and the hadith tells us that they raced towards the Prophet as Salam and once they reached him he embraced them and he kissed them which shows that the profit system also kisses youngsters and and and and boys that of that age and there's nothing wrong in that unlike nowadays anything you do with be considered to be molestation and and in the light which is way out of proportion kids have to have affection they have to have these feelings and the Prophet as Salam also used to conduct races on horseback okay he used to endorse wrestling between the companions so that this would strengthen them prepare them for a war when needed and to make them feel the beauty of winning and taste the bitterness of losing so that they would compete better and evolve more mmm good eye you just mentioned again physical affection there are numerous studies that we can point to now modern in modern times psychosocial studies demonstrating even in medical science that there are benefits in the health of the patient when the healer has uses physical touch and in the classroom same thing we have valid studies evidence showing that when teachers employ this their caressing or scrote stroking using physical affection along with the education the performance goes up in the students I think the Prophet Solo salams understood this he was not shy to love and to be affectionate physically towards not only his children and grandchildren of course but also to those around him who were not his family to persons correct the Prophet s son would do this but we have to be careful the time of the Prophet our son with pure heart and sincere Islam is different than our times mhm so one may cross the line if he allows a teacher to have such physical contact with children unless he's married and he is well behaved and he's well known we cannot expand this and open it without any limitation but at the same time we cannot restrict it to be no touch relationship there are a hadith where the Prophet array so it was salam kissed young companions there are a hadith where the prophet alayhi salat wa salam joked with youngsters and children where he stroked their heads and recommended doing this as in the case of orphans mhm so there are a lot of evidences that support such medical researches and psychiatric papers but again we take Islam to control and govern everything else not the other way around so we don't need these scientific theories and and reports to back the way we practice our religion because maybe in 10 years time there will be another paper condemning it or saying something against it so we will not have our Islam our religion a place where it can be scrutinized by a paper given by a psychiatrist or by a scientist what about Omar ibn al Khattab he held the children view him see when we said that the Prophet Isis Salam whenever he passed by the children playing he would stop and give Salam to them and embrace them and they loved it because this was the figure of the Prophet or a sorcerer Allah described him in the Quran that he was merely sent as a mercy to the jinn and to the humans to the whole world's so he is a mercy Allah saw to some this is him you cannot help but sense this mercy even if you're a child Oh madam in hot tub may Allah be pleased with him he's the second-seeded person in Islam so Abu Bakr is the first one to enter paradise Roman hot Bob is the second man in Islam in terms of importance in terms of closeness to the Prophet I figure in Islam mmm that's why he's buried next to the Prophet Aslam alongside with Abu Bakr only Abu Bakr and Umar are buried with the Prophet is hola Salaam having said that he was well known to be strong in religion a man of a very strong will serious dead serious would never tolerate injustice would never overlook any form of transgression or oppression so it was well known you make a mistake you're gonna pay for it so he had a reputation and he was known for being is it fair to say Stern I wouldn't go that far because you have to remember he's the second seat he is kind loving caring the Prophet loved him the most after Abu Bakr such a person can't be described as as such but you can say that he was perceived as being strict okay serious and so the kids were and this is why in what incident it was reported that he passed by a group of children playing mm-hmm now once they saw him they did not react in the same way that they reacted when they saw the Prophet erase Ostrom at that time so they all ran away from his way except one boy who was like in his 11 years of age 10 years of age and this boy was Abdullah even his obey terminal I want hmm his mother was this mad bint ABI buck so his aunt was Aisha the mother of the believers his father was a zoo baron and how Wham the cousin of the Prophet are a solo sir whose mother was Sofia the aunt of the professor and one of the ten heaven bound companions so he was a man in a sense that he was ten years of age but he was a man he did not run away so out of curiosity I might asked him why didn't you run away with your companions with your friends he said why should I run away I didn't do anything wrong to be afraid of you and the road is not narrow so that I can leave space for you it's so big and white so Umar was astonished and he was happy with such a response the the thing is for the punchline is look how the children treated the Prophet as Salam and how they treated amar may Allah be pleased with him not that Omar was wrong but the nature of the Prophet is awesome the holistic mercy kindness and love that he had was overwhelming while what was overwhelming with Omar though he had these same emotions and and and and feelings but what he was perceived as to be a tough strict ruler mm-hmm you know the subject of orphans as we run out of time in this episode it's a big subject of course we all have time to fully explore it but there are many causes for it terminal illness war forbidden relationships divorce all these things create orphans they will always be with us they always have been and we as Muslims of course have an obligation to care for their needs sometimes they may lose the father both parents may be the extended family is absent or feckless for some reason what's your advice about dealing with orphans there is a hadith or a number of hadith where the Prophet tells us a less thought was I am on the day of judgment the orphan provider or the person who sponsors an orphan and I I like this on the day of judgment in paradise meaning that that we're so close to one another because of what he had done for doing what for sponsoring and taking care of an orphan the definition of orphan in Islam yeah is a person whose father has died before the age of puberty so once the orphan reaches the age of puberty he's not an orphan and who can be if his mother died and his father Sarah live he's not an orphan so the main provider for him is his father who if he did not have him he would be called is that for male both girls and boys if they lost their father they're considered to be orphan in Islam Islam highlights the importance of taking them in not just giving them money while they're at the orphanage this is not sponsoring them sponsoring them is to take them in with your family living in your house eating from you food up bringing them in the Islamic fashion as directed by the Prophet Alice artisans he also told us if you stroke an orphans head then this would cause your heart to soften and for your things that you desire to take place the Prophet SAW Allah saw some one of his companions and he told him do you want Allah to answer your door and give you what you want and for your heart to be softened in the message yes the Prophet told him stroke the head of an orphan not to strike him or to beat him but rather to show your affection to him when you just cuddle him and you wipe over his head and hair Allah would grant you a lot of reward for that so Islam cares for such segments of the society Islam tells you it's part of your good Islam to take care of these orphans and not to let them be on the streets maybe become bad elements of the society [Music] yeah very serious and touchy subject we appreciate you addressing that and all the others for today's episode thank you so much for being with us shake awesome Jacqueline la fête we hope to continue with an additional episode dealing with the subject of children around the Prophet who are not his family members but we are concluding for today thank you assalamualaikum warahmatullahi roberto god"
