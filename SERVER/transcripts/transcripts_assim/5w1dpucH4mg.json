  "title": "Praying in a room with pictures of living things or idols | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "a sister says what's the ruling on praying in a room that has pictures of people are living things hung on the wall or idols in the room this is quite common in hostels in our country and this can also be the case if we visit someone's house or in a mall etc this is not permissible yet the prayer itself is valid so you should be careful not to pray in a room because the Prophet are in a room that has statues or pictures because the Prophet said that is awesome that the Angels do not enter a house that has pictures statues or dogs but if like you've mentioned yaryna hostel and your roommate is a disbeliever and there are idols in the room there's no where else to pray then the prayer is very nice ah Allah"
