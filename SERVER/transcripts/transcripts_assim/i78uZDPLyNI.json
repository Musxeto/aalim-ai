  "transcript": "so if I Repent on sin and like if I drink wine I have to quit I do not I do not understand what you're saying yeah unus if I Repent from one sin then like if I drink wine then I have to quit I have to regret and intend never to do it again now I don't quite know how do I repent from all sins at once like okay I can regret everything and I can quit everything I know but I don't know what to intend should I intend never to S again should I intend never to repeat anything please tell me exactly what to intend for the future I made much research I didn't get an answer I still don't know so you can maybe tell me a sentence I will do this and I will quit this I hope it's clear no it's not clear definitely it's not clear I've committed a thousand sins now I feel remorseful and I want to repent are you telling me that I have to list down these thousand sins and do okay number one I Repent I feel remorse I will not do it again number two I Repent I feel remorse I'll not do it again number three this is crazy one of Allah's beautiful names is which has two meanings meaning number one he alone is the one who guides us to repent that's why we have thousands and hundreds of thousands of or millions of people who are not repenting why don't all of these people repent and go back to Allah because Allah did not allow them to repent and why didn't Allah allow them to repent because they don't want to repent so Allah keeps them in the darkness us Allah gave us his favors and blessings and guided us to repent the other meaning of is that Allah when we repent he accepts our repentance this is how we pres uh uh perceive Allah this is how we deal with Allah and this is where you're failing when you think that oh Allah is waiting to just throw me in hell if you have committed sins express your poverty to Allah show him your desperation and need for forgiveness and simply repent the problem is that when you repent and you have these feelings your Devil comes out and says oh then this means that you're not going to make any any sins in the future this is impossible I have to do some sins in the so now you're confused and this is why you're allowing Shan to mess up with your head and him messing up in your head is causing you to think negatively of Allah this is not applicable how is it possible to remember all the sins that I have done and does remorse and the intention not to make any sins mean that I don't have to sin in the future but I I know that I will fall into sin because I'm weak I'm human so Satan says then might as well call it a day and don't repent because it's inapplicable and of course this is Satan's Whispers in your ears and your fault is you're opening the door and inviting him in and may Allah make things easy for us"
