  "title": "Now that Palestine is not under our possession, is it recommended to visit Masjid Al Aqsa? | Assim",
  "transcript": "i hope i don't whiten your beard even more by this but i want to know this uh now palestine is is not in our possession so is it okay if we go and visit masjid al-aqsa because we have to go through israel okay i will answer inshallah so hail from malaysia is asking a very good question people in malaysia and indonesia and other countries who do not have a problem with diplomatic relationship with the enemy powers israel so they say we have a umrah package they come to makkah to medina or they go straight to uh jerusalem and they visit the masjid is this permissible or not this is an issue of dispute among scholars and due to the fact that it is controlled by the enemies of islam this made a lot of the scholars say that going there is approving them of conquering and taking muslim lands and making it as easy as possible which is not permissible others say well we don't have any form of enmity or actual war with them and i'm not going there to benefit them i'm going to there to pray in the mesja which is 500 prayers better than anywhere else so i'm going there for that i would personally recommend that this is not to be done there's no guarantee for your safety there there are enemies of islam and the muslims so you may get a visa but you can't guarantee that you won't be abducted you won't be killed you won't be harmed nobody can guarantee this because these guys don't have any um pledges that they can hold on to it's in the quran allah tells us that all of their promises are broken all of the pledges are not fulfilled this is what the jews are this is what allah tells us in the quran so if there is a new sect or cult of jews different than the quran show them to us but there isn't and this quran is for eternity it's for the day of judgment so no one can come and say no no no you've got it all mixed up the jews at the time of the prophet some are different no they're not different they're the same and we can see that clearly so my own point of view is that this is totally prohibited even if it comes to me on a golden plate i would never go there until the land is free and it is belonging to the muslims the jews always sing this land this mind god give this land to me and this is what they chant it's not yours it's allah's land and allah has given it to the muslims and only the muslims can take care of it allah knows best"
