  "title": "Ruling on repeating funeral prayer when body of the deceased is not present there assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question is yesterday after the prayer one of the IM made an announcement saying that so and so passed away we already did his janaza but now we want to make another prayer for him and he instructed the IM that was leading the prayer to make a Dua and he instructed the congregation to all say a mean and I'm wondering what's the ruling on this it is not it is not permissible to announce the death of people in masjids like this and the scholars say that announcing the deaths of people on pulpits or in the manats is an innovation it is also not permissible to repeat the funeral prayer as long as it was offered by other Muslims so if the corpse or the deceased body is not there why would we repeat the prayer again this is not from the Sunnah at all and this was also wrong from them to do"
