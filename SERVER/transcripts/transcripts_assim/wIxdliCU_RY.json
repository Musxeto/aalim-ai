  "transcript": "amina says can someone call the 99 names of allah every day see calling the names of allah azzawajal without asking allah subhanahu wa is not from the sunnah so if i just say ya latif and i repeat it it has no impact it has no meaning while if i call allah with his names and ask him so i say ya latif make things easy for us ya samir answer my call ya rani pay off my debts ya kareem so i'm calling allah azza with an appropriate name of his associating it with something i want from him this is totally permissible and highly recommended because allah loves to be called by his beautiful names but to come and simply say allah ya allah allah like the sufis do repeating it a thousand times or a gazillion times this is totally unlike the sunnah and it has no benefits you're not doing anything ask allah for something while doing this allah when you call him but when you just call someone this would be on the human level irritating if you just say asan asam asam and i look at you yeah duh and you just keep on repeating my name i'm gonna probably smack you because this has no benefit so you're mocking me what are you doing to do a bada to please allah you praise him you glorify him you invoke him make dua but not just simply repeat his names"
