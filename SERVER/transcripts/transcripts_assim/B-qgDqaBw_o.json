  "title": "If someone avoids haram, does good deeds, & dies unmarried, will they still receive 72 virgins",
  "transcript": "Muhammad from Pakistan. Uh sir, if for example if a Muslim man he tries his level best to do as many good deeds as possible and he avoids haram to the best of his ability and when he reaches the age of 70 80 years old he passes away and he never got married. Okay. He never got married. So will he get the 72 virgins the 72 who's in heaven if he never got married in this life? No. No, he won't. Unless he died as a martyr. The 72 virgins or wh are given to martyrs who die on the battlefield. Normal people would get two wives whether they were married previously or not. And Allah increases that to whomever he wishes. Subhanahu wa ta'ala."
