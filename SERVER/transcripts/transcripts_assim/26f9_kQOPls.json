  "title": "Avoid rows with Pillars Columns in masjid? What if people are already praying there #Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh so he was uh avoiding to pray in rows between columns or uh um pillars in the Masjid some of the brothers wanted to know if we are supposed to skip the entire row or only the part between the pillars also if people are already praying in the row should I join them or start a new row and if the Imam tells me to stop should I listen to him or continue what I'm doing there is no there is no Hadith that the prophet says don't do that all what there is are narrations from the companions such as an Malik and others stating that we used to avoid praying between the RO the pillars in a rle and in another narration we as children used to be beaten up if we were to pray in rows that were broken by pillars but there isn't nothing attributed to the prophet alisat wasam nevertheless when the companions say and Nate that we used to do this at the time of the Prophet this has the ruling of the Prophet ordering them or at least seeing it and approving it so the ruling according to the majority of Scholars is that one must not pray between the pillars or when there are pillars dividing the row and they should skip the entire row so that the whole row is complete unfortunately some masjids have many many pillars that divide the rows sometimes it means that we've skip like 50% of the rows which means that 50% of the space in the Masjid would be vacant due to these pillars and nevertheless we should do that unless the Masjid becomes packed and there are there is no space as for example in the case when we go to the Haram whether in Mecca or Madina and we find these pillars dividing the row in this in this case you are excused and you may pray or in the case that I come to a Masjid and I find half of the row already started between pillars I should join them and not skip the row and pray on my own because that would be dividing the umah for no apparent reason and this if there is a sin it's upon those who started the roow in the first place"
