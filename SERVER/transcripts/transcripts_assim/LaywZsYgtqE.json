  "transcript": "brother Hamid from the UK had two questions the first question is what's the ruling on joining the army in a non-muslim country what is the role of an army the role of an army is to defend the country generally speaking or to invade other countries like we see worldwide so if you look at Europe the United States all other countries they have armed forces what are these aren't forces for either they are to deter any invader from coming any hostility against the country and this is legitimate to defend your own country or it is used to attack other countries under the titles of protecting democracy freedom human rights blah blah blah but regardless we're not going to go into people's intentions what you're asking about Hamid Bey is that to join an army and to be ready to die with this army that is not raising the flag of Islam is totally prohibited why the Prophet was asked is awesome Oh prophet of Allah a man fights for honor another fights for being praised as brave meaningful bravery a third fights for the war booties for the money which one of them is a martyr in the cause of Allah the prophet said Aslam whoever dies fighting to make a Las word the highest who dies in the cause of Allah all of these are not for the cause of Allah therefore it is not permissible for a Muslim to join an army of a country that has forces killing Muslims attacking Muslims regardless of their intention or their justification it's someone who's not a Muslim attacking Muslims this is totally prohibited for you to join them even in clerical work and share happiness Amy may Allah have mercy and his soul was asked about joining the medical staff of such armies and he said that this is not permissible and Allah knows best"
