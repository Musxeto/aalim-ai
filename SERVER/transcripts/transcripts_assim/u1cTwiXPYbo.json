  "transcript": "second question when we are doing the burial they say you have to recite Surah a number of times and read the Quran and this and the Imam says this is what we should do you have any report that the prophet did this Imam says no but this is good thing we read in Quran there's nothing bad about it do you know more than the prophet Allah again this is an innovation the prophet when he sallallahu finished burying his companion he said to his companions who were round the grave ask Allah for forgiveness for your brother and ask Allah to make him steadfast because now he's being questioned no Quran no a Hadith no nothing so if the prophet did not tell them to recite such surahs do you know more this is weird man so this is the beauty of Islam you don't need someone to come and give you a syllable approval oh what you need is to open the Quran open the books of Sunnah find the way whether it is the way of the Prophet or not and then you have your answer"
