  "transcript": "our first email for tonight is from Marcy Marcy says do I have to wear the hijab in front of my male cousins who is about 11 years old when do I have to wear the hijab and in what age of the children in front of male children now we know that hijab is mandatory upon a Muslim woman in front of nan moms what is the definition of nan Muharram those whom she can get married to so moms are like her son her brother her father her uncle paternal or maternal her nephews her father-in-law her son-in-law her step father and her stop a step a son etc now having said that what age would she be obliged to wear the hijab so if I have a three four year old cousin of hers male cousin is she obliged to wear the hijab the answer is definitely no three years is too young okay what about if he is 15 years of age so 15 years of age this means that he has reached the age of puberty and hence this is above the limit by consensus she has to wear the hijab then what is the limit scholars said that if the child is below the age of discernment meaning that his six years of age 7 years of age does not pay attention to whether the woman is curvy or not whether her voice is soft and appealing or not he doesn't look at her or at her body in strange way in this case she's not obliged to wear the hijab if he's like 10 years of age not yet had reached the age of puberty but you can tell by the way he looks and by the way he laughs at some jokes when the children talk about the body of a woman his mother or whatever and in he laughs and makes a joke about it by the way he looks at other women in this case yes she has to wear the hijab not necessarily covering the full cover that she does when she's out of the street but at least she has to cover her hair her neck her bosoms etc and be decent in front of him but once he approaches 13 14 which is close to reaching the age of puberty she has to wear the full hijab and Allah knows best you"
