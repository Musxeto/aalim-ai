  "transcript": "Your name? Mohammed from India. Okay, yes Mohammed. Sheikh, recently me, my mother and my brother had a conversation, was speaking about my, regarding my brother's marriage and during the discussion an argument broke out and my mother yelled at me saying that I should not no more in, be involved in such discussions. So I told back to her, Wallahi Inshallah, Wallahi I will not be involved in this discussion again. Now again they have apologized back to me and they want me to be involved in this, in their discussion. Now is this considered as an oath or how to retract this oath? Yes, Wa Jazak, this is an oath. If you swore over such a thing, you have to feed or clothe ten poor Muslims. And if you are unable to do this financially, you have to fast three days. And Alhamdulillah you can get involved with it once again. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it, Inshallah, within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, and for all bi-idhnillah."
