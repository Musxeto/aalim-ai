  "transcript": "ah we have one hadith remaining with us and then inshaallah we will move on to a new chapter the chapter we are studying is the conditions of salah the hadith has the number 179 who will read it for us kill the two black ones during salat meaning prayer the snake and the scorpion now this hadith is authentic hadith and it tells us that it is allowed for us to move during salat mustafa for what for any necessity such as carrying a baby and this hadith killing the snake or the scorpion so this is a necessity it's not a sign that of your virtue and you're a good committed muslim that you're praying and you find a cobra uh coming crawling towards you and is about to bite you and then you're about to bite the dust and then you say well i'm going to continue praying no you have to it's a must that you move and heal it and scholars say that movement during prayer is divided into four types fadi it's divided into four types the first type is the movement that is regarded as a lot and without any legitimate reason and it's in sequence and this type of movement scholars say nullifies prayer can you give me an example muhammad movement that is a lot in sequence and has no legitimate reason yeah like some people are you um used to what i said rub their skin and their skins two times three times without any reason yeah but this is not a lot now to say a lot meaning that mustafa if you run away for example if you run away that's a lot so if you're praying and then oops i forgot the food in the microwave so you go and move and go to the kitchen and and and take it off or turn it to turn it off and and then go back to prayer is this acceptable this nullifies your prayer immediately if a person's if a person answers the phone talks on the phone if he takes and i've seen this i've seen weird things people answering the phone during prayer and some brothers said that they've seen people taking a piece of paper and taking their pen and writing a note while praying because they don't want to forget this thing that that just came back came into the mind and then they put everything back again this is a lot of movements that could be considered to be nullifying salat so this is the first type the second type which is moving a lot but not that much which makes prayer which with the movement itself is uh not preferable not recommendable so you move but you move slightly such as the people while praying some of them play with their beards so while they're praying they do this or they play with their uh uh what we call shimar the thing that they wear on their head so if it was slightly if you're moving from one position to the other and just picks it or so it does not bother you it's okay but if you're moving it all the time or some people play with their watches in prayer and i've seen people while while in prayer adjust their watches to the clock in the masjid so the guy says yes okay now we're okay this is also uh though it is movement but because it's not as much as running away because it's a few movements it's not recommendable it's macro and it's a sign that your prayer is not complete the third form of movement which is considered to be a little and scattered and there is a reason for it so this is permissible it's it's it's not in sequence you know you make it once in the first rakah another one in the third rakah and one uh at the fourth rakah and it's it's little it's not uh as much so this is okay such as a person praying he wants to make uh prostration he fixes the position of the of the wash and then prostrate because he's afraid that it would hurt his uh wrist or any of this sort it's little it's something that is negligible then it's okay and permissible and the fourth type is the obligatory movement that you have to move such as if a person in front of you leaves his position leaves the raw and go out and goes out of it then it is obligatory that you fill his position and walk a step or two to fill that position and this is uh uh uh permissible and sometimes it can be obligatory if you get this itching in your head mustafa while praying and it really itches so is it preferable that you you know scratch your head or try to fight it until prayer is over and then you jump on your head and start scratching it i think it's preferable to scratch your head because it will not let you concentrate the repair do you all agree with that you all agree with this fatty you try first not to scratch it but if it's going to distract you from focusing on the prayer then you should just scratch it then this is the same answer almost yes this is true if it's going to distract you you have to do it otherwise the rest of the prayer you will not cons contemplate on and this is exactly as we find in lots of mosques while prayer while we're praying you hear a mobile phone of one of the brothers going off so what do we do and the the phone keeps on ringing and the brother refuses to turn it off or to answer the call and it stops then the caller calls again and again and again and again and throughout the whole prayer and the phone is is ringing after the prayer you ask the brother why didn't you turn it off he says i didn't want to move in prayer and which would void my prayer was this right no no i think i have to make his mobile orphan after that because it will disturb itself while praying and also maybe another do you buy this malik yes i agree with him you think you should turn it off if a caller calls you should turn it off well out of experience i believe that this is not good because no matter how many times you call you turn it off he's gonna call again because he gets the busy tone so when you turn it off he calls again and when you turn it off he goes a third time the best thing to do is to turn it on so he hears the people praying and then he realizes that oh that's why he can't answer the call the the call uh do you have any remarks yes you just switch it off switch the whole mobile this is possible but when you have a key lock on with your mobile this means that you have to take the mobile and see where the key lock is unlock it and then turn it off and this would may cause you confusion but to begin with the best thing is that you turn off the ringtone before you go in the most problematic well i would say something that brotherhood would say you know you can just turn it off somebody rings the shelf completely yeah well this is the best thing to do the thing that also i would like to uh uh bring your attention to is that a lot of the muslims unfortunately put ringtones that are songs that has a music notes to it and this is forbidden in islam as you know songs are musical instruments are forbidden in islam and this is the direct instructions of allah azza in three verses of the quran and the hadith of the prophet and elsewhere and also the consensus of the four schools of thought they all the four imam agree that musical instruments are forbidden and i wonder how people and where are their minds when they go to the shop and they pay them a certain amount of money and tell them to download this song or that song what are you trying to signify showing off to people that you know these songs a normal ringtone would do the job it notifies you that that there is an incoming call for you so one should always try his best to inform people and tell them whenever he hears the mobile go goes going off that this is not uh uh permissible if you have a ringtone that is a song especially this happened many times in mosques while people are contemplating where people are praying in the middle of the the prayer you hear this mobile with a sound of a female singer sound you know singing as loud as she can in the middle of the mosque with a famous song and everybody in the prayer would immediately click to the song and instead instead of saying subhana rabbil they would start without you know uh intending that it's not within within their control they start to think about the song during prayer so imagine how many sins we fall on this poor thing who paid his money to get this song downloaded to his mobile it's a sin and one should be avoiding it okay does this include or exclude the ringtones that come actually with the standard phones not the ones you download no even even those that come with uh uh uh by default uh from the company that manufactured the the mobile there are songs in your mobile you know like in in some mobiles you have the b ringtone or the mosquito ringtone or the ring ring uh ringtone this is okay but if you go to mozart 40 or you go to the fifth of beethoven if you go on to ba and or you put pink or backstreet boys or whatever these are all forbidden you may not do this because these are musical instruments what about the nokia 2 tune the one that's in the phone itself it's like it's the same thing that i mentioned this anything that has music is it music it's music you can dance to it can't you you could you can it it brings joy to you when you hear a tone that has you know different tones this is unacceptable in in in islam because it's considered to be music and islam tells you music is not allowed at all now what's the wisdom of that we think we need a whole program to explain to you the dangers of music but i'm afraid that my cameraman says that we have to take a short break so stay tuned go ahead and recite from the beginning because i have a few comments on the previous citation it was great i would like to share with each other some comments on a few letters so i would request you to recite from the beginning yeshuai please this is wrong there is no such recitation me and welcome back before the break the brother read to us abu hurairah's hadith which said that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said kill the two black ones during salat that is the snake and the scorpion now one of the brothers may come and argue and say well the prophet sallam was white and he did not like blacks so i i what do you say to this now is this acceptable in islam at all we have no race segregation none whatsoever and we have companions married marrying blacks and blacks marrying from whites and there's nothing as long as you say they're all equal at the sight of allah azzawajal and they all you know differ depending on the amount of virtue they have in their hearts so when the prophet says al-salam kill the two black this doesn't mean that you go out carrying your nine millimeter and see one of them homies and pop him you know and just kill him no this is not acceptable of course because the prophet is not talking about blacks and whites he's talking about these insects a scorpion and a snake and again the color is not a determining factor meaning that if i'm praying and i find a white snake coming said well the brother is okay he's not black no you kill the snake the color is just a general uh uh thing so if you have scorpions there are white scorpions there are yellow scorpions there there are black scorpions so the color is generally there they are black but if you get a different color then you have to kill that snake or scorpion abomatic is there a certain snake or all state are all snakes well at the very beginning they were all kind of snakes that you may kill but then this was obligated by the prophet salallahu identifying a certain snake in the house not to kill but all other snakes yes you may kill those according to what i know that you may kill all kinds of snakes except those that in your house you may not kill them until you notify them one will say whoa notify snakes you want me to see a snake in my house and say excuse me if you please leave the house yes the prophet says allah that the there is a possibility that these snakes are your brethrens of jinn so you have to notify them this doesn't mean that you have to stay in home you may leave you may take your children and go but you have to notify them and give them a notice of three days and then you may do whatever you want if they do not move and come out the hadith is inside muslim where a man was newly wed and he went out and he came back home he found his wife standing at the door and he was so jealous he was so angry and she told him wait don't jump to conclusions there's a snake in my house so as soon as he went in and saw the snake he threw the spear at the snake and the snake jumped at him and stabbed him and well that didn't stab him it it it bit him and he died so the prophet came and said islam that don't kill these in in your houses that live in your houses until you notify them and give them notice there are types of snakes that the prophet said that had two dots on top of them and they are quick to make pregnant women miscarriage and they can kill with with their looks and so on to be also killed but according to what i know all snakes can or must be killed mustafa when you notify the snake do you say it in a specific language or any languages i don't think that snakes carry language tag saying that this is a french language so francais you just notify them because if they're jinn they understand your language so you ask them by allah if you fear allah azzawajal leave this house otherwise i'm going to kill you you notify them in this manner and afterwards you can do whatever you wish any questions remarks yes sir is this like a specification by the prophet muhammed that you can only kill scorpios and snakes to repair well that's a good question that's that's a very good question no this hadith tells you that whatever harms you you may kill it during prayer so this is not only scorpions and snakes so if you get uh the black widow you know this spider they called what they call tarantula or whatever i don't know the name i'm not good with those i don't want to be i don't really want even to meet them but if you get one and say this is not a snake and it's not a scorpion well i don't think i can kill it no you have to kill it you have to squash it if possible and likewise if you get a a a dog with rabies also is attacking you no one tells you to stay anything that harms you you have to stay away from it mustafa what about non-poisonous snakes do you still have to kill them well apparently yes you have to kill them but i have to also uh refer back to my references again and and check it out with some of the scholars to to check their opinions because what appears to me that all snakes are to be killed and if they're not poisonous you don't know what else they could do so if uh uh an anaconda the big uh snake it's not poisonous but it can crush a man to death and swallow this man and it would be good for about what week or two and then it moves on no i just meant like a like a small snake like that doesn't mean that's warm it doesn't it doesn't do anything like a peaceful snake above a baby or a baby snake or i what i think that it it's all harmful and it all does bad things to you so if we have an order to kill scorpius and snake the prophet sasan did not identify which snakes to be killed so we should kill them all it's exactly like killing mice you have to kill mice but nowadays we get people with hamsters and they they buy them and they wash them and you know put shampoos on them they put them in nice cages they feed them the small white rats or and so on and they think that's good no it's not all rats are to be killed because the prophet told us alison that they would burn your house they go and they take any piece of cloth and they go into anywhere that there is fire and they light this piece of cloth and they move on and burn the whole house this is what the prophet said alessa sam so apparently that you should kill all types of snakes unless there's another hadith that tells us no not all of them because at the very beginning when the prophet migrated to medina salazar he ordered the companions to kill all dogs this was at the very beginning so they started killing all the dogs now the dogs are usually nudges and pure and and but there are things that you may use them for it's permissible for you to keep dogs in the case of yeah in the case of that um you know fear of uh enemy not the fear of an enemy for to guard oh yeah okay what else mustafa for hunting hunting and what else agriculture uh like when you for the plantations yeah any the farm on the farm the dog's farm no i like it to cart on the floor your farm safeguard your crops yes and to safeguard your cattle sheep as a german shepherd and this called german shepherd because it's known to accompany uh sheep and so on so this is permissible so at the very beginning the prophet came and said kill them all and then this was obligated and the prophet told them do not kill the dogs except the black dogs that have that has two white spots or yellow spots on his head because this dog is a devil so black dogs are to be killed it's permissible normal dogs know you have to leave them it's okay to leave them because you may use them in the things that we've mentioned earlier as for uh snakes it so appears to me that the order the instruction to kill snakes is general so one should kill them all unless there is another hadith that abrogates this i i don't have any knowledge of it so it should be kept likewise if one has a scorpion and he takes the sting off the scorpion it doesn't become harmful does it it doesn't bite if it cannot sting then it's not dangerous does this mean that one should keep it and and and preserve it you know make uh make it his pet no this is not acceptable and and and i don't think that uh anyone of the scholars say this uh we move on to the following chapter that deals with sutra and what does sutra mean sutra means the screen it's the thing that you put in front of you before praying and what use do we have from this it prevents people from passing between you and it so it keeps the this your distance for a prayer and we have one hadith to begin with is hadith number 180 who is to read it narrated by abu johem may allah be pleased with him allah's messenger said if the person who passes in front of another person in prayer knew the magnitude of his sin it would have been better for him to wait for forty than pass in front of him now this hadith tells us it is a sin to do what to pass in front a person praying and in this hadith the prophet told us that if you only knew the magnitude you would have stopped for 40 and he did not specify 40 minutes 40 hours 40 days or 40 years and scholars say that it is 40 years yes also muslim has added that there's another version yes well okay that's good if i did not read this muslim added that it uh 40 for bukhari well the scholars say it is 40 years so it tells you that the magnitude of the sin to pass in front of person praying and this indicates that a person should have something in front of him whether it's a visor whether it's a a chair whether he's praying to a wall to a pillar or to a person sitting down this would also do the job but not to pray in the open and in case a person was praying in the open then for you as forbidden to come and cross between his feet and the position where he puts his forehead now this is his praying prayer uh area and you should not pass on that if you do then he is the sinful the one who is praying he is the sinful because he failed to put this sutra or this screen in front of him and you will get something also similar to that because you deliberately passed without uh taking any consideration i'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program inshallah next time we meet tomorrow we will try to go through this hadith and talk about the issues related to it so until then wash ah"
