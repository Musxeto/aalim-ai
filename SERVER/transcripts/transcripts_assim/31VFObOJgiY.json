  "transcript": "and he says I'm residing in Australia and here Muslim run meat shops they sell meat slaughtered by machines with bismillah played in the background is it considered halal now first of all as Muslims we are very critical when it comes to the meat that we consume you see all other types of food are Hallett we have no problems with it so vegetables fruits seafood is all halal for us the problem is when it comes to animals or birds and we know that Muslims don't eat pork and this is by default they don't eat donkeys domestic donkeys they do not eat wild animals that are predators such as lions tigers leopards they don't eat birds that also are predators like hawks larks Eagles etc they don't eat cats because cats is unlawful to eat so what do they eat they eat livestock such as camels cows sheep buffaloes goats they eat game when they hunt it such as zebras giraffes deers all rabbits all other animals that are lawful to be consumed providing that they first mentioned the name of Allah so if a person slaughters without mentioning the name of Allah this is considered to be halal for him though there is another opinion in this issue that states that if a person forgets then it is holid and it's an issue of dispute secondly it has to be killed in the proper manner if it is caught it has to be slaughtered and if it is a game a prey it has to be hunted whether it is gunned down or it is killed with an arrow with something that penetrates not bangs on the head it has to penetrate or by training animals or birds to hunt for you and not to eat and consume from it but this is again a whole long different topic thirdly the person who is either slaughtering or hunting has to be one of three a Muslim a Jew or a Christian other than that these three faiths any person who slaughters or kills an animal we cannot consume it and it's considered to be dead meat so if you generally speaking understand these conditions you would understand that Muslims who slaughter and mention the name of Allah and the animal is halal then this is halal for us to eat a Muslim who says bismillah and slaughters a dog this is Haram a Muslim who bangs a sheep on the head or electrifies it or suffocates it until it dies this is Haram it has to be slaughtered and he has to mention the name of Allah saying bismillah and if he adds Allah Akbar then this is an added value now the question that Ali mentions is about a slaughterhouse nowadays people are trying to make money as much as possible so slaughtering by hand consumes a lot of time time equals less money less time more money so they've come up with these automated slaughtering machines it's like an assembly line where they put the animals with the birds and the knife just works automatically and chops the head off and then it's to be processed later on so what's the ruling on that the ruling is simple if let's assume the assembly line has a hundred slots where they insert the chicken so with the press of my button a hundred knives execute the mission and it slaughters the chicken at the same time if I say bismillah and I press the button the hundred chicken are halal to be consumed because I'm a Muslim I said bismillah and I slaughtered but if I come at the beginning of the day at nine o'clock and this is nine o'clock a.m. and I say in the beginning bismillah and I push the button and I start reading the magazine and the machine automatically slaughters and inserts others and slaughters and insert others animals etc and processes it automatically this is Haram y-you said bismillah yes it's true I said bismillah but I said it on a particular incident what comes afterwards I have not said bismillah while slaughtering it the machine was slaughtering it so this is considered to be dead meat and this is quite crucial to understand and to investigate but do I have to go to slaughterhouses and investigate that they are following this procedure there's no as long as I'm in Muslim country or in a Christian country and they tell me that we slaughter and we mentioned the name of Allah I don't have any other information to prove otherwise in this case there's no problem for me to eat from it but because the default is all the meat that are slaughtered by Muslims or that are slaughtered by Christians or in a Christian country that it is hella until proven otherwise and we spoke about this so many times before analyze OGL knows best"
