  "transcript": "I consulted you about an IM here who were doing some kind of Z every every Friday putting a white blanket on the floor and everything and after talking to you I decided obviously to ask him directly what are his beliefs because you told me that at some part it could be just B and if it goes further it can even reach the level of kufur so when I talk to him he said two problematic things the first thing is like he said about the white blanket that it is a secret and I know that there's no secret in I and the second worst thing he said was like even the prophet Sall Al wasallam in some I he will hide it from the people because he was saying that the secret is too high for my level you know it's like for the high people the people who understand better and so on so when I talk to another im here about it he just said that because this guy is a j he doesn't know any better than this so it's fine to pray behind him he even quoted who said that about certain sex they say things that when if he were to say it himself it would be considered but if it is for the others like it can Beed Defiance because they are ignorance either way I am not sent to judge people I don't have to judge people but between you and me such an Imam who says that he cannot answer you because it's so high I don't think the answer is so high for you that I think he's himself so high on something I don't know he should maybe change the brand wet blanket and covering it because it's a form of between him and Allah what is this what kind of is it he wet himself I don't understand this nonsense these lunatics do but by all means would I ever pray behind such an IM no way Jose I wouldn't waste my Salah behind such a person that does not even disclose his true identity in his Islam or what he's doing or whether it's in accordance to Islam Quran definitely it's not according to Quran and the Sunnah it's part of his uh uh most likely and this is definitely a no-o for me and Allah Knows Best"
