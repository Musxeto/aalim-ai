  "title": "Ruling on doing Azza in a Masjid (gathering to accept condolences for  the deceased)",
  "transcript": "MWI from the US uh Sheik what is the ruling on doing an Aza which is something that it's trending in my state nowadays where people Gather in the Masjid from like 3: to 5 and they receive condolences for the deceased so that people don't come to their house like on E or something reminding the family that they don't have anything to celebrate that they should be grieving is this something this this is called not is to make a gathering whether it's in at home or outside the home or in the Masjid which is totally Haram so that people would come and give their condolences now this is by itself an innovation the companions used to say that we the companions used to consider gathering for M to accept the condolences and to mourn the dead and preparing the food for those who came we used to consider that part of wailing and we know that wailing that is raising the voice in a high pitch in expression of grief over the deceased wailing is a major sin so the companion used to consider this to be as a form of wailing doing it in a Masjid is further worse because this is a double Innovation and regardless whether it's prevailing in your state or not we know for sure that a lot of practices in the United States and North America in general are not based on Islam and that Islam in some places there has been distorted and altered into a new liberal Islam a new cult where everything goes and unfortunately this is prevailing but alhamdulillah there are people who call fored and following of the Sunnah and they're steadfast and determined to make a difference with the grace of Allah so in short what you have described is an innovation and it's prohibited to participate it is prohibited for Muslims to go to such Gatherings from 3 to 5 to give their condolences and they should do so at the deceased house if they ever visit him or see him on the street or the market or give him a call and that is the Sunnah"
