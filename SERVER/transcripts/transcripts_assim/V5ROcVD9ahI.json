  "title": "Is it a sin to use contraceptives as children have already been predestined?",
  "transcript": "what is the ruling of contraceptives since we will undoubtedly undoubtably have all children that are written for us then is it a sin trying to prevent them if this is to leave a gap between children there's no problem in using that the concept of what's written to you is logical only if you know what's written to you so you cannot justify or deny an action because of it being written to you it's like saying okay if this is your concept of a way of thinking go to a high riser and throw yourself if it's written that you will fall on your feet and walk safely it will happen nobody was gonna do that because it's your choice you don't know what Allah has predestined for you so you do your best you do your due diligence and whatever Allah predestined will happen but it's not you depending on what was written it's rather you taking the means and trusting Allah and relying on him"
