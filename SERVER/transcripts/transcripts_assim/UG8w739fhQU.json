  "transcript": "here in india a lot of muslim girls are in relationship with hindu boys and some girls come into relationship after knowing everything and some girls fall into that web usually they pretend to be secular in front of muslim girls praise islam and muslims be good to them keep saying they are secular and express their fake love and after marrying them they saw them through hindutva and forced them to convert to hindu illusion and my and my blood bowl shocked when i see hijab within muslim girls fall for hindu boys and when they ride on bike with hindu boys and meet them in colleges and bikes and here's horrible things happening from this current hindu government they are banning hijab killing and journalism muhammad you have sent this question to me on my website correct yes yes okay i will answer you in the same fashion so i remember this because i've just answered it a few hours ago the question is clear the answer is mind your own business you're a male these are females they're wearing hijab as you claim this is their problem it's a cultural thing it's not a religious thing they're riding behind on bikes behind hindus who cares if they were riding behind muslims that would would have been okay it's the same thing it doesn't matter fornication is fornication haram relationships is haram the relationship these people don't care about islam why should we care about them the hell with them but when you try to listen to the whims and desires in your head when you try to listen to the whispers of shaytan and shaitan says no you have to do something against that what go talk to the to the girls tell her come on sister you are so beautiful you're so intelligent look at you masha allah and you're going with a hindu boy he's a kafir he's going to fool you and he's going to marry you but he's going to convert you into hinduism what should i do come with me i'm a good muslim man excuse me what are you doing this is what shaytan wants you to do there are boundaries in islam and this does not justify you going and speaking freely with hijabi women warning them of their hindu boyfriend it doesn't matter whether he's a hindu he's a muslim he's a christian he is and she doesn't care what religion he is because she's not following islam so what should i do my blood boils well you have to learn your religion it's obvious that you don't have knowledge in islam you have to learn the proper akida you have to learn so that you can define what's right and what's wrong according to the quran and sunnah not according to the boiling of your blood thirdly concentrate on the men give your dawah to their brothers to their parents to their cousins to their family when the men in their families are strong in iman they will protect their women folk from doing such haram things but if you don't abide by the quran and sunnah and you want to jump the gun and go and do something that is not approved by the quran and the sunnah this is totally wrong and allah knows best you"
