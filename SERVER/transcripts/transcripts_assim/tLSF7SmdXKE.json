  "transcript": "our fasting our prayers and all the good deeds that we have presented to him during the previous month of ramadan today was the first day of eid and this day is a day of celebration which the prophet alaihis allah instructed his ummah to celebrate to be joyful and this is a manifestation of the balance in islam something that a lot of us may neglect or may ignore due to our ignorance in the sunnah you see our prophet was the perfect human being without any doubt so if there were any types of perfection in humanity the prophet allah was the manifestation of that perfection no doubt and in chapter 6 verse 162 in surat allah says to his prophet say indeed my prayer my rights of sacrifice my living and dying are all for allah azzawajal the lord of the lord of the worlds all of these are devoted to allah azzawajal if you look into his biography alaihis wasallam you will find that the prophet alaihis salat was used to go out to jihad to fight in the cause of allah as he used to revive the knights in night prayer and tahajjud asking allah azza for his mercy the prophet alaihis wasallam used to mourn the dead of his relatives and companions used to be saddened by that as he used to be joyful and happy when playing with his grandchildren the prophet alaihis was the one who used to race with his wives showing his compassion and love to them by being playful and joyful and it was him who used to teach who used to judge and who used to lead the prayers in the masjid so there was this balance in his life the prophet alaihis was afflicted by many calamities we know what had happened to him and to his companions in the battle of where 70 of his companions were martyred his own uncle hamza may allah be pleased with him was mutilated and gutted was martyred we know what had happened to his companions in in bitter maruna and in and the coward lee assassinations of them yet despite all these calamities this did not stop the prophet alaihissalat was salam from being happy on the day of eight from allowing his wives and family to use the duff on the day of eid to sing songs and chant and play despite all of their calamities and tribulations and sadness which indicates to us the wisdom of the sunnah that a lot of the muslims don't know despite what is happening in palestine despite the atrocities despite the barbaric attacks over civilians whom a hundred years ago opened their homes to these refugees coming from east europe and from all over the world barefooted no clothes they took the men they hosted them in the middle of their houses only to be kicked out of their houses of their own houses by these refugees and now they're trying to kick them out of their own porches and now the owners of the land are becoming refugees and they're killing them and they're bombing them and they're putting them in a concentration camp as if they themselves were not in a concentration camp decades ago as they claim when we see this a lot of the muslims due to their ignorance say that we should not celebrate eid we should mourn the dead we should react to what's happening and this is not the way of the prophet was the day of eid is a day of jubilation the day of eid is where you express your servitude your submissiveness to allah azzawajal through being happy through being grateful and expressing your gratitude to allah for completing the month of ramadan by doing this you are expressing your servitude to allah azzawajal tomorrow when everything is back to normal when the eid is over we can begin our mourning we can begin our relentless defense of the cause of our own brothers and sisters in palestine to expose such atrocities to expose such in gratitude of these zionists who took the place of the house owners and kicked them out and unfortunately the whole world is standing at their side against all the laws of the united nation against all norms so we have to balance these feelings according to the quran and to the sunnah and not just jump the gun and accuse people that you don't care about palestine you should not celebrate their eid you should not be happy we have our role model muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam to follow his example in sadness and in happiness in grief and in joy in comfort and hardship and by doing this insha allah we would strike the correct balance ramadan is over and a lot of the good deeds that we used to do willingly we're shocked by how less they are compared to yesterday why is that because the system was helpful everybody was fasting everybody was attending taraweeh everybody was giving in charity everybody was trying their level best to gain as much reward as possible once ramadan is over the blessed month then business as usual people go back to the sins to go back to their negligence those who were lazy to pray in the masjid go back to their laziness and this is a very dangerous sign so many people ask the frequently asked questions how do i know that allah has accepted my fasting and my prayers you don't however there are some signs that may be signs of glad tiding among them is that you find that after ramadan you're continuing on doing righteous things and good things way better than before ramadan and this is an invitation all righteous people most of righteous people let me rephrase that have their portion of night devoted to allah azzawajal nobody knows about most righteous people wake up an hour or two before fajr and they pray to hajjut prayers the mrs is asleep the children are asleep nobody knows about them and when they wake up they never tell anybody so they pray one jesus of quran at least and by this they finish the whole quran every lunar month they offer to what a witcher they make dua for everything they need they recharge their rusted hearts and they wake up in the morning fully energized most righteous people fast mondays and thursdays every single week like clockwork and some of them are up in high gear so they fast in addition the white days 13th 14th and 15th of every lunar month and this is at least one third of the month of every single month but this is in their system this is why whenever ramadan comes they don't feel any difference because they hit the ground running now when you come and look at how they try to get close to allah azzawajal you realize that allah azza has accepted their fasting and their prayers by making them capable of continuing these good deeds throughout their lives where it becomes part of their routine but if you found yourself going back to netflix to listening to music if you found that fajr prayer on the day of eid or doher prayer or asa prayer was skipped due to being tired being lazy having guests asleep and this would cascade to the rest of the month if not the rest of the year then unfortunately this is bad news so you have to work on the fact that allah's presence and watchful eye is not only in ramadan but it is throughout the whole year if you worship allah in ramadan allah is the lord of ramadan and the lord of shawwal and the lord of the whole year be aware of this fact one of the things that are so beautiful in our religion is that if you want to be qualified to be called on the day of judgment from one of the eight gates of jannah then you should fast six days of shawwal we fasted the whole month of ramadan skipped not a single day most of us some of us were forced to skip due to natural reasons such our sisters such as our sisters who are compelled to skip few days if you manage to make them up in the month of shawwal beginning today today is eight you can't fast tomorrow is the second of shawwal you begin tomorrow you make up your missed days then you follow that by six days of shawwal if you manage to do this you will be recorded at the side of allah as a person who fasted the whole year the whole twelve months and that qualifies you with the grace of allah to be called from the gate of only those who fast will enter from it of course you fasted ramadan inshallah you'll be called from it but you will emphasize your presence and the fact that you will be entering from it if you manage to fast six days of shahwah do i have to fast them immediately on the second of shawwal no from the second two of shawwal to the 30th you have this whole period for you to fast do i have to fast them consecutively no you can fast mondays thursdays mondays thursdays mondays thursdays boom these are these are six days you hit two birds with one stone you fasted the six days and you also add it to that following the sunnah of fasting mondays and thursdays so that's hitting two birds with one stone double the reward and it is not compelling this is a sunnah so if you fasted five days and then you felt tired and said tell you what i want to quit i'm not going to finish the sixth day no problem if you manage to fast six days this doesn't mean that it becomes obligatory upon you to fast it every single a year like some ignorant people think no there's no compulsion there's no obligation it is up to your preference so if you manage to do that if you manage to preserve offering night prayer if you manage to preserve fasting mondays and thursdays if you manage to complete the quran once every month this is one of the best glad tidings that allah could send you to indicate that the fasting of ramadan that tahajjud and tarawih of ramadan was accepted nobody is going to take you to court nobody is going to check on you or hold you accountable why didn't you fast or why didn't you pray this is something between you and allah you have to fix it with allah azzawajal so that you would not suffer but if you don't it's your choice may allah azzawajal make us among those who are steadfast and that will continue to stay steadfast on the straight path until we meet him as they would i think we have a a blessed brother and one of the people who work educa in educating the muslims dr ahmed athakafi whom we are blessed to have with us in sha allah dr ahmad yes it's been a very long time since we talked together but alhamdulillah i always follow your uh uh hard work in the love of this beautiful language of ours and i was so happy to hear that masha'allah you've managed to start a program on zad tv and this program is about teaching arabic to non-arabs which is something we are in desperate need especially when it's coming from a native especially when it's coming from someone who his profession is in teaching arabic to the non-arabs so allah accept your fasting and prayers i would like you to give us a preview about this a beautiful program in sha allah okay bismillah first of all alhamdulillah always be is talking about how to live arabic alphabets through the quran alhamdulillah we have more than 28 letters and this literacy alhamdulillah in each one we have one class of one letter we starting by the holy quran one sword surah for example then after that recite together with my my guests then after that alhamdulillah we get the leader from inside this letter from this inside this surah we understand how to pronounce the letter as arab we understand how to write the leader as arab people we understanding how to use the leader as predicts alhamdulillah we did more than 28 as i told you before programs more exercise more writing exercise more wordship more listening and also more than we have reciting more ayats so from this program you will get two benefits the best benefit that you understand how to recite some of ayah like suratul fatty had likes then after that you correct your pronouns for the leader of arabic leaders and this is here from allah subhanahu ta'ala for my brothers and also for my sister all around the world who are watching the difficult to understand more arabic to develop their language to learn their islam issues and alhamdulillah as i told all my students the arabic language is the key for our religion to understanding the quran to understand the hadith also to understand others and insha allah this is coming soon this is excellent news because as you know shaykh i have a lot of interaction with the muslims overseas and through my website through twitter through and every time i find this urge and need of a specific category of muslims to be more advanced in religion in science in knowledge and i always tell them it is the basics that you have to do is number one learn arabic so they find it difficult to learn arabic from trusted sources alhamdulillah if we can manage to learn the alphabets as you've stated from the quran this is a win-win even if you did not perf perfect your arabic language the reward you're getting by just participating and reciting the quran correcting your recitation and how to pronounce it correctly this by itself is rewardable so if you add to it yes that the way you learn would not be easy to forget because it's connected to the quran that is a genius and wonderful idea masha'allah exactly this is what we need that tv and me also what we need we need inshallah we have a mission we have a reseller we have a message that inshallah andrews has understanding the quran understanding how reading people and understanding how to pronounce the quran and insha allah from the quran you will understanding the arabic you are understanding the alphabets you will understanding the grammar writing the speaking everything now this is definitely for beginners and yes uh there has to be more to come so what are the levels you expect for a beginner like myself and an arab for example how long will it take me to at least maybe just read the quran without understanding just being able to recognize the alphabets and read and then how long will i need to begin understanding and are you inshallah designing any courses as such so that people would pursue their levels in different stages yes they have multi programs inshallah for arab uh language for many speakers of arab so they have special programs like my program and they have advanced program for hazard academy also for my brother and my sister who needs to learn arabic allah said in the quran so don't worry my brother don't worry my sister just start if you start allah will guide you to the right way to save to develop your language in arabic or you will enrich your la information in islam and more and more inshallah this program inshallah it will be for the beginner and inshallah we have in future we have leveled one level two and inshallah we were rich and the adventist and this is excellent news especially when we uh get to know that zad academy which is one of the successful programs that were introduced four years ago it is so successful that a lot of the arabs are benefiting it from it big time now there is inshallah the good news that it's going to come in english and definitely one major syllabus would be teaching arabic so inshallah i would hope that your participation in teaching the students the non-arab students in an academic way where there are quizzes and midterms and finals there is a textbook that they can follow which would qualify them inshallah for the following semester and the following semester and so on i hope insha'allah this would benefit the india greatly inshallah my brother and this is really this is our message in our life we have to help our brothers and my sisters in islam what we have inside from arabic language inshallah we will give them that you would like to contribute really my brother has first think i wanted to say thank you for that tv who always give us the chance to represent islam and represent the knowledge of arabic you always encourage us to to do something good for islam and inshallah we need more and more support from our brother ancestor and protect you and your family from all types of evil and may allah azzawajal continue to make you steadfast on the straight path may allah grant you as many students that would benefit you insha allah after your death in your grave with the good deeds that they will send to you through their recitation of the quran and learning i invite you insha allah to tune in to zad tv uh i believe that his program will start this month in shawwal today is the first day of shawwal so hopefully it will start soon i think we have a short break and afterwards we will have a a with one of our dear brothers in islam so stay tuned abundantly the way he deserves to be praised we ask allah to exalt dimension and grant peace and send his blessings upon the prophet muhammad you know what while you enjoy the moment and you should enjoy the moment because it is a moment of eid it is a time for us to celebrate it's time for us to show thankfulness to allah for having guided us to islam and for having allowed us to engage in different acts of worship in the month of ramadan between fasting and staying up at night reading the quran praying at night qiyam tahajud tarawi all the different acts of worship which muslims alhamdulillah find themselves motivated and excited to do what what happens though is that sometimes we forget that allah azzawajal is the one who should be worshipped our entire lives we don't forget as if we don't know but it is the human nature to be forgetful and so that's why i would like to remind myself and you to continue muslims should continue in you know maintaining that relationship with allah you've seen the results you've you've seen the fruits of your efforts reading the quran increases your iman staying up in prayer will help you become closer to allah and those are the qualities that we need as long as we are alive until we meet allah and therefore as the scholars say you know rabbuh ramadan the lord of ramadan is the lord of the rest of the months and so we should make it an appoint this this particular year versus the previous years to really maintain and continue in doing good and and drawing closer to allah you know staying away from the prohibitions obviously one of the main benefits of fasting is that you increase your taqwa because you're able to avoid all types of prohibitions and so just like you were able to avoid them throughout the month of ramadan inshallah you'll be able to avoid them after ramadan so i ask allah to make that beneficial and to help us and to enable us to act upon these reminders and to make us get closer to him and closer to him and so that we will live a good life and then we will meet um in paradise and hopefully in alphadous when it's all said and done hello and accept from you and make us all among his righteous servants allah for his advice and reminder which we certainly need and this is one of our biggest problems in contemporary times i've met so many brothers and sisters through various means whether my website or my twitter account or my counseling sessions and the common denominator in most problems is the lack of a good advice so many people flip sides or as they say go to the dark side when they don't manage to surround themselves with righteous practicing muslims the environment that surrounds us molds us so if you are a loner you do your prayer in the masjid you fast ramadan you try your level best to be a practicing muslim but you don't have the good company you go to the office nine to five you go shopping you come back home there is nothing that fills your heart with iman there's no fine good preaching that enters your head this is when shaytaan takes control this is when netflix show time hbo and the whole nine yards kick in and control our times and lives when we're always on these pdas and computers giving our back to the wall so nobody sees what we're doing and this is when the deterioration begins may allah preserve us we need fine preaching we need these constant reminders bombarding our hearts not to brainwash us rather to heart cleanse us it cleans our heart it draws us closer to allah and as sheikh washed he said by continuing this process we are climbing uphill so when we die we die at the top unlike those who don't have good company unlike those who are loners and don't hear the fine preaching don't get a tutor or an advisor or a role model figure next to them advising them directing them correcting them they are on their own it's like being in the middle of the ocean without any life raft being swung right and left by the waves you need someone to give you a helping hand these reminders keep you on the straight path whenever you forget it reminds you whatever you try to neglect it brings you back into line into the course and without this we're bound to fail allah azzawajal addressed his messenger is make yourself with those who call their lord in the morning in the evening tolerant be patient with them force yourself to be with them this is an instruction to the prophet who are we mixing with who are we staying with this is something that we have to contemplate and and try to figure out a solution to our lives i think we have with us on zoom our beloved sheikh brother mentor sheikh ahmed safadeen dr ahmed safadeen where he will insha allah join us to talk to us about his beautiful program that was aired on that tv during the month of ramadan and i am very happy honored and pleased to be talking to my beloved sheikh to my beloved mentor to my beloved brother my younger brother but yani uh older and then me but actually he is younger in spirit he is younger in masha'allah his efforts to help islam and the muslims worldwide and his efforts in dawah i pray to allah that he accepts your prayers he accepts your fasting and all the good deeds you have presented in during the month of ramadan and to keep on giving you the power and the energy to continue doing that after the month of ramadan uh first shaykh asam let me start in the name of allah the compassion the merciful and also i would say alhamdulillah is due to allah and may the peace and blessings of allah be upon his prophet muhammad his family his companions and his followers all until the day of the resurrection actually i'm speechless uh with your introduction because all of what you said about me applies to you and the other sheikhs who are alhamdulillah always on the screen of zad and so many other islamic channels but i'm just only a humble uh student of knowledge well i i'm training saying this not not just because i i want to um you know humble myself but rather i you know uh this doesn't fit me anyway yes so i'm not a mentor let's put your things we are brothers let us put things let's let's put us things in perspective you are the first one whom allah blessed you to give q a on second channel and we followed your footsteps and how to answer the people's question in a moderate way in a social way well it was it was the uh favor of allah upon all of us to be uh used in the service of this dean and try to pass on some knowledge to our muslim uh brothers and sisters um connecting with them in in another language uh other than arabic because normally what used to be um around on on many television stations was only done in arabic but then there was an opening of english as you said on first on saudi channel 2 and then alhamdulillah with the creation of many full-time islamic channels it the widespread awareness on the part of many muslims that we need to reach out to the muslim masses and of course in this way we are reaching out to non-muslims as well alhamdulillah dr ahmed you know as the viewers alhamdulillah know that our way you and i and most of the duat who insha allah are on the same path strive our best to walk on the footsteps of our prophet and this is what we live for and this is what we will die for hoping that allah would resurrect us on the day of judgment and under his flag now having said that allah azzawajal has blessed you and blessed zad tv to have a program which talks about the most honorable sciences in islam or one of the most honorable sciences that fills our hearts with a man and that is the seerah of the prophet so alhamdulillah we were blessed by this program the glimpses from the fragrant prophetic biography so can you just shed some light why was this topic chosen and yeah tell us about the circumstances because it's not normal well let me let me be uh transparent in this because uh i know with the interest of the brothers and the trust that they uh put in me uh regarding having a program on z tv we talked about this even before my new job in the general presidency for the affairs of al-masjid al-haram so we were talking about this and we were thinking of recording this program uh it wasn't it wasn't really clear which topics we're going to touch on uh you know and we were thinking of recording it somewhere else in riyadh in uh in hobart in judah we didn't know exactly and we were thinking about this and and then just talking about it with uh our uh dear brother uh mustafa al-bithar but then subhanallah you know this job came in and uh and then i said well uh to to my brothers in the in el masjid and nebui uh is it possible to record within the harlem they said yes of course we can give you the best place which is and what is best to talk about when you are in that very precious place which is the uh rauda sharifah the very noble garden which is according to the hadith a guardian from jannah and according to many scholars this peace between the member or the pulpit of the prophet peace be upon him and his own house which is the house of inshallah actually is going to be taken and transferred to jannah so as he said so you know it gives it gives you the feeling that what what else can you talk about as you said the most um important the most uh uh relevant to to to to viewers is when you when you are within that place to talk about the prophet ali because i can live it you know spiritually we can talk about so alhamdulillah we made the arrangement with you sheikh al-sim and with the brothers um at zad tv alhamdulillah and the team came up came came over to medina and we recorded that it was by the way the first tv series or program uh uh delivered in a language other than arabic in the rauda in that particular place so i really felt very thrilled on one thing but it also gives me this feeling of uh you know where am i you know how dare i i should be talking about this when when i you know the grave of prophet sallam is only meters to my right and then his mihrab uh is is behind me and then his member or pulpit is uh to my left subhan allah and i said you know how dare you uh ahmed you talk about this but then i said uh if this is for the service of the dean if it is to talk about the seerah and biography of the prophet salallahu why not you know and i i uh you know alhamdulillah ask allah to help me in this regard and i select it as i selected uh some topics uh that i think uh were relevant somehow to to what is going on and at least to get some idea about the life of our beloved prophet muhammad how he lived in that place i just was imagining in that place how the companions were uh sitting around the prophet saws how he used to lead the prayer in that how he used to come out from his own house to the to the masjid um you know these uh poles or posts that are uh now standing in the radar and the uh what we call now the old haram which is the very limited uh uh and small size of haram at the at the time of the prophet peace be upon him because now it expanded uh multiple times many many many times uh more i was i was living there and there used to be like uh trunks of uh of uh uh uh palm trees uh so i i just was imagining how how they used to live there and talk to the prophet peace be upon him what he was dealing with you know uh and then although we we covered many topics some of them happened that took place in in mecca some of them in pai if some of them um even even his correspondence with uh leaders uh of the uh of the world at that time even outside the arabian peninsula but then we could imagine that it all came out from that very very uh special place which is very much uh in the hearts of every muslim so how the idea came and how that was executed the month of just preceding the month of ramadan you know that i would love to spend the rest of the night talking to you i would never feel bored listening to you jazakallah unfortunately we have actually the time of the program is over control room is telling me to finish and and close but i still have in less than 30 seconds we as you've said earlier they made you an offer you can't refuse so of course would there be another offer in shuttle for a sequel because the seerah is an ocean without any uh shores so it's endless so inshallah do we inshallah anticipate a a sequel well uh you know it is of course the the intention is there we need to work out the logistics we need to work out the details and uh hopefully by the grace of allah insha allah we can cover more um starting from within the the haram the prophetic message but we can go beyond even to many places within medina or even in mecca good uh i think uh the door is is is wide open to many ideas maybe if i would ask your dear viewers to come out with some ideas so at least we can we can feel what they what they in at least think of or at least they uh aspire to to have on anzad uh in the other tv channels uh regarding the sierra regarding the events that took place in the uh in medina or any other topic that we can address we can talk even about the glorious quran where certain ayahs were revealed uh upon the prophet peace be upon him in this particular place what does it mean under what circumstance and so on i mean there are many ideas that we can explore and see how we can uh you know uh execute such uh programs in the future uh by me or by uh by you many many other guys uh and many uh scholars uh around mashallah and i pray to allah azzawajal that he continues to bless us with your beneficial programs and to accept from all of us what we do and all of this is for his sake we pray to allah azzawajal that he makes it acceptable and sincere for these beautiful uh reminders and words and i pray to allah azzaw that he grants you and your blessed family all the best in this life and hereafter may allah azzawajal join us together in this world soon or in medina or in jeddah and may allah gather us under the flag of the prophet in paradise allah it's an honor to talk to you and also to see the viewers i tried to be uh as transparent as i could be uh give them the background of this uh idea of this program and then uh what else we can expect in the future so jazakum allah for uh bringing you over uh being honored tonight to be with you on that again barak allah and i believe that the control room is waiting for me outside with a stick to hit me with i hope it's not a baseball bat because they've been shouting for the past five minutes that the time is over the time is ending the time is this i think the director even left the the premises so with this we come to the conclusion of our episode for eid i pray to allah azzawajal that we meet again hopefully soon on ask zad but next year in the aid event and you are all safe and sound assalamu alaikum warahmatullahi mm-hmm"
