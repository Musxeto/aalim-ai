  "transcript": "Ronny's says can we take oath on poor and whether by keeping our hands on it or simply by words first of all we cannot swear we cannot take an oath except by one of Allah's names or attributes by Allah by man and by in Arabic is one so he say wallahi wallet refill Jabir well as easier ahim all of these are okay and the Quran is the speech of Allah which is one of his attributes and hence it is permissible to swear and to take an oath by saying well Quran I didn't do this because this is like saying what Quran Allah what by the speech of Allah so this is totally permissible the issue is placing your hand on the actual Quran is this permissible or not difference of opinion among scholars some say that if the Muslim ruler be it the judge or someone else who's in charge of solving disputes between people and he asks one of the defendants one of the clients one of those coming to his court over a dispute he asks him to place his hand on the masaf so that he emphasizes the importance and the gravity and the seriousness of the situation some scholars say that this is permissible why because the origin of this goes back to the times of the companions may allah be pleased with them for example with even our fan used to ask individuals not only that he used to ask companions who came when there was a dispute between one another and he wanted one of them to swear that he did not take the money for example he would say go to the member to the pulpit of the prophet alayhi salatu salam and swear there because swearing here is different than swearing next to the pulpit of the Prophet Allah stop swearing here that I didn't take the money is different when I swear next to the Blackstone has your S word or maqam Ibrahim or the multisim of Kaaba whoa this is a very serious thing maybe I'd have second thoughts if I were to lie that ya can lie here but there a lot though she would definitely annihilate me so this has an origin whether that some places are glorified more or sometimes are sought after such as swearing after awesome prayer as mentioned in the Quran in some hadiths as well so those scholars who say that placing your hand on the Koran and swearing is permissible when the Imam when the Muslim ruler when the judge deems it obligatory to emphasize that you're not lying other scholars say no this is not right there was a copy of the Quran at the time of Abu Bakr Omar Othman Ali and all the great companions of the Prophet s of Sarah may Allah be pleased with them and the tab UE and never ever we've seen anyone asking a defendant to place his and over the Mousavi actually this may count as an insult to the Koran when it is used for such purposes like this rather than being recited read and acted upon so the most authentic opinion is that this is an innovation this is what the Christians may do when they ask you to place your hand on the Bible but the Muslims should not imitate this or do this because it is not part of our religion and Allah social knows best"
