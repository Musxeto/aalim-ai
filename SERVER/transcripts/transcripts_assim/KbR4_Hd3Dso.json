  "transcript": "Second question, is a woman encouraged to give up her inheritance in Islam? Because in Pakistani culture this is very frowned upon for women to demand their inheritance. But the brothers kind of want them to, it's frowned upon because they're the ones who took care of them and provided for them after their father's death. So is it encouraged in Islam for her to give up her inheritance to her brothers because her brothers took care of them? Okay, I'll answer your questions inshallah. As for her second question, are women encouraged to let go of their rights in inheritance? Of course not. That's weird and strange and totally un-Islamic. Allah Azza Wa Jal is the one who himself divided these wealths over the heirs of a deceased. It was not done by the Prophet Alayhis Salatu Wassalam, it was done by Allah. He's the one who divided the wealth of a deceased and he's the one who allocated such inheritance to the heirs. Who are you to come and say, well sis, you should let go of your rights and give it to me and my brothers? Why? Because we're taking care of you. And who said you should take care of us? Again, this is un-Islamic. It's a misconception unfortunately among the Muslims that, oh, the brother is obliged to provide for his sister. This is not true. Where did you get this from? Oh, I heard this Sheikh saying that the brother is obliged to provide for his sister. No, this is not true. A brother is obliged to provide for his sister if the conditions are fulfilled. What are these conditions? Number one, his sister is stone broke. She doesn't have any money of her own. But if she inherited, if she's working, if she has savings, I don't give her a penny. Second condition is that she doesn't have someone who blocks me from inheriting her, such as a father. So if she has a father, then I'm not obliged to provide for her even if she's poor. Because this is the responsibility of my father. If she had a son, it's the responsibility of her son. Thirdly, in order for it to become an obligation upon me to provide for her, is that I have extra than what I, what my wife and my children need. If I can barely go even, hand to mouth, I don't have the necessary means to fulfill my own needs and requirements, let alone someone else. I'm not obliged to provide for her even if she's stone broke or I inherit her. This is not mandatory because I can't. This is all what I have and I have to feed my wife and children first. If I have extra and the other two conditions are fulfilled, then I may give my sister. Therefore, coming back to your question, it is not recommended at all to give up what Allah has given you. This is your God-given right. Okay Shaykh, but if I do this, my brother would boycott me and may not speak to me till the end of time. So, tough luck for him. He's the one who's going to hell, insha'Allah, for severing the ties of kinship over something that is not his. If your brother is a thief, he's a crook for asking you to let go your God-given right. Who gives whatever about him? Let him go. This is not something that people could twist your arm and force you to do something when Allah is the one who graced you with it and Allah azza wa jal knows best. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So, come to me and let's speak about it insha'Allah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
