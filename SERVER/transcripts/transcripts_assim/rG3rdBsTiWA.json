  "transcript": "Sumaya from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh My question is, I've asked you earlier about the school being inside the same building as the masjid I'm trying to be a Quran teacher, junior one But in here every madrasa is attached to a masjid And sometimes there's like a classroom, just like a single classroom inside the whole building That's used for teaching So can I go to that classroom only, you know, and teach when it's that time of the month? I told you before, and I told others, that the default is Whenever there's a masjid and there is a fence, walls of the masjid surrounding it This is a place designated for ibadah, for prayer And a menstruating woman must not enter the vicinity However, sometimes the masjids may have other areas connected to it Known to the public that this is not part of the masjid Such as the house of the imam, the house of the muezzin Sometimes it's on the top of the masjid, sometimes it's adjacent to it Sometimes it's a school, sometimes it's the management of the masjid Offices and the likes, sometimes these are shops Rented to the public, grocery shop or whatever And they utilize the rent to spend over the masjid All of these places, though considered to be attached to the masjid Do not carry the same ruling of the masjid And hence, a woman in her menses could enter it without any problem And Allah knows best"
