  "transcript": "foreign [Music] [Music] which is on my either of my site so the question of say it is is the gaps between the worshipers does it nullify the prayer the answer is no it has no impact on the validity of the prayer the worshipers so if I'm praying and the man next to me like in the covid era there is social distancing he is three feet away one meter away and the one on the right is one meter away and neither of them is trying to come close and if I come close they get run away so is my prayer valid your prayer is 100 valid and you don't have to repeat it and Allah Knows Best"
