  "transcript": "Uh so I had a question. Uh when I recite from must have during my sonat moat and prayers I sometimes hesitate about some verses. I think I'm not reading it correctly. Then I pause for a while and then take my time like just for a few seconds and reread the verse from the must. I was not sure like whether what I'm doing is um something wrong and uh will my prayer be well still by doing this way or not. Your prayer is valid. Pausing for a few seconds to remember or to rectify your recitation or to make sure that it is correct has no impact on your the validity of your prayer."
