  "title": "Is there zakat on land / plot that is intended to be sold after a few years? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Alum yeah recently I bought a plot uh but one year not completed uh and I have the intention to sail the plot after 3 four years when the value increases so is there AAU on the plot it's an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion is as long as it is not displayed for sale there is no zakat on it in the sense that you bought a plot and it's sitting there you don't go to real estate offices and say to them this is my plot it is 600 M square meters and I'd like this price for it if anyone wants please call me no it's there and therefore it's not displayed to be sold and hence there is no zakat in it similarly if someone says what about your clothes she do we have to pay zakat on your clothes do I have to pay zakat on my clothes the answer is no what if someone comes and says she I'd give you $1,000 if you take off what's on your head and give it to me will you be willing to sell it I said of course $1,000 definitely I'm going to sell it here you go so is is it zable because I sold it for $1,000 no it's not displayed to be sold like when I go to a shop and I find items displayed clothes and the likes these are zable but what we wear what we possess what we own other than gold and S silver do not fall under the category of zakat and Allah Knows Best"
