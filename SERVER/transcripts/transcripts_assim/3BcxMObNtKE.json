  "transcript": "San from Bangladesh San How are you doing Sheikh? Doing great with the grace of Allah. Sheikh I have two very small questions about prayer. Can I ask both questions? Unfortunately not. Make them one big question. All right, all right. Sheikh, what's it called? We know that there's 12 highly recommended sunnah prayers after far prayers and my question was. After far prayers? What do you mean? What do you mean? Like we know that there's two what's it called? Sunnah prayers before the far of Fajr. Okay, true, true. Before Dhuhr, two after Dhuhr, two after Maghreb, two after Isha. Yes, yes, yes. My question was, does all, oh sorry, the what's it called? The sunnah prayer for Dhuhr, the one before the far. The four rakah? Do we have to pray that? Yes, do we have to pray that? Do we have to pray that on two two's like separately or do we have or do we pray that all in one like all four? Okay, so this is an issue of dispute and we've addressed this question many times. Some scholars say that it should be prayed four like Dhuhr. You don't conclude it after two rakahs. Rather you stand up for the third and the fourth and sit for the Tashahud and conclude it with Salam, like Dhuhr. And this, some scholars quote a hadith and even Sheikh al-Albani authenticated this hadith. Other scholars say this hadith is not authentic and the general trend is that the Prophet said, alayhi salatu wa salam, the prayers of the day authenticate this addition of and the day. They authenticate the night prayer to be two and two, but not the day. So it's an issue of dispute. I personally am inclined in praying it two, offering salam, then offering two. Because this is the safest approach. All scholars would say, you've done well. But if you pray four, the scholars who authenticate the hadith would say, you've done well. The others would say, no, this is wrong, you should not have done this. So to be safe rather than sorry beats all odds, and Allah knows best."
