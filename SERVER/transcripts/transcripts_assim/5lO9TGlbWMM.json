  "transcript": "and finally fuzzy Dean says a classmate from university asked me why Islam prohibits shaking hands and I said to him and I gave him the example that even the Queen of England it's illegal to touch her part from certain individuals what would be the correct answer what you have said is true you gave them the Islamic verdict that Allah made it prohibited and you gave them the logical explanation that even on earth there are certain individuals that find it offensive and not permissible to touch like the one you have mentioned and this is totally ok insha Allah"
