  "title": "Advice For New Students Of The Deen",
  "transcript": "from the uk um i just had a question i was wondering if you can give some advice to a student that has just started seeking knowledge in the dean for example his daily routine um his actions and if you can recommend any books in english please to that color what is that first of all this is not a easy question to address because this requires a lecture just to to talk about students of knowledge behavior and actions and how they're targeted and how they're scrutinized and they're put under the microscope this impacts islam negatively so the pressure is high when you defend yourself when you react to something this is not something that you're doing that would only implicate or have implication against yourself this would go and have a ripple effect over islam and this is why you are under pressure so it requires a full fledged lecture as for the daily routine there is no one size that fits all some people love to memorize and revise and study before fajr time so they wake up an hour or two before fajr and continue after fajr for an hour or two and then they'll sleep the rest of the day like retired people who don't have anything to do some people prefer to do it after fajr some people prefer to do it between asl and maghrib some people are night people after isha till midnight so it differs and as for the books on my website there is insha allah a detailed explanation for the beginners how to go about this so please refer to it you"
