  "title": "The Prophet’s ‎ﷺ fairness towards Jews who twisted their greetings assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Allah. So look at the fairness and justice of the Prophet ﷺ. The Jews whom we all hate used to come to the Prophet ﷺ and greet him with a twisted word. So instead of saying Assalamu Alaikum which means peace be upon you, they used to say Assamu Alaikum which means death be upon you. See the difference? And the Prophet ﷺ figured that out. And whenever they came and said Assamu Alaikum, death be upon you, he would say Wa Alaikum and upon you. So mother Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, could not hold herself back. And she shouted at them saying may the death and curse and the wrath of Allah be upon you. She bluntly said it. The Prophet ﷺ reprimanding and admonishing Aisha. Mahya Aisha. Allah does not endorse or like being offensive, abusive or using such profanity, such aggressiveness. Allah does not endorse this or like this. She said didn't you hear what they said, Prophet of Allah? He said I heard. And I just replied to them and upon you. Where Allah would not answer their supplication that death be upon me, but Allah would answer my supplication by saying and upon you over them."
