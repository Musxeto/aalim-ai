  "transcript": "now coming to something that may cross your mind what about amphibious creatures that live partly in water and partly on land such as alligators or crocodiles so what's the difference between alligator and crocodiles by the way huh it doesn't matter if you see one just run but I think the difference I have no idea I've never seen one I'm not interested in seeing one so people a lot of people say what's the ruling on eating it said well if you can eat it before it eats you that would be a plus Allah protect us it's an issue of dispute because in the Sunnah the prophet prohibited eating anything that has a uh what do you call it NAB a sharp teeth some men have sharp teeth no it has something like lions uh canines or something like that yeah English is not my first nor second nor third language so it's lousy so anything that has a a claw or these canines and and the likes it's Haram for us to eat and definitely our friend the crocodile or the gator has lots of them but because it lives in water now we are hesitant so some Scholars say no it's Hal and I'm inclined to say that inshallah it is Hal because it cannot live outside water yeah maybe it can live for a day or two or three but then it will die due to its nature it has to be around water and use water not to breathe rather to sustain it its life however we come to something a little bit more luxurious what about the skin because we have many shoes belts and wallets that are made of gator skin and I I believe that this is halal as long as it is tanned then it becomes Halal due to this confusion but it's best to avoid the meat of it as for the leather it's no problem"
