  "title": "Why is trimming the beard more than a first length a WEAK opinion when other companions did it?",
  "transcript": "Sami from the USA Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So why is trimming the beard more than a fistful not being haram deemed a weak opinion when Abdullah ibn Umar and some of the other Sahaba would trim their beards beyond a fist? I don't know of any hadith that states that your beard should be a fist length, so why would trimming the beard more than a fist be haram? Do you have a fist length beard? Not quite, but almost. So why are you so preoccupied with this concept? I'll give you a quick analogy. We have a set of hadith where the Prophet ﷺ himself said Atlikul liha, a'ful liha, akrimul liha, arkhul liha, asbulul liha, all saying that leave it as it is. And he himself in his description had a wide thick beard ﷺ. So this is his teachings and this is what he did. If we get two, maximum three of the companions who did otherwise, but the whole entire group of the companions did not do so. Who should we follow? The teachings of the Prophet ﷺ, his doing, and the majority of the companions? Or should we follow only Abdullah ibn Umar, Abu Huraira, maybe some third companion? It doesn't make any sense. So you cannot come and blame me and say Sheikh you have a beard that is longer than a fist. And Ibn Umar used to trim it and whatever exceeds a fist length, he would cut it short. Why would he do this? Some say that because this was his interpretation of the ayah in Surah Al-Fatih after doing his Umrah or Hajj, shaving his head and shortening his beard. This is how he understood the ayah. This is his understanding. So who should I follow? His understanding, or the actions and the rhetoric and the doing of the vast majority of the companions? And besides, it's an issue of dispute, though those who say leave it as it is, outweigh definitely those who say you can trim it. So to be safe, just do what the Prophet did, alayhis salam, and the majority of his companions. And if your beard is too long, to the extent that it's hazardous to your life and to your well-being and it's coming in your face and when you're eating, you're eating portions of it and if you're a biker, it hampers your vision, yes, you may take this opinion due to necessity and Allah knows best."
