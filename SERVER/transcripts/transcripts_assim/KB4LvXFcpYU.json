  "title": "Where does a woman do Itikaf? Can it be done at home or in a prayer hall (musallah)? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "another important question that does come up regularly is the fact where is the place of ertika for the female for the women women can perform ertikaf in the masjid this is permissible the prophet alaihis salat was in one year put set up a tent for himself then mother aisha mother hafsa mother zainab they all set up these tents out of jealousy so he got angry of them and said take them all out so this means that women can have atticaf in the masjid but it is not that recommended for them because we know that praying in their homes is better than their attending the prayers in the message so a woman does not perform ertiga unlike what most people think they think that earthy calf can be done in prayer halls or in a musalla and this is not true etiquette can be done in my home this is not true ertikaf can only be done in a full fledged message that is what nobody can sell nobody can move to somewhere else so it's not a prayer hall it's not a muslim it's a full-fledged masjid a woman who does not go to the masjid she does not perform ertikaf but she sits home she reads quran she prays she makes the care and she makes dua"
