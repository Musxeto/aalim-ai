  "title": "What type of dog nullifies our prayer?",
  "transcript": "furthermore dran Abu Bakr sent us an email asking about the kind or the type of a dog that when passing in front of a person offering prayer this would interrupt his prayer and it would void it and the the answer is in the Hadith but maybe some of you may not know this fact well it is an authentic Hadith in theah where the Prophet Alat wasam told us that if a person is not praying to autra is not praying to a visor or a petition in front of him and a woman a donkey or a black dog passes between his footsteps and where he prostrates then his prayer is void and this Hadith was not accepted by mother AA may Allah be pleased with her thinking that this was something different to what she believed in because she had a misconception yet this was a mistake from her may Allah be pleased with her because all the other companions such as and all the other companions who reported such a Hadith or applied its verdict they all accepted it to be an authentic Hadith her misconcept ction was that how would a woman void a man's prayer if she passes through him when the prophet Alam used to pray night prayer while I was lying in front of him and the scholars answered this uh uh simply by saying that the prophet said that passing of one of these three nullifies the prayer voids the prayer but if you're praying to a woman who is either standing sitting or lying down she did not pass in front of you and therefore your prayer is valid likewise we so many times pray to men stand sitting in front of us and use them as a visor or as a Sutra therefore there's nothing wrong in that so is this to all kinds of dogs the answer is no it's only for a black dog who is completely black and why is that well because this usually is that such a dog is a devil meaning that it is the top in evil among his peers so the prophet described him as a Shan and we take it as it is we don't go into details only the black dog that from dogs in general that would void your prayer and not if if he passes like 3 m in front of you he has to pass pass between where you stand and where you place your forehead when you prostrate so if he passes away from that your prayer is valid and it is not affected inshallah"
