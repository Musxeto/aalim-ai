  "title": "Ruling on seeking unbeneficial or worldly knowledge? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Fadhil from India Fadhil Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaikumussalam to Allah Sheikh, we know that Prophet ï·º used to seek refuge from the knowledge that's not beneficial Correct Right, so what will be the ruling on the knowledge that especially in Indian education system is that they teach us about the biographies about the famous people and force us to memorize it Okay, so Fadhil's question is crystal clear. We have a curriculum in school. We have 15 subjects. Beneficial subjects such as biology, chemistry, physics, language, etc. But we have one or two subjects that we are forced to study, otherwise we'll not be able to graduate, that speaks about Hindus or Sikh or things that have no benefit, none whatsoever for us Muslims. We're obliged to do it in order to pass the exams. And this is a problem if we say, okay, we seek refuge in Allah from knowledge that's not beneficial and yet we have to quit school, then we will remain to be janitors and trash collectors for the rest of our lives. Not that these professions are bad, but they're not what we aspire to. We want to serve the ummah and the community and they are serving the ummah and the community but not like a surgeon or a doctor or engineer is. So you have high aspirations. But if I study these unbeneficial sciences or knowledge due to being compelled to do Inshallah, it's a win-win and Allah knows best."
