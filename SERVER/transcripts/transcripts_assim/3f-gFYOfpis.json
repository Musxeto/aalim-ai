  "title": "Prayer behind an Imam who only offers ONE salam at the end, is it valid? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Obey from Tunisia. Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi. My question is, is my prayer valid if I pray behind an imam? He only gives one salam at the end of the prayer. If so, what do I do? Because all of the messengers near me just do this. This is, Abu Jazakum, to offer one salam in fard prayer, this is a shadh opinion. And the Prophet ï·º did never offer a salah with one salam except in the funeral prayer. So if this is something that this man is following, a reputable school of thought, and I don't know of such a school of thought, but if he is and he believes that's only one salam that is mandated upon him and obligatory and the other one is a sunnah and he skips it, you offer the second salam and your prayer is valid inshaAllah. And it's best that you find a masjid and an imam that follows the sunnah and embraces it."
