  "transcript": "face says how to do - mm and what are the conditions tear mom can only be which is interpreted as dry ablution can only be done when a person is unable to use water for evolution or for purity whether due to lack of water there's no water or because he is unable to use it due to some physical hindrance something that prevents him from using it how is it done it is to strike the ground the soil the sand earth the rocks with once and then there are two ways of doing it either to wipe your hands to the rest like this and then what wipe your face or do the opposite that is strike it once wipe your face and then wipe your hands which one is correct well Sahih al-bukhari and elsewhere the hadith narrated narrated by a marble Yasser I think may Allah be pleased with him and with his father stated that the Prophet began with wiping his hands first and then wiping his face and the ayah in the Quran when it talks about TM mom it says that to wipe your face and your hands so it is an issue of dispute among scholars some say we begin with what the Quran began with others say no we follow the hadith of the Prophet Allah saw some especially when in the hadith it stated some mess aha waha summa means that this is in order not just any and it means that this was done after that and the most authentic opinion is that both in sha allah are valid I would personally begin with the face and afterwards with the hands and allah azza wajal knows best"
