  "transcript": "Shake. My question is regarding the issue of raid the raising of hands in prayer. I currently follow the Hanafi school of thought and we raise our hands only in the beginning of the prayer based on the narration of Abdullahbasa authenticated by some scholars including ali but so many people come and tease us and compare us to Gadian and call us the enemies of prophet and give the references of and claim it is a book written by Imam Bkari. So my question is regarding the issue of the polyan and the is the book authentic or not the Jew by first of all the issue of labeling someone who does not follow a particular sunnah that's the ruling of it that it is recommended not that it is halal haram rather it's a sunnah if you do it you're rewarded if you don't do it you're not sinful labeling ing people who abandon such a sunnah as enemies of Islam is the work of these are ignorant imbeciles. No Muslim who follows the sunnah when seeing afi not raising his hands in and after rising from would say that oh he's an enemy of the sunnah or that he's this or he's that. Why? Because it's a sunnah. Even in the beginning of the salat if I lead the the prayer and I say and then I [Music] say I don't raise my hands my prayer is valid 100%. I don't put my hands on my chest. I don't have to. It's not a must. It's a recommended sunnah. But if I don't the prayer is valid. So to neglect the most important issues in Islam and focus on causing enmity and grudges between the Muslims over a trivial issue which is the Sunnah. But it's a trivial issue compared to the big issues. Not that it is not important. Yes, it is part of the Sunnah. But is it as important as having the unity among the Muslims? Of course not. To focus on that. This is the strategy of Shayan. and whoever follows it is a follower of it's like when I go to and I've heard this so many times they say if we raise our hands in in rising from the if we say after after if we don't wear a topy or a cap people would almost fight with us these are ignorant imbecile so what because They're focusing on something that is not part of the salat in the sense that it would invalidate it. It is a sunnah. If you do it, you reward it. If you don't, you miss a great deal of reward, but there is no sin on you. So don't go to extreme and listen to these imbeciles who say you're enemies of Islam. But at the same time have a free will in following what the prophet did and his companions. Not following Imam Shafi, Imam Ahmed, Im Malik or Imam Abu Hanifh. They're all great scholars of Islam, but they're not mentioned in the Quran nor in the Sunnah. And in the Quran, Allah tells us to obey and follow the Quran and to follow his sunnah. So we look at what the prophet did and we follow it and then you will be on the right path."
