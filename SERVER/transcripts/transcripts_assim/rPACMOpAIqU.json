  "transcript": "can we support our favorite Cafe country or team when they are playing against a Muslim country or team first of all the issue of supporting a team over another is a general issue therefore it's not a particular answer that can fit any question generally speaking it's permissible to support a particular team because you like this style there the way they they play you like a particular player there however when we say this we have to pay attention to the fact that as a Muslim should I be wasting my time devoting my energy and my allegiance to such a silly thing called a sport or a game we've said this many times I have no problem at all in people playing sports going to the gym hitting the soccer field doing healthy things themselves but to sit on their backside wasting four or five hours a day supporting a group of players they may have tactics they may have style they may have talents but still this is not beneficial for you the prophet Isis I'm used to seek refuge in Allah from knowledge that is that's not beneficial secondly when the the the team that you're supporting is a kaffir team or belongs to a cafe country or they are wearing Haram attire like crosses and tattoos and all the likes and you support them what kind of a Muslim are you what type of a Muslim are you will you support someone who's all over his body there's ink and tattoos and weird haircuts are these your eye your Your Role Models are these the people you look up to then you have a problem because these specimens are not are nothing at the sight of Allah disbelievers they're away from nature in the way they look and the way they behave yet you support them and you love them and you would probably faint if you say see them in real life taking their autograph trying to take a selfie with them what kind of Muslim are you was alive you you would not have done one percent of these things to him let alone uh maybe go and and shake hands with him you have a problem now when this Cafe country is playing against a Muslim country and you still have the audacity to support the disbelievers yes it's not Jihad it's not a battle that you should take sides but nevertheless it reflects what's in your heart and most people who don't feel bad about this they have a seed of hypocrisy that is growing bit by bit through time without them knowing it and all of a sudden you'll be shocked to see the end result may Allah protect us all so definitely you have to go through this again"
