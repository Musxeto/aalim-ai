  "transcript": "Z from Kashmir my question is regarding theam of who I have been told the of the of you mean the belief in the life of the prophet in his grave yes I have been told that if you don't believe that the prophet is alive in his grave in the life of Al you are out of the fold ofama and prayer behind you is invalid I am confused because we don't they don't force us to believe that the prophet is physically alive rather they say he's alive in the life of alza which is a different life all all the dead are alive the life of the Barak but in one of your videos you told that the prophet is not alive there is a difference is he alive the life of our D yes or no no no no this is what I meant we have three Li levels we have this D we're alive when we die we are taken to our Graves and we're buried and we're considered dead in our standards of this life but in the standards of the Barak the those who are in the Barak they are alive in the sense that they're being tormented or they're being favored and blessed by Allah so in their grave their life is different than ours so if they mean that the prophet is alive like us today and he eats and drinks like us and if we open the grave and take him out he could walk this is insane this is not from definitely because Allah stated in the Quran you're dead so his life in the Barak is different than his life on Earth and it's different than his life on the day of judgment for eternity this is what we meant but when we say those in the graves are they alive or dead no they're dead by our standards they don't drink they don't eat they don't get married by our standards otherwise we could have get gotten them out and let them resume their life they're alive as per the standards of the bar of the standards of our life here and Allah Knows Best"
