  "transcript": "Abdullah from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikum Sheikh my question is something that is very common in the UK is when people want to watch sports, football, cricket, whatever, they don't pay for the channels, they go on the website and watch it. And this website is easy, you just click, you just go on the website and press play and then most of the time it comes on. And I'm not sure, I think it could be hadith or not, but it's so widespread in the UK. But the police, from what I've seen, they never catch anyone. They try to catch people who's providing the service to watch these sports and stuff. So my question is, providing if the watching these don't get in the way of our obligations such as Salah and our studies and stuff, is it permissible to watch these? First of all, if the material you're watching is halal, such as crickets, and there isn't anything haram involved, and these websites are open freely. I don't have to hack or to violate any rights. It's there, it's free. I'm just browsing the World Wide Web and I find this website that's showing live games of cricket. There's no sin on me, I did not do anything. This is something available. It's the problem of the organizers, the owner of the channel to go and track these websites and close them down. Otherwise, I see no problem in doing this, like reading PDF files of books. And people say that this is copyrighted. It's on the website, what do I want me to do? Give the author a call? If I go to a public library, I'd find the book there. And if I find it on a website and I just read it and I'm not making money out of it. I see no problem in that and Allah knows best. Copyright Â© 2020, New Thinking Allowed Foundation"
