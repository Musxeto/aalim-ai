  "transcript": "Turab from Russia Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh May Allah bless you and help you understand my question So I want to open a business and the question is what is the most no no in which way of earning money so a business or some craft is the most barakah in this life and the next life according to the Quran and the Sunnah apart from like being a da'i or Islamic teacher and etc. Do you know Turab of any merchandise or line of business mentioned in the Quran and the Sunnah that we're supposed to do yes or no? No Sheikh. So why would you ask me such a question? Imagine that if I tell you making tea mugs is one of the blessed businesses in the Quran and the Sunnah and hypothetically there is something like that wouldn't it be that everybody is going to work in selling and manufacturing tea cups or mugs? It doesn't make any sense. Islam is a generic proactive religion. It is suitable for every generation and every location on earth. People in Alaska or in Siberia in Russia they may not use tea mugs or tea cups they may use something else. So business is different. You have to become an innovative person come up with new ideas and adapt to the environment and see what the demand and the supply is about and this is where the barakah is. As long as you don't sell haram, you don't lie, you don't cheat, even if you sell sand Allah will put barakah in it. Whatever you sell or buy or produce as long as you're truthful and you're sincere and you don't cheat or use Allah's name in vain you are inshallah blessed."
