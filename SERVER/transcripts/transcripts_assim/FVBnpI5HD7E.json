  "transcript": "As-Salamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu And has two accepted rak'ahs in it when it's free and liberated. Ali from Pakistan. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh, if a woman has a habit of fasting Ashura but due to her period she is unable to fast, will she get the reward of getting her sins forgiven a previous year or does she need to make it up on a later date to get the reward? This date, whether it's Ashura or Arafah, cannot be made up. It's unlike Ramadan. Ramadan, if you have a legitimate excuse, Allah stated in the Quran in Chapter 2 to make them up later on. But these other days, that specific days, such as Ashura, such as Arafah, such as the three white days, they cannot be made up. If a woman had the habit of fasting it every single year, once she falls sick or has her menses or she travels, then Allah would grant her the same reward as every year and Allah knows best."
