  "transcript": "Zeeshan from Kashmir Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu Sheikh so my question is that my father always gives me a daily allowance whenever I go to college so that allowance is basically 70% of that money is for travel and 30% is for buying some food now my travel money is always saved because my friend drops me near my house so do I have to pay this money back to my father that travel part of it or I can keep it and use it for something else this is dependent on what you think and believe your father has given you the money for if your father's income is very small and little yet he manages to give you from his hard-earned money this amount or this allowance knowing that you'll spend 70% on your travel and 30% for your food then Alhamdulillah if you go with your friend you should make this clear to your father and say listen I know you suffer and work hard for the money 70% of the allowance I don't need it because I go with my friend but if your father is well-off and he gives you this amount and hypothetically saying 70% is for your travel 30% is for your food but in essence he doesn't care if you save the whole amount and use it in something else if you use the whole amount for your food and inviting your friends or if you use the whole amount for traveling it doesn't matter for him it's a gift for you in this case you can do with it whatever you wish and Allah knows best you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all Al-Fatiha"
