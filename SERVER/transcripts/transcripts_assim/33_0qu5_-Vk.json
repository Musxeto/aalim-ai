  "transcript": "Abdul Rahman from India. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi. Due to urine inconsistency, sometimes one or two drops urine came out of my, came out and I don't know where they fall on my clothes. And in rainy season, sometimes roadside mud splashes on my dress. Even if I cleaned it, some stains remains. So if I pray with these clothes, will my prayer be valid? I can't change the clothes because I'm on the way to work or the difficult times. Abdul Rahman, one question. When you say one or two drops fall on your trousers, do you see them? Yeah, I feel, I feel like. I feel. I feel is a phrase of doubt. And certainty is not affected by doubt. Whenever you hear yourself say, I feel, I think, I believe, maybe, perhaps, immediately disregard this doubt and throw it in the dustbin. Because everything is pure until proven. Underline proven and put high bold, highlighted, change the color, put it in caps, all caps, proven. If you don't have proof, then you disregard it."
