  "transcript": "similar that a brother saying that he wants to marry a convert but his parents are against it and what should he do converts are different some converts don't wear the hijab wear Min skirts uh converts and mix with men and celebrate uh uh Haram uh feasts and would probably have no problem in sitting on a table with poor and wine and and and having a good time of course you have to obey your parents because this woman does not check all the boxes a convert that checks all the boxes meaning she is a practicing muslima much more practicing than born Muslim women who don't I'm not pointing at anyone I'm not looking I don't even I don't come at me I'm just saying this so some Muslim women don't even practice half of what she's practicing so definitely go for that revert if she checks all the boxes and she's a good practicing sister"
