  "title": "Covering hands Mandatory for women? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Ana from Uganda Assalamu Alaikum Salam to Allah You say that you agree with the opinion that says that it is mandatory for a woman to cover the face So what of the hands? Is it also mandatory? Okay This is an issue of dispute Whether the hand is mandatory to be covered or not I personally follow the opinion that says that it is mandatory to cover Because even if a woman is covered from head to toe And her hands are visible From her hands, expert men can tell her weight, her age, her complexity Sort of a number of factors that would give a hint of how she looks So it's best for men and for women that women are totally covered And they exclusively save this to their husbands, to their mahrams, fathers, brothers, uncles To women folk who can look and enjoy what they see without any haram being involved Other men would not enjoy such luxury Because they're ordered to lower the gaze And when they see something that is tempting Shaytan may mess up with their heads and make them sin And you would be contributing to that sin May Allah protect us all Al-Fatiha"
