  "title": "I asked a Hindu restaurant if they used Nutmeg, can I trust them if they say it has not been used",
  "transcript": "Suleiha from India. Yes, Suleiha. I ask a vegetarian food stall run by Hindus whether they use nutmeg or not and they said no. Can I trust them to eat from them if I am not sure whether the food has nutmeg or not? Okay, first of all, the issue of nutmeg has been thoroughly discussed and we said that it's an issue of dispute whether little amount is possible and permissible or not. And in countries like Saudi Arabia, they allow food that has nutmeg with little amount that does not intoxicate or impact a person's sanity. And it's an issue of dispute as stated earlier. So, if you follow either way and the shopkeeper that sells vegetarian food only states that it does not include nutmeg and you have no reason to disbelieve him, there is no problem in buying it inshaAllah and Allah knows best."
