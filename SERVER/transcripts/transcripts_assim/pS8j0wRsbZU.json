  "title": "Can we make a congregation before the actual congregation as School gives us little time to pray",
  "transcript": "now faison from india is it permissible to make a congregation before the actual congregation in the masjid like for example our school allows us to go to the masjid but gives us little time to pray so we have to return before the actual congregation so is it permissible for us to make a small congregation with our friends and then leave before the former and if it is haram should we repeat those prayers it is totally prohibited for people to establish congregation in a masjid before the actual congregation as this defies the purpose of having one imam and defies the purpose of uniting the muslims together behind one imam so your options are as follows number one ask the imam to make their congregation the original congregation immediately after the adhan for the sake of the students in the school and most likely he would not accept that so your second option is not to pray in the masjid pray in the school itself with the congregation or outside of the masjid so that you would not disturb the unity of the muslims in that message imagine when you come and establish prayer and there are people waiting for the original congregation and see a congregation being conducted the vast majority of them they will leave the imam and they will catch up with you because they're 10 minutes earlier it's good for their timings it's suitable for them and that would cause a lot of problem and allah knows best you"
