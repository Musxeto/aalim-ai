  "transcript": "the currencies are considered to be or weighed or compared to silver not gold why see 85 grams of gold is like maybe 20,000 reals while 595 grams of silver is approximately maximum 2000 riyals so the difference is 10 times if we were to tell people yet the money you save in the bank or under your mattress if it completes one year and it reaches 20 thousand reals you give zakat if you do your analysis you'll find that only maybe 10 percent of the population would be able to give zakat but if you say that if the amount you are saving is 12 mm reals and above measuring it by silver not gold you'll find that 90 percent of the population will give zakat so which of the two options is better and more in favor of the poor and the needy definitely the latter and this is why the scholars like chef in Baz Luhrmann if they mean and the Muftis inside Arabia all say that you calculate the value and the threshold of your wealth money-wise by silver and not by gold so that this is in the favor of the poor"
