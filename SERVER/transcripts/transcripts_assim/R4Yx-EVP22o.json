  "transcript": "mohammed al says if today my wife and i are going for Umrah and she has menses what can she do and what can't she do from the beginning of the meat pot will she be in a Haram condition till menses finishes and complete Tawaf and cutting hair has she to follow the condition of a Haram that is uncovered face and wrists brother mohammed el has many questions but I'll try to sum them up first of all if a woman comes for ombres or Hajj we know that a man and a woman must assume the state of a Haram and prohibit the things that are restricted for a person who is in the state of a Haram from what is known as the meat at certain places and areas anyone that is that are surrounding Makkah anyone who's flying or driving or whatever traveling to coming through must assume Haram at that area not before after exceeding it no they have to do it at that area or before so if a woman comes and then she gets her menses before reaching them apart she has two options one either to cancel her Umrah altogether so she goes with her husband stays in the hotel room and he does his ambra he does whatever he wants and then go back with him option two that she assumes her Haram though she has her monthly period on how is that done simply she takes a bushel and she wears the Haram she says the baked ilaha mohammed providing that she has to wait the entire time until she is purified and then performs her a major ritual bath herrwusel and then resumes her or umrah through Tawaf sai cutting her hair and that's it some people say okay but we don't have enough time we have only one day or two day then this case you have to refer to option number 1 which is cancel it next time you come you do it now if she assumed her state of a Haram while she was pure and after a couple of hours she got her menses that's problematic if she did not make a condition meaning the woman knows that probably today tomorrow I will get my menses not me of course her she says what to do we say assume your harm and make a condition what do you mean share my condition you say Lebec allahumma ombres for in habits and hobbies for Mihaly hi - hi Bustani oh Allah I assume my Umrah I'm now in my harem but you make a condition if I were to be prevented if I will be to be blocked from continuing my Umbra then I may take off my alarm and go back to my previous state so if you said that and then you were faced with the situation where you got your menses then there's no problem you canceled your Umrah do i have to slaughter no you don't have to do anything you made the condition sure I did not make the condition what should I do now you're in a big trouble because now you have to stay in your state of a harm until you finish it perform well and then continue you mean I cannot cut my hair no I cannot cut my nails no I cannot wear perfume I cannot have a be intimate with my husband no you cannot so if she says ok I live in Jeddah it's an hour drive so you go back you wait once you're pure you take a rooster you go and continue or resume your Umrah without the need of resume assuming a harem again because you are still mad if she says sure I live far away and we traveled by airplane and it's difficult for us to come except in the next six months or so or maybe year in this case the scholars say due to necessity then you may resume your Umbra in the state of menses because you cannot do anything else and this is the choice of Sheikh al-islam iemon tamiya then allah azzawajal knows Best Buy"
