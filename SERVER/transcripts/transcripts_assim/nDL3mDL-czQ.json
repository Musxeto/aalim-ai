  "title": "I watch haram & see car accident I turn it off fearing Allah will punish me that way (Superstition?)",
  "transcript": "well I don't know if it's a belief in bad moments or a belief in superation or what it is for example if I watch a video with music I know that I'm sinful for it but if there is something bad in the video for example someone if if it's what if it's what if but if there is something bad in the video for example someone got into an accident I think that Allah will punish me like in the video because I was listening to music and so I turn off the video so as not to get into an accident as a punishment yeah this is this has nothing to do with Superstition this has to do with fearing Allah's punishment now Allah's punishment may not necessarily be similar to what you had seen in the video which is an accident it may be even worse and it may not materialize in this life Allah May store it for you in your grave or may store it for you on the day of judgment and you will be admitted to hell for for that so this fear in you of being punished which makes you refrain from continuing to do this sin is a fear of Allah and that's positive"
