  "transcript": "um my sister who recently husband died and her friend as well that lost her husband as well both of them visit the graveyard while they there her friend says that we have to recite Surah Y andah and my sister she doesn't know whether this is right for her to do that because she says give be blessing their grave if they do that okay first of all may Allah have mercy on both of their husbands second of all it is an issue of dispute whether women are entitled or permitted to visit cemeteries and graveyards and the opinion that I follow and it's the opinion of binaz and the major Scholars of uh uh Saudi Arabia is is that it is prohibited because the prophet Alam cursed those who frequently visit the grave yards and it's an issue of dispute but this is what I am inclined to so they must not go and visit the graveyards thirdly and finally when people go and visit a graveyard it is totally prohibited for them to recite the Quran whether it's Yin or mul or Bak or fa which is the most commonly recited whenever a disease is mentioned so Uncle so and so died no let's recite the fat alhamdulillah and they spit here and there what what are you doing said no this is part of the culture whenever a deceased person is dead we recite faat and whenever someone is getting married we recite faat as if getting married and dying is the same thing it might be but anyhow this is not our topic so this is an a what to do when visiting a grave you make Dua oh Allah forgive them oh Allah expand their graves oh Allah fill it with mercy and light blah blah blah blah but not to recite the Quran and Allah Knows Best"
