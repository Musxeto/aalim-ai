  "transcript": "they're asking me about a project um started by some brothers and it's called global prayer and the idea is that all the muslims unite themselves at 6 00 p.m makkah time or whatever uh or gmt on the day of artifact so that which is 15 or 16th of november so that they raise their hands and pray for our brothers and sisters from uh palestine and other countries and so allah would uplift the oppression being inflicted upon them and so on so they're asking what is the ruling on this the ruling is that this is innovation no one ever said that okay now this is the global prayer time everybody is in alafad we have like three million people it's uh five o'clock in the evening just before sunset everybody's supplicating so let's join hands why not also wear pink uh uh t-shirts for example like they've done here or there all of this is innovation to it's not part of solidarity it is not part of showing your unity your unity is shown through following the quran and the sunnah those who are not in arafat it is not their time to offer this dua and particularly on that particular time so even if you are on the states or if you're on japan you also try to fix your alarm clock so that you could coincides with those who are on out of standing on arafat no this is not uh correct and this is part of the vida and one should not circulate such a thing or should not even participate in such a thing because it's an innovation"
