  "transcript": "thirdly what to do when I want to make croupier because some people say do I put my over the head of the person I'd like to make rupiah for or do I just recite the Koran what's the procedure again we have to go back to the Quran and the Sunnah and mainly to the sooner the prophet alayhi salat wa sallam has narrated by mother Aisha may Allah be pleased with her whenever he used to go to bed he used to blow and then recite the last three holes of the Quran and then wipe whatever he can from his body but if he felt pain in his body now this is the night coat and coat rupiah or bed at car but the actual rope here whenever he felt pain in his body he used to recite the three oils then blow not the opposite and then he wipes over it when he was sick at the end of his life mother Aisha said I used to gather his own hands agreed in them the three holes blow and wipe his body with his own hands which means that mmm no he says the actual blowing is part of the rakia so whether you blow on your grandmother by reciting al-fatiha idol could see the last two ayahs of surah al-baqarah and the last three pulls and you dry blow on her or you do that on your hand and wipe on her this is hella this is okay there's no problem in that insha'Allah but you have to be present I've heard of some rakhis who are performing rakia long distance and that's mighty fine to me he's in the states and the people are in India and he goes alhamdulillah and I mean he blows in his head phone or his handset and sometimes they go into conference call so UK Korea and India in the same call what is this this doesn't work at all this is totally bogus and it does not work"
