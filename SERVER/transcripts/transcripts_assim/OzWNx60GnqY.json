  "transcript": "Medina from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullah So sometimes I deal with kids in the mosque or something like that and they sometimes are encouraged to do haram from their parents for example I was in the mosque and I played with kids and the mother wanted them to be quiet so she got out her phone and wanted them to watch like a TV series and I didn't know how to react and like if I should encourage them to not watch it or I don't know because obviously they're not my kids but I didn't want them to watch that or for example in other cases I was in with kids that have like non-Muslim parents and I didn't know like if I should tell them that for example saying something wrong is not good for them or I don't know because I'mâ€¦ As for the first incident where Muslim children may watch haram content in the masjid you have to tell them that this is haram and this is inappropriate but in a nice and diplomatic way that children would accept and love by like by saying oh don't you know this is the house of Allah and Allah is angry when we watch such things so it is not permissible to be watched at least if you want to watch it you have to leave the masjid and you you're not allowed to raise the volume there's music there's haram things and Allah is watching us maybe that would help of course talking to their parents to their mother directly is more beneficial at this moment but if this is not applicable or not possible then you have to do this with the children if they listen alhamdulillah if they don't you have done your duty and Allah Azzawajal knows best"
