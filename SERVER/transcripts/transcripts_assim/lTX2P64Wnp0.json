  "transcript": "caller is from india brother muhammad sheikh my question is there is a hadith in sahih al-bukhari and it states that allah has hated us hated for us three things vain talks wasting of health and asking too many questions in disputed religious matters or asking others for something shaykh i ask questions in disputed religious matters to get the most authentic opinion is this haram okay i will answer inshallah muhammad from india he says allah uh the prophet said allah that allah hated for you three things and hadith was narrated allah has hated for you three things gossiping and chit-chatting to ask a lot and to sponder and waste your money so asking a lot does it refer to asking questions about religion in a nutshell no to elaborate questioning at the time of the prophet sallam a lot was prohibited because it was a time of legislation so the prophet alaihis allah said to his companions leave me as long as i leave you as long as i don't mention it to you don't ask what's your ruling on drinking green tea in a mug without sugar with mint of course so i did not say anything or comment on it and there is nothing in the quran to talk about it or against it so why are you bringing it up don't ask because there is a possibility that if you ask it may burden the whole ummah after hajj with the prophet as islam the prophet said was standing and talking to the congregation one of the companions stood up and said oh prophet of allah is this hajj we have just performed every single year for us or once in a lifetime so the prophet salaam was angered by this question because if he were to say every single year that would have burdened two billion muslims on earth but he said to them leave me as long as i leave you as long as i did not discuss it then don't bring things up because it's time of legislation after the death of the prophet allah there's no legislation possible the deen is complete so asking questions that are relevant that are genuine even if plenty is a good thing what is not permissible is to ask about hypothetical things a brother calls me sheikh if i were to travel to the moon or to mars and it's time for prayer where should i face or how do i know the times of prayer i said to the brother when you get there give me a call and i will find you an answer inshallah this is hypothetical you're not one in a million or a billion or even five billion that have the possibility to go there why ask sos yeti you know questions therefore such questions are prohibited but on daily daily basis you ask questions frequently oh how can i wipe over my socks if i am a traveler oh if i take off my socks is my wudu broken or not and you keep on asking these questions to learn your religion this is totally permissible as the interpretation of kathra to sual can mean to literally ask a lot of questions or to beg money when you ask people for money this is also and it also can be asking about things that are not of your business none of your concern and we sit with so many people like this and they're heavyweight and he just sits there with you in the waiting room in a in a clinic or somewhere and just chit shots so what do you do i do this and that how much you are are you getting paid i don't know the guy and he keeps asking questions um how many wives do you have how many kids what is this fbi am i under interrogation here and he keeps on asking such questions this is not permissible in islam as the prophet says a sign of a person's good islam that he does not get his himself involved in what is not of his business you"
