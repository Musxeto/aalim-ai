  "transcript": "Kalume says as we know our every door is accepted either Allah answers it what we asked for or deflects harm from us or equivalent to it we had asked or Allah will store it on the day of judgment my question is we get this virtue when we ask dua with submission or even in lip service like now I'm asking you Allah send rain but saying without submission just lip service I did so will I get the above virtue as well in the lip service dois I believe that if I confirm is asking about is if I make du'a while I'm not a tentative I'm not having concentration to Allah solution like so many people after salat they would probably come and say Yara Beverly Arab Romney Arab we do this but they're looking left right center at on the watches they're not showing any submissiveness this duaa is not answered why the Prophet is awesome says in an authentic hadith oder allaha wa antumul in una be a java ask your lord while being certain that he will answer your door for allah does not answer dua from a heart that is neglectful and playful laughing he is not concentrating somewhere else so if you make duaa like a lot of the brothers and sisters in the subcontinent after each and every fort they do they wipe the face in they go and they do this as a routine and if you tell some of them what did you say he will not be able to say it all because he memorized it in a fashion that is so quick and fast when he comes to repeat it he makes mistakes so this is not with your heart attending the draw the dua that Allah answers or deflects harm in exchange or stores it for you on the day of judgment is the one that you say with your heart being present and you're not neglectful you know what you are asking Allah for"
