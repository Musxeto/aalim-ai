Ash-Shamaa'il is an Arabic word, it's plural of Ash-Shimaal and it is a science related to studying the characteristics of the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam whether related to him physically how he looks, how he appears his height, his colour, his hair, the way he walks or related to his ethics and moral conduct and behaviour which is related also to how he trusted Allah how he had hope in Allah, his content and his behaviour with his wives, with his children with his companions, with the non-Muslims and with the Muslims and his transactions whether it is commercial or social and also how he used to behave in the sense of his sleeping patterns, what he ate what he loved to dress in and also anything connected to him such as his rides, the animals he used to use his utensils, his bed, his household etc some of the scholars even included the things he used to do as forms of worship related to his prayer, to the way he fasted to how he performed Hajj etc Now one may ask a question what is the benefit of studying such a science when it's related to Seerah? So what's the difference between Al-Shama'il and the Seerah? Well, Seerah is a holistic form of science in the sense that it talks about everything that happened and took place in the life of the Prophet alayhi salatu wa salam So things are scattered in the Seerah it's exactly like Tafseer for example of the Qur'an you get to learn everything related to Tafseer all over the place but when it comes to Asbab an-Nuzul the reason of revelation of a particular ayah you'll find it scattered if you collect it in a book then you have the science of Asbab an-Nuzul likewise, the Seerah is a whole broad topic but when you collect from the Seerah the scattered information about how the Prophet used to sleep alayhi salatu wa salam and then put it in a chapter this becomes Al-Shama'il and Seerah as well has many aspects so it includes the Prophet's battles alayhi salatu wa salam the incidents that took place and it includes a lot about the companions where Al-Shama'il deals only and specifically about the Prophet alayhi salatu wa salam and the Seerah as stated earlier speaks a lot about everything while Al-Shama'il speaks specifically about the miracles in his life alayhi salatu wa salam the things that should be collected and focused upon rather than speaking in a genetic way what is the importance of studying such a science? first of all we know that the three questions in your grave that each and every individual of us will be asked upon are who is your Lord? what is your religion? and who is this man who was sent to you? so it's part of your religion to know almost everything about your Prophet alayhi salatu wa salam Allah says in the Quran don't they know the messenger that was sent to them or are they denying him? so the knowledge of the Prophet alayhi salatu wa salam is extremely important as Allah always selects the best of people to send as messengers and this is why all the time Allah azzawajal tells us that he sent to Aad their brethren Hud to Thamud their brethren Salih someone they know his lineage, his upbringing his ethics, his honesty, his integrity so in order for us to increase our Iman to the Prophet alayhi salatu wa salam we are required to study such a science also the more you study this science the more your love is increased to the Prophet alayhi salatu wa salam because if you don't love the Prophet alayhi salatu wa salam you're not a believer let's not beat around the bush there are some ignorant imbeciles among the Muslims who say I follow the Prophet, I believe in him but I don't love him well you're not a Muslim you will not complete your Islam and become a full-fledged Mu'min until he becomes more beloved to you than your parents, than your wife than your children, than your own self than your own soul this is how important our love to the Prophet alayhi salatu wa salam it is part of the religion and there's nothing to him alayhi salatu wa salam he's not going to gain any wealth from us loving him but this is part of the religion then we increase once we know this science we increase in followership of him so the more you know the Prophet alayhi salatu wa salam the more you comply and follow him which would lead you faster and easier to Jannah and finally the knowledge we get from the science makes us steadfast on Islam which is something we highly need and is highly required in this era of fitna where everything around us is snatching the believers from their Iman and the enemies of Islam the enemies of Islam are plotting against our belief so when you know the science of Ash-Shama'il and how he behaved alayhi salatu wa salam this makes you steadfast in fighting these doubts and misconceptions that the enemies of Islam try to infiltrate our belief with so I hope by studying this science that we will get closer to Allah and that we will increase in our love to the Prophet alayhi salatu wa salam and this book we attempt to study is the authentic version of Ash-Shama'il al-Muhammadiyah which was originally compiled by the Imam al-Tirmidhi Sheikh Muhammad bin Nasr al-Din al-Albani may Allah have mercy on his soul he took the book and selected to us what is the most authentic of it and this is what we will attempt to study so I pray to Allah that it is a beneficial study and that we get closer to the love of our Prophet alayhi salatu wa salam through it May the peace and blessings of Allah be upon Muhammad May the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him May the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him"
