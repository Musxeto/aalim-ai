  "title": "Can I shorten & combine prayers if Iâ€™m traveling to do something Haram (sin)? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Al Haig from India, or Al Hajji. Al Hajji. Assalamu Alaikum Sir. Assalamu Alaikum. Sir if one has the prior knowledge that where he's going there will be haram like free mixing and music, is he still allowed to certain prayers? And also if I'm able to certain prayers and also pray in full, which one is better? To pray in full or certain prayer as a travel? First of all, the scholars say that a person whose intention to travel is to commit sin, he cannot shorten and combine prayers. Because this concession was made by Allah Azza Wa Jal to ease your travel which is halal. Someone is travelling to XYZ country to fornicate and to party all night long and to consume intoxicants and to deal in riba and haram, he does not have the right to shorten and combine prayers and do these things that are concessions from Allah for those who are travellers. As the scholars, the majority of scholars have concluded. As for if I am travelling in a halal travel and I have the option of shortening prayer or completing, shortening is definitely best for you unless you attend the prayer with the congregation in a masjid and the imam is a resident who's completing, you have to and it's a must that you complete your prayer and Allah knows best. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all."
