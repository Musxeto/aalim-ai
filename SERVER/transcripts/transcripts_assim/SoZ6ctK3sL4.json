  "transcript": "A sister says, Ã¬Can you give some sound advice to our Muslim female vloggers?Ã® The advice I could give to male and female vloggers, number one, what are you? The answer, servants of Allah. Number two, what reason did Allah create you for? Answer, to worship Him as He created the jinn and the humans for the sole purpose of worshipping Him. Question number three, is anyone on earth not tested? Answer, no. All humans and jinn are being tested by Allah Azza Wa Jal. Question number four, those who pass the test, goes where? Answer is paradise. Those who fail the test, goes where? The answer is hellfire. Number five, are the things you're doing as a vlogger, regardless of the topic of your vlogs, are they in accordance to the Qur'an and the Sunnah? Or if we were to rephrase this, is Allah pleased with you? Is Allah agreeing with what you're doing? Most likely, the answer would be no. Allah Azza Wa Jal mandated hijab for Muslim women. Hijab is not a scarf or a piece of cloth that you wear. It's also an attitude. So Allah tells us, women have to wear the hijab. Difference of opinion, whether the face and the hands are included or not. Those who say, she must cover that, and there are those who say, no, she can uncover her face and hands. But, this is not all what Allah Azza Wa Jal has commanded women to do. They are commanded to go the extra mile by not softening their voice. Why? Because their voices may lure and seduce those who have illness in their hearts. So Allah says, do not soften your voices and be submissive when you speak, so that those with illness in their hearts would not be tempted, would not be seduced. Number three, you as women are not permitted to wear anklets that make sounds when you walk. Because this also has a very negative impact on men, normal and those who have illness in their hearts as well. And likewise, wearing high heels that have this sound when you walk, that would draw the attention of any man who's not looking. Not only that, in Islam, it is not permissible for a woman to put on perfume that men can find the scent. So, even if you're properly dressed, covered from head to toe, wearing low heels or a soft shoe that has no sound to it, and when you speak, you speak moderately or firmly, if you wear perfume and men can find the scent, you don't know what Satan does to them, to the men when they smell this fragrance. The Prophet said, alayhis salatu was salam, any woman who goes out of her home, passes by a group of men who could find her scent, her beautiful perfumes, she is as if she's an adulteress. Because she committed such a major sin in Islam. All of this gives you an idea how a woman should abide by her hijab. It's not only the piece of cloth she wears on her body, it's an attitude, it's a whole life transforming system where she conceals herself, her beauty and anything that may tempt men to be attracted to her. So now you tell me, when you go on your vlogs and you appear in different pauses, talking naturally, what is the impact you're leaving on me as a man? And why are you doing this? The only acceptable answer is for fame and recognition. And this is the curse of social media. Both on men and women, when a person gets recognized and acknowledged, the fame he gets when people talk about his vlog, about his website, about his app, about his YouTube and Instagram, he becomes an influencer. He becomes a celebrity. People would like to take photographs with him wherever he goes or wherever she goes. This kind of attention is a vacuum machine that would suck you in and leave you for dead. Because whenever fame is at the target of your actions, you lose sincerity. And it makes you compromise your religion. And lots of these women don't care about hijab after some time. Don't care. They even were modest in the beginning. Now they put eyeliners and shadows and some light makeup and some light lipsticks. What are you doing? This totally defies the hijab according to all scholars of Islam. Said, yeah, but I have to look a little bit nice. I have to hide my pimples. I have to hide some scars. I have to do this. I have to do that. So you end up losing your religion. You end up losing your Iman. You end up with a great deal of sins on your shoulders. For what? Just to be an influencer, just to be famous, just to be recognized by the people. Then what? You tell me by Allah. Will you find any benefit of this in your grave? The answer is no. Will you find the punishment of what you've done in your grave? The answer is yes. And what awaits you at the sight of Allah Azza wa Jal on the Day of Judgment is far worse. May Allah Azza wa Jal protect us and may Allah Azza wa Jal make our deeds sincere for His face. you"
