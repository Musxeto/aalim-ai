  "transcript": "if someone in the Masjid are doing prayer should I lower my voice when reciting Quran to give it to myself I did not get your question uh yeah I mean when I'm reciting Quran like uh when I make my my voice louder if there's person that is praying beside me should I lower my voice of course it is not permissible to raise your voice when someone else is praying as this would distract him and distract others the prophet sallallahu alai alai wasallam once came into the Masjid and patches of the companions were raising their voices with the Quran he said to them both are correct Arabic wise he said take it easy upon your yourselves because you're not calling someone who's deaf or far away rather you're calling someone who is near all hearing and all responding so it is not permissible for you to raise your voice like some ignorance do whether in prayer or outside of prayer for example we enter the Masjid on Friday while we're reciting the Quran or trying to make Dua or trying to make vick some ignorant imbecile r raises his voice with Surah and another one few meters away is annoyed by that so he raises his voice to counter that man's voice so that he would not be distracted and now the whole message is distracted what kind of ignorance is this people just don't think don't ask and they act just to please Shan and definitely shatan is happy for their obedience"
