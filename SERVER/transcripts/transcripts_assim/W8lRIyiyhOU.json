  "transcript": "and to Those whom Allah supports brother Muhammad from Egypt he had four questions the first question was regarding he's asking what should I do should I recite it loudly or silently if you're in your home it is recommended that you recite it a little bit loud so that you can hear yourself and in a Hadith when the prophet Alam uh passed by Abu bakr's house house and he was praying night prayer in a in a silent voice so he asked him oh Abu Bakr what are you doing why is it so silent and ab Bakr said may Allah be pleased with him oh prophet of Allah the one who I want him to hear me has already heard me so by reciting silently Allah hears what I'm saying so I don't not have to raise my voice and when he passed by uh Omar's house Omar may Allah be pleased with him was reciting it in a loud voice so he asked Omar what are you doing and Omar may Allah pleased with him said oh prophet of Allah I kick Satan away and I wake those who are asleep so the prophet said to Abu Bakr oh Abu Bakr raise a little bit oh Omar go down a little bit so the Sunnah the best way to do it is to recite while making yourself hear it so many times you think think that you know this Surah by heart and you recite it every single day for example every wi you recite it the minute you go and try to to lead the prayer with it you make mistakes Subhan Allah why because you've never heard yourself reciting it it's all the time just moving your lips and reciting it uh silently therefore reciting the Surah with a loud voice a little bit so that you can hear gives your night prayer a a big boost and a great impact"
