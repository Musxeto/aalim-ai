  "transcript": "says can i recite the quran without wudu can i touch the quran without wudu so these these are two questions the first one is can i recite the quran without wudu and the answer is yes it is permissible to recite the quran even if you're not in the state of which is the minor ritual impurity but the scholars say if a person is in the major ritual impurity resulting of ejaculation or intercourse meaning in the state of jannab then he must refrain as per the hadith of ali may allah be pleased with him that nothing used to prevent the prophet islam from remembering allah mentioning allah azza except being in the state of janaba which is the major ritual impurity so a person who is not in the state of wudhu or a woman in hermansis they can recite the quran without any problem at all as per touching the quran the vast majority of scholars and schools of thought say that this is not permissible and there are evidences and proofs that may not reach the level and degree of authenticity and strength however the number of scholars who prevented it and prohibited it makes one refrains from saying that yeah it's okay and therefore we tend to to be safe rather than sorry and in the maliki school of thought they say that touching the quran or parts of it is permissible in case if a person is in need of it on daily basis such as the people who go for circles of memorization of the quran those may need to touch the quran in the state of minor ritual impurity when they're not in the state of vudu and students and and the likes so as long as one is in that dire need and he's not doing this as a form of worship it's different from someone who just opens the quran wants to to read a whole his daily routine to get closer to allah then a person who's doing that as a form of education and he needs to do this to memorize or to revise the quran then insha allah this is permissible knows best you"
