  "transcript": "um risha says does shaytan eat with you if you do not say bismillah the answer is yes the hadith authentic hadith the prophet says when you eat eat with your right hand and when you drink drink with your right hand because shaytan eats and drinks with his left hand and the prophet said allah is that when you eat say bismillah because if you don't then satan would eat with you and in another narration a man forgot to say bismillah and he remembered well before the last morsel of his food so he said bismillah [Music] in the name of allah in the beginning and at the end so the prophet laughed allah so the man asked why are you laughing he said because i saw the devil throwing out everything that he had eaten so yes he does eat with you of course the food you don't see it missing but the barakah is what is being negatively affected"
