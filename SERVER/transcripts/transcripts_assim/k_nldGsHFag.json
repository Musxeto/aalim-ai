  "transcript": "we have rashid from tunisia i'm confused about something yes sir why i go here i find people who studied islam for years but they're doing badass and many of them are imams i never studied or anything but it's clear to me that what they are doing is wrong and when i speak against this people get angry and criticize me like i'm the one who is misguided i don't understand how could laymen like me know that all of these stupid things are bad as well with the shaykhs and imams okay i will answer inshallah from tunisia why do people who are knowledgeable who've studied islam fallen to biddah there are many reasons rashid first of all praise allah that he made you upon the sunnah and that he showed you bid from nanbida secondly lots of these people are ignorant though they have bachelor degrees and masters and maybe phds but they're ignorant because they are blind followers of what they've read and studied not what of what islam is truly about from the quran sunnah thirdly a lot of them are making money from their congregation with this buddha so the laymen love these innovations and these mystic sufi stuff and they don't want to change to proper islam so they follow their congregation and let the flock follow them and this is why they feel angry and may guide them up"
