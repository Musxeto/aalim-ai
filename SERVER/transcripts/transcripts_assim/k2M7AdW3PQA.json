  "transcript": "what is the distance between ladies prayer area and the men's prayer area because some masjids put it on the second floor some put it in the basement some people put a visor between men and women and some put a curtain etc all of this is up to the preference of the people of the masjid the sunnah was that men were at front and women were at the very back of the masjid no visor no curtains nothing separating them but the men at that time were more righteous and pious so even when the prophet islam concluded his prayer they would not turn their back or stand up and leave they would wait and the prophet would wait until the women would take their cover and properly cover themselves or leave the message then when the prophet salam turns his back to them they would move on nowadays people are different so putting glass or matters see through mirrors so that the men cannot see the women is permissible is it from the sunnah no it's not but it is something permissible depending on the preference of the people of the masjid"
