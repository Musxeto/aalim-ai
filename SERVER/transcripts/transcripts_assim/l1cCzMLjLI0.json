  "transcript": "Ishaq from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu So Sheikh, the company that I work for allows me to work from home Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu And to be honest, there isn't a lot of work that comes in But whenever there are tasks that I'm arraigned with I try to complete it in a timely manner without any delay So if there is no work for me to do Is it okay if I take short naps or do other stuff at home? Or will that make my income haram? Or should I spend the entire 9 hour shift in front of the system Looking at it even if there is nothing for me to do? Akhi, this is something related to what is expected from you If you're supposed to work from 9 to 5 And you know that everything you're assigned with That you fulfill it on a timely manner And in the best of professional fashion possible But this may require 2 hours of your 8 or 9 hour shift There is nothing wrong in doing whatever you want to do in the remaining time Providing that it does not conflict with the interests of your company So if you have email alerts and your mobile is on And you simply take a short nap And you are alert whenever anything comes your way There is no problem in that Some people I know who work from home They do push-ups and sit-ups and pull-ups and chin-ups And use their dumbbells and may walk on the treadmill Utilizing the time in physical fitness There is nothing wrong in that You're not supposed to be glued to your screen Just waiting for anything to come Because you know that the flow of work is not that urgent and consistent And Allah knows best"
