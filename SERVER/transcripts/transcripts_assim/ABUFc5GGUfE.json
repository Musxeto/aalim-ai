  "transcript": "i went home and take a nap and when i woke up i accidentally and found out that i missed the other congregational prayer in a machine so my question is if after that can i uh after missing the congregation in the machine can i sleep more time for ex for an extra hour okay so the question is obvious due to over sleeping he missed the congregation of asar so can he go back again to sleep for an extra hour and then pray it before maghrib time the answer is technically yes practically no how come you've missed the congregation of asar do you think that if you go back to sleep that you will be satisfied with the hour shaytan will come and most likely make you oversleep until maghrib time maybe until isha time so no your feeling of remorse and regret should not allow you to sleep again yes if you sleep it's halal and if you pray asar before sunset it's halal but this is not practical and shaytaan is messing up with your head so don't do that"
