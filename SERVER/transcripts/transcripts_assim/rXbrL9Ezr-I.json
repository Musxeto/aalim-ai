  "transcript": "What what about the obligation here? I I believe that this is the Islamic ruling. Such taxations are not permissible and it there's a long list for that. Nevertheless, as said, once you agree on living or on coming in to that country, you should abide by their laws as their laws do not go against your beliefs and religion. So if part of their laws, for example, as in the case of of Holland, and this is a a regulation, I think they've changed it. I'm not sure. Anyone who applies for their citizenship must undergo must watch one hour of pornography uh uh film, a blue movie. Mhm. Just to make sure that whoever is applying for the citizenship will uh uh uh blend in in their melting pot. M so if this is the case definitely this is not acceptable for us as Muslims but taxation as the brother said the roads you're driving over the electricity you're getting all the infrastructure all the benefits you're enjoying is part taken the taxes you have to pay and the Muslim does not lie so even if they're taking it unlawfully you should not lie because you would not be undermining your own reputation your your your reputation is nothing except to you but you will be undermining the reputation of Islam. Okay, just before we went to the break, brother Sharif mentioned a very important point that no matter which category of non-Muslims and we're talking from a societal perspective, we're talking from the society and the community that you're living in. We're not looking at all the categories we mentioned in the first uh segment. um no matter what idea that person might have with about you and about Islam, you have to deal with him. How does a Muslim really uh analyze the situation of dealing with for example in in in in the university you might meet someone that is atheist that is Jewish uh the Islam the people who really hate Islam. How does the Muslim really prepare in dealing with community? Well, first of all, as Muslims, we have a target. Mhm. Our objective is to call people to Islam. And this target, I would have to evaluate it. And it differs from one person to the other. Meaning, if I meet someone and he's a non-Muslim, I'd like to call him to Islam. I have to be wise and I have to be knowledgeable in how I call him to Islam. If I meet him from the first incident and I just say this is Islam, why don't you embrace Islam? Your religion is false. He'll not accept me. Mhm. And likewise, if he is, and I can see this in his eyes. If he, as brother Sharif said, looked at my dress or or my costume or whatever I'm wearing and he's having ideas about this dirty Arabs or terrorists or so. If I approach him, it won't be the right time. This is my target. I have to plan it well. I have to know when it's the right time to call him to Islam. For instance, the prophetat wasam, as the story says, had a Jew serving him. Was not in his house. He used to probably get groceries, do things for him as someone who is for hire. He was a child. Mhm. 13, 14 years old. And the prophetatam heard one day that the child was on his dying bed. Subhan Allah. He himselfat wasam went to the Jews house and the boy was lying on the bed and next to him was his father. The prophet wasallam seized the chance though the man or the boy to work for the prophetatam but it was not related to us. It was not narrated to us that he ever gave him dawa. Definitely we know that he gave him da by his character by the way he used to treat people sallallahu alaihi wasallam yet that was the final moment for the boy. So the prophetat wasam thought that this was the only chance or the remaining chance. So he visited the boy who was on his dying bed and said to the boy embrace Islam accept Islam. Mhm. The child or the boy looked at his father and his father nodded his head and he said, \"Obey Abasim, obey the prophetat.\" Though he was a Jew, but he knew that he was on the right path and that he was the messenger of Allah. And the boy embraced Islam. Mhm. The prophet went out of his house with his face shining. Mhm. And he was happy and he said may praise be only to Allah who guided him to Islam and saved him from hellfire because of meh was the means to do this. So this is a Muslim's objective is to call people to Islam. But you have to be careful. You have to choose the right moment. You can't go to someone who has um um he he's consuming intoxicants. Is the gin bottle half empty? And the guy is wasted and he's got a 45 on the table with red eyes and and a happy trigger. And you just say to him, come to him, say, \"This is haram. You're not allowed to do this. He's going to shoot you between the eyes.\" So, is this the right thing to do? Definitely not. You have to prioritize your dawa. You don't go to someone who doesn't pray, who uh slanders his father and mother and abuses them, who steals and deals in ribba and does everything that's wrong. You don't go to him and say, \"Brother, you have to clip your fingernails because this is Islamic.\" This is not the right thing to do. You have to know how and when to address them. That's why if a person is living in the this is how he deals with the others. Now having said that if I know and if I tried to call my friend my student uh uh colleague in the university to Islam like seven 8 10 times and the guy is refusing. He does not want to hear it. He says and he gave me a warning. Listen, you want to talk about Islam again, don't talk to me. Mhm. You want to have a good relationship, want us to go to the pub, you want us to go to uh uh nightclubs and and hang around and have fun, I'm okay with that. Don't you dare mention anything about religion, Christianity, Islam, or whatever. If this is the case, then I have to stop meeting this guy and utilize my time in calling others. So I change but if there's a chance I feel that he's good there is a probability that inshallah maybe next week next month maybe next year he'll embrace Islam he's not refusing the concept and and I feel that he is trying his best to accept Islam and and the Muslims then I may be in good contact with what I what I can see from your point here she is that you see it very important that we have to it is upon the Muslims there in the west um that they should keep a relationship with non-Muslims and to an extent a very close relationship because the ultimate goal of that relationship is to tell them about what Allah has blessed us with Islam. This is true. We have to have this relationship but Mhm. and this is a very big but what kind of relationship do I have with a non-Muslim? Is it the same relationship that I have with my brother Sharif for example? Mhm. Do I be friend with him? Do I give him my full support and if he needs anything I try my best to stand next to him because he is my brother. Allah mentions in surah verily that the belieers are brothers. So he's my brother for sure. Now I have a non-Muslim colleague at off at office. Mhm. So, does Islam tell tells me to spit on his face or to uh uh take the money of his wallet if he's not watching or to give him a flat tire at the parking lot because I don't like him? No. Islam tells us to coexist. Be kind to this guy. Be nice to him, but don't take him as your ally. I can have him as an associate. we can go for lunch break together with the intention that I want to call him to Islam but I don't go with him and hang around with him. I don't go every week three times to the uh tennis courts and and enjoy playing and I feel close to him more than I feel close to my brother Sharif here because Islam draws the line. Be good to people non-Muslims. Be kind to them as long as they're kind to Islam and they're not hostile to Islam and the Muslims. But do not take them as allies. Do not love them more than you love your Muslim brothers. Okay."
