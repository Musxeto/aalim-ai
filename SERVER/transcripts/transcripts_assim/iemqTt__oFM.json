  "title": "What is taraweeh, difference between taraweeh& tahajjud, should I pray Witr with Imam- Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "[Music] what is tell away when was the term taraweeh used first time why do we pray this normally we see the term p.m. Elaine more in hadith difference between tahajud and Tarawera how many raka should we pray should we pray Witter with the Imam well first of all we don't know exactly when the term taraweeh was invented most likely it was invented by the time of Omar may Allah be pleased with him or afterwards taraweeh was given to that prayer because people used to prolong it in length so between two rakahs or four Rakas they used to take a break in arabic they used to take raha so taraweeh is taken from Rahu and some say taraweeh is because they change between left and right foot resting on one of them because of the length of the prayer so when you stand idle one of your feet would probably ache so by leaning a little bit to the right and then after white words leaning to the left you tend to alternate and get a little bit of comfort out of that but the most authentic opinion is that the first one was used now what is the origin of taraweeh some say that it is a beta and what is a bid ah an innovation or a beta is something that is invented in religion that is not part of it with the intention of worshipping Allah and getting closer to him so some say that Allah has a beta and this is not true the Prophet himself alehissalaam initiated the Sunnah and the highest is authentic the Prophet prayed taraweeh prayer leading the Companions for three or four nights and then he refrained he stopped so the companions started calling him out Oh prophet of Allah come come and pray like you prayed the previous night's we like it so the Prophet came out to them and he said I have seen what you had done the previous night's had I not feared that Allah would obligate this prayer upon you I would have continued so listen to the prophets justification how his salat WA Salam it's a good thing I love it I know you love it but because I was afraid that Allah would make it obligatory upon the Ummah which leads which would lead probably to hardship I stopped it I was so merciful to my Ummah I didn't want to burden them with more obligations so the one who started it was the Prophet Arizona after he died what he had feared does not exist anymore and that is no one can obligate night prayer because he's dead how can it be obligated that is why when romanovna hot pop may allah be pleased with him in ramadan went out to the masjid he saw the Muslims praying in groups three people here ten people there five people here but they were not in congregation all of them so he ordered obey Him niqab to lead them in Tarawera so the all trading congregation taraweeh behind one imam rather than being segregated and spread all over the masjid behind many Imams and when he saw this he approved it and said that this is something that is good and he used the word baton near metal bit OTT II have a but Buddha here is not religious because in religion the origin is there which is the prophets doing Anna's son bida here is the linguistic terminology which is something new because they were praying in groups different groups what he had done is something new which is nice described as bida but it is not a religious bid that is bad in Islam again because the one who did it was a prophet a less awesome so he revived his Sunnah sallallahu alaihi wasallam how many rak'ahs do we pray taraweeh scholars differed some say 41 others say 39 some say 23 has prayed in the harem and some say 13 and some say 11 so which one should we take well those who restrict themselves and their followers to pray 11 they coat the hadith of mother Aisha may Allah be pleased with her when one of the tabi een said to her or asked her how many rock i did the prophet sallallaahu lamprey in ramadan she said my nephew and this is what the Arab say to whomever is younger than them Yamina my nephew the Prophet did not pray alakazoo son in Ramadan nor outside Ramadan more than eleven raka so those who specify only eleven rock has to be prayed take this hadith which was reported inside him a Muslim and hold it as an evidence not knowing or knowing but neglecting that mother Aisha herself said that the Prophet used to pray at night is awesome 13 raka and the hadith of even Abbas he said that the Prophet SAW Stalin used to pray 13 records per night so it's either 11 or 13 but is there any problem in increasing that it's an issue of dispute some say it is totally prohibited and their allegation is not so strong they say that the Prophet did not pray more than 11 but we know that he prayed 13 let us assume he did not pray more than 11 does this mean that it is not permissible to add there's no restriction in adding for example how many times is the Prophet a son perform Hajj in his life once so if I have the ability to perform it once every 5 years or if I I'm always invited every year to a camp in Hajj and I have the luxury of performing at once a year do you say that I shouldn't do that because the Prophet only performed Hajj once in his life so no no no of course we don't say that so push not only that when the Prophet SM was giving Jota a nomad a Bedouin came and interrupted him he said O Muhammad tell me about night prayer so the Prophet SAW shall have answered and me said night prayer is to be prayed in to - to Salah to lay Nemeth Nemeth 'no he gave him the format not the cart not the count not the number and then he said if you feared Fechter then offered one recorder and the man left now we know that if the number was essential the Prophet would not have salallahu alaihe wasalam delayed explaining it he would have called the man as it come come the format is - - but you should not increase more than eleven because the Prophet did not say this a little of Salaam we now understand that the sky's the limit so you want to pray 20 and pray wonder how with your three recorder no problem you're going to pray a hundred no problem you want to pray a thousand no problem because anyone who comes and says whoa you can't add more than eleven we say with all due respect this is wrong without providing the evidence that prevents us from training more we cannot limit people to this so yeah but mother Aisha said he did not offer more than eleven are in salat wa salam true but he did not offer more than one hatch in his life he did not offer more than two Umbra's in his life and so on so I hope this answers your question [Music] you [Applause]"
