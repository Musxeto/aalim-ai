  "title": "Is talking about your sins BEFORE Reverting to Islam exposing my sins?| assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Carlos from Brazil, Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh, Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Is it permissible to those who accepted Islam, talk about his previous sins before Islam, before shahada? It seems that this is not boasting your sins. As a kafir before Islam, Allah erases everything. So if a Muslim reverted to Islam, and then part of an interview he says, well in the past I used to do tattoos, I used to club, I used to party all night long, I used to drink intoxicants and do drugs, but now alhamdulillah after being guided I have committed to Islam. It seems that this is permissible. Is it recommended? It depends on your judgment, whether I'm adding something to the table, I'm giving incentive to non-Muslims to accept Islam or not. What is not permissible for someone who's a Muslim, and he used to do these things and then he was guided and repented and sought Allah's forgiveness and Allah forgave him. Now he's an imam, he's a sheikh, he's a normal human being and he goes around saying, I used to do drugs, I used to womanize, I used to party. No, this is totally prohibited, even if there is a good cause resulting from this and Allah knows best."
