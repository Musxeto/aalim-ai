  "transcript": "and we have um it's hack from india yes so my question is is it permissible for someone as a consumer to buy something that has huge demand let's say a new phone or a gadget that is very exclusive and has limited supply and then later sell it at a higher price for profit knowing that people would buy it because of its huge demand okay yeah i think he was asking about collector's items or something that has a limited edition and he says i would like to buy it and after a few years sell it for a profit is that permissible if the product itself is halal and there is no extravagance there's nothing wrong in that so if you buy a ferrari or for example and you store it for 20 or 30 years hoping that you would make a profit out of it this is halal if you have the money to spare but if there is extravagance if the if it is a a special ring or a historical uh a pen or something of the the nature now this would be extravagance it would be insane to buy such a portrait for a hundred million dollars or to buy such a chair of a a famous artist or a jacket or a glove of a fair famous pop artist all of this is extravagant and totally prohibited"
