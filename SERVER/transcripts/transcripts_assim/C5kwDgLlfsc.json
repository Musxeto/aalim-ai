  "title": "If my wife asks me to trim the beard, can I trim it (under pressure!) #Assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "N I have two questions the first question is about beard and the second one about moon sighting the question regarding the beard was is it a sin is it haram to trim theb this is an issue of dispute among Scholars the majority of the companions may Allah be pleased with them did not trim the beard and there is not a single Hadith that proves that the prophet Sall wasallam used to trim his beard on the contrary the authentic hadiths prove that the prophet Alam had a very thick and big beard that filled his chest to the extent that the asked the companions was the prophet Alam used to reciting in silent prayers like and they said yes they said how did you know if it's they said we used to see the trembling of his beard from behind his back we're standing behind him and we can see his beard trembling which means that he is moving his Jaws by reciting it silently as for trimming it there are a number of hadiths about the companions such as Abdullah Omar may Allah be pleased with him which he understood that the Ayah inah fat after performing your rituals of om or Hajj that you should shave your head and shorten your beard he understood it like this the Ayah is saying that you after finishing your rituals can shave or shorten shave your head or shorten cut clip the hair on your head not shave it he understood it to be referring to the head and to the beard so only when he performed Hajj he used to take a fist of his beard and cut whatever exceeded it so this is why Scholars differed and said yes it is permissible to trim what is more and exceeding than a fist now the people are doing it the opposite they're doing it from the top of the Fist not the bottom of the Fist so this is wrong I am inclined to say that it is not permissible to trim it otherwise I would have trimmed it and if there is one evidence supporting shaving it I would have shaved it long time ago but I've searched and I found that Allah wants it this way and I'm keeping it this way what about the pressure at home the what what what about the pressure at home the what the pressure pressure yeah for example from your parent or there's a word going around that if your wife tells you to cut your beard you cut it it depends if you're a man then you don't adhere to such a pressure but if you're a wimp and you don't have a spine see if you shave or cut your beard your wife is going to wear it one of you have to wear the pants so I don't know how men deal with women like this you know in counseling I do a lot of counseling and I sit with lots of couple W I see specimens that look like males but they're not seriously they are not real men and I see women and they're not real women and the man comes to me said she I married this woman and I thought she's a woman and she's going to make me happy I ended up marrying a dude why know she's more masculine than me so this is Allah's religion not yours and mine your father says to you take off your clothes and walk naked will you do it you will not do it so likewise when Allah tells you to grow your beard I'm growing it because Allah says so if my mom says don't go go pray fer why because I told you not to pray faer of course you don't listen to her you go and pray faer Allah told you to pray fuder and you're not uh uh listening to Allah and obeying him and obeying someone else so you have to Define what a man is and act accordingly"
