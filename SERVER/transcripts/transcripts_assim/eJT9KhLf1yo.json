  "transcript": "[Questioner] from India sure I have had a severe \nocd wiswas wudu so sometimes I couldn't pray and   I get stressed I get stressed in wudu so I \ndeliberately skip some prayers so should I   make up those prayers or am I allowed to make up \nthose prayers or should I ask forgiveness repent   to Allah and continue my normal prayers in the \nfuture this is too generic if a person skips   prayer intentionally this is a major sin and he \nhas committed a huge major sin can he make it up   if he did that intentionally no he cannot make it \nup the time is gone like someone who did not stand   in Mount Arafat on the season of Hajj on the 9th \nof delhija and he came five days later he says   oops I was caught up in traffic I was held up \nby the customs and and immigration authorities   they thought that my Visa was forged and not real \nand then they released me five days later so now   I'm gonna make it up and stand in Mount Alpha \nalone no you can't because it's time bound and   you missed it but if this person is an OCD patient \nand he is compelled to repeat the wudu or to have   these thoughts and it's not within his grasp or \ncontrol and he missed the prayer unintentionally   unwillingly but due to his compulsion in \nthis case yes he can make that prayer up"
