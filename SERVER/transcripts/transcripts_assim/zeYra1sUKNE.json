  "transcript": "foreign we have with us hadith number 173 in the chapter that deals with as zakat from the book of um and who will read this for us reported that the messenger of allah sent omar for collecting and it was said that ibn jameel khalid bin waleed and abbas the uncle of messenger of allah sallallahu sallam refused to pay it upon this the messenger of allah sallallahu salaam said does ibn jameel detest something but for that he was poor and then allah made him rich as regards to khalid you are unjust to khalid for he reserved his armors and weapons for the sake of allah and as for abbas i shall be responsible for it an equal amount along with it and he again said umar didn't you know that the uncle of a person is like his father muslim in this hadith be pleased with him is describing to us an incident that took place at the time of the prophet was first of all that we learned from this hadith that the prophet used to send people to collect the zakat so this is an islamic practice and you remember we said that the zakat is divided into two types in the sense that wealth that is apparent and wealth that is hidden the wealth that is hidden is my money my bank account the gold and silver i have in the house this is called hidden wealth no one comes and collects the zakat because you cannot investigate the apparent wealth is the livestock you have so those designated by the ruler goes and he collects there's a cat from how many you have for example if you have above 40 sheep up to 120 he takes one if you have five camels he take one sheep etc and then they also go to farms and they collect as a cat so if you have a farm of wheat a farm of barley they come and take the zakat from that but we know that if it was not harvested yet it is ready to be harvested they come and make a guess and this gas is not from thin air it is from their experience they are experienced people they know that this palm tree they can tell that the dates in it is about 50 kilograms did not weigh it but they can tell and this is found also in the sharia the prophet used to send people like this and he used to warn them as in the hadith of adam jabal do not take the best of their wealth so if you're going to take a sheep don't take the healthiest and the fattest and the strongest but rather take something that is average don't take the weakest because this is for allah don't take the worse but don't take the best take something in between and we stated that the prophet used to send his men to collect the zakat sometimes these men would be bribed so the most famous hadith on bribery is when the prophet salallahu salaam sent a man to collect the zakat the man came and said o prophet of allah this is the zakat that has been given to you and this is a gift that was given to me the prophet was outraged he mounted the pulpit praised allah offered salutation to the prophet salallahu salaam and then he said what is wrong with people whom we send them to collect the zakah see the prophet did not mention his name and this shows us an islamic etiquette the prophet did not slander the man to the public this deviant person he did this he did that and they start to wage war against him no the prophet allah said it as a general advice he named what the person did but he did not name the person himself he said why do people who we sent to collect the zakat come to us saying that this is for you and this was given for me on what account people give you gifts wouldn't they sit in their homes next to their fathers and mothers and see if people come and give you or not and this is extremely important especially in construction especially in purchasing departments especially with salesmen if you're a doctor if you are in the purchasing department and someone comes to you a salesman and says we have this quotation we have these goods to sell for you and by the way this is a mobile phone a gift just a token of friendship and you're very happy it's the latest model can you take this no this is a bribe one who says why it's not going to affect my decision this is what you think it will affect your decision whether you like it or not and even if it did not affect your decision on what account do you take it go resign from your work and sit in your home would anybody give you a gift no so they're giving it to you because of your position likewise a judge who works in a court and people give him a car people give him a plot a piece of land people give him a free first class ticket to geneva and a whole paid month in the hotel they're giving it for the blackness of your eyes they're giving it for the color of your hair they're giving it because of your position and this is the bribe so the prophet ali sasam used to select people who were extremely honest and disciplined abdullah for example and he was one of those who used to collect the zakat and also the jizya he went to the jews and the jews offered him a bribe so that when he looks at their farms he would reduce instead of 50 kilos he would say ah this has 40 kilos only so they offered him a bribe and what did abdullah one of the great companions of the prophet and one of the three poets the prophet had three poets these are the three poets of the prophet so what did abdullah say he said by allah you are the most people i hate on earth but my islam forbids me from doing any form of unfairness or unjustice to you and that is why don't you ever be afraid that my hatred to you would make me instead of saying 50 kilograms say 70 kilograms transgress don't think that i will never i would ever do this and the jews said by allah the heavens and the earth were created on such justice so usually those who are civil servants those who are working and collecting such for the islamic treasury or for the baital mal to the muslim state they must be in a very high level of honesty and integrity because it's an important thing likewise all other public jobs such as a judge if you have a corrupt judge then you have a very big problem so the prophet umar romar as you know is a man who knows nothing but the truth so even if his own son does something wrong he would have no second thoughts in punishing him anyone who does something that is wrong he will be punished no excuses at all so he came back and he told the prophet that i collected the zakat as you have instructed me only three refused to pay so as i am not the leader at the moment you are i'm reporting it to you of course we know that if it was done while he was the caliph he would have taken uh drastic measures to force them to pay it because he's a ruler he's the leader here we see a sign of discipline of umar may i appease with him so no matter how high in knowledge you are no matter how prominent you are in the state as long as there is a ruler as long as there is a leader life does not go on without discipline and obedience so umar said that there are three who did not pay and i'm awaiting your instruction who are they even jameel and khalid and al abbas the uncle of the prophet so the prophet said and commented as for ibn jameel what does he detest does he detest that he was poor and he prayed to allah that allah grants him money and now when he became rich he does not want to pay zakat as for khalid waleed this is inshallah what we will find after the break so stay assalamu alaikum and welcome back so the prophet israel sent omar as you know is a man who knows nothing but the truth so even if his own son does something wrong he would have no second thoughts in punishing him anyone who does something that is wrong he will be punished no excuses at all so he came back and he told the prophet that i collected the zakat as you have instructed me only three refused to pay so as i am not the leader at the moment you are i'm reporting it to you of course we know that if it was done while he was the caliph he would have taken uh drastic measures to force them to pay it because he's a ruler he's the leader here we see a sign of discipline of umar may i appease with him so no matter how high in knowledge you are no matter how prominent you are in the state as long as there is a ruler as long as there is a leader life does not go on without discipline and obedience so umar said that there are three who did not pay and i'm awaiting your instruction who are they even jamil and khalid milwaukee and al abbasid so the prophet said and commented as for even jameel what does he detest does he detest that he was poor and he prayed to allah that allah grants him money and now when he became rich he does not want to pay zakat as for khalid the sword of allah the prophet said that why are you and this is in plural not for umar this means that others spoke about khalid or against khalid so the prophet is refuting their claim why are you angry with khalid and he is the one who made all of his wealth in shields and armor for the sake of allah this is called wakf endowment so it is not owned by him it is for the sake of allah anyone who uses it for the sake of allah so most likely that when umar came to khalid told him i don't want to pay zakat because he did not have any money all of his money was in the shields and armors that were made to fight in the cause of allah azzawajal and from this scholars concluded that imagine that we want to build a masjid so we're collecting charity or i'm targeting to make a water station in africa so that people would be able to drink and use it now who's the owner of the project is it me no is it you no it is for allah so they say whatever money that does not have an owner and it is for the cause of allah there is no zakat in it even if it's a billion dollars so they say that if the money is not owned by an individual so if i'm collecting money to build a masjid and i've got this money and a whole year passes at two years three years do i pay as a cat the answer is no likewise if a tribe or a group of people they say listen how about we make a wallet or something to keep the money in so that whenever any of us has a calamity we take from that money for example and this happens in some tribes every month they pay a certain amount and they collect a lot of money so if someone kills someone by mistake he has to pay blood money but he doesn't have so they take from this money and give it to him someone falls sick and he has to operate and he doesn't have the money they take it and give it to him someone's house is burnt they buy a new house so it is collective effort for the community or for a group of people the money once being donated is it owned by anyone no the minute it comes out from your pocket you can't come after six seven years and said listen i gave you a hundred thousand i i need them back no it's gone so scholars say this money does not have any zakat in it because there is no owner of it now if you are collecting money to get married and the first year you gathered 50 000 rupees second year masha'allah another 50 000 do you pay the car yes you're the owner so if you want to get married and you're collecting money you have to give two point five percent if a whole year passes and the money reaches an asap and you claim that i am doing this for the sake of allah it's good but the money has to be zakatable another person says i'm collecting money to build the house again you have to pay zakah as long as it reaches a nisab and a whole year passes over or passes by this was for nuri now al-abbas remains for the abbas in this hadith the prophet said al-abbas is my uncle i'll give his zakat and i will double it now scholars say that there is another hadith that explains it because if i look at this hadith i would ask myself how would the prophet know how much is zakah he has to go and ask how much money you have how much real estate how much livestock how much gold but the other hadith explains it when the prophet said alaihis wasalam that al-abbas gave the zakat of his money two years in advance how is that you calculate the money for example and you know that the first of rajab i have to pay my zakat my zakat is 50 000. so i say i will pay another 50 000 for the next year and on the first of rajab next year i will calculate my money if it's more than 50 000 there's a car i will give the difference if it's less then whatever i paid more is sadaqa is charity and scholars differed in the ruling on advancing paying of the zakat some of them said that this is not permissible at all why because they say that the time of it is not there so how can you pay zakat it's like someone giving expiation for breaking an oath but he did not make an oath yet so i say um feeding 10 people or clothing them or slaughtering a sheep if not then fasting three days so i will say i will pay these 10 people for what said i don't know tomorrow i'm going to say wallahi i'm not going to do this and then break it so i'm going to pay it now is it possible to know if you do it this is charity good for you tomorrow if i say wallahi i'm not going to do it and you do it you have to pay a new one so they said that this is the same case with the zakat you cannot advance it but the most authentic opinion is that you can why because having one year to pass over the money you have is a condition and you can do or pay before the condition is fulfilled but without the reason you cannot pay so the reason for expiating the oath is to have an oath if there is no oath you cannot give expiration what is the reason in zakat the scholars say that the money reaches an islam and the condition for the zakat to be paid is that a whole year passes so the nisab which is 85 grams if i have 70 grams and i say okay i will give zakat hoping that somewhere throughout the year my money would reach 85 and then it will be zakatable scholars say that this is not permissible why because the cause of the zakat is reaching the slop is not fulfilled but if i have 85 grams which is done islam or over and a year does not pass i can give the zakat in advanced because this though the year is not passed but my zakat is due after two three months what is the use of advancing the zakat there is a very important usage of that so many times i have friends i have relatives i'd like to give them money as monthly payment or allowance because they're in need yet if i give them the whole 50 000 they'll spend it in a second so my zakat is 50 000. can i postpone it over the year and give it over 12 months as installments scholars say no way once the zakat is due you calculate it you give it away immediately they say maybe you can postpone it for a few days a week okay more than that no because this is allah's right in the money it has to be dispersed immediately however how can i help my relatives and giving them monthly allowance they said calculate your next year zakah so 50 000 i gave it the other 50 000 of next year's zakah i'm going to give it installments until the time of my zakah which is first of rajab for example is due then i calculate what money i have if i have money that the zakat of it is 70 000 i've already paid 50 i make 20 000 balance and give it for zakah if i have zakat of 40 000 then i consider the 10 000 the balance that i paid charity challenge this is gone and scholars say that you cannot pay the account in advance for more than two years so no one is allowed to come and say this is my zakat for the next 10 years it cannot be this long two years is the maximum and this is the most authentic opinion of scholars and then the prophet said didn't you know that the uncle the paternal uncle is in the same status of a man's father and this to indicate to umar the position of an abbas may allah be pleased with him in that he is the uncle of the prophet alaihis and he has to be respected as long as he did not do anything sinful and maybe the prophet alice susan sensed or felt that umar was not happy with abbas because he did not pay the zakat and he did not justify you know when umar said give me the zakah and said no i'm not going to pay but then when the prophet clarified to him and told him that he gave his zakat for two years then he felt good about it but he wanted to prove to omar or to show him the position of al abbas and we all know that in the drought that struck the muslims umar when he went to pray for rain he asked al abbas to ask allah azzawajal because of his position from the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam this is all the time we have until we meet next time"
