  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Pakistan so she have a \nquestion about the Jummah prayer yes sir   I heard that in in the Jummah prayer if I if I \ngo with uh after this Ruku in the second raka   then after the Imam does the Salam I have \nto offer four rak'as of Dhuhr instead of   the two rak'as of Jummah prayer so \nwhat do I have to do in this case the Prophet (Peace and Blessing upon \nhim) indicated to us that whoever attains   minimum of one raka with the Imam so the Imam \nis in record position and you come and offer   rukuu and both of you are simultaneously in the \nrukuu position and then you continue the prayer   this was the last raka the prophet said that you \nhave attained the prayer so if you come in Maghrib   and you attain the last ruku with the Imam and he \nsits in the third raka over salaam you offer two   rakas only because that rukuu is considered \nto be a full raka a full unit if the Imam   says while you were trying to go for which means \nthat you were not with him in the rukur position   simultaneously this means that you did not attain \nthe Salat which means if you did not attain Friday   yet you joined the congregation when the Imam has \nalready raised his head from rukur the second or   was in the tashahud before concluding the prayer \nand you joined him this late this means that the   Friday prayer in you in your case is not valid \nwhat to do whenever you miss a Friday prayer what   is the alternative that you have to pray Dhuhr and \nthis is why when the Imam offers salaam you stand   up and you continue four rakaa of Dhuhr and you \nnot rewarded for the jummah and Allah Knows Best"
