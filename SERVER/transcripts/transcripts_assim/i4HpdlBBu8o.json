  "transcript": "um if you're like financially unstable um and like you can't provide for yourself um is it still infermissible to get a job when you're a female because there's free mixing in like the UK especially like um if you want to get stuff that you enjoy but your parents say no you have to get a job like what do you do in that situation we have a rule that states necessities make prohibited things permissible however Necessities are estimated according to their true need and whether it is a necessity or not so for example a sick person can break his fasting if someone has a stomach ache a severe headache a hardship that is causing him a lot of pain it is permissible for him to break his fast and make it up later on if someone comes and says I have a small cut in my finger so this is an illness I would like to break my fast who said no this is not a legitimate reason not a necessity when we come to a woman traveling without a mahram this is totally prohibited it's the prophet himself who prohibited it nobody can come and say no no it's okay time changed the prophet himself says it's not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah on the day of judgment to travel without a mahram even for Hajj even for Umbra this is the factor of the Prophet Islam if you're a Muslim you abide by it you don't go fatwa shopping or ask Tom and Dick and Harry and say oh they said it's okay then go with them on the day of judgment and don't seek the prophet Allah's companionship so if someone says okay I have a necessity to travel without a mahram we tell her what is your necessity she says I have to travel to see my mom this is not a necessity she says I'm in a cafe country there's no Muslims around me and I fear fitna on my religion I have to run with my religion you say this is a fitna go even without a mahram because this is a necessity coming back to your question you say my mom and dad don't allow me to buy things I want is this a necessity that permits you to mix with man and maybe there will be most likely flirtius with you at the workplace maybe you have to compromise your hijab Etc of course not yes if you say that my parents are all bedridden we don't have benefits from the government we don't have food on the table nobody's helping us nobody's giving us zakat or charity and we're starving said okay this is a necessity we have to look at the list of choices of jobs and then decide what is best for you and Allah Knows Best"
