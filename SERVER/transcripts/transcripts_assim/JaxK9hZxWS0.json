  "title": "Can we make brother like ties to people like the Prophet ﷺ made ties between Muhajirun & the Ansar",
  "transcript": "Michael from Kazakhstan. Michael or Misha. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa'alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Sheikh, may I ask two questions? No, only one please. Okay, so the question is about brotherhood in Islam. The Prophet ﷺ used to make brother-like ties between the Ansar and the Muhajir. Correct. To the extent that they started to add the new brothers to the testament, etc. So the question is, does the Fiqh have any rulings on this in the modern days? Or are any literature among the scholars on this topic? Can we as regular Muslims do the same thing? Or is it only for the Khalifa or the Imam to do that? No, no, no. This was in the beginning of Hijrah. When the Muhajireen migrated to Medina and they were stone broke. They did not have anything. So the Prophet ﷺ selected one from the Muhajireen to become a brother of Ansar. And he assigned each Muhajir to his brother from the Ansar. And he even went to the extent to say that they are as siblings. So if one of them dies, the other one inherits him. And this went on for some time until this ruling was abrogated. As mentioned in Chapter 8, Surah Al-Anfal, at the last verse of it, that no, the inheritance should be between kinship. And this type of inheritance between this type of brotherhood was dissolved and abrogated. Now what remains of it is the cordial feelings between us brothers. So yes, if I have a dear brother of mine, a neighbour, a friend, a colleague, we have this bond between us to the extent that I may lend him money, he may lend me money. If he's in need, I would give him money. I would let him borrow my stuff and car as a brother. But there is nothing that goes above that to the extreme amount of brotherhood that the companions had in their beautiful stories that were narrated. And Allah knows best."
