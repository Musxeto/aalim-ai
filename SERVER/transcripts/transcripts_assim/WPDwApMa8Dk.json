  "transcript": "Ummah from the UK? Okay, so I have two questions. My first question is, I have siblings that are five, three years old and I'm asking if I could, it's permissible to ask them if they wash themselves after urinating. Go ask them, go investigating if they have no chance on them or not. How old are they? Five and three years old. So do they know how to clean themselves? Yeah, I taught them how to clean themselves. Khalas, you don't need to go and check on them, Alhamdulillah. If you don't see anything visible, you don't have to say, drop your pants, let me check them. This is not appropriate and there is no need to it, Inshallah."
