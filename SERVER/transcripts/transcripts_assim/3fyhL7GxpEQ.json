  "title": "Masjids around are deobandi, who to follow when breaking fast, masjid or umm al qura assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh Sheriff my question uh is unfortunately all the messages in our residential area are controlled by the ubuntis and the nearest one is around 300 meters from home so it takes around three to four minutes to go there uh now as per um began at 6 07 pm today but the nearest Masjid gave the Advan of Maghrib at 6 11 pm and they began the iqama in less than one and a half minutes after the end of the event that is at 6 15 PM so ultimately my question is am I obliged to break my fast upon hearing this event and then Prema in the congregation of this Masjid well actually this issue always reoccurs we have a problem says something and the Masjid adjacent to us says something else who should we follow basically speaking as an individual I'm obliged to pray and break my fast as soon as the sun sets however I cannot depend on the calendars because I'm not certain whether they're accurate or not my watch is accurate or not if I can see if I'm living at the seashore and I can see the sun setting once it disappears I can break my fast and pray Maghrib whether the Masjid adjacent to me gave that done or not I could care less but if I don't have any visual or certainty that the sun has set in this case I must rely and depend on the message next to me because they are the one who's taking responsibility on the day of judgment for calling the Adan I have no way of just yeah it says it's time no this is a concept and depending on the watch that might be mistaken or depending on the um calendar where there could be one or two minutes difference between some apps although they claim that they're following I'm not following omakura for certain then this is problematic I would highly advise you not to break your fast until you're certain that the sun has set either visually or by following the message best"
