  "transcript": "[Sheikh: Ahmed from Egypt.] [Ahmed: \nOkay, so, there's a dilemma that happened   right in front of me and I was wondering about \nit. A kid in the streets suddenly saying 'allahu   akbar' and he would have continued the adhan, but \nhis parents cut him off and scolded him badly and   loudly in front of others. They told him that \nhe would be deceiving others into believing it's   time for prayer. So the kid was sad. I was like, \nwouldn't that child repeating adhan be better off   than he was singing a song or getting used to \nsomething sinful? Didn't his parents drive him   away from his natural fitra by scolding him that \nway? So were they wrong in short?] [Sheikh: Okay,   I will answer, in shaa Allah.] Ahmed from \nEgypt says, 'I saw a boy calling the adhan   and his parents scolding him for calling \nit because they were afraid of people being   deceived by it. Isn't this wrong, because maybe \nthe adhan is better than him singing a song.'   Well, I understand where the parents are coming \nfrom. Because the adhan is not a song, the adhan   is made to announce that the time of the prayer \nis due. And they are quite right. Imagine   sitting on the table of your food minutes \nbefore sunset. The dates, the soup, the sambusa,   and you're just making dua waiting for the \nadhan to be called to eat. And your neighbor,   his son or somewhere, calls the adhan - \nplaying. 'Better than singing'. And you   start to eat and the sun did not set yet. \nWouldn't you feel a little bit deceived   and betrayed? The answer is 'yes'. So I know \nand understand where the parents are coming from   and maybe they have a point in what \nthey did. And Allah knows best."
