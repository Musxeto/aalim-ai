  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] ald Allah the almighty tells us in mul that he had created life and death to try us to test us who performs best Among Us so this life we're living in is merely a test Allah the almighty is trying us with the good and with the evil with the nice things and with the bad things things he is testing us to see subhanahu wa'ta'ala how we perform and lots of the problems and calamities that we Face they are from Allah to erase our bad deeds and this is a blessing from Allah the almighty the prophet sallallahu alaih Ali wasallam told us in an authentic Hadith that these calamities to raise the bad Deeds or to elevate your level in Paradise if you don't have bad deeds and this is not imaginable except of course in the case of the prophets who have no bad Deeds but the likes of us have lots and lots of bad Deeds our Prophet sallallahu alai wasallam tells us in an authentic Hadith that among the people the most tried and tested are the messengers of Allah and then those who are below them in piety and virtue and then those who are below them therefore these calamities are clear sign of Allah's love to us the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam tells us that the amount of reward comes comparable to the amount of calamities bestowed on us and the more Allah loves a group of people the more he will increase in testing them and trying them with calamities and therefore among the most whom Allah loves of his Creations are the prophets and messengers of Allah if you look at the biography you will see a clear manifestation of Allah's love to them through the calamities that came over them look for instance to Adam the first human being the first prophet of Allah whom Allah had created him with his own hands Adam was struck by a severe blow a severe Calamity he was tested by Allah and failed in the test he was told not to eat from the forbidden fruit or from the Forbidden tree and Satan lured him deceived him and swore by Allah that he was giving him the authentic and sincere advice he ate from the tree and Allah descended him and all his offsprings to earth look at Prophet Noah n may Allah have the peace and blessing upon him this great messenger of Allah stayed for 950 years over 9 centuries calling his people to believe in the Oneness of Allah and they would mock of him they would make fun of him all this work and devotion and look at the calamities of Allah his beloved wife did not believe in him not only that his son also did not believe in him and he drowned with the nonbelievers and if you go on look at Moses the messenger of Allah peace be of on him calamities caught up with him since the day he was born when his mom when his mother put him in a cradle and threw him in the river fearing that the pharaoh's the Pharaoh and his soldiers would come and slay him and by Allah's Grace he was brought up in the Palace of pharaoh himself he goes into town and he finds one of his people the sons of Israel fighting with one of Pharaoh's men he goes to the assistance tries to assist his man from the same tribe and he just simply hits this Coptic who dies and then it spreads in town that he killed one of us so he flees his country and only returns back to it after 10 years a foreigner for 10 years for something that was not a crime he was just trying to help and if you go on the prophet Jacob peace be upon him he's the father of Joseph and he's the son of Isaac the son of Abraham so it's a chain of prophets of Allah the almighty peace be upon them all Jacob loved his son Joseph and this did not go down well did not go down the throat of his brothers that's why they plotted to throw and get rid of their brother Joseph he lost his beloved Son for 20 years and after these 20 years he lost his second beloved Son the brother of Joseph which caused his eyesight to go he lost sight he could not see why he's the messenger of Allah he's the prophet of Allah he's the closest to Allah among all humans it's simple it's a Calamity from Allah to Those whom he loved and if you go down to Joseph himself peace be upon him look what his brothers did to him yet he was patient he accepted that look at what happened to him in the house of Al aiz look how they slandered him and tried to stain his reputation and he did not do anything he was put into jail for so many years and after all of that he was accused in his honor and dignity and if you go on on to talk about Abraham the messenger of Allah 80 years old with no children nothing of his offspring praise to Allah the almighty Allah grants him ishma a young strong handsome boy and when you're 80 and you get this boy then I don't have to elaborate on how valuable this boy is in just while he was about about 14 15 years old strong a man Allah tells him through a night through a dream that you have to sacrifice your son for me Slaughter him and kill him who can bear something like this Abraham did not go back to his Lord and say well can I be Exempted from this can I do something else he immediately went to his son and told him about the dream the Revelation he had and Ishmael said father do what you're told if you look at all of this and if you look at the stories of the prophets of Allah you'll find that there is always a light at the end of the tunnel these calamities proved to have benefit and goodness to all mankind because they were patient they accepted the calamities testing and Allah's trial to them whenever there is a tornado a big storm they're usually followed by calmness and peace Allah gives us a glad Tiding that verily with the difficulty there is relief verily with the difficulty there is relief if you notice these verses Allah says that with each difficulty there are two reliefs not one the companions of the Prophet Alat reverted and accepted Islam and by doing so they lost their wealth they lost their families and they lost their tribesmen they lost everything they had ever lived and walked for they've become a cast everybody is ignoring them and the pagans the idol worshippers kept on torturing them kept on punishing them for believing that there is only one God and for following the prophet sallahu alaih wasallam one incident was that after all the these years they've isolated the Muslims in what is known to be B hash and they've isolated them in this particular small piece of land in a valley they forbade people to talk to them they forbade people to communicate to sell to trade to give them any form of assistance to the extent that for three years they were in complete poverty SAS may Allah be pleased with him tells us about this eror he said that we were so hungry in these three years that we used to eat the leaves of trees he remembers once I went to urinate and I heard the sound I looked down and it was a piece of dry camel's meat that I was urinating on I was so hungry I took it washed it I burnt it and I ate what came out of that and this made me strong for five or six days look at the calamities that took place to those who were the favor people on Earth to Allah we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we will be right [Music] back after these difficulties after these calamities SAS was transformed into one of the wealthiest people of Medina so there is always light at the end of the tunnel never despair our Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam look at him as a ro model he is indeed without any comparison to any other the best of Allah's creation he is the most favored and loved by Allah among all of his Creations nevertheless look at the calamities that came to him his father died when he was 6 months old in his mother's womb his mother died when he was less than 6 years old his grandfather who took care of him died when he was 8 years old he his uncle who took care of him like his own son died also later on he was abused by his people though he was known to be the honest and the trustworthy he was slandered he was accused of being insane a sorcerer he was accused of being mad person and a liar a poet and so many other things the prophet Alat wasam faced his people in peace and tried to call them to Islam what did they do to them they attacked him they kicked him out of Mecca and they followed him to Medina and they attacked him so many times they killed his uncle hamah abdb and they also slandered his wife his beloved wife AA they have accused her of adultery and and with his one of his favorite companions closest companions to his heart all of these calamities from Allah to him and he was satisfied he was patient and he knew that there is always light at the end of the tunnel Our Lives brothers and sisters cannot go on on one single paste we have to have our ups and downs and that is what why once we get Darkness all around us we have to look for that light at the end of the tunnel and to get that light as quick as possible there are things if we do them Allah's relief would be very close to us among these things is to be on good terms with Allah when things are fine the prophet says Alam get closer to Allah know Allah when things are well and when you are overwhelmed with Allah's blessing because if you do this Allah will be there for you when calamities strike so this is a good Tiding the prophet tells usat that three men were trapped in a cave with a big rock they tried to push it away but it would not go so each one of them started supplicating praying to Allah with their Good Deeds oh Allah before This calamity came to us I did well to my parents the other one said I was good to a worker who came to me and left and I invested all of his money and it changed and transformed into billions and I gave it to him though he had half a day wage and the third one said I stopped from fornicating I did not commit adultery though I could have and Allah showed them the light at the end of the tunnel and got them out of that cave therefore we should ask ourselves what good deeds do we have now to call Allah with in cases of calamities do we have something to say oh Allah I remember a year or two I did this and that for your sake now I am in a calamity please Allah because of what I've done let This calamity go away lift your anger from me there are benefits of calamities though we don't like them but if you notice and analyze once a Calamity strikes we get closer to Allah it's very strange when we are in the blessings of Allah in our health and wealth and there's nothing wrong in our lives we tend to drift away from Allah we never say alhamdulillah we're never grateful to Allah but the minute something happens if my kid gets or catch a fever I will immediately go to Allah oh Allah cure my child oh Allah pay off or pay away the debt that I have on me and that is why we should always try our best to be on good terms with Allah when everything is running smooth and fine so that Allah will always be there for us when a Calamity strikes now once a Calamity takes place we should not be impatient we must not complain because this is from Allah and if you complain from Allah's decree on you then you're not a True Believer therefore look always for the light at the end of the tunnel if Allah tested you or tried you with an illness in your body if Allah tested you with debts that are burdening your shoulders and you cannot pay them back if Allah gave a crisis or a problem to you you who Allah is testing you with a wife that nags all the time and she uses extremely bad words you who Allah is testing you with an unlawful son who does not care for you who does not obey your instructions who does not satisfy your needs in a son you who Allah is testing you with a daughter that you have lived for all of your life and at the end of the day she's not a good Muslim she uncovers she shows her beauty to Those whom Allah told her not to do that if Allah strikes you with the difference different kinds of calamities be aware and know that it is of your own doings because Allah tells us that no Calamity no crisis no problem that comes on Earth or in ourselves except it is a sign that it is from our own doing this is the result of of our sins we have to connect our hearts to Allah we have to know that it is only Allah that can remove and lift such calamities but on the other hand if Allah has blessed you with health and wealth with Beauty with everything that you want going like you want yet you're sinful and you know that then be aware because this is not a blessing of Allah this is testing and trial from Allah so that you would do more and more sins and you'll be held accountable for that on the day of judgment you want Allah to be for you when you need him be there where Allah wants you to be know Allah in the times of comfort comfort and blessing and he will know you on the times of calamities and problems maintain and preserve the five daily prayers on time and in the locations that Allah had instructed us to do so if you do this then you're a good Muslim maintain your connections with your next ofkin your relatives your uncle your aunt your cousins your brothers I once asked a friend of mine how is your brother doing and he said I don't have a brother with this name and I was shocked to know that he did not see his brother for years and they have a conflict among them and no one is trying to solve it know Allah and get closer to him through cleansing your tongue and whatever comes from your mouth don't slander don't swear don't say bad things and cleanse your heart from grudges hatred Envy if you do that you'll be a servant of Allah and Allah will be there for you when you need him until we meet next time"
