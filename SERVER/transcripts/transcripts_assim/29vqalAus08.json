  "title": "Women dress code in foreign countries (black abaya)? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "aisha says i hope you are in good health insha allah i want to ask the ruling of dress code for muslim women in islam when she is staying temporary or temporarily in a foreign state it is the same whether she is in a foreign state or in saudi arabia or in cairo or in morocco or in kuala lumpur what they wear is the same they have to cover themselves with a outer garment that is thick not transparent that does not expose her bone structure and body curves that does not look like the attire of the disbelievers and that is not a fitna on its own it does not attract people to look either to the design or because of the flashy colors so the same goes in a foreign country or locally but if you're referring to wearing abaya the black abbaya no this is not mandatory for a person to uh adopt and wear in such foreign countries if you feel that wearing something that is dark blue that is gray that is brown and it has a acceptable design that fits the requirements of the islamic attire there's no problem with that sean"
