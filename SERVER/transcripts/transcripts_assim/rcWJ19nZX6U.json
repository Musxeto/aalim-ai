  "title": "Are disbelievers SAVED as per ayah in Surah Baqarah? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Farooq Abdullah says someone told me that if Jews and Christians only follow this meaning the ayah in Surat al-baqarah Allah says what translates to who believe in the unseen establish prayer and spend out what we have provided for them and who believe in what has been revealed to you O Muhammad and what was revealed before you and of the hereafter they are certain in faith those are upon right guidance from their Lord and it is those who are the successful so the man told him that if they do not follow the Prophet Allah saw some peace be upon him though they are though they are saved as per these verses of the Quran is this true definitely not this is not true if you even have Faruk read the ayahs the verses yourself you find that that is true not true the ayah is praising those who do these things and described them as successful and you just heard that Allah said and who believe in what has been revealed to you so someone does not believe in the Prophet Isis M does not believe in the Quran definitely is not among the successful and he's in hellfire the Prophet said Ali system there is no Jew or Christian who hears about me and does not believe in me and follow me except he will be among the people of Hell so definitely this is a crystal clear indication that only the Muslims would enter Jannah and by Muslims we mean those who follow the Prophet al-assad's RAM or those at the time of Jesus who followed him or those at the time of Moses who followed him they are all considered to be Muslims until the following messenger came to them so I hope this answers your question"
