  "transcript": "uh son hain from canada sheila my question is a few weeks ago someone asked you a question regarding novels and stuff like that and while you were answering the question you mentioned something like uh allah tells us about events past events or some events in the quran which didn't really happen but they just told us about those events in order to teach us a lesson or something like that tell us what these uh events are okay says that you stated in one of your answers few weeks ago that when talking about novels that allah azzawajal would speak about things that did not happen i didn't say that allah would speak about things that did not happen said well we have to look into it if morally it is a good story that has a good benefit to the reader and it does not include anything haram so the whole structure of the story has a good ending builds up courage honesty truthfulness in the reader's head and evil loses it doesn't beautify evil it doesn't include anything some scholars say that this is permissible because allah mentioned examples to us in the quran and he set an example of so and so doing so and so which is not a reality rather it's an example to us to learn from and stories that people know that are not true and they are fiction as long as nothing haram is included this is a part of teaching people with good moral conduct islamic beliefs and entertaining them at the same time now having said these two different views i'm implying to the other one and this is opinion may not have mercy so providing there is nothing what do you mean by there's nothing anything of the unseen is totally prohibited so mentioning angels hellfire mentioning jinn reviving the dead giving them life changing the form of an animal to a human being or a noun to another animal all of these things are blatant lies and only allah can do this so even if it's in a novel or a story this is totally haram to write or to read when you talk about time travel this is nonsense because there isn't any such thing and just to make up the idea and to have the ripple effect from going to the past and changing events which would mean to change the future which is a present blah blah blah all of this is not possible and cannot happen and it's claiming to change people's fates according to what is going on this is totally prohibited magic having magical powers to do things magic is haram in islam which leads to harry potter's novels and stories and movies to be all impermissible for muslims to watch and the list goes on so at the end of the day we are limited with very little um amount of novels and stories that we can read and write yes this is true and we don't have to bend the rules we have to follow them and these rules are not mine or yours these are divine rules from allah azzawajal muslims don't cheat don't lie don't fabricate and don't talk about the world of unseen and allah azzawajal knows best i said that allah would give us examples and tells us things that are an example not an actual fact and every time you read the quran and you you hear or read allah gives the similitude of a man who's mute who cannot speak and he who does not know where to go when his master tells them where to go while the other one is a sane and an intelligent person who enjoins virtue and forbids evil these two allah gives them as an example so when writing novels scholars say that these two did not actually happen we don't have ahmad and abdullah who are we are being told about allah is telling us about in the quran these are two that allah is giving us as an example likewise writing uh novels would be in the same path when you write something that is fictional with the intention of guiding people or giving in dawah or developing moral ethics this is permissible insha'allah"
