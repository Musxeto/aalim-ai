  "title": "Parents think I'm too young to marry! - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "comes from a brother he says that he's 20 years old male and he has a good job that pays well and he never approached haram with the grace of allah but he has strong urge for women which is natural and and human and his parents do not want to search for a wife for him because he is young for them how is he supposed to get a wife does he still have to obey his parents and when and where can he find a wife in halal means brother this is a common situation that hundreds and thousands of young men are facing unfortunately we have to look at the circumstances and on the other hand you are fortunate that you have a job and it pays good though you say that you do not have a high degree and you're not well educated but delay you still have a job that pays well and allows you to open a house so if this is the case and now we have two evils one evil is that you fornicate that you commit haram you tried your level best to stay away from females but the temptation is so high and great so you are unable to safeguard yourself and the second evil is to go against your parents will and get married and definitely the worst of evil is that you fall in fornication which is a major sin your parents have no right and preventing you and getting married especially when you are financially fit and you have the urge in you just a young man so they have no right and I address all parents you have no right in postponing or delaying your son or your daughter's marriage when they are looking to it and they have the urge for it so in your case you have degree light too diplomatically talk to your parents and tell them I'm going to get married whether you like it or not in a very nice way of course not the way I'm saying it to them but make it blunt and clear that it's I'd rather disobey you and get married to a woman rather than fall into her arm and disobey Allah Almighty because there is no third way in your comprehension you may fast but you may say that this doesn't work that good for me and I see no reason for you to not to get married now where to find a halal wife this is something that you have to look for so you have to check with your friends you have to check with the imam of the masjid or the islamic center you have to check with your sisters if they know some of the friends who are practicing with the characteristic that you're looking for in a woman and this insha'Allah would do"
