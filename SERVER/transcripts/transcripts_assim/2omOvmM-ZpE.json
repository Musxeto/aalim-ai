warahmatullahi wa barakato today we begin insha'Allah with hadeeth number 49 it is similar to previous hadith we discussed and it is related with the times of prayers mohit ocelot and hadith number 49 and who would volunteer to read it for us yes brother assalamualaikum narrated say arvind Salama I along with my father went to a pupusa Aslam II and my father asked how did the prophet salallahu alaihe wasalam used to pray the obligatory prayers abu Barzeh said the prophet salallahu alaihe salam used to offer the zohar prayer which you people call the first one at midday as soon as the son decline the Asura at a time when after the prayer a man might go to the house at the father's place in al-madinah and arrived while the son was still alive I forgot what he said about the Maghrib prayer the Prophet loved to delay the Isha which you call al otama and he disliked sleeping before it and speaking after it after the fajr prayer he used to depart when a man could recognize the one sitting beside him and he used to recite between sixty two hundred ayat of the Quran in the Fajr prayer very well again the hadith is an emphasis to what we have mentioned before and that is the times of Prayer are recognized by observing the Sun and in the hadith what is a little bit different than before is for example Maghrib he forgot what abou Barza niala peace with him said about it but we know that the time of mother it starts when when the Sun sets so as soon as the Sun sets this is the time of mothering and the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam used to like to delay the time of raesha but again in the previous hadith we mentioned that it depends on the people so if the people were present he would pray Asia after the Adhan but if they did not come he would wait and he would wish to postpone it until the third of the day is gone or that is until the third of the night is gone and sometimes close to the middle of the night however the Prophet did not do this all the time and it's a lot Aslam but he wished that his people his own mode postponed it but knowing that this might burden them Salalah hollom he did not made it part of the obligatory things and the last phrase it says that the Prophet used to allah√≠s Allah - Salam did not recommend did not like he disliked sleeping before it and speaking after it what is it salat elisha so the prophet alayhi salatu salam did not like sleeping before it meaning between Maghrib and Isha why would he not like something like that because it would result that people would stay up late and this was not his Sunnah his son Thomas to sleep after Asia and not only that a nation that sleeps a lot is unproductive it would not be able to produce unfortunately nowadays in most Muslim countries when does the day begin at what time here in India what are the working hours 8:00 at 10:00 this is extremely late because if you work at 10:00 you will finish probably at six maybe seven what remains of the day the whole day is gone the Islamic working hours would be after fajar and you work up to Lahore maybe at 1 or 2 o'clock and that is it you utilize the rest of the day for whatever you want to do because there is lost time between fetcher and your working hours in Arab countries some other countries start their day at 7:00 some starts at 8:00 the maximum they would start is at 9:00 from 9:00 to 5:00 this is the western way of doing it however this is too late again the prophets way the prophets analysis Ram is that after Asia you go to bed and mostly they used to wake up in the middle of the night at 12 o'clock at one o'clock and they spent the rest of the time praying from 1 up till Fajr prayer and then they professor and then they go and this is unlike what we're doing nowadays we try to stay as late as possible 1 a.m. 2 a.m. and we sleep for 2-3 hours go to fazil we don't know what we are reciting in fajar and then we go back to sleep and go to our work so our day is completely out of context we don't have any productivity during the day the Prophet RA salatu salam did not like speaking after isha chit-chatting unless it's an emergency or for something that is related to islam of propagating of islam making the calling people or having guests and this is rare it is not the norm if you look at the Muslims nowadays after Asia what do they do they spend this time in watching movies and listening to music and chit-chatting in anything that is not useful for them but this was not the way they used to work all day long and they used to rest and prepare for prayer all night long or most of the night because they knew the reason they were on this earth for and that is to worship allah azzawajal Ansari hmmm mostly the prophet alayhi salatu salam once asked his companions after fajar so far is the beginning of the day so he said who among you is fasting Abu Bakr said I am prophet of Allah and then the Prophet said who among you has visited a sick person visited someone who is a patient and Abu Bakr said I am the one the prophet of Allah I did that already who followed a funeral until it was buried a worker said I did who fed a poor person and a worker said I did all of these four tasks and it is Fajr prayer when did he do all of this meaning that his night was not spent in sleeping it was spent in righteous deeds the Prophet said Alison by Allah these four deeds if they were combined in one day in one person he will be among those who enter Jenna so we are wasting our time we are wasting our lives doing things that do not benefit us and that is why we have to try our best to sleep early because the early birds usually get all the barakah the Prophet Adam said may Allah bless the early times of my Ummah morick Allah Almighty fee Bukhari ha if my Ummah start the day early Allah will bless that for them so this is a part of the tsunade's salatu salam also and this hadith the companion abou Bartonella be pleased with him says that the Prophet Allah so some would conclude his Fechter prayer when a person recognizes the one next to him he did not say when the person recognizes everybody meaning it is still dark and this emphasizes the point that we spoke about earlier that the Sunnah is to offer fajar prayer when it is dark not to wait until it's light also he says that he used to recite between 60 and hundred verses of the Quran so even if he prolonged the prayer starting at where it's really dark if he prolongs the prayer until it's light this is okay do you remember what is the name of the darkness of Fajar we mentioned that last time it's called Alice Alice and to do this action is called tell release and what is the name of praying it when it's about to be light when the whole world is lit but the Sun did not rise it's far it's called is far so this is the Sunnah of the Prophet Elisha lhasa regarding these prayer times move on to the following hadith hadith number 50 we have two hadith here fifty and fifty odd we will give it one go in sha Allah ali radiyaallah ta'ala no reported when it was a day of the battle of ahzab the messenger of allah salallahu sallam said may Allah fill their graves and houses with fire as they detained us and diverted us from the middle prayer till the sunset Muslim not complete sentence couldn't find actually Abdullah bin Masood reported that Rohde allah tala anjo reported that the polytheist detained the messenger of allah salallahu alayhi wa sallam from observing the afternoon prayer till the Sun became red or it became yellow upon this the messenger of allah salallahu alaihe salam said they have diverted us from offering the middle prayer that is the asar prayer may Allah fill their bellies and their graves with fire or he said may Allah stuff their bellies and their graves with fire this battle the Battle of Allah has AB does it have another name anyone it is an unhoned ik l Honda this is correct and al-haq means the trench this battle took place in the fifth year of a Hydra and this battle was not that they had a lot of fights and a lot of casualties on the contrary it was anticipation and what importance did this mat will have this is assalamualaikum and welcome back let's go to exam 2 place on the fifth year of hijra and as stated the Prophet was advised at least a lot of Salaam when he learned that the tribe of Rapa fan joined forces with the pagans of Quraysh and with the Jews of many Kariba to attack Islam and annihilate it so the Prophet was advised Dallas awesome to build or actually to dig a trench a big trench something that the Arabs did not know of and this would make a natural barrier alongside the hills and the mountains surrounding Medina this approximately took a number of weeks a month or so however there was not actual fighting except for some skirmishes here and there yet the Muslims were afraid as Allah described them in al-quran and there is a surah by the name of Al exam where it describes how the Muslims were afraid and intimidated by the siege of the disbelievers now the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam in this hadith is the first part of it it says that I'd leave me I'll be pleased with him said that the prophet alayhi salatu salam said on the day of al Honda call Reza may Allah fill their graves and their houses with fire as they have prevented us from praying ah sir on time until the Sun set and he described it as the middle prayer and people before used to think that fetcher was the middle prayer because Allah says in the Quran half ago Allah saw at your salat e a loser and a salata would star by this hadith definitely is salat and answer so even though there are scholars that said otherwise we as Muslims definitely would put aside what the scholars said when we have authentic hadith about the Prophet erased all option because there are different ways of interpreting the Quran the best way is to interpret Quran by by the Quran itself like for example where Allah says alladhina amanu what am i Albizu Eman a humble those who believe and do not associate their belief with any form of aggression and the Companions came and complained and said prophet of Allah we all have some sort of aggression and the Prophet said no this is not what was meant didn't you read what the righteous man the pious man look man what did he say to his son in ashika the full moon are they verily associating others with Allah is a great transgression so this is the transgression meant in this eye so the Prophet explained this by that this is the highest level of interpreting the Quran likewise if you do not have a clear interpretation from the Quran the second level would be interpreting the Quran by the Sun the hadith of the Prophet Elisha Ladouceur because he is the most knowledgeable of what allah azzawajal meant and there are a number of evidences this is not the time for it and then the third way of doing it is by learning the interpretation by the companions and that is why even our best for example may Allah be pleased with him is among the best in interpreting the Quran the famous hadith or narration when Muhammad may Allah be pleased with him used to gather those of knowledge in his gathering in his court but he would not allow any and he used to allow even a bus and a bus was a young boy yeah not a young boy he was a man in his 20s early 20s and the companions complained saying that we have children our children our sons are older than even our bus yet you deprive them from coming and attending your court why is that so he said I'll show you and in his court he asked companions companions of the Prophet as son I would ask them what do you know about the surah adagio nasrallah he will fetch what I attend I said Who Luna feed inna llaha for a Jaffa sabe the Angelica was tougher what do you understand from this the Companions all said that is obvious Allah says when you see the victory of a large that were Jill coming and Allah Azza WA JAL has made you victorious and people are entering in Islam in a lot of numbers in this case praise Allah and asking for forgiveness because Allah is most forgiving and he accepts the repentance so he nodded his head even at best what do you understand from this verse or from the surah even ambass says this is the tithing to Muhammed Ali so Sarah that he's going to die Allah is informing Muhammad that he is now about to die sallallahu alehiwassallaam how did you understand this this is how what he understood umar said by Allah this is exactly what I understand now Ramar understands it because in the beginning he did not when this surah was revealed to the Prophet al-islam and he told the people after reading it that all people a man a slave of Allah is been given the choice between this dunya and in what Allah has and Abu Bakr started to cry and started to weep and the companions are looking what is this old man doing why is he crying the Prophet is talking about a slave of Allah and now he's crying and Abu Bakr says by Allah o prophet of Allah we give our souls in your protection meaning he knew he understood that is when I'm already alone who understood what this chapter means and he came to know this so Quran by Quran Quran by Sunnah Quran by the companions and then for an by the Arabic language if you fail to find the interpretation of the previous three then you go to the Arabic language because Quran was revealed in Arabic it is Arabic so you can understand it only by Arabic so half into a la sala Watty was salat in Woodstock a solid rooster is the middle prayer which is al ansar prayer and the Prophet as you can see in this hadith has supplicated against the kuffar nowadays this is an issue of controversy among a lot of the so-called Muslims they say don't supplicate against the kafir don't supplicate against those who are not Muslims why because this is not friendly this is barbaric this is so-and-so no no no supplication is something that ask from Allah Azza WA JAL I'm not holding a gun against you I'm not doing anything against you I'm just simply saying o Allah do this or do that to the disbelievers and it is believer no definitely not it's a form of aggression to supplicate against the Jews and the Christians who do not attack us or who are not enemies and they are the majority of the Jews and the Christians what it is permissible for us as Muslims not only that it is recommended for us as Muslims to supplicate against the enemies of Islam so those who attack Islam those who read the Kuehl Islam those who make drawings against the prophet alayhi salat wa salam or make fun of our religion or attack our poor on the simplest thing to do is to raise your hands and ask Alonso jail for their destruction now if someone comes up and says no no no no this is not wise you should ask Allah for their guidance this is unacceptable those who attack us we have to defend ourselves and the least you defend yourself with is making dua and the Prophet that is also made dua and we follow suit and why didn't the Prophet a little option and pray on time isn't praying on time something essential yes it is essential however this hadith was before Allah Azza WA JAL made salat al how mandatory what is a lot of hope it is the prayer of fear it's called the prayer of fear it is when people are at war people at a state of extreme fear that they are unable to pray the normal prayer we will come to describe this inshallah later on and this chapter of prayer but before this was mandated al Honda took place and the prophet alayhi salatu salam was so engaged in anticipating the enemy so that they would not attack them while they were off guard to the extent that he did not pray us along time weather deliberately or he forgot but it was a situation that he could not pray on time so this shows you how scary that battle was anticipation awaiting not knowing when an arrow would come not know when their horsemen would ride across that trench and start to attack so it was a very scary situation being surrounded from all directions and that is why the Prophet Alister Sam missed Al answered prayer and as I said because we do not have enough time to elaborate on this mashaallah next time we meet we will mention when it is possible for you to make up for the prayers and when it is not possible I'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time via Manila assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
