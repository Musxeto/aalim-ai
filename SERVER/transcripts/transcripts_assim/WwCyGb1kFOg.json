  "title": "When 2 Muslims try to kill each other, both are in hellfire so what about Battle of the Camel",
  "transcript": "the question is regarding the hadith uh when two muslims confront each other with their swords both the killer and the one who is killed are doomed to hell fire so i wanted to understand the battle of uh jubble uh battle of the camel regarding this hadith because we know that there were so habits on both sides of the you know group that they fought each other but then there were people of chennai there as well so how can we understand this okay from canada the hadith of when two muslims meet with the swords with intention of killing one another both are in hell fire the murderer and the victim the victim because he was keen on killing his partner or friend before he was victimized before doing that so he says what about the incident of the camel when companions fought together we know that among them are some of the ten heaven bound so how is this possible the hadith is crystal clear each were keen on killing his brother that's why both of them are in hell now you tell me when the companions went and met in the incident of the camel of the jamel did any one of them thought of killing his brother or intended to harm his brother of course not do you think that sofiane or abram were keen on killing this or that or ali was keen on killing uh muawiyah or ali was keen on killing zubair and talhah who were on the other side of course not all of these battles that took place at the short span of time due to some confusion due to the hypocrites spreading their rumors and lies among the muslims to provoke such incidents all of the time they had nothing towards one another except love and respect and this is why when ali heard of the killing of zubair and of uh he cried and wept they were his brothers and likewise be pleased with him when he heard of the assassination of ali he wasn't pleased he was his brother so this hadith does not apply at all in the situations that took place"
