  "title": "Can I change my last name if it has an Hindu origin? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "so we have Asadullah from Canada he says is it permissible to change my last name as I doubt that it has a Hindu origin to it if the name is bad then you may change it because the Prophet is awesome used to change bad names into good names however changing your father's name is not permissible the Prophet Isis Alam said in an authentic hadith that this can mount to cover of course not disbelief that takes you out of the religion but it is a minor chord and one has to be called after his father and his grandfather now if it is a family name and he changes it or he drops it there's no problem in that what counts is your name and your father's name if your name is bad and you want to change it this is alright but being called after someone who is not your father this is totally prohibited you have to keep your father's name your grandfather's name if it's a family name no problem drop it but do not replace it with another family's name as if you are part of that other family because this is prohibited so in short if it's a long way of a great great great grandfather you can drop the name if you doubt it's a Hindu name just use your name your father's name and your grand father's name and that would suffice"
