  "transcript": "brother and sisters there's a good news for all of you has decided to continue the series of this lecture from tomorrow and now for the next half hour we have a live Q session so if you have any questions please raise your hand I'll choose you one by one we go one one and one one your ask question and then so start first and he knows that he is without what's his what's his de St yeah is he a cafir or not you want to get him out of the fold of Islam see this is we repeat the question yeah okay the question is the brother I spoke about earlier who led the prayer knowing that he is not in the state of wo so would he be still a Muslim or not the issue of is a very sensitive issue and very complex nevertheless we should not go down that route because it would cause many many problems for us and for those around us and and I get literally hundreds of questions hundreds not tens and literally not exaggerating every month from people wanting to get their parents their spouses their children out of Islam so my father did this my father is he still a Muslim my mother did this and that is she a Muslim my husband my wife my children and I am so astonished why is it that people would like to get others out of the fold of Islam it's not that they hate them it isan messing up with their heads main objective in life is to get you out of the straight path correct what isan's job description he took a vow upon himself by Allah's Grace and dignity and and honor that he will deviate them all this is his vow he took upon himself so it is his job description to take you out of the straight path to deviate you to make it as easy as possible for him to have you accompany him in Hellfire does he do this frequently 24 hours 7 days a week will he ever leave you alone yes when your soul exits your body before your soul departs your body he's not going to leave you so you have your Peaks and valleys some people have their OCD ups and downs but you will never ever be free the OCD is with every one of us but some of us these intrusive thoughts they work in their minds for one or two seconds and they go so these guys are in good hands some it takes them one 2 minutes 5 minutes 10 minutes 1 hour some half an hour some five hours some one day some one month some the whole year these are very very chronic and serious so don't go down the route of Tak why Tak needs conditions and there are obstacles that blocks you from someone who doesn't know how can I say that he committed an act of kufur he doesn't know Allah says in the Quran we will would not torment and punish a nation before sending them a messenger before sending the messenger they don't know and this is known as people in Siberia people in the Amazon people in the jungles of Africa they don't know anything about Islam never heard of Muhammad never heard of religion never heard of anything how can we hold them accountable on the day of judgment Allah will test them they're they won't be thrown in Hell directly no because they did not have a prophet or a messenger coming and conveying to them the truth so and I also tell these people with OCD they I've committed kufur why I think I did this I think I did that I left the fold of Islam leaving the fold of Islam is not like going into the toilet and coming out it's not as easy as that oh I left the fold of Islam mashallah I said the shahada 50 times why because I made kufur 50 times a day so I say shahada 50 times a day you're crazy you have a problem so it is not as easy as that it is related to conviction now this man when he prayed without W was he deliberately mocking Islam No was he interested in insulting the religion or mocking Allah no he's misguided confused ignorant of the ruling so definitely he's not a cafir but he has committed a major sin now this is different from someone who pretends to be a Muslim and he's not a Muslim like many disbelievers come and pray in the Masjid with us and work they enjoy it and they do what they do they're cfir it's different from someone who is mocking the religion and making fun of religion and pretending to pray to make others laugh and make fun of no this is kufur he's mocking Islam so I hope this answers your question next question to take from the sister's side sister you just request to come forward over here and just ask your question loudly so we can inshallah answer them any sister has any questions okay uh sister if you want you can write a question down we can ask you can ask it then for the brothers you can go ahead brother again being a hypoc the the risk of being a hypocrite prevent the of good advice should fearing the fearing hypocrisy prevent me from giving good advice fearing of hypocrisy can never be a deterrent from giving a good advice why because a real hypocrite doesn't give a advice so a real hypocrite doesn't fear hypocrisy so this is the biggest sign that you're not a hypocrite I get people coming to me on counseling sessions and they cry and they weep I'm a hypocrite I'm a C I'm I said why because I do this I do that said a hypocrite doesn't cry a hypocrite doesn't fear Allah do you fear hell yes W I'm terrified do you fear Allah of course do you fear your sins 100% sheh I get sleepless nights you're a Believer go home can I get a refund no you can't you've already fa for so it's this easy Shan messes your head big time and you have to identify who's whispering in your head a Shan or an angel does angel whisper in your head no of course he does people say no M does he yes he does the Hadith says the angel has a whisper and the devil has a whisper what is the whispering of the Angel promising you the truth and asking you to believe in goodness and the whispering of the devil promising you falsehood and and lie and asking you to believe in falsehood and in sins so when you get Whispers in your head identify can you can you differentiate if this is Whispering of angel or or or devil yes or no how do you say no I don't know don't you know the difference between evil and good so if I'm here finishing this Q&A and I get Whispers in my head saying to me okay after we finish you go home and watch I'm a Swifty watch the latest uh um concert for Taylor Swift okay okay oh wait wait wait who's this do you need to be a rocket scientist it's Shan but if I finish I get Whispers saying okay when you finish this question on this inshallah we go home uh I didn't read uh my ju of the Quran and then I will prepare for tomorrow's lecture and inshallah I'll try to pray six raas of night prayer and go to bed early so that I can wake up before faer and pray faer at the Masid and hey hey wait excuse me who's talking to me who's this angel angel is telling me so you definitely can identify who's telling you yes or no Shan tell tells you you're a hypocrite you're a cafir you're doomed to Hell Shan comes and tells you you did not perform M this is my 50th W what are you no no no no do it again who's this uh I don't know you identify definitely Shan so once you are able to identify this you can tell easily inshallah that it is not hypocrisy H hypocrisy Hypocrites don't go and say a shall I tell him to come to the tomorrow shall I tell him to uh not drink with his left hand because it's Haram or would I be a hypocrite no you this is something that is good for him and for you gets your rewards make your intention good for Allah you're a good uh person inshallah okay the sisters have two chances so we give them two questions and come brothers so the first question is why do you have two ra for and why not three why do we perform one R and twice in short what is the wisdom behind the structure of the a man asked once a Sheikh and he said Sheikh why is zamzam water not tasty is Zam Zam water tasty no it has some salt in it it has some taste in it so he said why is zamzam water not tasty and the scholar said so that Allah would know who drinks it for his sake when it is tasty everybody drinks it for the taste but when it is not and you know the blessing in the Baraka and you're drinking it then you doing it for the sake of Allah the same goes for rituals in Islam why do we pray m 3 not four why do we pray fer two and not four why do we fast Ramadan and not January it's cold why do we give zakat 2.5% on cash and gold and Investments 5% on crops that are irrigated by rain 10% on crops that we irrigate with pumps and machines doesn't make any sense because this is part of Allah's testing of your IM Allah revealed inah when the Muslims were in Mecca their was where nottin the whole go a little bit shorter huh no it was Jerusalem Al so the Muslims used to put the Kaa in between so they prayed in the direction of Jerusalem to Mecca where is Jerusalem Direction wise North it is to the north when they migrated to Medina they used to pray to Jerusalem North and all of a sudden Allah told them to change the direction to to meah which is South 180Â° so the Hypocrites and the Jews said oh the Muslims don't know Muhammad doesn't know where to head north or south the west or east so Allah revealed the Ayah we Allah have not made the that you are on today except so that it would reveal to us who follows the prophet from those who do not so the rituals and the orders and the commands in the Quran about everything it's just a test the same test was given long long back when Allah ele elevated the level of Satan El Lucifer to the level of angels he's Jin he's not an angel but Allah promoted him then Allah ordered them all to prostrate to Adam they all prostrated except Satan El so Allah said why did you not prostrate to what I have created with my two hands and this is an indication that Allah has hands because if the hands like the say it is Allah's power Allah doesn't have hands Allah has power so Allah created Adam with his power if this was true Satan would have said well you created me with your power as well wouldn't he but he did not because Allah created Adam with his hands Allah favored and blessed Adam with this honor so Satan says it doesn't make sense oh Allah you created Adam from clay and you created me from fire and the fire is better than clay why should I prostrate to him so he rejected he refused a direct order and command from Allah using what his intellect his logic which is corrupt you can't use logic with SH with instructions Allah says do something you do it you don't say um no no thank you not today it doesn't make sense so when you come and say why is f and not one or this or that you have similarity to Satan's thinking are you related but watch out huh and Allah knows best the next question is what is the ruling of making M on while performing more than 30 Companions of the Prophet Alat wasam report that wiping over the is part of the of the Prophet the means the foot wear whatever you wear on your feet so it is part of the Sunnah there is a difference of opinion among Scholars some limit this only to socks made of leather it has to be made of leather and there is nothing in sh that says it has to be made of leather some say it must not be seethrough some say it must not be cotton some say it must not where do you bring this on Allah made this concession to make life easy so whenever or whatever you wear on your feet if the two conditions are fulfilled you can wipe over them when you come to the area of washing the feet what are these two conditions number one that you must put on your shoes your socks your Footwear after an original woodoo an original woodoo is the thing that you wash your limbs the normal woodo with washing your feet now I'm in the state of tahara I'm in the state of VO if I put on my socks immediately or after two hours or after 5 hours it's okay because when I put them on am I in the state of wo yes condition one is fulfilled condition two that it must cover the area that was supposed to be washed so the socks have has to cover your toes your foot and your ankles this this is the area I should wash above that no problem but if your ankles or part of them were exposed you cannot wipe over that and these are the two conditions and Allah knows best okay somebody at home he has to pray when he comes to the Masjid before he sits down because his is another okay so the question is the prophet ordered that no one prays between aan and of except the two of what if a person prayed them home and walked to the Masjid and came in and theama was not given the people are still waiting for the Imam so he wants to sit down we say to him pray these two raas why because you can't sit down without them and this is an exception but if you did not pray your Sun home and you came to the m to the Masid some brothers pray two and this is wrong just pray the of and is combined in joined and included by default and Allah knows best the next question from the sister side the sister is asking about unmarried women working abroad without any families so she has other female friends in that country is this allow doesn't make sense are you asking about the ruling on living in a country without any family or are you asking about traveling without a Mah to a different country she has to another country to work okay so if a sister says what's the ruling on traveling to another country for work whether uh uh I have family there or not but the issue is traveling without the companionship of a male Maham the answer was given by the prophet himself he said it is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah in the day of judgment to travel without a male Maham a man stood up and said oh prophet of Allah my wife went for Hajj but my name was chosen to go for Jihad of with the expedition of so and so now I'm in a dilemma what should I do the prophet said said to him go and catch up with your wife leave Jihad the prophet did not ask him is she old or young the prophet Alam did not ask him if she's beautiful or ugly the prophet did not ask him if she's alone or with the companionship of other trusted women he said it is not permissible no matter what the reason is to go for Hajj which is a pillar of Islam without the company of a m Maham leave Jihad and accompany your wife so by this we know by default a woman traveling to a foreign country the travel itself is Haram staying there with without male mam without people to take care of her is definitely also Haram what kind of ideas would run in her head and what would Shan do to a woman who no one knows if she does anything Haram nobody cares this is problematic and unlam there's a wide Fortuner behind this blocking someone's car just please could you remove it than okay the question from the brother so if a woman is pregnant and it's time for her labor delivery when should she stop praying the scholars say that she should stop praying when she starts to bleed and this is the usually accompanying blood that comes with the postnatal bleeding or after uh she delivers but if she let's say breaks water she did not bleed she's still pure she can pray she has to pray to the best of ability maybe or most not maybe most likely she's not going to be able to pray standing up not even sitting down in this case she prays lying on her side as per theith ofus but she should not stop praying until she sees the traces of blood and Allah knows best the contractions are not a sign of uh giving birth until we see the blood that prevents her from praying the next and sisters what is the ruling on playing Quran recitation as a background audio in random videos and reads ands Quran is Quran if a person plays them or puts them with a video so that people would listen to them yes but if it is only sound effect only like background music no this is Haram it is not permissible to use the Quran in such a fashion because this is disrespecting it and Allah Knows Best I I I I did not see the comparison yes we said that the prophet showed Mercy to the people where is the harm them when they harm him there is a difference between alud and in Arabic Allah says in the Quran the the idol worshippers would wish that you compromise your religion for their sake so that they would compromise their religion for your sake as they said worship our Lord one day and we worship yours one day this is called Mudah when you give parts of your religion and your faith for the sake of others mudat is when you give some of your own rights for worldly things or for uh uh um reward from Allah meaning someone does something Haram there is no compromise there is no Mercy or um being diplomatic or kind Haram is Haram you have to stop here this is why the prophet was he was the smiley and someone who would execute prescribed punishment at the same time so religion is a red line we cannot play someone does something Haram the prophet shows utmost anger and Vengeance us may Allah be pleased with him and with his father comes to the prophet and says oh prophet of Allah this woman from makum from qur she's one of the dignitaries and you uh sentenced her for her hand to be chopped off so show us some leniency and pardon her the prophet was outraged and he said do you seek intercession in one of the prescribed punishments of Allah by Allah if Fatima were to steal I would have chopped her hand off so this is a clear example no compromise in religion but when someone pulled the prophet from behind that was not related to religion that was related to him personally he forgave and showed Mercy when someone parks in front of my home under my shade my tree I would not come to his four tires and flat flatten them I would usually but in the M I wouldn't do that because this is not related to religion it's related to me personally I forgive so this is a huge difference you have to be aware and alert of someone insults you personally who cares people come in sometimes and argue with me and when they're not happy with my argument they say w she you're an ass I say yeah this is my nickname my nickname is as I am this is how my name is spelled and my students say oh she he's insulting when someone says I'm an ass am I going to grow ears and a tail I don't care but if he insults religion if he insults uh uh Quran makes fun no this is where we have to part our ways I hope this makes sense the next question if a man and woman get divorced online within 10 days of marriage will only the women be considered a divorce or also the man also can the man register again I was reading a message sorry if a man and woman get divorced online within 10 days of marriage will only the woman be considered a divorce or also the man and also can his next first what is meant by the man is not a divorce it takes two to tangle of course if Islamic Nashid and she's your Mah but you can't Tango alone so if a marriage happens we have a couple they're married yes man and wife whether it's an hour whether it's a week whether it's a month whether it's a decade they're called married if the divorce takes place after the marriage even after 5 minutes the marriage is dissolved it's broken and we have a divorc couple a divorc c man and a woman so what's the problem she's angry that people call her divorced and the man is not he's loose no he is also divorcing what's the second question second marriage be considered for the man first married or of course not when the man gets married again that would be considered his second marriage maybe maybe the problem with the sister is that why is the woman when not married called a Bier a virgin and when she's married she's considered to be a someone who's married and so if she's divorced when a second proposal comes she identifies herself as a someone who was married this is fact why don't we give the man a similar title so he just do we just say no he's divorced he was a divorce why did we he say he's a he's not bicker anymore because it doesn't work like this in Arabic language there is nothing for the man to be described like that and Allah Knows Best City when I stay at their house it's like staying at home there's no have enough so the brother says if I travel to another city to visit a relative a brother my brother my sister and I have food I have a shelter I have uh a bed to sleep on so what's the ruling on shortening my prayers as a traveler the question is not whether you have food or not the question is are you labeled as a traveler or not meaning when people call your home Salam alaykum alaykum is uh XY Z there no W he left yesterday he traveled to his sister's house if you're in London well he's in Birmingham or he's in Glasgow he went to visit relatives and so what would that be he's a traveler in this case you have the concession and this is why when the Ayah of shortening the prayers inaha was revealed Allah said that there is no uh burden upon you to shorten prayers when traveling if if you fear that the disbelievers would harass you or give you FNA Omar said prophet of Allah s Ali wasallam today we're in safety there is no FNA no disbelievers can intercept our ways so why do we shorten the prophet said this is a concession and a gift given to you to from Allah accept it so I come all the way from Saudi to Kuwait I shorten prayers I'm a traveler anyone calls my home where is the sheh she's traveling I have the concession alhamdulillah and this is the gift from Allah that's why I did not lead because if I led is I will pray two rakas imagine the whole Masjid praying and what this crazy IM praying two ra lots of people would make lots of problems so I'd rather not Pray when there is shortening needed h uh the next question is from sisters so uh we know and believe the knowledge of future is with Allah is it allowed to study degree in meteorology the way the for yes because the the knowledge of future is still with Allah meteorology and weather forecast is nothing to do with future telling it is not even a prediction it is based on science the clusters of clouds the uh pressure of the air the currents warm or cold coming from everything is seen on images from the satellites and studying how the the effects of it and the norm of it and they can tell there's no prediction and also in addition so many times oh it's going to rain tomorrow nothing happens s you go and check the weather on your app oh tomorrow is sunny let's go for barbecue and it rains dogs and cats Subhan Allah so it is not a predict it's not a future telling it's a prediction based on scientific signs and and facts and there's nothing wrong in that inshallah so the brother is asking so the brother who went to his relative how long should he shorten the prayer and this is an issue of dispute some Scholars say if you intend to stay more than 4 days you have to complete some say it's 9 days 19 days 11 days blah blah blah all of this is not mentioned in the Quran or in the Sunnah and this is whyl say you shorten until you feel that you're not a traveler anymore once you settle kalas meaning if you go to your brother for 4 days 5 days yes he's my brother's house but I'm I'm a traveler but if you go there for six months after the second week most likely you know the Masjid the timings until now I don't know the timings of prayer in In uh Kuwait I have to look for for the app and this is a very good app m is called wow this is a fun app I wish we have one like that because it eases a lot U knowing the prayer times and the I don't know so I shorten when I went to mumbay to do my uh peace TV conference I went to the kinsky Lea kinsky Hotel oh Seven Stars Hotel I lived there for one for one month I also shortened because every couple of weeks or of 10 days they move me to another Suite to another uh and I was not aware of the times I I was still a traveler but if I go for a course of two months or 3 months in one of the countries and I get an apartment and I furnished I put my laundry and my luggage and every I'm settled I would complete my prayer maybe the fourth or the fifth day plus because I'm settled I'm staying there not feeling uh agitated of traveling and shifting and going from one place to the other I hope this answers your question the next question from sisters what is the ruling on the joint family system even when finances perit to Allah for are you serious are you asking me this question and you know the answer all men from the subcontinent hate me because I am very vocal in this joint family is not a good system at all as per Islam I have cases like the hair on my head aldah I'm Bal but there are so many of them of of problems of yeah infidelity between the in-laws let alone the issue of mother-in-law and sister and daughter-in-law I don't know what's in the subcontinent that it's in their DNA that the Mother-in-law should torture her daughter-in-law I don't know what not all of them of course but a huge amount of mother-in-laws think they should make up for the m years of their youth I got a couple coming to my home for counseling about 15 years ago that what I at that time I was doing it for free now it doesn't work this way they came to me and it a couple and his mother and the boy was like 23 years of age and the girl was 17 or 18 and the mother was in her mid 40s early 40s and the little girl was shivering like a chick under the uh uh rainwater terrified what's wrong and the mother started to speak and Shout she she sleeps until 11:00 she doesn't work she doesn't cook she doesn't do anything she's ignorant she's disrespectful blah blah blah blah and the poor thing was shaking and I was trying to be diplomatic at the time I was intrude so I was trying to speak in diplomacy yes maybe this maybe that maybe this and she's not backing off she's hampering and and hammering her on the head then I had to take off my mask and show my real me I said listen do you have daughters she said yes I said would you like your in-laws to treat your daughter like this she of course not said why don't you fear Allah it was like pouring ice water on her head just but this is not fair she I said why she said when I was her age my in-laws used to treat me like this I said are you stupid are you crazy you were suffering and complaining from the Injustice that your in-laws used to do to you you're cascading this to your own daughter-in-law fear Allah it's in the DNA I don't know what's wrong they have no fairness the amount of cases that come come to me of dispute between the woman and her in-laws the poor Mommy's boy kicks his wife to her parents because his mom ordered him and she calls Sheikh they took my gold that my parents gave me and they're depriving me from my wealth from my clothes from everything what kind of people do this answer thieves pure thieves they have no shame no honor no the whole family not the husband not his mother the father and the brothers and everybody yeah these are scum of the earth these are the scum don't look at their cars and their name they're the scum of the earth who dare and take people's jewelry and wealth like this W they the scum if I see them face to face would be a different story but they don't come face to face because they're coward so when you ask me a question like this you're asking for trouble joint family is a no good family a woman is entitled to have her own home she's not forced in Islam to meet her father and mother-in-law let alone serve them and their in-laws and their brother and sister-in-laws children and uh uh cater for their needs no she's not a servant go to some other Asian country and get servants instead of marrying it's cheaper and Allah knows best okay so the usual frequently Asked question children their parents order them to go against the Sunnah in another word disobey Allah shave their beards let their thobes go below the ankles uh not pray in the Masjid watch Haram movies listen to music join them in free mixing Gatherings Etc what to do your parents are your eyes you can't poke them out so you have to honor your eyes but at the same time there is no obedience for anyone in disobeying Allah so you have to this is your test from Allah you have to be respectful you have to be obedient you have to be dutiful to them but when it comes to disobeying Allah this is a red line how to deal with them is up to your own judgment and diplomacy it is not wise at all to go headon Clash oppose Raise Your Voice shout and complain no no no no this is totally unacceptable how to do what to do be diplomatic try to dodge it what are are you going to uh shorten no lengthen your tub when are you going to shorten your beard when are you good said yes yes inshallah okay yeah soon in buys you four or five days whatever they shout they say of course yeah definitely there's a difference of opinion among Scholars and Dodge you a month or two you don't have to give them a lecture we make a mistake of trying sit sit sit sit sit down and you start giving them they will never buy this from you so and and it's not one size that fits all sometimes dodging them does the job sometimes telling the Imam of the Masjid to come and speak to them does your job sometimes they would look into it it sometimes you have to give in some little little things to have more gain it's up to your judgment and your uh diplomacy and wisdom how to tackle them at the end of the day if you are at a crossroad either go right or left definitely there is no obedience to any of Allah's Disobedience you never compromise your religion they like it or not their problem but be diplomatic to gain and win their heart to the best of your ability this is the last question from the sister side and conclude today's session in tomorrow when we have time we take the rest of the questions and then we'll do more live questions the last question is what is the valid ending time of the F if is is at 5:56 a.m. then what is the last time we can pray for what's the last time what's time 556 556 56 it depends is 5 56 the appearance of the tip of the Sun or the whole Sun I think it is the appearance of the whole son not the tip the tip is way earlier the end of fer time is the moment the sun tip arises and and shows no more no more fer it's end because the time of fer here is when the whole sun is above the ground you can't pray ish you have to wait for 10 or 15 minutes until it's in the air now you can pray ishra so the moment the tip of the Sun appears this is the end of time and you should not wait this much and Allah knows best for coming today and spending this whole Friday in learning the de of Allah I I request all of you to come tomorrow as well from 3:30 p.m. in this m and we'll continue our series on the day of the life of the Prophet Muhammad s wasam and the session if you get at the end everyone see you those who want to have pictures"
