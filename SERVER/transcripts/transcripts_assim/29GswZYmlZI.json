  "transcript": "was asked once what is iman so the prophet alaihis salatu gave a description that we need to understand he said if your good deed pleases you and you're saddened by your sins then you are a believer so many people think that when your good deeds please you this means that you're showing off that this goes against sincerity on the contrary when i pray fajr on time i'm happy this is what pleases me because allah azzawajal has granted me the power and ability to pray on time when others were deprived not only that when i commit a sin i'm not happy i don't go around tell people listen i did so and so yesterday and i boast about it on the contrary i try to conceal it i'm regretful and remorseful and i ask allah for forgiveness these are attributes of a believer that we all must have in us as part of knowing that not everything is covered not everything is shirk as so many people keep on whispering and being taunted by the intrusive thoughts of satan to them i've been asking so many questions replying to many queries having many counseling sessions with people with such intrusive thoughts thinking that anything that crosses their mind takes them out of the fold of islam this hadith highlights to us the reality of iman that it increases and decreases and that what people think of themselves as long as it coincides with the quran and sunnah as long they acknowledge that good deeds please allah so it pleases they please me and bad deeds anger allah so i'm depressed and sad with it this would definitely add value to our iman may allah azza make us among those who believe and allah knows best was allah"
