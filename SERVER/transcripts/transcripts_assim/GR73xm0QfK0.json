  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Nigeria please what advice do \nyou have for someone who wants to get married but   he is postponing it because he believes he's \nnot yet at the level of religious commitment   of the kind of person he would like to \nget married to this is something that is   related to a person's preference there isn't \nanything that is considered one size fits all   I don't know his background I don't know \nhis physical health and strength I don't   know about the environment he lives in The \nGeneral basic advice would be get married   as soon as possible if you're physically fit \nand financially able to provide for your wife   saying that I'm not religiously committed yet we \nhave to look into this if the guy says I meant   by that that I have six or seven girlfriends that \nI cannot get rid of I said no of course don't get   married if you're in that level of attitude and \nsins no no stay where you are you're bound to hell   and it's not right to corrupt a poor woman an \ninnocent woman's Life by marrying her if you   can't man up and stop sinning and doing these \nfilthy things don't get don't think of getting   married don't it's not a poker game would you say \noh let me call the shots maybe if I get married I   become a righteous person no you have to become a \nrighteous person stop all Haram then get married   I don't know about this person Umar May \nAllah be pleased with him once saw a man   and the man was fairly mature and old so he asked \nhim are you married and the man said no and Omar   does not sugarcoat so he \nsays to the man one of two   either your impotent meaning you \ndon't have any desire for women   or you are a Fajr meaning that you play around \nand you have extra marital relationships because   this is not normal for a normal man not to get \nmarried so yeah I hope this advice uh does the job and have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford it \nthat's good for you if you cannot you're entitled   for one free session and this is for everybody \nif they can affirm by Allah that they cannot   afford it because they're poor I'll give them \none free session without a problem a full half   an hour so come to me and let's speak about \nit inshallah within the following two days   or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for All"
