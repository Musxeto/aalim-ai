  "title": "Parents forcing to sever ties of kinship with relatives, what should I do? - Sheikh Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "trick I had a couple of questions to question yes that if my father tells me to break off a relationship with my cousin Betsy because he's not getting along with him or disrespected him for something should I said I listened to my father and big or cut off that or severe the ties with my cousin okay second question is a second question is if let's say it's similar but you know my cousin is had an argument argument with my father or and my father has not asked me to severe the relationship with him but at the same time my cousin is not talking to my Park so what should i do should I talk to my cousin in that case or not okay that's the question I have I when I see a Charlotte or a good mario sound brother that would from Pakistan had two questions related very good questions but we have to understand the basics of Islam and once we understand the basics of Islam everything else comes easy and that this is the biggest problem of a lot of the Muslims in order to be able to solve mathematical problems you have to memorize a time table two by two equals four if you don't it would be difficult if you don't have the foundations so going back to his question his father tells him to sever the kinship of a cousin or of anyone so now he's torn between two lovers he's stuck between a rock and a hard place his father obedience is mandatory connecting the ties of kinship is also mandatory so what to do scholars say that if a parent instructs you to disobey allah azza wajal it is mandatory that you disobey your parent how is that because in obeying your parent you will be this obeying allah azzawajal who's more important you've answered yourself so my father tells me go and fetch me a bottle of scotch this is an instruction and an order and I have to obey my father but when I look at the other side of the equation I'd find that buying alcohol or intoxicants is cursed those who carry it are cursed so doing so will get me the curse of allah azza wajal and it's prohibited I have to disobey my father no questions asked a lot of the brothers are faced and the sisters are the result of a broken marriage so the parents are separated the mother says do not see or contact your father's siblings your uncle's your aunt's your cousins from your father's side and he is living with her or the opposite the father tells the son do not contact your mother your mother left you a new year were young so now you have to cut all contact with her again you cannot obey your parent in such an instruction having said that be wise and diplomatic so your father tells you do not visit your cousin Amir and you go and say I will visit him and I will disobey you and I fear only allah azzawajal meeting him head-on is not wise whatever he shouts instead say inshallah inshallah o I will obey you my father and visit him from behind his back this is presuming that everything is normal but if your cousin is bad influence if he does drugs or if he's gay or if he's an atheist of course you cannot visit him and you have to sever your kinship with him until he rejects such a sin or at least be in contact with him through the phone because your father's instruction is in line with Allah's instructions so you have to obey your father his second question is quite the opposite now his cousin does not talk to his father so the cousin is the one who civet kinship ties with his uncle so now he says should I connect to my cousin or because of his sin I should leave him and abandon him his sin does not justify your sin meaning that he is sinful on the day of judgment committing a major sin by not contacting his uncle but this does not justify that I take sides with my father and sever my kinship again Allah ordered me to connect to my kinship and there is no justification for severing it therefore you must talk to your cousin this doesn't mean that you cannot advise him reminding of allah azzawajal of Allah's wrath to those who sever their kinship maybe Allah would guide him on your hands"
