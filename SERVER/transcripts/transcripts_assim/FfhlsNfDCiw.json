  "transcript": "of al mustafa sallallahu wasallam is it a name of the Prophet Aristotle samisen issue of dispute among scholars the majority of scholars since the beginning of time have been using this name in their literature referring to the Prophet Allah so some though there isn't any authentic hadith and this is how we should define whether it is yes or no there isn't any authentic hadith stating that Mustafa is his name but it's the description that from and he is the chosen one Mustafa means that he is the chosen one and he was and his the chosen one sallallahu SLM so there's no problem in using this name to describe the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam though we have to believe that it is not authentic attributed to him and this is different from having a name to Allah see - Olivia you cannot call Allah or describe Allah with anything that is not authentic even if the scholars used it you should refrain from that but for the Prophet are some describing him with such things is permissible user"
