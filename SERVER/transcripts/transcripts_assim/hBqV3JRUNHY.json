  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] AC [Music] alhamdulillah after the prophet wasam tried his level best to call his people to Islam or at least to give him the ability to preach Islam without harassing him or abusing him or attacking him and his companions and all this was not successful the prophet am thought of something else and this is how a real true Muslim should be all the time positive and Progressive so the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam thought of talk of taking his dawa elsewhere as staying in Mecca was proven not to be be very successful due to the arrogance of the people so in the month of Sha of the 10th year of his message or of his prophethood the prophet Alat wasam after the death of his uncle Abu Talib and his wife Khadijah he went to a nearby city known Asif and it's a mountainous City about 60 miles away from Mecca he was accompanied by his previously adopted son Z and he went on foot imagine about five years 5 hours Journey uphill when he reached there there he would have expected to be greeted to be honored or at least to be listened to with dignity he displayed himself and his da to three of the dignitaries of thif who were so evil that not only they rejected his dawa they insulted him and they made fun of him and when they turned his dawa down as the prophet wasam was leaving them they instructed their fools and children to say bad things about him no not only that also to throw him with pibbles and Stones this made his feet bleedat and he left t with his injuries in another Hadith mother AA may Allah be pleased with her asked the prophet Alat wasam whether he had ever encountered anything more stressing and difficult than the Battle of and the prophet saidat yes indeed I faced something worse than the Battle of uhud where 70 of my beloved companions were mared among them was my own Uncle ham ABD MB and that was on the day of T when I was thrown with pibbles and stones and turned down with insult and disrespect he said I went down back to Mecca so depressed to the extent that I woke up in an area near to Mecca some say it's near to mina so he walked approximately 4 hours downhill unaware of that because of this huge burden that he was carrying in his chest after the trauma he faced or was put in by the people of t and as he was in this state he heard the voice from a cloud above when he looked up it was jiel peace be upon him the Archangel telling him that Allah has heard what your people had done and said to you and he ordered the angel of the mountains to obey you and the angels of the mountains came to him and said oh Muhammad if you wish I'll bring together the two mountains of Mecca to crush them as a punishment if you wish just tell me give me the command and I will demolish everything on their heads any one of us would have been happy and approved and gave his consent on the spot the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said I hope that Allah will bring forth from their offspring people who will worship Allah alone and not associate anything with him and this shows you that the heart of the Prophet Alam was filled with love and compassion and mercy to the whole world afterwards the prophet Alam continued to do what he was doing for the past 10 years well actually for the past six years because three years was In Secret and then the following six or 7 years was in public so a month later it was the season of Hajj and people are coming from all over Arabia to perform their pilgrimage and we know that they were pagans so they came to Hajj worshiping Allah where actually they were worshiping the idols surrounding the Kaaba then why would they come to Mecca because there was still some traces of the religion of ibraim peace be upon him so the prophet continued to speak to tribe after tribe and show them the beauty of Islam and ask them if they had it in them that they would believe in him and take him in to their tribe so that he would live among them and preach them Islam one of these tribes at that particular year came from Medina and Medina at the time was known as ye that was the Pagan name of it so there were six men from Medina specifically from the tribe of alhaz who came to Hajj so the prophet Alat wasam took this opportunity and he addressed them to see whether they would feel interested in learning about Islam when the prophet met them he asked them would you be interested in listening listening to what I have because they identified themselves to be from the tribe or from the group of alaz and they were known to be allies of the Jews so when he acknowledge this he invited them to sit and listen to him and they agreed the moment they heard the Quran the moment they heard his da to monism to it was very logical now we have to know that in Medina there was the and there was Al and each one of them were Allied to a tribe or two from the Jews so Medina was inhabited by the Arabs and the Jews and among the tribes of Jews and the likes and they the Jews used to fuel the feud between the and the so after the fights took place and it took place for many many long years the Jews used to say to the Arabs this is the time where Allah would send us a messenger and under his flag we shall in alate you all we should kill you all like the killing of or so when they heard the Quran and saw the da of the Prophet Alat wasam they knew that this is the man and they said to one another this is the man that the Jews are threatening you with you have to hasten and accept his DAW and become Muslim so they did accept Islam and they went back to their people preaching them of this dawa of the prophet and there was no house in Medina of the ANS which the mentioning of the Prophet Alam did not enter there a year later in the month of shaal in the 11th year of prophethood the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam married AA the daughter of Abu Bakr his best friend and she was six years of age so the prophet married her as a marriage contract but did not consumate the marriage until she was 9 years of age and that was after migrating to Medina and this marriage was prescribed by Allah and he was ordered by Allah to marry her and that was the happiest thing that ever had happened in the life of Aisha and also in the life of of her parents and she was the Beloved wife of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam till he died in this year a miraculous event took place some say this was a form of compensation to the prophet Alat wasam to conso him for the death of his uncle and his wife Allah sent to the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam the Archangel jiel while he was in his home accompanied by a ride known as Al and this was smaller than a horse but bigger than a mule and this was a creation of Allah asael to take the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam from meca to in Al known as Jerusalem and it was so fast faster than Lightning faster than lightning and there he mounted in went into the Masjid and led the prayer where all the prophets and Messengers prayed behind him all them who came before him and then he was as ascended to the heavens and he went to the first Heaven the second Heaven till the sixth Heaven meeting various number of prophets and Messengers and talking to them where afterwards he was admitted to Allah's Court where he Pro frustrated until was given the instruction to rise up and he could not see anything but light and Allah talked to him and Allah revealed to him the obligation to pray 50 prayers a day which our Prophet MSA peace be upon Him asked him to go back and ask Allah asael for reduction so he kept on going back and forth and Allah reduces them from 50 to 45 to 40 235 until it was settled to be five prayers per day and night and the prophet would not go back and ask Allah for reduction and Allah Asel said to them that I have decided what what the obligation should be and have reduced the number or the burden for my umah for my servants and slaves [Music] for [Music]
