  "title": "If I make Ruqyah for one illness, do I need a separate intention for it to work on other  illnesses?",
  "transcript": "Ahnaf from Bangladesh is our first caller. I made Ruqyah for my stomach disease but after doing that I recall that I have something disease in my eye as well. So in this case if I drink the previous Ruqyah water would it be sufficient or do I have to do Ruqyah on the water bottle again with the intention for my eyes? First of all when you do Ruqyah you do not require an intention of a specific illness. The Ruqyah is a Ruqyah. So if you do it for example for a disease in your eyes it can also cure with the grace of Allah an evil eye or any black magic or envy or your illnesses in your knees and etc. You don't have to have an intention just drink it with the intention of Allah Azza Wa Jal curing your illness and Allah knows best."
