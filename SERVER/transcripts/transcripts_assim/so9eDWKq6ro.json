  "transcript": "from bosnia what's up a ruling on believing in coincidence if somebody says that i met your brother yesterday in the market we didn't have an appointment but it was a coincidence if they're referring to that this is not deliberate and it happened by the decree of allah azzawajal no problem saying that it's like saying what luck this person has wow this guy is lucky oh his his bad luck that he if they meant that it is related to destiny because we don't have luck as it is separately from destiny and we don't have coincidence or chance separated from destiny so i hope this is permissible inshallah"
