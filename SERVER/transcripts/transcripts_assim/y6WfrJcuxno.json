  "transcript": "Brother Talha from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Sheikh should we give like our kindly or harshly some people some say we must be harsh because people change like change the religion of Allah while other people say being high being kind helps people like listen better so what is the correct approach? Talha what was the approach of the Prophet Alayhi Salatu Wassalam? Talha. I'm not sure. Come on you have to go to the seerah even if you don't go to the seerah if you go to the Quran Allah Azza Wa Jal says it is by the mercy of Allah Azza Wa Jal O Prophet Muhammad that you are lenient and soft with them had you been rude and harsh they would have dispersed from around you so the way of the Prophet Alayhi Salatu Wassalam all the time was to be lenient with the disbelievers with the wrongdoers Ma'iz Ibn Malik comes to him and says O Prophet of Allah I've committed adultery purify me he looks the other way he comes from the other way O Prophet of Allah I committed adultery in front of all his companions four times and the Prophet keeps on looking the other way if these harsh rude individuals who claim that no we have to be harsh we have to be aggressive where at the time of the Prophet they would have whipped him or beaten him up Alayhi Salatu Wassalam they would have beaten up Ma'iz but the Prophet did not do that the Prophet was always kind and merciful because he was sent as a mercy to all mankind sometimes and rarely that is he used to be a bit harsh when the aggression or when the wrongdoing was done from a knowledgeable person and he knew the ruling as when he spoke harshly with Abu Dharr Al-Ghaffari for being a racist when addressing Bilal saying you are the son of a black woman or when he was harsh with his companion who was wearing gold or with Abdullah Ibn Amr when he said did your mom tell you to wear these saffron dyed clothes but these are incidents that you can count on a single hand maximum two hands 23 years of his life he was always soft-spoken kind and gentle so do not look at these ignorant imbeciles who keep on snobbishly talking to people from the tip of their nose thinking that they're in their ivory tower have the ability to control people and say Simon says do this and do that no the they don't have control they don't have the authority of the Prophet peace be upon him they don't have the knowledge and the kindness and the mercy of the Prophet peace be upon him so disregard them and throw them in the closest dustbin"
