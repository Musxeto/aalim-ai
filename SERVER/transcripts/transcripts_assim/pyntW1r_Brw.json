  "title": "Has a woman nullified her Islam if she knows the permissibility of Polygamy but does not like it?",
  "transcript": "[Music] and her second question is that one of the nullifiers of islam is to doubt so we have to have certainty and yakin so if a woman doubts the permissibility of polygamy would that nullify her islam and says yes and be careful there is a difference between hating polygamy and doubting its permissibility or even doubting it is part of islam so if a woman does not wear the hijab but she acknowledges that this is in the quran she doesn't wear it because it makes me hot it makes me sticky it's humid blah blah blah but i'm certain that this is part of the religion she's sinful but she's a muslim if a woman wears the hijab culturally but she says that this is not logical why do me women wear the hijab and men don't do this i don't believe in this i don't think this is fair oh this woman has committed an act of apostasy because she's rejecting not doubting rejecting allah's ruling likewise a woman would fight tooth and nail against her husband getting a second wife that's your right she's jealous she's threatening to divorce that's your right it's up to you but a woman who says that this is not fair why don't women get married to a second man and take another husband at the same time if she rejects and objects to allah's ruling this is an act of an apostasy may allah azza will save us all"
