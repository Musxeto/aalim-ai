  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] bismillah r-rahman r-rahim wa salatu was-salam ala rededicating alhamdulillah and welcome back to another episode of life's adornments we're discussing the virtues of child rearing its benefits is Charles and tribulations and how do we return back to the Quran and Sunna with regards to raising our children in an Islamic and manner hamdulillah we last talked about the causes of deviation for children and we wanted to go a bit deeper into this topic today and talk about some more subtle things that may happen inside of the home that cause children to go astray we know that every parent's wish is to see the child on Sarah thermistor came on the straight path to be obedient to Allah who subhana wa ta'ala to worship allah and to follow in the footsteps of the prophet mohammed salah salem but oftentimes this isn't always the case so what do we do in these matters how can we defend it how can we block these matters and how can we protect our household to help us with these matters we have shaken our document and Hakeem who is a teacher at that Academy nki you and an imam and teacher for over 30 years we would like to introduce and welcome our guests acid America wonderful la guardia come salawatullahi wa barakato no i'm sure cuz i was a pleasure to have you myself it's not gonna hear the pleasure is all mine alright as is our tradition let's get directly into the matter the first thing at hand is conflicts within the home and this oftentimes leads to divorce or not but how does conflict within the home the tribulations that happen how does that affect the child and caused them in certain cases to go astray she's not mind over him and whom did allah o salat wa salam o allah rasool allah he was early he was arabic woman today be who there who am i back everyone knows that the environment affects you whether positively or negatively and the term that we often say and hear a lot is i'm not in a good mood so what helps in changing your mood definitely there are a number of factors among the greatest of them is your upbringing and this is why we focus a lot upon the parents because they can make or break a child we know that marital disputes in the household is a normal thing it's like the spices you put on the food if it's too much it's gonna spoil it and if there's no spices at all you look for it somewhere else change the restaurant for example may God forbid so what happens when a couple fight in front of their children they display what the child is going to be in the future and this is cascaded to anyone who is a role model so if you have a teacher who's arrogant who's abusive this would have a negative impact on the student if you have the couple's the father parents who are like this that will impact your child and if you have an imam of the masjid if you have a scholar and this is one of the biggest problems you have in today's times when a scholar who is knowledgeable who is highly decorated unfortunately he does not walk the talk he's arrogant he's abusive he ridicules people he even back bites others on the account that this is sure what our deal and this is what the man has says we have to do well what are you doing would the Prophet do such things that is a sample you should know the Salaf say do you have to be tough and rough and rigid with the people of innovation people of innovation differ there are different levels and some of them have misinterpreted and not intentionally diverted from the sirat al-mustaqim from the straight path so you have to treat them differently not brush them with the or paint them with the same brush and considered them all halal for you to backbiting slander and and and make fun of so the children are vulnerable and you mold them as you wish in a household where the parents can communicate even when angry and the child is watching the father is not hitting the mother he's not cursing her he's not saying offensive words the mother is not shouting at him or throwing things at him rather they are disputing they have an argument they have different of opinions but it is civilized this is how your child is going to grow up but if it's the other way around and unfortunately we have lots of examples not only in the Muslim world in even domestic violence is a big issue worldwide so many women talk to me about domestic violence and I tell them that such marriage is not a healthy one what are you waiting for until he kills you if he punches you if he strangles you if he makes or puts bruises on your body what is next so you have to do something and then the first thing you do usually is get a medical report so that this is a legal document and a lot of the men unfortunately don't fear Allah rather they fear the police and being prosecuted for domestic violence and this is a serious offence almost everywhere so they have to do something about it the most important thing is not to have these fights in front of the children and you can see how it reflects when a child starts to physically abuse his siblings younger or older because now he is becoming trained and he has a role model to follow and this is all because of the mistakes that are beyond repair in some cases of the parents I almost came across the narration from about Sheryl Hana our mother where she would say or Abu Ibrahim in certain cases yes and this is the process when I'm told her that I know when he upset at me because you swear by the Lord of Ibrahim and we're happy with me you swear by the Lord of Mohammed true so it makes me think to myself and I was younger I never really saw my parents argue or conflict so when I got married and older and I came into the conference which is normal I was like wait a minute this happens that I didn't really know directly how to handle it so I think is it would it be true that perhaps if conflicts were in front of the children but handled in a respectable and Islamic matter could this then strengthen them in the future and teach them how do you deal with this court in conflict well we have three scenarios one abusive parents having arguments that is physical or unhealthy this would definitely reflect on the child in a negative way then we have the second scenario where they have conflicts but they don't express it it's all behind closed doors this would definitely not impact the children negatively but at the same time it depends on the upbringing of the child and how Allah social guides him or not so usually it has no negative nor positive impact and then we have the third scenario where they do argue but in a civil way and at the end of the day they kiss and make up and the children have a happy ending and this shows them that whenever you communicate with others then this would have a positive result insha'Allah this would most likely not always but most likely would have a positive impact on them yeah so how how they learn and abate how they see their parents is their first way to interpret how to deal with conflict but in these abusive situations you recommend what it needs to be done because many times in our message it you see a sister will be abused by her husband and she'll come to the Imam and in these different people but it's like a sticky situation so how do you recommend this behind there's nothing sticky about it first of all we have a hierarchy we have a chain of command so first of all the sister and we will assume that she is the weakest link and that she's on who's being oppressed because I have unfortunately counseled men who are being beaten up by their wives yes and some of them for a few years now is patiently waiting for a solution and the brother Coleman says what to do he has the physical ability to retaliate but you will always be under the microscope you'll always be the aggressor even if you do it in self-defense nobody believes it so assuming that the woman is under attack in this case she has to communicate with her husband when he's in a good mood if this doesn't work he's always on the edge and he's just waiting to burst then she has to talk if it's possible with him to a marriage counselor a Muslim marriage counselor who would listen to both of them and pinpoint the mistakes most men would not like this because they know they're it's their fault then she has to go and address this to her parents and her siblings they have to stand by her side and show him okay you want to pick a fight pick a man your size and don't show your strength to a poor woman when he sees that there are men who are ready to beat the heck out of him then he would realize that okay let me consider this twice because most of such so-called rage is selective it's not real so he has or he justifies what he had done because I have rage issues I apologize to my wife okay so Han Allah when a police officer stops you gives you a ticket and maybe insults you would you have these rage attacks against him so don't you put me in prison what about if your boss who's got authority to sign your increment and bonus and raise if he insults you would you retaliate with a rage fit said no of course not I can't what about if someone says something to anger you or gives you the gesture of a finger or two or whatever on road and you want to express your rage and you want to fight with him but you discover that he's 64 from Brussels full of muscles so what are you gonna do say I'm gonna kiss his knees this is the high as I reach said okay subhanAllah this means your your rage is selective you choose to abuse your wife because you're a person who does not fear Allah is ocean not because you have rage problems so such people you have to stop them yes sometimes logic is not good enough so you have to obtain medical reports and tell them how to I'm taking you to court tomorrow and then they'll throw your backside in in jail for a long time that he was thought or intimidate him with your father and siblings let them talk to him man-to-man and tell him that we don't accept this you took our daughter from our house in honor and we trusted you you should not do what you're doing maybe this would help we're gonna pause here a lot for a short break and we'll come right back to continue with the causes of deviation for children stay tuned with us until you get back assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh [Music] assalamu alaikum and welcome back to our second segment of life's adornments we're discussing the causes of a child or children the deviation hamdulillah we last talked about conflict within the household and how that then affects the growing up of a child and causes them to go outside so this is an issue where many times children have issues within the household conflicts within the household and then it causes them to leave outside and learn in the streets as we say in America the school of hard knocks so you learn upbringing you learn about yourself your identity and how to behave from the streets as opposed to learning from the household and then you pick up bad companionship so we want to talk to Shea Qasim about how does a bad companionship affect the Tobia the upbringing of a child well the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam clearly explained this to us when he gave us the similar to the comparison between a good companion and a bad companion no so the Prophet told us that a good companion is like a person who sells perfumes and Musk so if I know such a person just being in touch with him he would either sell me something that is good in in fragrance or he would give me as a sample that would Oh take this smells good or the least is just by going to his shop I'll catch some of the perfumes in my clothes so a good companion is like that you sit with a good companion he would remind me of an ayah of a hadith of a nice incident he would see something that is wrong is it ugly this is wrong what you're doing is Haram or you should do this or why not go with me to the message and pray how about our own Rob imagine if you say subhanAllah we'll be having a hundred times allowed forgive all of your sins so many things you can benefit from a good companion the least is that he would have you back if someone backed bites you he would defend you if someone wants to harm you he would stand by you now a bad companion is totally the opposite he's like a man working in the bellows so he is a blacksmith working with iron and coal and fire if you go to his shop maybe some of the sparks would burn your clothes and if nothing harms you or burns you the least is that your clothes your beard your hair would smell awful so this is a bad companion it's bad news nowadays our lives are negatively impacted by the bad companions those who we ride with who we hang out with I know a friend who picked up smoking and at an early age so I asked him how could that be he said my father was an influential man who was busy all the time my mom was not educated so she only worked in the house for securing our food and clothes and you know normal house shorts so whenever I wanted to communicate with any one of them they would give me money and say go out buy something from the grocery shop so I used to hang out on the streets for six or seven hours doing nothing so I met others who were like me and hamdullah it was only limited to smoking cigarettes there was no weed or any something that is more awful than those cigarettes smoking is haram but it is compared today it's whoa mashallah he's a righteous person he only smokes so unfortunately there are so many things that have deteriorated in the communities but it starts with smoking so he said I was 12 years of age and I picked up smoking at that early age subhanAllah the guy sprays in the message it and he's okay but he picked this habit which is now almost impossible to kick because he was raised doing it and this is one aspect now in school you fall under what is known as peer pressure so yes you're straight you're a good guy you pray in the message and you end up by so many people asking you all the time do you have a girlfriend no I don't are you gay no then why don't you have a girlfriend a lot of the people who fall under this peer pressure if not if they do not look for a real girlfriend they make up stories and they live in fantasies and they lie so they tell their peers yeah I have one I have two we've been to the movie we took her to the drive-in and we saw a beautiful movie we went there and we did this did that all lies okay you're a good Muslim why are you doing this said oh Allah he they've been pressuring me and they almost accused me of being gay who do we let him in the  out of you so you lie he says lying is better than doing the right thing the opposite which is taking a girlfriend I know of a friend who was used to talk to me about his past he says when I was 16 17 years of age I used to pray five prayers in the Masjid but I had friends I wasn't a practicing Muslim I just prayed I had friends that I hung up out with every single night and whenever it was married time I would stand up and say you know play cards do whatever I would stand up and say okay it's Margaret um I'm going to pray the five or six friends of his would mock him and make fun of him and I say oh sure oh hey ma'am make dua for us and they laugh so he went the first day the second day the third day he fell under the peer pressure and he skipped mother prayer why because this is the influence of bad company and again we always use the same hadith of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam when he told us about the murderer who killed a hundred soul and the scholar told him you live in an environment that helps you do that you have to leave them migrate to another city where or a town where there are righteous practicing people you worship Allah with them the environment affects you and do not listen to the whispers of Shaitaan because sometimes Shaitaan comes to me and says masha'Allah you're a practising share why don't you mix with actors and actresses and and celebrities and enjoy your time and give them dower you have knowledge so he play another game not me if you bring a good healthy red apple and you put it in a rotten box of apples will it fix them they will spoil it and make it decay so your heart is also vulnerable to such attacks the children are in great need of good company and by the way it's not only the streets it is the international schools you put your children in I am shocked when I go and see Muslim families putting their children in International schools okay no problem why are doing this said we want them to learn English but you're Arabs you're Muslims people from America people from Europe wish they spend all of their wealth just to learn Arabic and to teach it to the children while you are doing the opposite what is this they say well english is the language of the millennium that english is this is english is that okay what about their Islamic education zero their knowledge of the Quran zero their knowledge of al-qaeda some of the children who are fifteen or sixteen sixteen years of age you ask them what are the pillars of Islam they make mistakes what are the six pillars of Eman did not even know what is a other the predestiny and how to think about it what kind of Islam is this so negative influence coming from bad company is not limited only to the thugs on the streets it can be self imposed when you take your children when you make your children under the influence that the Western civilization is sophisticated is something that is cool and you're nothing without it occupying your thoughts and life and acting like them and being like them so this is one aspect again of bad company yeah it reminded me of a sort of situation I had when I was growing up but today I had a sort of a strong personality growing up and I wasn't overly practicing but I just had like a system that knew there are certain things I just wouldn't enter in and even and I had a really bad company around me so I will come and hang with the guys that were on the corner selling drugs and doing things but when I will come around they would like hide the drugs you know this way and I always thought it was fine until one day there was one of our friends who he was driving and there was some guys who had just robbed a bank and I them for a ride home so the police stopped them and they gave him 20 years for being an accessory so when I told my father what happened he said yes this is why a lot of thoughts toward us don't even come close because sometimes just by being an environment when a lot of punishes people if you're president you're gonna receive a bit of that as well the company is important not only to our children it is important to us imagine in surat al-kahf which Muslims read every single Friday Alonzo Gee is addressing the Prophet is awesome by saying what's weird enough SEC you have to force yourself to be among those who met remember allah azza wajal day and night seeking his face shaking his pleasure and do not look left right or center to others and do not obey those whom we have made their hearts neglectful and hideous so if this is said to the Prophet I saw the Senate then by default we are in greater need of that with that being said we're going to end our program today a Chaba thank you so much for your wisdom and sharing your great novels ma'sha'allah Jacqueline behave for the viewers we hope that she benefited much insha'Allah I stay tuned for another episode of life's enormous until next time assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh [Music] [Music] [Music]"
