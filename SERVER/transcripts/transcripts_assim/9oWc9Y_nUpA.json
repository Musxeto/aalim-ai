  "title": "Can someone deprive his siblings from inheritance cuz he's the only one spending on the mother Assim",
  "transcript": "um i think his third question was about wanting to deprive the other siblings the other heirs from their share of the inheritance simply because i'm the only one taking care of my mom so if my father dies my mom gets one eighth i get a share with my siblings but my siblings are all uh overseas and they never care about my mom they never take care of her they never give her a dime so i would like to deprive them from their share so that i would utilize it to spend on my mom get her a house and provide for her as this is a necessity is this permissible totally prohibited and the money is totally haram and you are responsible on the day of judgment to pay them back from your own good deeds and if you don't have any good deeds you will take from their own sins and it will be thrown on you and you will be thrown in hell their obligation if they do not fulfill it does not justify that we prevent them from getting their rights this is not up to us the division of inheritance was not done by us or by scholars it was done by allah mentioned in the quran so we have to fulfill it no matter what"
