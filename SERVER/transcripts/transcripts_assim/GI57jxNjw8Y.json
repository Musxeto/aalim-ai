  "transcript": "fatima says and this is quite a long question but it is interesting why was the world created in six days when nothing is impossible for allah and when allah says be and it will be beautiful question as muslims and as jews and christians as well we have no problem in believing that if allah wants something he says be and it is there is no problem in that none whatsoever we all believe in that so if allah wanted to create the whole universe in a flash that would have been done but why did allah choose to create the universe in six days well the scholars have different opinions opinion number one it is allah's way to teach his servants his creation how to be kind and gentle and to take things thoroughly and easy instead of hasting things secondly and this was mentioned by al-imam he says that when he created it over a span of six days his magnificence his wisdom his power was apparent to the angels because it was created bit by bit so when you create things bit by bit this shows your power and your excellence and your magnificence but when you create something all of a sudden with be and it is kun fayakun this shows your power only because it's there but when you see the gradua how gradually it was created bit by bit this gives you a lot of uh um appreciation to allah's power and to allah's wisdom okay we have labib from bangladesh give me one second let me finish this third point please and thirdly when allah azzawajal creates the heavens and the earth in six days it shows that allah azzawajal does what he wills so those sinners who have been sinning for so many days and months and years thinking that okay if we were sinners then allah's wrath should have been upon us and he would have punished us on the spot but he didn't which means that there's nothing wrong with what we're doing allah created the heavens and the earth in six days and allah will wait for you but allah azzawajal will not ever leave you unattended and there are other reasons but i hope this is sufficient"
