  "transcript": "was about writing fictional stories for children is it permissible or not for children inshallah it is permissible because as long as the idea is good and the context is good and it's bringing up their morality their their behavior their conduct and you're trying and focusing to make them better people I believe you shall I this is permissible the problem is when it's for grown-up because for grown-up you have to identify this in the very beginning if you were following these conditions of not lying not saying anything how I'm not doing anything Haram and your intention is to uplift the society then you have to mention in the beginning that these are all fictional it's not related to reality or to truth etc so insha'Allah if you put the conditions in mind this is acceptable"
