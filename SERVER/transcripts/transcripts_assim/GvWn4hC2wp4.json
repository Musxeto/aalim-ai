  "title": "What percentage of Islam will be in 2050? (statistics and predictions) ï¿¼assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "I read in one paper article in the pewresearch.org, they made a study about the world religion. They say Islam is the fastest growing religion in the world, and they predict that in 2050 Islam would be slightly less than the combined Christianity, Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, all of the Christianity. Maybe the difference only 2-3%. But in year 2070, they predict that Islam will overpass all of them. In that report, they mention that up to 2050, they say the people who leave Islam, roughly is about 9 million, up to 2050. But the people who embrace Islam, roughly about 11 million. So there are different 3 million. But the Christianity, they say that people who leave, sorry, people who embrace Christianity is roughly about 60 million. But people who leave Christianity, exit Christianity is about 110 million. Wow, it's almost double. I know, I don't believe in these predictions, and they don't mean anything to me. To us, we say, those who leave Islam, they're more than welcome. We don't want them. Yes. Because they are a hindrance to us, and they are tarnishing our reputation. We don't want them. But I know that they are less than few thousands. Yes. With the grace of Allah, because everyone who accepts Islam would not leave it because they accepted it wholeheartedly. Yes, yes. And today, all the population of Muslims in the world, if I'm not mistaken, is already more than 2 billion. Thank you so much, Sheikh, for your time."
