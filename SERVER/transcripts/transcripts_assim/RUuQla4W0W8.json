  "transcript": "Say, This is my way, I invite you to Allah. So Sa'ad says, can a man remove hair that grows on a mole that he has on his face or is it part of the beard? Well Sa'ad, I think you've answered yourself. It depends where the mole is. So if a person has a mole outside the boundaries of the beard area, if he has a mole on his, underneath his eye, on his forehead, on his neck, he can remove any hair that grows on that. But if the mole is in the beard area itself, then the hair would be considered part of the beard and he must not remove that. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it insha'Allah within the following two days or three days. And bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
