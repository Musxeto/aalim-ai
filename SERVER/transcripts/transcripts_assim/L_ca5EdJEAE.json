  "transcript": "100 okay but sometimes uh there is some saying like my experience I follow Samuel saturated so sometimes this kind of a treatment because the youth that living that really I don't really want to learn Islam getting confused for you thank you first of all no one is perfect even me unfortunately nobody is perfect and I've heard you say this so many times a scholar like you a scholar like you in Arabic a scholar is I am not an Adam I'm a student of knowledge I sat with ulama like if you sit with them you would think yourself to be what am I nothing zero but to you you don't have any like those so unfortunately you see us like Adams but we're not now the youth must never ever engage in labeling this is a very dangerous game uh what are you um I have to give you a label I have to give you a sticker no this is very bad focus on learning the religion as was revealed to the prophet Allah by reading the Quran learning it when we read the Quran and learn it you don't ask no I'm learning the Quran learn the Sunnah learn that proper according how are you say no don't do it I would say no don't do it we say the way of the Prophet ourselves the rest of it if you focus on learning what is beneficial for you you will not have a problem the moment you watch YouTube channel is refuting sex also putting the gloves okay it's very good let me bring my popcorn and you waste your time you waste your energy and you make your heart hard and black because if you meet the other Sheikh you don't want to speak to him you don't want to give himself don't do this lie I don't spend seconds on watching these refutations some of them are friends of mine some of them call me what do you think I said don't call me don't ask me what you're doing is bad but said bad things I have to refute him I have to say this and that's it anyone who says nothing's about you would it become true if someone says to you you're an ass sometimes they say to me you're an ass I said yes this is my nickname as I am so someone says to me you are not my students insulting you I don't care what he says say whatever you want you're not going to make me go down and when you praise me I'm not going to go up so focus on learning the religion of Allah not following individuals not having allegiance to share so-and-so or group so and so this is not Islam Your Allegiance is the understanding of the three favorite generations and I hope this answers the question"
