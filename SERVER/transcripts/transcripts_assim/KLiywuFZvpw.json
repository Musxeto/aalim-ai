  "transcript": "Uh this is a followup question from Mr.'s question. So basically one clarification my 1.5 year search was the local search. The virtual agency was just some days and then I posted it until I asked about it. The current situation is that I have found a potential candidate who accept most of the conditions. However, there are two issues blocking me. First of all the free mixing. The family basically have an issue completely avoiding free mixing with male cousins which she grew up with. Although I clearly told them that Islam, Maharam and non Maharam are clear. Obviously the main issue is the nigab part. She stated that she's willing to wear the nigab and intends to but not as the condition of a marriage. She wants to wear it whenever she feels ready herself. My question is I understand that as a husband I am responsible for my husband and ensuring Islamic principles are followed. If I permit something impermissible I be responsibility. So if I agree to marry her knowing she will only wear the nikab when she decides which it will be days or years will I be considered sinful during that entering period of marriage because I allowed it basically that is my main point as long as there is no other alternative after 1.5 years as you claim and this is the best choice available then it is permissible for you to marry her while intending and making dua and trying your level best to make her love you and hence obey you and follow what you believe in accordance to the Quran and to the Sunnah as well."
