  "transcript": "Suad from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Yeah Sheikh I recently visited my friend after Jummah prayer and while I was in a house it was time to pray Asr and she told me that it's best to delay Asr prayer on Jummah. Is that correct Sheikh? The answer is no. This is totally baseless. It is never part of the sunnah to delay Asr prayer any day of the week at all. So I don't know where she brought this piece of information."
