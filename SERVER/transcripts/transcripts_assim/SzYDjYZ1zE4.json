  "transcript": "[Music] dear brothers and sisters in islam assalamu alaikum warahmatullahi and welcome to this 42nd episode of the islamic fair last time we met we talked about the meaning of riba which is usually and how severe such a sin is in islam and we were about to talk about the types of riba and before we get into the types of riba it is very essential to discuss the roots in phuk so that you can understand the concept of riba so the hadith of the prophet is where he says gold if gold is sold for gold silver for silver wheat for wheat barley for barley dates for dates or salt for salt then it must be one for one an immediate exchange whoever gives or asks for extra commits usury the giver and the taker are the same the hadith indicates six categories of what the muslims the people used to deal with a lot and the ulama the scholars looked into these six items and they managed to divide them into two categories these categories share the same common denominator so they put gold and silver in one category and they put wheat barley dates and salt in another category and then they worked their minds trying to find the justification why is there only these six that are mentioned and is it only in these six that we can deal in river or there are other categories that take the same ruling so the most authentic opinion is that these two categories are the principles and they signify indicate to us what can come underneath them so gold and silver the the reason and the justification is called effeminia which scholar says say that this is something that the muslims that the people have agreed upon it to be a price for something which means that dollars euros rials pounds dirhams dinars all fall under the same category though if we look at this banknote this is nothing this is a piece of paper but because when i tell people take this and give me five bags of bread in this case they and i agree that the five bags of bread costs five saudi areas this is agreed upon so they give me the bread and i give them the money the second category is known as al quote that is weighed or that is measured by size so wheat barley dates and salt these are part of what the people consume and feed upon they can store it for weeks and months without feeling it would go rotten like in the case of fruits and vegetables and they are weighed or measured by size and not by quantity like melons and apples and the things that we usually count so scholars say these are the categories of riba why do we emphasize on us understanding the six items and what falls underneath them because now when we talk about the types of river this makes it more easy to understand so the first category is a feminine it's a price of things the second is that it is consumed and weighed or measured by size from the second category can we say iron for example he said no iron is not something that is consumed can we use tomatoes and this answer is no tomatoes rot quickly and cannot be stored so this is what the scholars said about the items of riba in a nutshell now let us talk about the types of riba the west with the the most well-known type [Music] of increasing and this is understood when we sell gold for gold or silver for silver or wheats for weeds etc so it has to be in the same [Music] item so what do you mean it means that if i have a two kilograms of dates that is not of a fine quality and my friend has one kilogram of excellent quality dates so i say to him listen take these two kilograms and give me one kilogram of excellent quality dates is it okay no problem there is a problem this is clear bilal did the same thing at the time of the prophet once he brought the prophet salallahu good dates so the prophet said whoa this is good dates where did you get it from so bilal said i had to saar so like six seven eight kilo kilograms of bad dates so i exchanged them for this one saw of good dates what did the prophets respond response was allah he said [Music] what you have done is the essence of usury and riba you should have sold your two sar for money and then with that money you should have bought one star of good dates so when it's in the same category i give you 100 grams of used gold in exchange for 90 grams of good manufactured gold river it has to be 100 grams of the same caliber in exchange for 100 grams of the same caliber end of story no questions asked but why because this is how riba develops and progresses and this is why allah prohibited it now this is when we are selling and exchanging of the same item i have a ton of good wheat so i'd like to exchange it for 800 grams 800 kilograms of brown wheat no no can do it has to be the same and you can cascade this to all types of the things that we mentioned feminine and being consumed and weighed or measured by size so let's talk about reals let's talk about dollars i have a 10 dollar banknote and i'd like to exchange it for coins so that i would make phone calls so the guy says okay here are nine dollars in coins i took a dollar for my service charge i'm okay with that he's okay with that it is not okay in islam this is reba it has to be exactly ten dollars for ten dollars but the prophet said i said if the types the items change there's no problem as long as it is simultaneously exchanged so for example if i have 10 grams of gold no one in his sound mind would exchange it for 10 grams of silver because these are two different types two different species different categories so tender 10 grams of gold i'm willing to pay 450 grams of silver for that do you agree he says i agree give and take simultaneously deal is done no problem i have a hundred kilograms of wheat and you have 20 gram kilograms of dates would you exchange i have no problem we exchange simultaneously done deal because the categories that the items are different what is not halal it is to postpone the deal so i have 10 grams of gold that i am in urgent need of selling and i say i'll give you 450 grams of silver for that he said done deal on one condition i'll give it to you tomorrow afternoon no problem with me rolling haram why it's silver and gold two different types yes but it was not done simultaneously let me okay i'm too far anyhow so the only way to do it is give and take i have a hundred dollars this is equivalent to 375 saudi deals here you go 100 say okay i'll give you the money i'll transfer you the money i'll send you the money in the afternoon give me half an hour it has to be hand to hand simultaneously so this is what is intended in the hadith so rebel fadal the first category is the increase in the same item gold to gold silver to silver etc what is ribbon now in arabic and nasi is to delay and postpone and allah mentioned in chapter 9 that delay is an increase in coffer and in disbelief what kind of delay the arabs used to know that there are four sacred months there are 12 months per lunar year since allah created the heavens and the earth among them there are four sacred months these sacred months are three in a row and one isolated the three in a row are the the month of the ada and three in a row number 11 number 12 and number one in the lunar in the history calendar and number seven which is rajab and we won't go into detail about why they're secret sacred but the scholars say that it is prohibited to initiate fighting in it to begin fighting is not permissible among other things so the arabs pre-islamic era when this month is muharram the first month of the lunar calendar and they wanted to invade another tribe but the elders said no no this is muharram we can't invade them so they said no no no we'll switch with the following month so this is suffer now and we will delay so they kept on delaying months according to the whims and desires so month number one became number two and after a while month number seven became number nine and it kept on being mixed until the bertha until the revelation came to the prophet of and the whole cycle went back to where it started so the months were fixed according to the right calendar with allah azzawajal when the prophet haslam was being prophesized and made a messenger of allah azzawajal this is the origin of it's a delay in time now this delay in time in riba is usually associated with the debt so the arabs used to lend people money so they lent me a thousand euros and i'm supposed to pay at the end of the month i pay the money back so when the end of the month comes the loan shark comes and says where's my money no interest i just want my money back and i say well i am i apologize i don't have the money on me he said okay i'll give you a couple of more months but you have to add 200 euros to that so i said okay so after two months he comes to collect his 1200 and he says upfront if you want an extension you have to give me interest you have to give me riba and this is called ribben nasi this is one sort or type of it and it's called riba dain as well because it's related to that another type is when there's a delay in handing so i have a ton of wheat and i'd like to buy 400 kilograms of dates you agree you give me the value the dates up front and i'll tell you i'll deliver my ton of wheat next month and you agree for that this is not permissible because this is nasi there is a delay in delivery and this delay is considered to be haram and not permissible now the main principle of riba is that there's a rule among the scholars the fukaha and they know it by saying and some say that this is a hadith but most likely it's not an authentic hadith yet the consensus of scholars upon it any loan that draws benefit for the lender is and they give so many stories about it and among the stories is that abu hanifah may allah have mercy on his soul once lent his neighbor some money and it was a habit of abu harifah to sit outside his house in the shade of his neighbor's house from and all of a sudden he stopped so his neighbor asked him why don't you sit in my shade anymore it's on the street i said because i had lent you money and i'm afraid that sitting in the shade of your house would be a benefit drawn over that loan i had given you and it would be subhan allah any benefit one gets over alone this is considered to be riba i'll give you a number of manifestations of this so that you can widen your horizons a little bit in india and i mentioned this before i think here or somewhere else and in the subcontinent they have a big house they give it to a person who is rich for rent yet they take a very large and huge deposit and they take take a minimal fee something negligible as rent so instead of paying a thousand dollars a month rent they pay five dollars rent which is nothing because this is a loan which is the deposit they had given and the interest they're getting is living in that big house renting it for nothing another example which maybe most of you will be shocked to hear and probably would hate me for that but i'm used to it is when you have a credit card and a debit card and they give you cash back when it's credit card the cashback is halal why because i am borrowing from them ten thousand dollars i bought merchandise i paid it the next week so they give me one percent pay uh uh cash back i didn't borrow they didn't borrow anything from me so that they're giving me interest no it's opposite in debit cards it's haram because when i come to the debit card i charge it i put in it ten thousand dollars so when i buy with this ten thousand dollars this is the money i lent it to the debit card company and they're paying it off they're using it in transactions and interest and whatever but they're utilizing the ten thousand dollars that i've deposited until i consume all of it then they give me cash back and this is interest money and this is haram this is a gift likewise i am a multi-millionaire i wish and i have a bank account that is so fat i'm a vip client every single year the ad the admins of the bank call me uh so we have a humble gift that we would like to give you and they give me a big box of chocolates they give me a mobile phone latest model they give me um a few things as a gift wow man i'm a lucky man why are they giving me are they giving it to me because i have a white beard i'm an old man my eyes are green they're not clean but maybe or blue why are they giving me this or these gifts these gifts are riba but i'm not dealing with riba i have a current account i don't have a saving account i don't take a ch a pay from them yes you don't but you're depositing your money in their bank and your money which is deposited in their bank is actually a loan they're not gonna put your wealth in a box and lock it and put it safe in the sub uh basement not gonna do that they're taking their wealth utilizing it by building a building giving it a loan an interest based loan um buying currency putting it in treasury buying stocks all of these things which is a loan from me to them because if they lose their stocks if their banks burnt to the ground if the currencies fall today i want my million dollars back and they'll give it to me immediately without any excuses oh we did this we did that we had a failure in our business right nothing of the sort and deal so this is a loan given to them whatever you get is riba now not only let me rephrase that not every benefit you get is reba if it's unconditional if it was not anticipated there's no problem in that i give you example i need ten thousand dollars for one month i need a loan can you please give it to me sure whatever you wish here's a check i take it i cash it after one month i come to the brother barakallahu here is a check of 11 000 what's this i gave you only 10 000. i said yes i know this 1000 is a gift a gesture of good will it's no shift i cannot take it this is riba no it's not real because it was not conditioned in the beginning prior it was not stipulated not even hinted because some people say okay sure this is ten thousand dollars you may return it after one month and don't forget us from whatever kindness you may uh give this is hinted the prophet is borrowed a camel from a man and he told him once we get from the sadaka i'll give you back your loan and the camel was of two years of age which was young so when the camels of charity came the prophet ordered to pay the man back so abu rafa came oh prophet of allah we could not find the same age of the man's camel we found five years of age which is much more expensive so the prophet said to them give it to him the best of people are the ones who repay their debts best so the man did not stipulate any conditions and was not anticipating any increase nor hinted to it the prophet's habit allah was always to repay better than what he had received in the beginning and this is totally legit the reba is when there is um something between us that we would like to be any settled in a sense or agree upon now we move on to this is riba i heard one of the so-called scholars cascading this to anything so he said rebel fadal anything that you exchange that is similar to another thing extra and this is wrong totally wrong the thing that is not permissible to be exchange extra are the six items or whatever falls underneath them but if i go to a mobile shop and i say okay this is an iphone s e this is four years old and it's one of the best phones that i could i had ever owned in my life and i advise you i think there are a few in the market and it's very cheap but it's very old looking small people don't like it i love it so i go to the market and i say to the mobiles the mobile shops owner i need a iphone 12 or 11. he said well this costs you an arm and a leg so i said how much would i have to pay you if i want to give you my mobile he said you have to pay me another two thousand eight hundred dollars whoa that's a lot of cash man okay i have like three of those so can i bring three mobiles should bring them so i bring them three mobiles one is a hawaii one is samsung one is iphone it looks it in okay i'll give you this iphone 11 for these three mobiles then one says sheikh this is riba why because you're exchanging one for three and this is totally river this is what you taught us in the class i didn't teach you this come on don't misunderstand me and misquote me i said the six items that the prophet islam indicated these are the haram thing to have fadal rebel fuddle in increasing of the same category gold to gold silver to silver wheat to wheat barley to barley dates to dates salt to salt all what falls underneath them such as currencies so you don't sell a hundred dollars for a hundred and five dollars totally river it has to be the same but if they differ so i have two cars that are three years old and i take them to the dealer's shop and i take one card this year's model no problem because it's neither price to buy things and it's neither something consumed and weighed at the same time so you have to understand this concept in order to understand what riba is and when you deal in your transactions you should okay yeah i remember taking a good class and i understand where riba is coming from and most likely this is not real let me ask and you ask and you learn this is how you gain knowledge analyzing asking going back to the fundamentals of that you had learned which is a very important subject going back to the islamic which we read from a to z as we are attempting to do here then go to the second level of islamic to the fifth level which is more expandable and more branches and many many more issues to ponder upon this gives you the mentality of a a juror a scholar who can understand not jump to conclusions saying hello without thoroughly going through it now we have the following section i don't know if we're going to make it but inshallah we'll give it a shot it's called surati in arabic it's called in normal language we call it pawning to a pawn shop so what is a surity it is defined as giving something of value as a security for a debt let me turn this off because i'm getting cold one second okay alhamdulillah so in arabic they call it bin it is to confirm and guarantee a debt with something tangible in your hand so i need a thousand dollars no problem but give me something to guarantee my money back so i said okay here's my watch how much is your watch it's uh 300 dollars there's no way give me something more expensive okay this is my rolex how much is your rolex it's 10 000 no problem so it has to be something valuable to to ensure that i'll get my debt back this is mentioned in the quran where allah says and if you are on a journey and cannot find a scribe then a security deposit should be taken and this was also practiced by the prophet allah tells us that the prophet islam once needed food needed barley and at the time the muslims the arabs the people used to eat and consume barley nowadays barley is rarely consumed by humans in our country and usually it's fed to the cattle so the prophet went are solatusa to borrow food from a jew he wanted to borrow some barley from a jew and he gave the jew his iron shield as a pawn as a surety so that the jew can guarantee that he will get his money back and if not he can sell that guarantee and take his debt and give the back the money back to the borrower there are rulings mentioned in the book among them is the thing that you pawn must be permissible to sell so for example i need a ten thousand dollars a loan she say okay what are you gonna pawn me she said okay look this message it upon this masjid i say okay masjid is very expensive yes but i cannot sell the message i cannot inherit the message i cannot give the message so you cannot sell it then what use of it to you say okay i have a dog a german shepherd that's a good dog it's been with me for three years i'll keep it as pawn until i bring you back the money not permissible why it's a good dog because i can't sell the dog to regain my initial money that i had lent to you dogs are not allowed to be sold bottles of i have a good bottle of red wine 1986 it's a good year so can you please accept it and give me a thousand dollars no this is not permissible so first it has to be something that can be sold secondly it is essential to know the amount of surety its type and description i need a thousand dollars of it sure thing what are you gonna pawn to me this back in it there is so and so and so so here you go so okay you have to make sure that it contains what i've described to you so that when i don't pay you the thousand dollars back at least you can sell it but if you open the bag and it's full of old uh trainers or um something that has no value so it has to or it is something that you and i did not count in the beginning and when i came to pay back the money you gave me the things that i pawned and i said no they were double the amount not this only so this to eliminate any sort of disagreement has to be specified by description by amount by type thirdly the person who's giving the surety should be a person who is qualified to take such an action so i need a thousand dollars what are you gonna pawn me so i have my brother's um uh a mobile mobile phone no that's not valid it's not yours you are not allowed to sell it how are you allowed to pawn it four neither party giving the serenity nor the accepting it can dispose of the pledged article so now you gave me the thousand dollars i gave you my mobile phone in exchange to guarantee your money back and you decided to sell it yeah but the debt is due in a month time yeah i don't know i know but i i need to sell it i just need the money no this is haram you can't do that it has to be consensual [Music] number five it is not permissible to benefit by the pledge article so i took a ten thousand dollars loan from you and i kept my impala ss the vintage expensive car in your garage and every day you take it for a spin what is this well it's in my garage no ahi you're not allowed to use it i placed my rolex with you and pondered with you and you're wearing it going to parties etc it's not permissible this is something you're entrusted with you should safe keep it say that the only condition for me to use what was pond with me is when it's an animal that i have to feed so if it's a cow or a sheep and i graze it feed it they say that in this case it's okay to milk because the milk is in exchange for the food i'm giving because i'm not gonna charge you for the food the animal is with me i'm not gonna charge you for the food when you bring the loan back unless we agree upon that so if you took the loan gave me your sheep and you said listen whatever you feed it when i pay back the debt i'm gonna pay you for the food in this case it's haram for me to use the milk but if this condition was not stipulated and i'm the one who's feeding it it's permissible for me to uh milk it and use it number six this pawned item is not alone when you took a thousand dollars from me and gave me your watch your watch is not alone it is pond it's a safe place for me to guarantee that i'm getting my money back so if my house were to burn to the ground due to forced measure not my doing when you come back with the thousand dollars you have no right to demand that i pay you for your watch i was doing me a favor man it wasn't my mistake this is a deposited thing not alone and this is a big difference if i borrow a thousand dollars from you and i took the thousand dollars and put it in my wallet and somebody steals the wallet i have no right to come into you and say may allah make it easy for you but the loan has been stolen so may allah reward you for it no i have to pay you back the thousand dollars but if you before leaving town you brought your car and said can i park it in your garage for safe keeping i said be my guest you're my neighbor so you park it and you travel and lightning strikes and the car is the car is burnt to the ground or a thief breaks into my house passes all security measures and steals your car when you come back i'm not obliged to give you a penny because i was doing you a favor i was trying to help you by keeping your car in my garage i didn't do anything wrong so if the item that is pawned with me was damaged or stolen or broken without any transgression from my side or negligence two things transgression and negligence what does that mean if you keep your car in my garage and i take it for a spin every afternoon this is called transgression because i'm not allowed to use it negligence is when i keep it outside my house with the rolls with the windows rolled down and the key in the ignition and i go to bed to sleep following morning the car is not there this is called negligence in these two cases transgression or negligence i'm obliged to pay for a similar thing i have to substitute you with a similar cost or maker or kind of it because it's my fault so i think we will stop here now again [Music] it's a deposit but the final point is important what happens if i don't pay off my debt to you so you complain to the judge and tell the judge listen i have his car but i don't want his car i want my money back so the judge orders me to pay and i refuse the judge threatens me of jail time and i still don't want to pay then the judge orders me to go to prison and to do time only then the judge authorizes me to sell the car get my thousand dollars and the rest is deposited in my uh in in the one who borrowed the money and refused to uh give it back it's deposited in his account and allah azza knows best so we will stop here inshaallah and go to the questions so the first question is why is this not moving haslin says is it okay to count this be in a counter for fixed number of zikr for example 100 times many times i miss the count if i do it do it on my fingertips the answer is yes using counter or using the bead sprayer beads this is permissible but the reward on doing it on your right hand fingers is better and you can do it five times and with your left this is five a set of five do it again a set of ten a set of 15 until 25 then you do that four times and this is a hundred if you wish fatima says the prophet saws said the gates of paradise are opened on mondays and thursdays allah forgives every servant who does not associate anything with him except a man with hatred between him and his brother it will be said delay these two until they reconcile delay these two until they reconcile what sheikh so is it compulsory to reconcile the old hatred and problems to be forgiven by allah this hadith is referring to people who buy caught one another so if you boycott your sister or your colleague and whenever you meet one another you look the other way when someone says you don't reply and when you say they don't reply this is what is included in the delay but if you have normal relationship end of story i have hatred in my heart towards that person there's feud there is beef between us but it doesn't show it's just nothing else no this is not falling under this hadith in sha allah and some scholars say that it is related to allah's favor every thursday and mondays to forgive those who did not even repent but if people have repented they won't be considered in this hadith says the dua we say at the end of the shoot is also to be read at the end of sunnah and nephilia as well the answer is yes and as in some places it is mentioned to be said after salah no this is to be said at the end of fort salad voluntary salat nafl salat before the salam because ebentamias has clearly stated that dua is done before salaam is done after the salaam fida says can you give examples of formula by action in selling i think that he's referring to al qabal so there is a verbal formula which is i sell you this remote for ten dollars and you say i accept deal is done and there is a formula of action such as i go to the counter i give this to the seller or i put it on the counter and i take a candy bar worth of five rials i'm diabetic i'm not gonna take a candy bar but hypothetically speaking he didn't say a word i didn't say a word i just took it and i put the money there's no problem with that in so many places in america for example you wanna or in the uk there's a newspaper stand you put the fee it opens you take the newspaper and leave this is a formula by action and allah knows best says is it permissible to give materials instead of cash as zakat the most authentic opinion is that this is not permissible unless there is a legitimate reason for that so many people many of us would tend to want to control the poor so i say okay my zakat money is a thousand euros i'm gonna buy food cooking oil flour dates spaghetti and macaroni uh pasta in general um some this some that and i'll give it to the poor why because this is better than giving them in cash and they would waste it allah knows where so it's none of your business where they spend their money as long as they're poor and needy and they're deserving to get zakat give it to them allah if you analyze i think we spoke about this maybe it maybe not so here or somewhere else who remembers i don't even remember what i had for lunch today because i'm fasting anyhow allah azzawajal mentioned in surat chapter 9 in the ayah related to zakat these four categories in arabic it's known as meaning i have to give the money to them in their hands they do with it whatever they want and then allah says meaning that it's not li it's meaning that if i buy a slave and free him i didn't give the money to the slave directly it doesn't matter if someone is in real debt and i go to the one who lent him and i said how much you want from mr ahmed he says ten thousand he said okay here's the ten thousand from my zakat money done deal i don't have to go to ahmed and tell him this is ten thousand you give it to the one who had lent you no so this is the difference you are not to control the poor thinking that no i'll buy them clothes for heat give them cash money in their hand they buy medication they pay the rent they pay the bills they buy food it's their money and they may do it as may do with it whatever they want maturio says which is more beneficial to a woman praying in the masjid or praying in the house no doubt that the prophet isam answered this question when he said that the prayer of a woman is far better in her home than praying in the masjid not only that he elaborated more when he addressed one of his female companions he said i know that you love to pray in my masjid and we know that the prayer in the prophet's message is 1 000 times better than elsewhere except the message of mecca so he said i know that you like and love to pray with me in my message however your prayer in your house is better than praying in my masjid and your prayer in your home is better than praying in my in your house and your prayer in your quarters is better than praying in your home and your prayer in your own bedroom is better than praying in your quarters so the prophet is minimizing the space and isolating women from any type of exposure and the more exclusive it is for her to pray in her home the better it is for her reward but if she wants to pray in the message so be it no problem haslin says if i joined any authentic islamic groups on whatsapp but i don't see or can't concentrate on anything they post will i be sinful no there's no sin on that there's no obligation that i read anything that they post on the group because no one can say that it's an obligatory thing to do holy says we have people here a group of muslims in the netherlands who say to every muslim in the deutsche parliament that they are kafirs is this correct sheikh definitely not these people are isis or nicest associated these are without a legitimate reason without fulfilling the conditions and eliminating the obstacles is a trademark of the hawaii and i know in germany i know personally in the uk in the netherlands there are so many of these youth who in addition to poverty when they see video clips of atrocities of the muslims being bombarded by american planes or british forces they have this hatred to anything that is christian when they hear the american president the former one saying that this is the crusade against afghanistan and iraq they said oh it's a crusade so it's christianity against islam shaitaan ignorance these video clips the brainwashing the ignorance that dominate their circles all contribute to making them radicals extremists and terrorists and this is why the likes of me are prevented from entering uk for example because we give from the quran sunnah we tell people not to be violent we tell people to obey the laws of the country not to take benefits haram by lying all of these things anyone would think that um that's positive that's building a law abiding citizens character but this is not what these governments want they want the muslims to be submissive to melt in the melting pot to dilute their religion they don't want them to abide by the hijab what we present is islam from the quran and the sunnah with the understanding of the companions and the tibetan and the temptaring easy are we violent definitely not are we calling people to chaos and mishap and to go against their governments definitely not but this is what they do not want they want people to help these youngsters to become radical so it gives us the motive and the justification to raid the islamic centers to imprison muslims and to fight and ban the niqab and to attack the muslim the islamic schools and their curriculums and syllabus subhanallah it's a big issue so those in the netherlands and i've spoken to many of takfiri's such as these people in the uk when i used to go there like five six times a year and i loved it but i was forced to stop when i was prevented visa from the prime minister herself there is a maid so i stopped but i spoke with many people of takfir youngsters and they were so enthusiastic and they're willing to throw a punch at me or to condemn me and accuse me of ku for myself but alhamdulillah the grace of allah talking to them in a diplomatic way in a logical way it opened the eyes of so many of them alhamdulillah and help them leave this rotten ideology so these groups of muslims stay away from them if you have their phone numbers deleted any emails delete it they're bad news and you should warn people from them um last question maybe from israel she says awful moment no male in life and only has close female cousins in short can she travel the answer is no traveling from one city to the other without the company of a male mahram is totally prohibited traveling within the city limits there's no problem even doing that alone um okay riaz says is bitcoin share permissible the answer is no and i have a nine minute video on my youtube just type in in in google search bitcoin plus awesome and you'll get that inshallah and i hope it's convincing jamilah says is the transaction haram after the second event in an environment where women operates like saloons and spas jamila is referring to the second event of friday prayer jummah and this is the transaction after the second adhan is void and haram for those obliged to pray in the masjid so if i have a shop in maastricht or in amsterdam and the shop is operated by women selling food and the customers coming to buy are other women or it's a saloon shalom or children or non-muslims there's no problem in selling them and buying from them because they're not obliged to pray the jumuah and allah knows best of course selling men who are disbelievers is not permissible but selling other women children etc yeah this is okay the last question says um do you have to make niya before every work we do if someone does some good deed forgetting to make niyyah to please allah but not to please anyone else will he be uh his deeds accepted the answer is yes but of course if i walked on the streets and someone smiles in my face and i smell back not intending it to be a charity my reward is less than when i actually smile anticipating the reward from allah knowing that this is something pleasing allah but yes everything good that you do you will be rewarded for that whether you have an intention to please allah or not the more you have the intention to please allah the higher the reward is and allah azza knows best this is all the time we have and until we meet next time i leave you what's up"
