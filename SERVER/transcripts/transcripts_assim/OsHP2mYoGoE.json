  "transcript": "my question is if non-muslim invite us for barbecue and they buy halal meat for us can we still have it as their grill had already been used for pork and other unhalal meat if you are 100 certain of that the answer is no you cannot eat uh meat that was cooked through contaminated grills or utensils but if you're not sure then the default is that it is halal insha allah for you to eat"
