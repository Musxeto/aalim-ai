  "transcript": "Okay, Ahnaf from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum. Wa'alaikumussalam. That's it? Sorry, I accidentally muted myself. Okay. So my question is, I heard a student of knowledge, he said that Isa is a Sahabi. Who? Because the Prophet Isa, apparently he's a Sahabi because he met the Prophet. Question, yeah, Ahnaf, I got a question to you. What is best, a Sahabi or a messenger? What do you think? I hope you did not mute yourself again. Ahnaf? A messenger. A messenger, so what does it matter? Now, just because the Prophet, Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam, met Isa, Alayhis Salatu Wassalam, in the fourth heaven or the fifth heaven on the miraculous journey, people say, oh he's a companion. What does that mean? It's an upgrade or a downgrade? It's a downgrade. The upgrade is that he's one of the strong-willed messengers, the five-willed messengers. So who cares? And by their logic of this student of knowledge, we could cascade all messengers of Allah who prayed with him and say the same about them."
