  "transcript": "MTS from Canada Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh, Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh so Sheikh I used to live with one of my friend and Used to do shoplifting for groceries. So suppose if he did a shopping of $100 he would only pay $50. So now he left the house, but he left back some groceries like oil sugar Almonds and everything and I do not know if those are stolen or paid for So is it permissible for me to use those? If you know that your friend is a shoplifter And he's a thief How could you live with someone like that and consume? The groceries he bring this is not permissible and hence whatever he brought to the house of his own Not from your money but of his own you have to dispose of that and give it to charity because you don't know if it's stolen or not and as you say 50% of it is stolen. I don't know how you could even have a friend like this May Allah protect us You"
