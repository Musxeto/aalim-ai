  "title": "Hadith \" Nobody will be living after completion of hundred years \" What about dajjal assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "from Sri Lanka says there is a Hadith may Allah be pleased with him and with his father that the prophet I think prayed to Isha once and he addressed the congregation and he said that there won't pass a hundred year and any of you remain on Earth so he has a confusion how is this possible providing that this Hadith is or can also be inclusive of the dajjal whom tamima daddy as in Muslim may all be pleased with him saw him chained on an island and he came to the prophet Islam the prophet approved of that and he conveyed what he had seen on his journey to the companions that tamim had seen that the jail and the jajal will remain until the end of time so charus is confused how is this possible first of all the prophet did not say to my recollection a hundred years he said earn and Karen refers to the generation and this is why when we look at the Hadith of the Prophet The Best of generations is my generation also means a horn it means also a century so if it's a century it's a hundred years and this is debatable whether the companies exceeded 100 years or less or whatever but definitely what is meant in the Hadith is Generation so the best of generations is my generation the generation of the companions then the tavarin then the table regardless of how long the eldest of them had lived so this is a generation so the Hadith is referring to the prophet addressing his companions telling them that no one should exceed 100 years from them from that night which is their generation and according to some of the scholars they have monitored the last of the companions deaf and it was something around that era which means that he did not exceed 100 years and with that his generation was over does this mean that every single creature would not surpass the the uh the mark of a hundred years from that night this is not what the prophet meant Allah and the Arabic language is a must for us to study because without it people would might would probably think of things that go against the Arabic language for example European about the wind that came and annihilated the people of Etc Allah says that it annihilates and it destroys everything with the instruction of Allah azzawajal yet you see only their homes present and nothing else okay everything should include the homes but in Arabic this is known as that in Arabic not everything is mentioned the Queen of Sheba well case she was given from everything but she had no control over the Jinn like Chalet man had she had no powers like Soleil man had so where is everything this is a form of exaggeration not meant literally to include everything and likewise the prophet was addressing the companions that everything is going to not live after a hundred years with the exception of what I told you before which is the dejal and him staying till the end of time in Allah knows best as"
