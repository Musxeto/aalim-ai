  "transcript": "her second question is where is the mik for pilgrims coming from Malaysia um so that they would say the and announce theam for for uh uh from there and if they're going to Medina first before performing om in meca what would they do again the issue of if you understand it then you don't know you don't need to ask people about it in the future the prophet Alat wasam designated five places that surround the holy shrines of Mecca and he said that whoever is coming from outside of this circle to meca with the intention of making for or Haj for pilgrimage then he has to perform hisam he has to announce hisam at these locations or what is adjacent to them so he should not penetrate this circle without offering and he told us that is for the people coming from the direction of Medina he told us JEA is those coming from the north and yam those who are coming from the uh South and that for those who are coming from Iraq area and man for those who are coming from the the East these are the five maak and they form like a circle around the holy shrines if people are coming directly from Malaysia from Indonesia from Singapore from Thailand from India anywhere east of Mecca and they're coming they're flying to uh uh jeda they have to pass over and this is known as which is in K it's a a city um east of Mecca so when they come when they fly the captain usually about 15 to 25 minutes before landing in jeda announces that we're approaching the mikat zone so those who are intending to make for or they should do it now once he says this you just simply after uh uh wearing your you say or and you intend that you are in the state of as simple as that but if as the sister says they're going to Medina first and then they'll drive or fly to Mecca in this case their mikat changes because they're going to Medina so when they are going from Medina to Mecca they their mik becomes the of the people of Medina which is known as so for those who come they are not allowed to uh offer their and this is her fourth question she says is it allowed to have the of from Jed if we are staying in jeda this again depends but before going to that question let me finish the second question if you're going to Medina first you make youram from Medina if you're going to mecah first then you make youram from the airplane when you are coming to jeda or if you came without doing and you landed in jida you are forced you're instructed to go to your mik and offer youram from there because the prophet saidat that this is one of the mandatory things of that you offer from the mik what if a person came to jeda did not wear theam did not announce theam and is unable to go to the mik but he wants to go for he's either unable or he does not want to do it well the answer would be that his from Jed is valid but he's sinful and we say that he has to slaughter a sheep as a fidya as an experation for not doing something that is mandatory which is offering Haram from the mik and he would be sinful if he did not have the legitimate excuse some people just say I want to I don't want to do it from the mik I want to do it from jida from my hotel what you going to do sue me well I'm not going to sue you but you're going to be sinful for that you have to pay the experation and you have to seek Allah's forgiveness because you are doing something deliberately that you know that angers Allah Asel"
