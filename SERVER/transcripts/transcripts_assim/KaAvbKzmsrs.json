  "transcript": "and can girls attend janaza as per girls attending janaza there is a difference between walking behind a janaza a funeral from the home to the masjid or from the masjid to the graveyard and between praying and offering the prayer of janazah in the masjid praying the uh the funeral prayer in the masjid or elsewhere is totally legitimate and permissible for women there's no problem in that attending graveyards is not permissible according to the most authentic opinion of scholars walking is most likely not permissible nor recommended yet the hadith of states that they were not ordered not to do so but they definitely were not recommended so it's best again to be safe rather than sorry and not to follow a funeral uh to the masjid or to the graveyard"
