  "transcript": "when i went to my mosque i found out that the imam was already in his roku so i hurried to join the role made my beloved but then when i was going to my record position i heard the imam said sami allah hamid so this made me doubt for whether i could get the roku of emo or not in this thoughtfulness should i add one raqqa and you saw after masala or not okay so fauzan's question happens to all of us we enter the masjid everybody is in the record position we stay or stand in the row we say as we're going down we say semi allahu liman now i know that the imam says which means i'm not that sure whether the imam and i were in the procore position or i was going down he was going up why number one if i am certain that when when the imam was in his record and i said allahu akbar and as i was going down i'm certain that he raised his head and i could not catch the raka in this case definitely i have to perform an extraka possibility two i said allahu akbar and i prost and i bowed i did raku and i'm 100 certain that i and the imam were in the rokua position at least for a second and then the imam said saka is valid and i don't have to add anything third scenario i said allahu akbar as i was going down the imam said say allah now i'm in doubt did i catch him in the record position or not i'm not sure i'm not certain am i inclined to one of the two opinions if the answer is yes i'm inclined that i didn't catch him or i'm inclined to that i did catch him but there is no certainty in both ways in this case i have to act upon my inclination and an offer afterwards if i had missed more than one rakah if i didn't miss any raka's and i'm inclined that i caught it with him i don't have to offer any sujude sahu if i'm doubtful i'm in a limbo 50 50 can't tell in this case benefit of the doubt i have to assume that i did not offer record with him and add eraka afterwards and after salaam i also add to sujud of forgetfulness also the sahu and allah knows best you"
