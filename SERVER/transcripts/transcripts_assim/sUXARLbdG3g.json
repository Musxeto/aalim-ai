  "transcript": "Abdullah says does the prophet salallahu alayhi wa salem have 99 names there are a number of books written about the Prophet Alistair sonam's names and there are hundreds and hundreds of books about the life of the Prophet eraser Otto Salam what about his name's I believe that there are about 14 of them however the scholars say that this is an exaggeration because the names of the Prophet Allah so some are handful and there is a difference between names and attributes so the Prophet might say or we can describe the Frog the Prophet as some to be the light in the darkness or the guidance of the unguided so these are descriptions I could write a gazillion description about the Prophet as some in this fashion but as far as names his name is Ahmed his name is Mohammed his name is al-kafi and her share a lot of or whatever these are the names that he called himself and he told us that these are his names so they do not reach 99 names and again I'm afraid that this is one of the steps of Shaitaan that he lures people through by exaggerating in their love to the Prophet Allah so son we know that Allah has 99 names as mentioned in the hadith not limited to 99 but this is what was mentioned in the hadith the Prophet said Allah has 99 names a hundred names minus one and whoever calculates it whoever comprehends it whoever understands it then he will enter general but to say that the Prophet has 99 names as well this would not be appropriate because then you're making him like a larger it is like when people write in their Masjid walls Allah are you associating Muhammad with Allah Almighty putting unless named next to Muhammad's name sallallahu said Allah this is unacceptable because you're praising the prophet far greater than Allah has praised him he is the servant of Allah he is the Messenger of Allah he is the beloved prophet of Allah but you cannot put his name Muhammad with a large name because this may mislead others"
