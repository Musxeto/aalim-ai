  "transcript": "[Questioner] from the UK um is getting a job \nand like you can't um like if your parents   can't provide for you like a female guest they're \nnot permissible I think especially your line is   breaking first of all and there's background noise \nso can you kindly State your question clearly um if you're like financially unstable um \nand like you can't provide for yourself   um is it still impermissible to get a job when \nyou're a female because there's free mixing in   like the UK especially like um if you want to \nget stuff that you enjoy but your parents say   no you have to get a job like what do you do \nin that situation we have a rule that states necessities make prohibited things permissible \nhowever Necessities are estimated according to   their true need and whether it is a necessity \nor not so for example a sick person can break   his fasting if someone has a stomach ache a \nsevere headache a hardship that is causing   him a lot of pain it is permissible for him \nto break his fast and make it up later on   if someone comes and says I have a small \ncut in my finger so this is an illness I   would like to break my fast you said no this \nis not a legitimate reason not a necessity   when we come to a woman traveling without \na mahram this is totally prohibited it's   the prophet himself who prohibited it \nnobody can come and say no that's okay   time changed the prophet himself says it's not \npermissible for a woman who believes in Allah   on the day of judgment to travel without a mahram \neven for Hajj even for umrah this is the fawta of   the Prophet (Peace and Blessings be Upon Him) if \nyou're a Muslim you abide by it you don't go fatwa   shopping or ask Tom and Dick and Harry and say oh \nthey said it's okay then go with them on the day   of judgment and don't seek the prophet (Peace and \nBlessings be Upon Him) companionship so if someone   says okay I have a necessity to travel without \na mahram we tell her what is your necessity   she says I have to travel to see my mom this is \nnot a necessity she says I'm in a cafe country   there's no Muslims around me and I fear fitna on \nmy religion I have to run with my religion you say   this is a fitna go even without a mahram because \nthis is a necessity coming back to your question   you say my mom and dad don't allow me to buy \nthings I want is this a necessity that permits you   to mix with man and maybe they will be most likely \nflirtiest with you at the workplace maybe you have   to compromise your hijab Etc of of course not \nyes if you say that my parents are all bedridden   we don't have benefits from the government we \ndon't have food on the table nobody's helping   us nobody's giving us zakat or charity and we're \nstarving said okay this is a necessity we have   to look at the list of choices of jobs and then \ndecide what is best for you and Allah Knows Best"
