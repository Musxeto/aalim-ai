  "transcript": "you have to be a male alpha no a male muslim alpha in the sense that you have to honor islam you have to protect the reputation of islam you are a representative of sunna so you always have to come on top not out of arrogance or pride rather out of perfection a real true muslim is a perfectionist so i give someone a an appointment at one o'clock i'm there quarter to one he may come 1 30. that's not my job i do an act and behave according to who i am this is my standard i will not lower my standard for other people's standards rather i'd make them go up so i always maintain a particular image not because who i am rather to protect the image of islam to protect the image of practicing muslims so many times i see people i want to smack them in the face but i don't why i don't feel consequences i fear what this might bring against islam my religion so i refrain from doing whatever tarnishes the reputation of islam you"
