  "transcript": "um ismail from the u.s yes one question uh sometimes it's very hard to find a government job in some muslim countries without paying a bribe is it permissible to pray a bribe in that case if it's impossible to get that job ismail from the u.s says some countries third word a world fourth whatever when you apply for a government job they will not give you they will not allocate this unless you put something from under the table a bribe and unfortunately this is prevailing in a lot of these countries and unfortunately a lot of them are muslim which tells you that the caliber of islam in such countries because islam fundamentally and religiously fights such corruption to the extent that the prophet allah is said may allah curse the one who gives the bribe and the one who receives it and i remember once in a friday khutbah it was about bribery and i said the prophet said so and so may allah curse the one who gives a bribe and who takes a bribe and i say oh curse everyone among us who gives a bribe or takes a bribe another single person of the 2000 attending the jummah i said i mean which shows you that whoa we have a problem and this is problematic now scholars said that if you have a legitimate ride of yours that you cannot attain without bribing and this is beyond your ability you've tried your level best and there's no open door in this case to attain your right or to protect yourself from such uh injustice you may pay a bribe now when it comes to government positions if this is the norm and everybody who's qualified or not qualified pays a bribe then in this case if you're qualified you may do this in allah"
