  "transcript": "Ana, from Uganda Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh They're saying Allahumma a'aynni a'ala dhikrika wa shukrika wa husni wa abadatik, can it be said any time or only during salam? This beautiful dua was taught to our beloved companion Muad Ibn Jabal, one of the great scholars of the companions, may Allah be pleased with them all, when the Prophet ﷺ took hold of his hand and he said, O Muad, by Allah I love you, by Allah I love you, look at this wonderful prophecy and wonderful glad tidings, it would make your ear pop like a radar's and whatever you're going to say, Muad is going to embrace it and engrave it on his heart after this glad tiding. So after these beautiful words, the Prophet ﷺ said, do not leave the following phrases at the end of your prayers, Allahumma a'aynni a'ala dhikrika, O Allah, support me to remember you and to thank you and to worship you according to the sunnah, the right way, the valid way, because lots of people worship Allah but on the wrong path, like those innovators, they think they're doing good while they are going astray, so he said, not any ibadah, that should coincide with the sunnah of the Prophet ﷺ so that it would be valid and accepted. The question of Ana, is this only limited to the end of Salat? The answer is no. As saying, Allahumma innaka afoon tuhibbu al-afwa fa'afu a'anni, is not limited to the last ten nights of Ramadan, when we are seeking and detecting Laylatul Qadr, you can say that anytime, in your sujood, during the whole day, while walking, while talking, while sitting, you just say, O Allah, a'anni a'ala dhikrika wa shukrika wa husni ibadatik, as we actually say it more than 17 times every single day, when we say in our prayers, only you we worship and only you we seek support and help from. So this is actually, a'anni a'ala dhikrika wa shukrika wa husni ibadatik, and Allah Azzawajal knows best."
