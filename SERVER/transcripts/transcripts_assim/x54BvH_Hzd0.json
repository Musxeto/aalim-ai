  "transcript": "Muhammad from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. The Prophet ï·º said and I quote anyone who shoots at night is not one of us end quote. Anyone who shoots at what? Anyone who shoots at night is not one of us. So can you please explain this hadith? Okay the hadith I do not know of. Maybe it's authentic, maybe it's not. It has to be investigated. As for the shooting at night, if the hadith is authentic, it would be in reference to the possibility of harming innocent people or hitting objects that you did not intend because simply you cannot see at night. So why would anybody shoot in the dark as they say? That is not permissible or valid."
