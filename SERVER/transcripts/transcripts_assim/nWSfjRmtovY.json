  "transcript": "we have shihab from bangladesh check if i travel to another city and stay in a hotel there can i perform kassar and what if i don't practice intentionally or join a congregation in masjid will i be sinful okay i will answer inshallah shihab from bangladesh he says if i travel to another city other than my hometown and i go and stay in a hotel can i shorten and combine my prayers the answer is yes you're a traveler what about if i were to go and pray in the masjid in this case you have to pray like the imam if the imam prays four raka's you have to pray for raqqa if he prays three raka's maghrib or turkish fajr then you have to follow him if he's a traveler as well and he shortens then you should follow him by shortening what about if i intentionally want to pray full in my hotel room and not shorten well the prayer is valid but you are going against the sunnah of the prophet allah if you want reward then you should follow the sunna of the prophet hazaram"
