  "transcript": "I have problems regarding passing wind due to Consignment and due to a constant fear of passing wind I can concentrate in Salah and sometimes when I'm confused direct password and this causes me to lose so how can I overcome this one of two my friend either you actually have a medical history and a medical problem that makes you pass wind involuntary or you're doubting that you are passing wind if you have the the former if you do have a medical condition that makes you pass when involuntary without any control and this is frequent 24 7. in this case the scholars say the moment the Adan is given you can offer your wudu and then pray between the adhan time until the end of the time of that prayer without the need of renewing your wudu if you were to pass wind why because Allah says fear Allah to the best of your ability and this is the best of your ability this is scenario number one if you have a medical case the second scenario is that you're not certain and if you're not certain we have a legal Maxim or what is known as a major ruling that states certainty is not affected by doubt what backs This legal Maxim is an authentic Hadith where a man came to the prophet and said to him o prophet of Allah I may find something a feeling while offering prayer should I break my prayer and go and perform mudu so this man is not certain because had he been certain he wouldn't ask this question if he simply farted so he broke his widow but he's doubtful and this doubt is bugging him and he doesn't know what to do so the prophet gave him this legal Maxim and he said to him do not leave your prayer until you hear a sound a popping sound of wind exiting Uranus not the planet but you know what or you find a an odor an offensive smell meaning that whoa this is definitely my uh uh tacos that I had a while ago so if this happens in this case you broke your wudu for certain because you have evidence the sound or the smell but if it's just a doubt it's just a movement something that's moving and bugging you ignore it continue in your Salah this is shaytan messing up with your head and Allah Knows Best Selma from the you"
