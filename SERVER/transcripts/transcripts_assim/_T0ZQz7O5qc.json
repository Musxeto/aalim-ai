  "title": "Does Foreplay without Sexual intercourse require Ghusl? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "now a question is focused on the issue of intimacy a couple a man and his wife they flirt with one another or one another they play with one another but they don't have actual intercourse they do not have the actual penetration do they just kissing hugging etc so do they have to perform whistle the answer is no because hustle can be obligatory providing one of two takes place either the penetration which is known as intercourse or ejaculation of many of semen so if a person ejaculates man or woman while intimacy or alone or nocturnal emission or whatever as long as there is ejaculation Russell becomes mandatory he cannot pray she cannot pray or read or touch the Quran or read the Quran they have to have their major ritual bath or whistle other than that the answer is no problem so kissing and hugging without intercourse without ejaculation does not require Russell however if there resulted out of that prostatic fluid which is natural known as Nephi in this case they have to wash the affected area and their private parts and to perform woudl but not also and I hope this answers the question"
