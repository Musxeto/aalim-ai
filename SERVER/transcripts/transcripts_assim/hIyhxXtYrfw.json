  "transcript": "Akbar from India. He says, 'we \nknow that it is not permissible to   consume garlic or onions and then go to pray in \nthe masjid. The prophet, 'alayhi salatu wa salam,   said that, this is prohibited. And he told us \nthat the angels in the masjid are offended by   what the humans are offended by. And definitely, \nif someone next to me had garlic, or onion, and   he breathes the smell, the odor offends me. So he \nmust not come to the masjid. Now, Akbar is saying,   'what is the time?' Akhi, this is not something \nyou can calculate, or start your stopwatch and   say 'okay, I have like five seconds then I can \ngo.' It depends on the smell. If people can   smell, when you say 'Ameen', that \nyou have eaten garlic or onions,   then you should not. If you can remove that odor \nwith a strong peppermint gum or some sort of   herbs that you consume and has a good \npleasant odor that would overwhelm   the odor, which I doubt there is something \nlike that, then yes, no problem. But usually,   it may take like six hours, some take 12 hours, \ndepending on the strength and the amount you had."
