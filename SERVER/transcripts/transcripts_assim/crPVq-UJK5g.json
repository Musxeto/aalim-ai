  "transcript": "moussah says there are some specific of car that if you recite 100 times in a day you get some type of reward do you have to say these earth car in one sitting or can you split them up throughout the day as long as they reach 100 first of all if car is the plural of thickened and vicar is whatever you say to remember allah azza wajal for example if i recite the quran this is thicker if i say after prayers subhanAllah alhamdulillah allahu akbar 33 times this is thicker so whatever we mentioned the name of Allah Azza WA JAL and whatever we say of the invocations that we were taught this is called vicar now we know that there are two types of vicar general and specific prescribed vicar the general dhikr is when I say a staff for Allah I seek Allah's forgiveness and I say it throughout the whole day I miss 810 times a hundred times a thousand times more or less there is no specific number for it this is general so we don't have a problem with this and brother Musa is not asking about this brother Musa is asking about the prescribed vicar where the Prophet told us allah√≠s alot of Salaam to say a specific vicar a fixed number of times so as mentioned earlier saying Subhan Allah alhamdulillah Allah ho Akbar 33 times after every prayer followed the prayer that is and then concluding la ilaha illallah wahdahu la sharika lah lah al mukarrama Andujar coalition pedir to complete 100 this is well-known people know this and there are a bit larger in number vicar so for example the Prophet said Ali salatu salam whoever says subhanallah wa bihamdihi times allah azza wajal we will forgive his sins even if it is as the foam of the sea or the ocean so no matter how many sins you have Allah forgive them if you say subhanallah wa bihamdihi times also part of the earth car of the morning and of the evening is to say la ilaha illallah wahdahu la sharika lahu lahul mulku al hamd wha-hoo ala kulli shay'in qadir 100 times and this is quite the longest type of Earth car and it takes some time maybe like three to five minutes if you say them with contemplation now saying them a hundred times may be a bit heavy for some and this is why brother Musa is asking do I have to say it immediately after fajar prayer because this takes a long time the most authentic opinion is that wherever the Prophet tells us are a salatu salam whoever says this whoever reads this whoever recites this during a day then you can recite it and split it in two installments if you wish so yes I can say la la la la sharika long walk around home do Auto Collision Kadir ten times or fifteen times after fajar prayer and ten minutes later I continue to say 25 times and half an hour later I complete the 60 times for example there's no problem in that likewise when the Prophet tells us Allah is a lot of Salaam to recite Surat al-kahf every Friday so if someone recites two pages of it after Fechter another two pages at ten o'clock a.m. and maybe one page before Friday prayer and the rest after a sir this does the job because this person has read Surat al-kahf on a Friday no where did the Prophet say alehissalaam that you have to recite it all in one go however it is much better and safer so that you would not forget or neglect if you split it up into parts it's much better to do it at one go now having said that remember brother Moosa that these are car they protect us with the grace of allah azzawajal so that car will say after fajar and in the evening which I am inclined to say that it's after mother it well some scholars say that it's after a sir both ways are okay inshallah the our car you say after followed prayers that car you say before going to bed the of car you say before leaving your house or entering the bathroom or eating and drinking these are the car protect us from the evil eye from envy from black magic from jinn with the grace of Allah soldier especially if you say them with contemplation with dependence and reliance on Allah the Almighty those who don't say them they are vulnerable to such attacks and this is why if you delay saying it all after fajar and you may say it at 10 o'clock or 11 o'clock in the morning between failure and completing them you're not fully protected which is not very a good thing to be in"
