  "title": "Are we allowed to have cakes for birthdays? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "so as he asks what is the ruling on preparing a birthday cake see the issue of birthdays is something that we Muslims do not have and if you look at the time or the history 100 or 150 years ago you will never find people celebrating their birthdays this is something that came to us recently either through the conquest of Muslim world countries or through people going to the west and adopting their customs and bringing it back to us so the issue of having a birthday cake with candles the number of your age with singing happy birthday happy birthday to you dear so-and-so happy birthday to you and then blowing the candles in one breath and then eating from that a cake this is not from the Muslim tradition and hence this is imitating the Kafar it is not a religious celebration but we are told not to imitate the Kafar enhance such celebration that comes over and over on a specific date which is the date of birth this is called the read and the Prophet Isis I'm told us that there are only two reads to be celebrated throughout the year for Muslims and that is riddle of ha a needle futur therefore you must not participate in any gathering or celebration or even congratulating people by saying happy birthday or giving them gifts on that occasion now if you the recipient so it's my birthday today today and someone says Salam alaikum happy birthday I would not hang up I would not the person or give him a lecture I would just say thank you if someone comes and gives me a present I would say thank you if someone gives me a piece of a cake of his brothers birthday and he brings it over to my office or my house I will eat it and I say thank you this is not taking part there is no problem in that but to initiate this yourself this is Haram"
