  "transcript": "Munira says can a wife call her husband brother daddy etc and can a husband call his wife mom sister etc will this affect their marriage as is no this would not affect affect their marriage but Romer hapa for example used to dislike this may Allah be pleased with him and he disliked it because it may lead later on to lahar or to make this woman prohibited for him not that it is a way of prohibiting her upon him so there's no problem in using that word and if one avoids it that might be much better"
