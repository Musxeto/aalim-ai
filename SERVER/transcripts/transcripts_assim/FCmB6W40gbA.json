  "transcript": "Adikunol from Nigeria. I have a question concerning seeking help from others. Just like you mentioned in one of your previous sessions that the Sahaba may be being asked not to ask people for something. So if I want to apply for a job in an organization, I'm not seeking help from an employee for him to speak to any manager, but I just want to ask about how good is the place, how is their salary, is this still the same? I just want to ask about the general work conditions of that very organization. Is this still seeking help? Because I don't want to put myself in that kind of situation that maybe I'm seeking help. I want to seek help from Allah, but asking questions about the place and the judge general, maybe asking about how the place is, is it still time that I'm seeking help? Jazakumullah Khairan. Wa Jazakum. There is nothing wrong at all in seeking information and help, generally speaking. So if you want to go to a country, you ask people, what's the currency? What is it like there? What's the weather? What's the best place to get a place to stay in? What are the best restaurants to visit? This information is not related to what the companions gave the pledge of allegiance to the Prophet, not to ask. Because asking here is a sort of begging and a sort of having the lower hand where we know that the upper hand is better than the lower hand. So when you ask people for something, such as, Akhi, can you hand me this? Can you give me this? Can you lend me this? I like your pen, can you give it to me? This is degrading of a Muslim. And a Muslim does not ask such questions. But to ask others, Akhi, what's the time? How many minutes left for Maghrib? There's nothing wrong in that. Even asking people for a loan, there's nothing wrong in that. The Prophet salallahu alayhi wa sallam borrowed from others, he even borrowed from a Jew. Therefore, you have to differentiate between acquiring knowledge of a company, of the way they're treating their employees, the CEO's behavior, and between spilling your honor and dignity on the ground or on the table, begging people to give you a favor, to do something for you. And Allah azza wa jal knows best."
