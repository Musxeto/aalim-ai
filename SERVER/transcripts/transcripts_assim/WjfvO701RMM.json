  "transcript": "says is it permissible to distance in the qatar of salah in the masjid i don't know what tanvir is referring to probably if he's talking about social distancing in the masjid i would say that this is not something that was practiced by the muslims in history to my knowledge though they had the plagues though they had pandemics but they never practiced it now one can attribute this to their lack of knowledge their lack of medical knowledge etc this is possible but we cannot simply go and say that this is part of the sunnah it is not and hence scholars some of them say that it is permissible to go and offer social distancing there's no problem in that and others may differ and say that this defies the sunnah yes as long as we have face masks and we do not touch things without sanitizers or washing our hands with soap why would i go to five or six feet a part in a masjid five of us came in the same car we were sitting next to one another so this is not logical it's not logical to have social distancing when there is none in supermarkets in malls and restaurants in parks in everywhere even in in airplanes where you sit for five six hours and there's not the same social distancing preventing people from touching the quran in the masjid this is outrageous and when you say that also we will not allow you to touch or kiss the black stone when doing tawaf now this is outrageous maybe tomorrow you'll say you're not allowed to use them swag because it's exposed and everybody can breathe into it maybe tomorrow you're going to say don't offer rookie my brother is sick i have to recite blow in him so no this is contagious who said this now we respect medicine we respect the doctors but we respect our religion more and the way it seems to me and i'm not advocating this but it seems to me that people have gone too far with this issue of social distancing with this so-called pandemic that less than one percent of the infected die what about the 99 what about the 85 percent infected who get cured by them by their own selves with the grace of allah no medical intervention so they've hyped it so much why i'm not a supporter of the conspiracy theory i would not say that it's a pharmaceutical companies that are gaining billions and billions of dollars in euros because of that i would not say it is because of influential people causing small and middle and even large businesses to collapse after five six years of uh six months of uh stagnant transactions so that they can reap it off very cheaply like they do in the stock market it's stable and all of a sudden it crashes people lose billions of money while the rich those influential they clean every lucrative share that is rock bottom and they wait for a few months or few years and they sell it gaining billions and billions i wouldn't say that i support this but this is what's happening our religion has to be up front eating from the same plate this is part of our sunnah you want to change all of our sunnah what remains covered 19 is going to disappear in sha allah what about when it comes number 20 or 21 or 2010 or whatever this is going to continue so we have to draw the line and know when it is mandated to quarantine and when it is just a hoax and allah"
