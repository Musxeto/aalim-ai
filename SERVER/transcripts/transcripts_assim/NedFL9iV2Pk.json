  "transcript": "uh the next question is from a sister i'm a 25 year old female and i'm suffering from insulin resistance for 10 years now and due to this problem i get very irregular periods two times a year without medication but even after going to doctors nothing helped me accept fasting i have been fasting for two months straight and got my periods back on a regular basis my question is is am i sinful for fasting regularly as i watched one of your videos where you talked about the hadith of prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam where he recommended us to foss on alternative days well may allah azza will cure your illness and our illnesses as well i too have a problem with diabetes and i haven't tried insulin alhamdulillah till now but i should have a couple of years ago but i'm still defined al hamdulillah the good news is i'm not getting any period yet so may allah maintain this blessing upon us as for the fasting what is prohibited is the voluntary fasting that one does to get closer to allah this is what we say it's not permissible to do more than 15 days a month but if it is for curing or healing or protection then this is permissible for example um a bachelor can't afford to get married um hot blooded and i'm young so the prophet tells me to fast allah so i fast every alternate day it doesn't work so can i fast the whole month if fasting the whole month would curb your sexual drive and would help you not fall into sin yes you couldn't do that because you're not doing it as a form of um getting closer to allah that you're doing it to prevent yourself from falling into haram likewise if in your case sister this regulates your period and helps you to cure yourself for some time the answer is inshallah there is no problem in that and allah"
