2011 and the closing of our our our gathering in shawano Darla we are very pleased to have with us as we had in the beginning shahe Simon Hakim who will deliver a lecture on the Rope of Allah and inshallah without further ado we would like to present the share does a common law sir should I have a friend over him at hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen sallallahu wasallam Obama Carla ugly he well I saw you hit a mean nabina muhammad in why the early me wassabi humanity their behavior Western Division that hehe al-madinah a man assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh there are two ayahs in surat al imran and these two ayahs are indeed one of the greatest eyes of the Quran because it incorporates a lot of messages and lessons that as Muslims we must learn and abide by this ayah is higher number 102 and 103 from short al Imran allah azzawajal says o you who believe fear Allah as he should be feared and die not except in a state of Islam and hold fast all of you together to the Rope of Allah and B naught divided among yourselves and remember Allah's favour on you for you were enemies one to another but he joined your hearts together so that by his grace you became brethren and you we're on the brink of a pit of fire and he saved you from it thus Allah makes his eye clear to you or I add clear to you that you may be guided afterlife in mustard may allah be pleased with him says that whenever you hear allah says yeah I you had latina a minus give it your attention because if it is something that is good for you Allah is directing you to or something that is bad for you Allah is warning you not to do and this ayah is clear yeah you hella Dina amata Omaha fatuity well at Hamilton nila 12 Muslim on Sophie Allah as he is supposed to or as he should be feared and how is Allah should be feared how should we fear allah azzawajal abms road says may allah be pleased with him he should be feared to the extent that he should be obeyed and not disobeyed he should be remembered and not ever forgotten and he should be thanked and not ever reject or neglect thanking him subhanahu wa'ta'ala so this is what the master Hudd says may allah be pleased with him however this ayah when it first was revealed it caused a lot of trouble to the Companions because when Allah says fear Allah as he should be feared this is something that no one can do how can we feel a lot as he should be feared so the companion started praying night prayer until their feet were swollen they started fasting days without end they started giving a charity they studying doing good things but yet they could not fulfill the criteria which is to feel a lot as he should be feared and that is what made some scholars say that this ayah was abrogated by the other iron sure Robin where allah says up allaha mustaparta feel a lot to the best of your ability so now when you look at this I you understand it and context in the sense that fear Allah as he should be feared to the best of your ability and this means that on the day of judgment allah azzawajal would hold you accountable to your ability not to something else there isn't a benchmark that you will be measured against or next to there is your ability and no one knows your ability except allah azzawajal and then allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala tells us that to worship Him as he should be feared or fear Him as you should be feared and die not except in the state of Islam and this is an instruction however can anyone say that I can fulfill this it is not within my reach it is not in accordance to my choice that I'll die in a state of Islam only Allah a soldier knows how my life will conclude and that is why in the hadith of M&MS road may Allah be pleased pleased with him this is a third coat we caught on Abdullah I saw you all know Abdullah who knows her own allah be pleased with him and we spoke about him in the first lecture and that he is one of the four that the Prophet as I'm instructed us to learn the Quran from one of the learning companions of the prophet alayhi salatu salam Abdullah F inverse Road told us in the hadith in a number of hadith also that the prophet alayhi salatu salam told us that a man may do deeds of the people of Jenna to what appears to the people for 60 years and then at the very end allah azzawajal wills it and he does something from the Acts of the people of hell and he dies on that and he enters her 60 years he has been worse bingham la he's been fasting he's been doing good things but the conclusion is what counts and this is why the profits analysis am verily that deeds are by usually what i say this people say intention and this is correct this is headed one of the most authentic hadith but there is another hadith which is what is relevant to our topic deeds are by their conclusion so you may do a lot of good things but at the end you conclude that with something bad and it nullifies all of your good deeds and the opposite is also correct you may have someone who was so notorious sinful far away from this lamp and all of a sudden Subhan Allah Allah guides his heart and 5-10 minutes he dies afterwards he goes to to Jenna and that is why the man who killed a hundred soul went to a scholar and said I've killed a hundred percent so is there any means is there any way for me to the pen cities but then village you living in is a bad village the company you're with are bad you have to choose a better company therefore leave the village urine go to XYZ village because the people there worship allah azzawajal stay with them in a shaala you'll be on the right track in the middle of the way it was his time so he died the angels of hell came to claim him the angels of mercy came to claim him and they disputed imagine angels dispute about over one person analyzer jet sent an angel to solve this dispute and he sent him in the form of a man as in the hadith and the angels of Hell said the man did not do a single good thing in his life and he killed a hundred people so we have to take him and the angels of mercy said the man is going to that village in repentance and his heart is filled with remorse so this erases everything else so when they disputed the angel who was said sent to to solve the problem said measure between the two cities and to either one his closer he can be claimed by the Angels so they measured it and they found him that he was closer to the righteous village more than the sinful village in another hadith authentic hadith allah azzawajal told the righteous village to come closer and told the sinful village to be further from the man so it is a large division who made this happen so it is essential for us to try and die as Muslims though this is not in our hands so what can we do about this we have to live as Muslims we have to practice as Muslims we have to try our level best to be on the straight path do your best and this is all what a lot that we all want you to do because you can do more than your best and if you are sincere if you do your best and try to practice to implement to abide by the Quran and the Sunnah in this case in sha allah with the will of allah with the mercy and grace of allah you will die as a Muslim so allah so allah is telling us to die and to be steadfast on islam until we die as muslims and unfortunately to remain steadfast on islam is very difficult it's not an easy thing and that is why the Prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam in the hadith of OSL Emma may Allah be pleased with her he used to so often say oh Allah who turns hearts make my heart steadfast on Islam this is the majority of his drug the hadith says the most Dora that the prophet used to always repeat Alice lobster is not Oh a large rugby money or Allah pay my debts or Allah do this or do that it was oh Allah who turns heart make my heart steadfast on Islam and i bet you and betting is haram but this is a figure of speech and i bet you if we make a survey among all of us who is afraid that his heart would be turned away from Islam none of us would say I we are so confident we take this for granted that we are in hell we are in the paradise of Sharma we eventually after death we're going to paradise but I'm not sure is it the white a castle or the the black one I'm hesitant I didn't make up my mind and this is awkward this is not the figure that we should have in our hearts we should be afraid a beloved alma Fenella be pleased with him he heard one of his sons he's a companion he heard his son say o Allah I ask you the white house the white Palace to the right of the people entering paradise so as if he had googled it and he knew that the first when you enter paradise there's a white palace so he's asking this from allah azzawajal what did his father Apollo said of the lumber often eloisa them is it my son don't do that ask Allah for Jenna and seek refuge from hell because I heard the prophet say Allison there will be from my own people exaggerating they go beyond the borders in da so this is part of the door that you exaggerating you go out of your way you should not ask such things so the profit that is awesome huge to always supplicate in this hadith or this do I llamo Carly Buffalo sabbatical be an Edenic so when he was asked he said yes the hearts are between two fingers of a las fingers two fingers of a las Venus and he flips them as he wishes so without a la Sol giving you the power to remain steadfast on Islam Elijah it is as easy as this I've seen a nymph seen as well so many righteous people who went back on their heels and they're not practicing anymore and some of them became not only not practicing they became deviant they became enemies of Islam so many people who used to pray with us in the masjid turned to be after a while hypocrites attacking Islam and doing whatever they can to undermine the efforts of the spread of Islam some dies who were used to be mashallah now look at them where are they what happened to them why is this because Allah social did not want them to remain steadfast on Islam or at least on the right track and that is why they flipped so it is essential that we ask allah azzawajal to hold our hearts steadfast to islam and at the same time to try our best to practice because a large l warned us and this is a threat and a warning allah says that we flip and turn their hearts and sites as they did not embrace it or accept it in the first time oh no kalibo i got a homo uppsala home kama lamu middle ve oh well Amara so this is a threat from Allah when truth comes to you and you do not embrace it and you do not accept it and you do not apply it in your life then Allah will see your heart and that is why so many times people come to us and tell us hehe this is from the Quran this is from the sunnah and we are any able to accept that or do it why not because of our intellect or actually of our stupidity but because our hearts are were sealed due to the fact that we've rejected this in the very beginning the second I of course the first I has a lot of more lessons to it but the time doesn't permit us to to go on the second ayah which is related to the topic and that is a la social says and abide by the Rope of Allah all of you together hold fast all of you together to the Rope of Allah Sol and what is the Rope of Allah subhana with Adam there is an authentic hadith that the Quran is the rope of allah azzawajal that extends to the heavens this is hadith authentic hadith and there are other interpretations such as the Rope of Allah is Islam so abide by the Rope of Allah hold fast to the Rope of Allah that is Islam and also there are other interpretation saying that it is the gemara the jumeirah of the muslims and all of these interpretations go into the same mean you cannot survive without abiding by islam and if you watch what are you contemplate about what a la sol warned us from he told us to abide or to hold fast to the Rope of Allah and not to divide and what is the division that Allah tells us not to do is it the difference of opinion that we have between the different for schools of thought between the Shaffer e the Maliki the hanafi the humbly definitely not because the Companions themselves may Allah be pleased with them differed and they had their own opinions so what is what allah azzawajal is telling us not to do it is the division that the prophet allah salam told us that will exist in his followers at the end of time where he said that my Ummah will devour we will be divided into 73 sects this is a prophecy and this has been fulfilled 73 sects all of them are in in hell except one who is this one the one that follows the Prophet of Islam and the footsteps of his companions so everyone else is in hell division that Allah tells us not to have does not happen except by shape on who is the one who drives you to be divided is to separate from one another it is Shaitaan this is his handiwork this is his craft and he is experienced is it he he is very experienced if someone asks me to submit my CV my CP would probably be a couple of pages three pages at most with all the experience in the courses and and the positions i assumed in my life Shaitaan six CV from the other hand is so long and it's so rich this guy did everything you can think of from Adams time till today he is responsible for divorces for killings for looting for sinning for not praying for our of apostasy for worshiping idols this is his job and he knows what he's doing is very good in it and that is why the prophets of allah said i'm told us that Shaitaan has despaired has given up hope that the worshippers in the Arabian Peninsula would worship Him the people who pray no way he handy gave up hope but the only thing he did not give up hope is that he would cause enmity and division among them and this is what he is doing and this is what the of it he's telling us Allison to be careful not to fall in his traps who is the one who made the son of Adam kill his brother creta who is the one who made the Brothers of use of peace be upon him throw him in the well and leaving him for dead Shaitaan and you look at the history and you always find him a they're trying to separate the Muslims and divide them and among the things that he does best is throwing enmity and hatred in the hearts of Muslims and that is why Islam is based a lot has based a lot of emphasis on not doing this Danny just brain storming if you wish in a few minutes if you just sit down and hold the pen in the paper then write down the things that Islam tells you not to do so that you would not make your brother angry with you or you would not throw hatred and cause hatred between you you will find that there are a lot of things for example the Prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam forbade that a Muslim proposes to a woman that his brother has proposed to so if I know that my brother has proposed to a woman and they've accepted it did not matter he just proposed and I know that if I go they'll turn him down and take me instead so I go and do that this is is haram why for the woman i might be a better person but because his heart will be broken and because i know that he has already done this alonzo gel for business it makes it a sin if he bought something from a shop and i went in and i said how much did you sell this for sure she's already sold how much he said it for he says 10 so i'll give you 11 i'll raise the price so that i can buy it off him and he would make that transaction void alonzo gel made this kind of transaction forbidden as well as well in Islam it is forbidden to brag about your lineage or your tribe or your country and the Prophet made that one of the major sins in Islam imagine that I come from this country I come from that tribe this is haram this is one of the major sins in Islam likewise if you brag and you're proud of your med hub I come from this method of this school of thought I'm better than you I'm more knowledgeable than you again this is haram labeling people and being proud of your label is hella the best of labels is the label of an answer and a mahogany they're the best of people yet when the Prophet Isis alam heard them call each other because of a few that took place between two of the youngsters one from Nazzaro and mahadji and each one called his tribe yeah i'm sorry yamaha jury and they came to fight the prophets assam who is proclaiming the proclamation of the jahiliyyah who is calling the name of jahiliyyah he made that call the pre-islamic error call something from related to the idol worshippers though they are the mahajan and the ants are so you have to be careful when you use such names the Prophet also forbade RS salatu salam and Amina which is how do you translate on you but no backbiting is different namimis is taking hmm notice not slander I'll explain it saves time na minha is when I hear something from the brother about her brother and I take what I heard to the browser he said someone so and so so that because yeah the gossiping so with the intention of fueling a few backbiting is when I talk with the brother about third one who's not here and say mashallah the brother is so fat and he's fat don't get me wrong he is fat but just because we said something that he does not approve of though it's true this is backbiting if he's not fat and I say he's fat this is not backbiting this book done this is even a lower form of sin and even greater in burden at the set of a lot so this kind of gossip is forbidden why because it is resulting in hatred between the Muslims and we do this extremely well especially the sisters unfortunately the boys have it the gents definitely have it but those who gossip a lot did you hear what she said about you when he came to the wedding last night oh the dress you wore that dress two years ago doesn't she have money to buy another dress ah she said that she didn't look at this or that and does this mashallah good samaritan goes and tells that well as she said so and so so about you haha us and that is the act and the doing of shape on because he does this best between the man and his wife until he separates and likewise among the humans those who go to the wife and say why why do you tolerate your husband he does this he does that you should demand for more pay for a better house you should ask for your rights you should show him that had I and they continue to do what they're doing so that they would destroy marriages the Prophet I so Sam forbade and Nyjah wha the secret talk imagine if we're free in a car two of the brothers speak or do I don't and they speaking together in order and I'm like a def duck what's happening this is haram why because I don't know what they're talking they might be talking at me about me and Alonzo just tells us in the poor and that this Nyjah this secret talk is from Shaitan in them and nashua min ash-shaytani Leah zhanna lanina i'ma do what I say blahblah him she and in Lebanon it is from Japan so that he would throw as a form of intimidation depress the presses people by doing this so you are not allowed if you're a group of people to talk on your own with someone in isolation or in seclusion you have to either take his permission ok we would like to talk in our language or we talk we have something to discuss but we don't want you to listen to it so it's ok usually the guys is no stop coaching definitely not do it some other time so you are not allowed to do this it also in Islam Allah tells us that when you're sitting and someone comes that you give him some space because if you don't give him some space what would happen these guys don't like me so I would have something against you hold something against you Islam tells you to spread salam to ever to whoever you see among the Muslims why because this makes you closer if I see you in Siberia or in the North Pole I know that you're a Muslim I can tap so the minute I see you're not I'm gonna pretend I didn't see ya there is no one except us in the Penguins if I see you Islam tells me that it is how long for me to give you my back and this came in an authentic hadith the prophecies lattre de berault do not give each one your back like 10 I jeshu do not sell in nature Schneider she is raising the price though I don't want it the people are bidding on the spin the brother is bidding he looks like you know he's not very well versed in the market so I say he says 55 pounds you know seven pounds and he thinks at all if he's betting for seven then it means it deserves more ten pounds 15 pounds and I really surprised though it does not yeah it's not worth even one power so that I can fool him call this form of transaction in Arabic new Josh and Anna josh is forbidden so all of this is forbidden so that the hearts would be clean that we would be united the Prophet even encouraged us at some whatever you see your brother he said that smiling in the face of another is has an a charity providing is the same sex son you know how to go you don't go to the opposite sex and give a big smile I said I'm looking for charity no you're looking for sin no you have it has to be the same sex otherwise you have a problem so do what you can to help others Muslims and by doing this you get closer you get United now to be united and not to divide cannot be except on the basis of the Quran and the Sunnah and understanding of the companions may allah be pleased with them so we cannot unite because simply we're called muslim yet you go on the right and i go on the left we have to be united on the Quran and the Sunnah otherwise our unity has a lot of problems and that is why the gemara is very important the Prophet says I just sound emphasizing the concept of unity and of congregation even when it comes to fasting and breaking your fast it depends on the on the community so the fasting is when you all fast and breaking the fast is when you all break the fast it's the majority of the Muslims and the unity the Prophet said I assumed that the hand of allah azzawajal is with the gemara and what is that Jamar even mush road may Allah be pleased with them said Jamar is whatever coincides with the truth even if you're alone so it's not the number of people it is the methodology it is the way of thinking it is the school that you're following imagine him peace be upon him when he was revealed to and he called his people to Islam how many Muslims were there how many Muslims were there at the time of Brahimi not a single song no he was OMA azzawajal described in the Quran he was OMA he was a nation he was a man worthy of everything masha allah may allah a peace and blessing be upon him however if he followed the concept of the majority he would not have accepted he would not have done what he had done hey you guys with me so like so he preached he called people he gave that one though he was one and this is the truth if you are on the truth if you are on the right track if you're abiding by the Quran and Sunnah even if the whole world even if the whole world goes against you you're still in good hands because you're following the Quran and the Sunnah with the understanding of the Companions of the salaf may Allah be pleased with them and that is why we may differ but our difference of opinion does not justify our fighting living mice road this is a code number 5 may allah be pleased with him in hedge he performed Hajj with earth mad enough at an earth man was the Amir Amir amami it was the third caliph and earth man used to pray in mena Lauren a salon Asia for when we know that we should have prayed to and he kept on constantly opposing this and saying no the Prophet traded to Abu Bakr paraded to Rama crazy too and that man had his own reasons he said said I'm added a wife in Mecca so I think that I'm not entitled to shorten and this was wrong yet and the lamas road whenever the prayer was called for he used to pretty high deaf man and used to pray for because he was the amount so they told him now you oppose him and you say that the Sun is too yet you're praying behind him for why is that he said Al Hillah foo shower the division and being separated is evil he has his own opinion and I fallen because he's the Emile I can't go against the Emir but I have to say and I have to make it clear to the people that this is not accordance to the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salatu salam therefore we have to respect one another Eunice asaba feet one of the Companions or one of the rivals if you wish of Muhammad Amir ISA shafi may allah have mercy on their souls Muhammad Aneesa Chevy is the amount shafi the well-known Imam he said Eunice he said that I debated I argued once over a topic with an mms a free and it was prolonged it was taking so much over time and at the end none of us was convinced with the other person's opinion so we've split the following day now imagine you you spend like two hours debating with the brother on a topic and he does not want to accept what you're saying he's not willing to believe or at least a be convinced so after two or three hours after debating there is something in the heart yeah he's hard-headed he's not willing to listen the following day Eunice says Subhan Allah I've never seen anyone as wise as the shopping after debating him for so long the following day he came and he took my hand and he said unison isn't it possible that we differ over something and yet still and remain to be brothers in Islam see how wise he is nowadays do we have this wisdom in us no aji i'm george w bush if you're not with me you're against this is what a lot of the Muslims are doing they look at each other and be happy while you are you doing this why are you doing that why aren't you a carbon copy of me because everybody else is wrong I'm the only one who's right this is what people think unfortunately and this shows you how ignorant and little knowledge they have because people have been always differing in their opinions and this goes without saying you have the four schools of thought differing on almost everything but this does not take them out of the fold of Islam because they are based on evidence and they gave everything they had trying to reach a conclusion that is in accordance to the coronation and they all said whenever my verdict or my opinion goes against the hadith of the Prophet of Islam throw my opinion in the dustbin throw it at the wall neglected don't even look at it and this is the proper way of doing so we cannot hold tight hold a to abide by the Rope of Allah except by the poor and the sooner and understanding of the self now if you look around you will find the enemies of Islam wishing us well is that true are they wishing us well yeah right we wish everything yes are they I'm the wrong place then enemies of Islam are not wishing us well they're plotting they're doing what they can to get us out of Islam not necessarily to the religion because this is an honor that we are not worthy of they don't want us to embrace the religion they just want us to leave our religion the hypocrites are there and they're doing what they are doing by the best of means and that is divide and rule or divide and conquer so they want to divide us if we would like to prevail if we want to be successful there is no other way except by abiding by the quran and sunnah and sticking to or holding fast to the Rope of Allah so jerusha's the Quran now does this mean that we can have no boundaries when it comes to Islam we can work with any Muslim group or any Muslim ethnicity or sect or whatever not you have to look into that group if that group is doing something that is considered to be a part of the things that nullifies Islam you cannot about you cannot work with them I cannot work with someone who curses the Sahaba this is there is no compromise someone that curses the Sahaba or talks about I HTML abuser or a book or amurath man and nullify the Islamic city all committed an act of apostasy I cannot work with him someone who says that yes I'm Muslim the Ferrari is fine but there is a profit after Muhammad Ali sir Sir you guys didn't know well and the Prophet not north so we're Muslims he's not muslim this is an act of apostasy a knack of i cannot work with someone who says that aji with Muslims we only abide by the Quran the sooner we do not accept it because it might have been altered and changed it might have been written by this or that again this is an act of apostasy those who do not believe in the sooner are not Muslims because otherwise a lot of you would not have sent to us his messenger salallahu alayhi why are you selling so we have to look into what these sects believe if they commit an act that nullifies their islam there is no communication between us we can't we can eat what a jew or a king or a Christian slaughters is that true but we cannot eat what these people slaughtered because they're not jew or Muslim or Christian this is only slaughtering we can eat if performed by a Muslim Jew or Christian and therefore one would have to look into what the people believe if they differ with us in minor things but the Appiah is okay the methodology is okay our point of reference is Quran and Sunnah then we don't have a problem even if they differ with us in particular things but it doesn't nullify their Islam and the point of reference is always over on the sooner we didn't safe hands but when they commit acts that nullifies the slab or they don't refer to a corridor sooner or they belittle the sooner as I've seen some of those daddy's so-called Diaries and when you tell them that the Prophet said as I say hey come on this is nothing and then exact it and they said yes yeah he come out one the Prophet said so and so but about honey if I said my team in Hamburg said sherry said Malik said they oppose and reject and refute the hadith of the Prophet that is awesome with the people's talk normal people even Imams life is not acceptable honey if I may allah be pleased with him and have mercy on his soul said the beautiful statement he said if we receive something in the quran we embrace it immediately and if we receive a hadith from the Prophet Elisha shahram it is on our head we have no second thoughts if but and if we defeat receive something from the Companions now the Companions differed with each other he says we do not go out of the loop of the Companions meaning that we have to take a verdict from one of the Companions but not a verdict outside of the Companions opinions because their opinion one of it is definitely true he says but if we receive something from other than the Companions then they are men and we're men there is no difference between in us and them they don't have any form of a priority it is only for the Quran and the Sunnah and the Companions of the Prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam and I believe that Johnny inshallah this should suffice though the ayahs as i have stated requires a lot and a lot of lessons to be learned and if you go to the books of deceptive see you will find a lot more elaboration on that I pray to Allah that he makes me and you among those who abide by the Rope of Allah and that he concludes our lives on forms of worship and ensure that Lila hey Lala so that he is pleased with us allahu alem witness which already has no so long shall embark on a bureau with naveen o muhammad"
