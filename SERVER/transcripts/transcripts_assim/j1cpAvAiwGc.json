  "transcript": "we have [Questioner] from the UK uh yeah \nI just have a quick question uh you might   think it's similar to what you've been asked \nbefore but there's a slightly detail basically   um I last year I was in the school and you had to \nhave good grades and a good ranking in order to   get to the best colleges and alhamdulillah by \nthe will of Allah I worked very very hard and   I got into the college that I'm in now which is a \nvery good college but the thing is is that and may   Allah forgive me to ensure that I had good grades \nunfortunately I cheated from time to times not a   lot but I did cheat from time to time even though \nI was also working very hard and I was thinking   and I know this is waswasa but well I don't know \nand I said what if I transgressed against someone   or some people because maybe I was selected \ninstead of somebody else that didn't cheat and   would that mean that it's hard for me to be in \nthe college in this college and with that also   affects the in my income will my income be \nharam as well if if you open a can of worms   and it spreads all over you \nwho are you going to blame   myself so if I say to you oh what you've done \nis a grave sin you have to quit this University   you have to ditch your grades not apply the \ncertificate of your O levels or a levels and   you have to work as a janitor and nothing else and \nyour income would be Haram would you do anything   uh uh see this is why don't open a can of worms \nupon yourself and then start looking for a way out   this is what shaytan does you guys have this in \nthe UK the devil is in the details if you go into   details the Devil comes and would ruin everything \nthe fatwa came to you stating that if you cheated   in one of the subjects or a number of subjects \nyou have committed a major sin you're sinful   but your degree is legitimate you can \napply to a uni you can graduate and   work and your income would be Halal but you \nhave to repent this is the fatwa why dig in   deeper as if you're digging your own grave \nand when you get the fatwa and you say whoops   oopsie Daisy I wasn't anticipating this so what to \ndo now the Sheikh said I have to do this I have to   quit I'm not quitting I need to work I need to get \nmarried what are you going to do with the fatwa   I'm gonna ignore it and throw it in the \nDustbin as I did when I cheated as I did   throughout my whole life you brought this to \nyourself so stick with the initial fatwa your   degree is legitimate your uni admission is \nokay don't think about others you may have   cheated or deprived them from their rights \nconcentrate on repenting expressing remorse   asking Allah for forgiveness and do good \nrighteous deeds and Allah Knows Best"
