  "transcript": "Yunus says if someone memorized the whole Quran for five years and then forgot it is his sinful what is the best way of remembering what we had already memorized as for the sin Yunus there is no sin on that forgetfulness is a human nature in the last ayah the very last eye of Surat al-baqarah chapter 2 if you go and check it you would see that allah azza wajal is saying or a bonala to our hip now in a sinner hapana o my Lord do not burden us if we were to forget or to commit an error in Sohail I'm a Muslim Allah said I will do that that means he will not burden us he will not hold us accountable for our forgetting so if one memorizes the Quran or parts of it and he forgets it this is not sinful this is a great and huge loss of reward what is sinful is that when you do not act upon these verses of the Quran that you learnt or memorized and this is why on the day of judgment the severe punishment would be to such people who would be resurrected blind and they would complain why am i resurrected blind while on earth I used to see a lot success to them likewise my signs my verses came to you and you neglected it and forgot it not memorizing then forgetting know forgetting meaning that you did not act upon it and today you shall be also forgotten so those who read in the Quran that Allah Azza WA JAL curses those who deal in RIBA that he waged war against those who deal in RIBA usury interest bank interest etc and still they implement it and work with it then those will be sinful because they knew the ruling and yet they're continuing to do it and this is shameful some people say that I don't have any other alternative yeah you have alternatives instead of being paid fifty thousand a month you can get a job for seven thousand a month your standard of living would be much less yes but it would be haddad but they don't want this they want this standard of living that they look up to and they have enjoyed all of their lives which is wrong may Allah social guide us all back to him"
