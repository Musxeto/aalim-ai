  "transcript": "Arik from the USA Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi So Sheikh, a couple of days ago I was flying to US, or was coming to US from Dubai And I started my journey on plane at around 9.50am in the morning And after a few hours of my flight, the time of Zuhr entered So I prayed Zuhr and Asr, and normally after a few hours the time of Asr started But after a few hours of Asr started, instead of starting Maghreb time, the prayer time started to go back Like after a few hours of Asr started, again the time of Zuhr started after a few hours So Sheikh, in this case, should I pray Zuhr again? When you prayed Zuhr, Arik, which country was that, or were you airborne? I was not sure which country, but I was taking the Emirates Airlines And Alhamdulillah, they show you that the place you are on right now, what prayer time is on that place So the first time Zuhr started, I prayed Zuhr and Asr together So, let me rephrase your question The time prayers that you as an individual are obliged to follow Are the time which you are on according to the sun Not according to your place of origin, where you took off, nor the destination So what counts to me as a passenger on an airplane is the position of the sun So if I see the sun sets, I will pray Maghreb And I can combine Isha to it, because now it is time for Maghreb Regardless of my time of origin or my destination or location Because this is what Allah addressed me to do To know the times of prayers through the position of the sun wherever I am So if you prayed Zuhr and Asr when your plane's location was over a country where it is time for Zuhr and Asr Because where you are the sun has already passed the meridian and it is time for Zuhr Your prayer is valid, regardless of what will happen after 4-6 hours Because you're going to the west, which means that the time is almost stopping And it's unlike when you go from the west to the east You will pray 5 or 6 prayers in a span of 8 hours But when you go from the east to the west, it seems that you're chasing the sun And the sun stops where it is and it doesn't set So there is no problem in your prayer Inshallah"
