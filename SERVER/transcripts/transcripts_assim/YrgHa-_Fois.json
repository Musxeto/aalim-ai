  "transcript": "how about I got you um I have a question regarding backbiting and you know asking for forgiveness you see I as a Muslim man I am aware that I can easily ask forgiveness for other Muslim men if I were to slant to them back by them but I don't know the proper ruling on non-muslim men and also non-muslim women that are both Believers and non-believers uh I was just asking what the ruling is and also I have the ability to if it's not allowed to talk to them directly and I have the ability to send voice messages so yeah that's my question okay first of all women Muslims or non-muslims is totally out of the question no communication should be established no voice messages no SMS no emails no conveying your apology through a proxy nothing completely cut all types of links and Communications what to do ask Allah for forgiveness for the Muslims and repent while expressing remorse and asking Allah for forgiveness for what you've done to the non-muslims as for non-muslim men again you don't have to apologize from them you have to have remorse and repent to Allah and that would do the job"
