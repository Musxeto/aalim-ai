  "transcript": "Saad from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh so my question is there is someone in my family who has like OCD problems so if so this is if the person goes to pray and he has a very weird problem so that if he does something like he doesn't go to the masjid to pray or any other sin that may be related or may not be related to the prayer and he does if he does that for some reason he starts to have like laughter in the prayer so would he would his prayers be valid if he has this and what if he pray does the sins that lead to this knowing that it would lead to this would his prayer still be valid Jazakum Allah Khair. Jazakum. Akhi the issue of prayer is between you and Allah Azza Wa Jal so if you feel that Allah is not going to accept your salat because you're doing it willingly and by choice and deliberately in this case your prayer is invalid it's very simple but if you know deep down that this is an impulsive reaction that you have no control over no matter how hard you try to block it and stop it it still occurs and happens in this case it falls under the last ayah in Surat Al Baqarah Oh my Lord don't hold us accountable if we were to forget or to err to make a mistake so a person who reacts beyond his control some people don't have control over their hand like those with Parkinson's disease so when he's praying he's doing this may Allah protect us and cure all those who are ill would I after salat say what are you doing you're confusing us you're distracting us don't pray here audhubillah only imbecile ignorance would do this this is the best of his ability someone and I've seen this a lot in prayer after I finish leading the prayer and I turn my face to face the congregation some people may have missed a rakah or two while praying the guy does this all the time big I just snapped the shot shots and he's smiling he's posing and when you show it to him he said well I don't know what's happening I don't know what I don't even recall doing this so this happens without his intention other people and I've seen this gazillion times and next to me and this is distracting from the beginning of salat till the end he does this once wipes his face does this and goes and it becomes shaitan comes to me said okay he's going to do it in three seconds two one zero twice wipes his eyebrows his face and his beard then he does this and he keeps on doing this 50 to 60 times per salah after salat it's gone some people without intending it during the whole salah they do this they just keep on doing this as if they have something yeah in their skin or underneath their skin after salat it's gone this is shaitan controlling an individual against his will so this has no impact on the validity of the prayer as long as the person is not able to control it you"
