  "transcript": "Muhammad from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. Prophet ﷺ once saw a man sitting and leaning on the heel or the palm of his left hand behind his back and he said and I quote, are you sitting in the manner of those with whom Allah is angry with sit and quote. Who is the Prophet ﷺ referring to here in this hadith? Jazakallah Khairan. It is prohibited for Muslims to sit and lean back on the palm of the left hand doing this. So you lean back only on the open palm of your left hand. This is the way that the Jews pray or sit according to the hadith and this is prohibited. To do it on both hands, no problem. To do it on the fist of your left hand, no problem. In that the haram is to lean back on the palm of the left hand and Allah knows best."
