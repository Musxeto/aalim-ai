  "transcript": "lozada says I have heard one can hold the Koran while in p.m. to read if one does not remember the long sewers how do I hold the Koran in hands well Rosella I'm assuming that you're asking about you praying alone because if you're praying behind the imam you're not allowed to hold the Koran as this is not recommended why not recommend it we are ordered to listen and you're not listening you're reading we order to put the right on the left on the chest and you're failing to do this by putting your hand up front you were ordered to look at the place of prostration and you're looking at the Koran we're ordered not to annoy those on our left hand and right while you are flipping the pages and picking up the most half and doing this so many things to do but if you're praying on your own this is permissible how to hold it simply do this right hand over the left I'm holding it the most half with my hand with my right I receive I recite from it if I'm tired I hold it with my left and continue there's nothing wrong with it and there's nothing prescribed for it"
