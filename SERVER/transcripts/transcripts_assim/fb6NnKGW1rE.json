  "transcript": "when you choose Those whom you accompany because then you feel like you are with your brethren you feel like you are with those who uh May uplift your morale and get you closer to Allah that's why the scholars say accompany those who are purer than you and those who are more knowledgeable than you who do we choose as friends usually when you look at your contact list open your contact list and try to find out from your contact list how many get you closer to Allah how many will you find this one is in for work this one is for school this one is my was you have was here here in quit big wow like us mallah welcome to the Gulf region we have big wow if I want to have a booking to an airline I have to have was if I have to have one something to to be much quicker and faster in government relations I have to have was so all of my contacts are like this this man sells sheep so I can buy them for sacrifice in he sells them sheep huh this this guy guy has this this guy has that who among my contact list who gets me closer to Allah very few so then I have a problem now a stranger in Islam is divided into two types A Stranger who is righteous and Pious on his own so he prays he fasts he abides by the Sunnah but he does not communicate this to others and when the punishment and Wrath of Allah falls upon a nation he will be included with them the second type is the best of all and this is the saved type and those are who are Pious and righteous but they also contribute to the community by enforcing and enjoying uh uh uh virtue and good and preventing evil and vice this is your responsibility as a Muslim when the wrath of Allah comes you will be saved Allah would not punish the people or the residents of a village while their people are those who enforce the law of Allah z may Allah be pleased with her said that the prophet Alam entered my house one day terrified and he said wo to the Arabs from an evil that is coming close to them from the dam of Y and Ma it's had been opened this much so zanab asked oh prophet of Allah can destruction befall upon us while there are good ones there are righteous people among us the prophet said yes this is possible when evil spreads and is overwhelming why because these righteous people are not saying the word of truth they're not changing they're seeing evil in front of them and they pass by and say talk what you're doing is wrong why don't you come and pray with us you cannot chitchat with this woman you cannot drink in the day time of Ramadan you nobody speaks the music is playing everywhere what can we do you can do a lot but you have to take the step forward so that Allah would not punish you for that"
