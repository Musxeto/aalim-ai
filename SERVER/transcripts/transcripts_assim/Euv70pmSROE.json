  "title": "Forgot if I recited Fatiha and went to Ruku, can I change the intention to Sunnah",
  "transcript": "We have Sister Saudah from Tanzania. What should a person do when they forgot whether they recited the Fatiha or not and they already reached in Ruku? Is it haram for them to change their intention to turn the prayer into a Sunnah? If they don't do it regularly, only once, they do it once in life. First of all, reciting the Fatiha in the Salat is a pillar of the Salat. If a person skips it, whether intentionally or due to forgetfulness or due to an error, and does not make it up in the same Salat, the Salat is rendered invalid. Secondly, if a person is in the state of Ruku and he gets the whispers of Shaytan, whether he recited the Fatiha or not, this is highly unlikely to happen. And usually people who come to me for counselling and they say, Sheikh I forgot, I made a mistake in the Fatiha, I say to them, Akhi what's your name? He says, Shizan for example. And I say, how many times are you asked about your name per day? He says once or twice. So I said, then you say your name once or twice a day? He said, yeah approximately, this is the average. I said, how many times do you recite the Fatiha? He said, at least 17 times in Fard prayers and you can add a number of more tens of times if I pray Sunnah prayers and night prayers and Duha and the likes. So I said, SubhanAllah, when I ask you about your name that you only pronounce twice, you immediately said it, without any mistake. And Fatiha that you recite at least 20 to 30 times a day for the past 10, 20, 30 years of your life and you still make mistakes in it? Don't you think Shaytan is messing up with your head big time? Likewise for you Saudah, when you go for Ruku' and say, hmm did I recite the Fatiha or not? This is definitely from Shaytan. First because it did not come to you while you were in the standing position. It came to you when you went for Ruku' when you actually were almost 99.99% certain that you finished your Fatiha and your Surah. Therefore if you get some doubts like this, ignore it and move on. Because such doubts are 99.99% are from Shaytan. What if they are genuine Shaykh? If you are 99.9% certain that yes you did skip Fatiha, your mind wasn't with you, you were thinking of something else, definitely big time I've messed up. In this case you don't change it into Sunnah or voluntary because this wouldn't do you any good. Because the prayer itself is invalid. What should I do? You immediately should rise up, consider you have not done your Ruku' and recite your Fatiha because you're still in the same Raku' and finish it and do your Ruku' and the rest of the prayer as usual. Offer your Tashahud, offer your salutation upon the Prophet as-Salam, offer your Salam Alaikum Warahmatullah, Salam Alaikum Warahmatullah, then offer two Sujud As-Sahoo afterwards and then when you sit offer two Salams to the right and the left and your prayer is valid and Allah Azza wa Jalla knows best. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it InshaAllah within the following two days or three days and Bi-Iznillah Azza wa Jall I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all Bi-Iznillah."
