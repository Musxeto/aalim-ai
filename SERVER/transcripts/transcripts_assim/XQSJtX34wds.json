  "transcript": "Brother Yunus from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh I am sure that when you were in Indonesia you have seen how in their culture they greet elderly So they always put the hand from the elder and put it on the forehead and bow a little bit So I wanted to ask you if this is permissible, I guess it's not permissible And if I have a wife from Indonesia and she's doing this to her family Am I sinful for not stopping her from doing this? Okay, Jazak Allah Khair for your question, Brother Yunus Yes, it is sinful and prohibited to bow as a form of respect And I've encountered this in so many Southeastern countries The moment that you shake hands with them they fall and do this to kiss it or to put it on their forehead And this is inappropriate No matter who this person is Our Prophet alayhis salatu wasalam allowed in one or two cases for the strangers to come and kiss his hand Because he's the Prophet, he's the best man ever to walk the earth Yet he himself abhorred and hated whenever he entered the gathering that people would stand and rise for him You could see that in his face So his companions stopped doing this, they would never stand whenever the Prophet came in alayhis salatu wasalam Which shows us that respecting people has to be in line with the rulings of Qur'an and Sunnah And I keep telling the brothers in Indonesia and Malaysia Whom I have great love and respect for Whenever they want to shake hands with me, I tell them beforehand Raise your head, you're a Muslim and be proud of being a Muslim Don't bow to anyone Now what would I lose if they all bow? I have no problem with that But this is religion Now I know this doesn't go well down the throat of so many scholars there But tough bananas I have to say what I believe And that is confirmed by the statements and verdicts and fatwas of great scholars of Islam It is not permissible to bow What about if we go to Japan, Sheikh? It is customary for people to bow to one another And if you don't bow, they consider this a sign of disrespect And would not like it Well I have two options on the table Either to bow to them, please them and anger Allah Or not to bow to them, please Allah And they would be angry with that I'm fine with them being angry as long as Allah is not angry with me Who cares if the whole world is angry with you When Allah is pleased How dare you do something that angers Allah Oh Sheikh, this is a cultural thing, this is how the customs And they don't mean, I know they don't mean any worship By that of course, that's why I did not say it's shirk I said it's sinful But at the same time, not everything that is cultural That is permissible to do If you go to Spain, men and women when they meet one another It's a business meeting, you go and kiss the cheeks And in France, maybe they would do this thing Is that fine with you? No, no Sheikh Why? It's the same thing, out of respect So we have to draw the line every now and then And be proud of our religion"
