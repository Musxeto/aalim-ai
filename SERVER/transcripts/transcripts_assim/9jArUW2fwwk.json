  "title": "Husband refuses to remove daughter from secular school, is it shirk of obedience if I obey him Assim",
  "transcript": "and my question is that I have a six-year-old who studies in a secular School in a Muslim country where they do have music and art classes now I've already talked to my husband about removing her but he's against it so my question is that does obeying my husband in getting her ready to school every day is something because Islam does prohibit it becomes shirk of obedience or sugar of Desire while I'm not happy about it I'm gradually finding ways to get my children out of that system no there is no there is no shirk of obedience in what your husband is telling you and you're compelled you're forced to obey him you disapprove of it and you know that it is Haram but it is his responsibility as the father and the guardian of the house and it is his sin so you have only to keep on advising him reminding him of Allah azzawajal showing him what happened to similar children when they grow up on such Haram activities but at the end of the day unfortunately it is his call and there is no shirk on your part inshallah"
