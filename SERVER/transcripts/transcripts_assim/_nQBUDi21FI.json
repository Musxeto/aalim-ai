  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] and welcome to our 23rd class of the islamic faith and this is the class that precedes the last class of this book so we have remaining two classes where we will insha allah give the 24th and then we will give the questions and answer session as usual after every eight uh classes so today we will speak about chapter 15 and chapter 15 connection to akida is that all books of akida speaks about whether sins take people out of the fold of islam or not and specifically major sense and all books of apida speak about this simply because as we've stated earlier in our course and elsewhere that deviant sects and cults of islam have disputed upon this issue where the quran the sunnah and the favored three generations along with ahlu sunny all agree upon the concept they never disputed over it so it was essential as a distinguished mark that labels a sect or a cult of being among the 72 deviant sects or cults in hellfire and not from a sunnati with jamaa what is this it's a rule that states that we do not take anyone out of the fold of islam due to a sin he committed and this is found everywhere in all books of akida imam hanifa spoke about it imam shafi talked about it talked about it how he spoke about it and a number of scholars talked and explained this some of them may add a phrase that we do not takes anyone out of the fold of islam as long he is from the people of the qibla when scholars say the people of tibla meaning that he's a muslim he prays and this is why he faces and this description is also taken from the hadith where the prophet indicates assalam whoever faces our qibla and eats from our slaughtering and he he says that he is from us and he is from among us he has obligations like us and he has rights like us so some add the following phrase we do not take anyone out of islam if he is from among the people of qibla with a sin he committed unless he deems it halal so this phrase adding something haram making it halal when we talk about deviant and uh corrupt arcade of different sects and cults we're referring usually to al-khawarich and those who follow them and to al-murjiya and those who follow them you remember that we said that the problem that or the mistake the error these cults and sex fell in was considering iman a lump sum something that is whole something like a balloon if you puncture it it's gone and it's not like a snowball that can increase in size or decrease this is a problem so the murjia said islam or iman is a balloon that cannot be punctured it is with a very solid surface that can be punctured either you annihilate the whole thing which is very difficult or it's still existing intact it never increases nor decreases meaning that no matter how many sins you commit how heinous your sins are you're still a believer as long as you have the essence of belief in allah in your heart then your iman is intact not only that it is in the same level of the iman of the archangel jibril mikhail and abu bakr um no matter how many sins you do you're still in the highest level of iman to counter that al-khawaris came and said yes iman is like a balloon doesn't increase and doesn't decrease but it can be easily punctured so any major sin is a needle that would puncture it and destroys any trace of iman which means that if you commit a major sin any major sin then you are a kafir and you will abide in hellfire forever they were followed by a well-known group called el mortezilla and el mortez said no no no no come on this is too much no we don't say he's a kafir alhamdulillah what do you say say we say he's in a phase and in a stage in between iman and kufur um okay what does that entail well it entails that whoever commits a major sin it will abide in hell fire forever but we don't say he's a kafir so why did you take so much effort to go there if the end result is the same which is going to hell forever so all of this is nonsense how would you make someone a kafir when allah azzawajal prescribed to us the major punishments so if a man kills a person what is this is it kufur khawar says yes because it's a major sin okay then why did allah describe the murderer in islam to be a brother to the victim why did allah allow the murderer to compensate for his crime by paying blood money or the deceased heir to forgive if they want and not taking him out of islam this is islamic it's not relating to islam at all but these people don't think they shoot and then they ask questions the khawaris are known to have sick minds it's sufficient that the prophet allah himself the mercy to the worlds described them as being hounds of hell the worst of allah's creation under the skies as described by the prophet isaiah so there's no point in trying to use logic with them because they are focused on their deviancy and controlled by shape islam according to jamaa is like a snowball it grows inside the more you do good deeds it reduces in size the more you do sins and leave bad deeds and good deeds very easy to understand and there are so many verses in the quran backing it up the hadiths are overwhelmed with uh evidences back again up so let us see what the sheikh writes and try to elaborate a little bit to understand the sheikh says we do not call anyone who offers the islamic prayer an unbeliever as a result of committing any sin other than disbelief in allah so the rule is we do not label as disbeliever anyone from the people of qibla meaning the worshipers the muslims for a sin he committed until he deems it halal so this is a statement now to reveal or to revile allah to curse allah to say bad things about allah is an act of disbelief and is indeed worse than associating partners with him and an idol worshipper does not bring allah down to the status of stones rather he elevates the stones to the rank of allah so now this is in refutation to the murjiya the murjiya says that no sin takes a person out of the fold of islam no sin strips a heart of belief so the sheikh says to revile allah is an act of disbelief so this is a sin that takes a person out of the fold of islam because it's worse than shirk so mujhy i say shirk takes the person out of the fold of islam the sheikh says well reviling allah azza is worse than shirk because a mushrik who associates others with allah he doesn't humiliate and insult allah by bringing allah's status down to the level of his idols rather he raises the idols to reach or try to reach the level of allah azzawajal allah mentions in the quran what disbelievers will say on the day of judgment allah says by allah we were indeed in manifest error when we equated you with the lord of the worlds the one who reviles allah brings him down below the rank of stones and to revile allah is very grave disbelief like faith this belief may decrease and increase so this is also a fact that we believe in when we say that is the disbelief of pharaoh or of abuja the tyrant disbeliever of mecca is there this belief equal to the disbelief of abu talib the uncle of the prophet islam the answer is no this is why the least person being punished in hellfire is abu talib though he died a mushrik but he's in the highest level of hellfire which means that he's the least being tormented in hell while in the last bottom level of hell are the notorious mushrikeen pharaoh such as abu jahl etc allah azzawajal says and this is to indicate the proof on the fact if someone asks you what's the proof that this belief increases and decreases like amen you say to them allah says what what translates to the intercalate then circulation the delay of sacred months is an act of gross infidelity which causes the unbelievers to be led further astray the translation in the book says the postponement of sacred months is only an excess of unbelief or disbelief and this is more accurate translation but those who return and also allah azza says in an other ayah but those uh let me see those who relieved and have hardened in their disbelief after once believing their pretence to repent shall not be accepted indeed such men have altogether strayed but those who return to disbelief after having accepted the faith and then grow more stubborn in the rejection of the faith their repentance will not be accepted for they are those who have truly gone astray now having said that about the disbelievers whether their disbelief increases or decreases this would not change the fact that they will remain in hell fire for eternity uh uh that the author says however the increase or decrees of disbelief does not lead to the unbeliever becoming exempt from punishment in the fire it only leads to increasing or lessening his punishment allah azzawajal says in the quran as for those who disbelieved and barred others from the way of allah we shall add further uh punishment to their punishment for all the mischief they did we do not testify that any particular person will be in heaven or hell except those whom allah and his messengers have stated their destiny we bear witness that whoever dies a believer belongs to heavens and whoever dies a disbeliever will be in fire this ends the lesson but seriously we need to read this chapter two three four times and contemplate upon it the vast majority of the youth who are not taught proper apida they find this raging fire in their hearts wanting to fight wanting to make a stand to the extent that shaytan pulls their legs bit by bit until they fall into the bid of the fear and they go on talking about muslim rulers as being kafir scholars of islam as being kafir judges as being kafir all of this because of a sin the issue of takfir is so widely spread that even the youth and even grown-up men and women may doubt their own islam and you know that i do a lot of counseling sessions for ocd patients and a lot of them i have watched netflix in my kafir i've watched clash of the titans am i kafir i played a game that had idols in it and zombies am i kafir the people don't understand the concept of kuffer this chapter you understand we do not take anyone from those who face the qibla who pray out of the fold of islam for a sin he committed or in other rephrasing for sins committed not a particular sin but generally speaking unless they deem it halal and this is extremely important because certainty is the rule and certainty is not affected by doubt i'm a muslim for sure i'm not doubting this all ocd patients they're muslims they don't they say this doubt this the moment i ask them rasulallah but when they get these intrusive thoughts maybe i've committed an act of maybe i've committed kuffur i say to them what is maybe it's doubt so doubt never affect or impact certainty because certainty is not affected impacted except by an other certainty not by doubts and to remove some of the misconceptions that some may have in this course in chapter or in episode 8 9 10 and 11 four episodes we talked extensively about kufur and the types of kufur and i advise you guys to go and watch them again and again because you will insha allah benefit from that but if we were to talk about um let me open the page of the questions so that we are ready if we were to talk about the types of um kuffer or sins that may cause a lot of confusion when we say the rule we do not take anyone from the people of qibla out of the fold of islam for a sin or for sins they committed unless they make it halal this is quite generic especially when someone is not brought up with the akhidav so he might be confused and when he hears a doubt casted upon him from here or there this may add fuel to the fire so let us look first of all we do not get anyone of the people of the qibla out of the fold of islam for a sin or sins they committed what is meant by sin first of all there are sins that do not impact the essence of iman and there are sins that annihilate and remove the essence of iman so the first type of sins that do not impact the essence of iman meaning that iman is still there intact but it is reduced but the essence is there such as all the sins or most of the sins you know of like fornication like um drinking intoxicants like gambling like dealing with riba like disobeying your parents like stealing like murdering the whole nine yards these are sins whoever fall and commit them is sinful is he still a muslim yes indeed he is still muslim and this does not impact his islam but it decreases his imam so he's a believer but he's a sinful muslim so this is well known to everybody now the second type of sins are those that eradicate and remove and erase iman from the heart because they impact the essence of iman such as if a person curses allah reviles allah or the prophet if a person intentionally steps on the quran with his foot or prostrates to an idol willingly these are acts of kufur that annihilate islam i don't have to go and ask why did you curse allah maybe you have a legitimate treat no no this is an act of kufr takes a person straight out of [Music] islam even if the person doing it acknowledges that it is haram and he says that no i'm not saying that this is no no this is totally out of the question similarly if in the old times someone kills a prophet so i said what's wrong in that he is just murder it's like killing anybody no this is an action that states that you are a kafir and the origin of this is what we mentioned in 8 9 10 and 11 episodes previously mentioned where allah azzawajal says in chapter nine well insane who used to chit chat about the companions making fun and mocking them while they were on an expedition with the prophet isa allah revealed verses of the quran saying if you were to ask them they would say we were fooling around say o muhammad to them is it by by allah by his verses and by the prophet assam you were mocking and having fun do not apologize you have committed kufur after believing in allah you've committed blasphemy you're out of the fall of islam don't apologize so this type of sin a sin is unforgiven meaning we don't have to ask a person do you think it's halal or haram when you committed it no the moment he curses allah or the prophet of salam he gets or leaves the fault of islam generally speaking of course i'm not talking about people who are insane or the likes also we do not take anyone from the people of the qibla out of the fold of islam due to sins he committed or a sin he committed unless he deems it there's a third type that does not fall under this category and this type is described by the last phrase which is not in our book unless he deems it halal and that is if any person deems what is haram from the quran or from the sunnah to be halal so this is cover of rejection he's rejecting the sharia he doesn't drink intoxicants he doesn't drink wine but when asked about it he says i don't believe it's haram and this is rejecting islam or part of it and a person who does this to things that are known by necessity from islam i'm not talking about minute little things someone who says i don't believe hajj is a pillar boom kafir because he's rejecting something that is from the essence of islam i don't believe uh hijab is mandatory i'm not talking about i'm talking about hijab which is mentioned in surat nur and in surat al-azab among tens of hadiths it's a kafir someone says i don't believe that we need to have legislation from the sharia and we can rule with man-made laws and he rejects the concept of sharia you get into deep waters the more you express that you're not a servant of allah anymore in that you have what is known as freedom to choose kuffer from iman the moment you choose kufr you're a kafir so this is the third category that also has to be added to the book because the phrase melanie's is not in the book and it should be added so that the three categories are clarified and allah knows best we move on to the questions we have zubair and he says dear sheikh i'm asking about music why did the prophet islam left those who were singing inside ayesha's place is it advisable to keep on learning from someone who halal things like shaving of beard trousers below the ankles listening to music as long it does contain for words a woman can pray without a veil as long as she's in her house he forbids and that it's wrong and so on he does not clean his ears while performing wudu and so on i don't know why you guys jam all these questions with in one paragraph and at the same time you don't write proper english in order for the question to be answered properly it has to be clear and it gives the person answering the question total understanding so the first part of your question is easy understood why did the prophet hassam leave those who were singing inside isis house well the hadith stated that the prophet sallam on a day of 8 was lying on his bed facing the wall giving his back to the hall to the room while there were two young girls singing and aisha was there so abu bakr entered his daughter's house shocked to see these girls singing and he said as a form of objecting and rejecting the pipes or the flutes of satan in the presence of the prophet so the prophet salaam stopped him by saying leave them abu bakr today is a day of eid so that the people would recognize that we have tolerance in our religion now there was no mentioning of music at all the girls were singing meaning saying poetry or delivering a nasheed and we know that in weddings in aids and when a dignitary arrive from long travel it is permissible to use the duff something like the tambourine without the metal endings and this duff we can use it to spread happiness in weddings in aids etc and this is why the prophet islam did not say to abu bakr no abu bakr they are not the flutes of satan rather he said this is permissible innate this is the only occasion that it is permissible in so he ordered abu bakr to refrain there were no musical instruments none what none whatsoever music is totally prohibited in islam whether it's a piano a violin a guitar a synthesizer drums pipes brass strings all are prohibited in islam so your comment zaid is wrong never ever was the prophet salaam in a place where music was played now the second part of your question is it advisable to keep on learning from someone who halal things like so i presume that who believes that the following things are halal such as shaving the beard having the trousers below the ankle listening to music providing that they don't contain words of kuffur uh saying that a woman can pray without a veil as long as she's in her house i've never heard anyone say that before and he also forbids which is the sacrifice we give for children newly born and he says that this is wrong and the prophet isaiah did not do that and he does not clean his ears while performing wudo meaning that he doesn't wipe his ears now this is a long topic simply because the things and the issues you have mentioned some of them are controversial and issues of dispute so shaving the beard is sinful but the one who does it is not a kafir and this is our chapter we do not take someone out of the fold of islam for a sin he committed as long as he is from the people of the qibla but if this person says that shaving the beard is halal this is an issue that we have to go back and contemplate upon because the consensus of the four schools of thought to my knowledge and when i when we say the consensus of the four schools of thought those who are the prominent opinion of these four schools of thought say that it is totally prohibited to shave the beard shortening it is an issue of dispute but shaving it so we need to look into this but if he shaves the beard acknowledging that it is part of the religion and part of the sunnah but it is not sinful this is an issue of dispute trousers below the ankles an issue of dispute listening to music an issue of dispute women can pray without a veil i've i don't know anyone who had said this before um saying and claiming that is not from the sunnah again this is even if there was a scholar saying this this doesn't qualify to stand in front of all the schools of thought and authentic sunna etc of religion so people don't pay attention to such a person or an individual so you see learning from such people is problematic because muhammad evan sireem one of the great tabi's said that this knowledge is religion so search and be careful who you take your religion from it is not the beard that makes a person knowledgeable or not it is not his trousers above or below the ankles it is a number of factors maybe if they were enough time inshallah i would clarify this on my next lecture which is on saturday the 27th of february 8 30 um makkah time p.m where i shall talk about um what makes a scholar a scholar and are those in the west specifically in america because this lecture is being done there are they considered to be scholars and who to learn from so maybe i will inshallah try to discuss these things uh day after tomorrow if allah grants us life so basically speaking you have to be really keen on taking knowledge from people that practice it if you end up with a scholar or a student of knowledge and you have a checklist that relates him to islam to being a practicing righteous pious muslim and you start checking the boxes finding out that most of the boxes are unchecked so only when it comes to academic or theoretical knowledge that you may check but when it comes to piety righteousness fear of allah etc you find that this person is way far away has no problems in sitting with women joking with women lgbtq xyz maybe you never know or at least he says i have no problem with them and you would find that a lot of the islamic practices are being diluted they're not as solid as they are supposed to be according to the quran sunnah you don't learn from these people as you do not learn from extremists who say that oh if he shaves the beard he's a kafir why would i do this it's sinful or if he his trousers are below his ankles he is a faster and you should ditch him you should spit on him this is not islam so you have to have the balance so to answer your question is it advisable to keep on learning the answer is no there are many with the grace of allah who follow the sunnah who abide by the understanding of the three favorite generations who refer everything to the quran from them fame is not a criteria to judge whether i should learn from this person or not the length of the beard is not a criterion the titles of phd or assistant professor or a whatever these are not criteria a grand mufti is not a criteria the criteria is someone who gets you closer to allah and who he himself walks the talk and who he himself if where to be at the time of the prophet salaam would be considered a muslim a practicing muslim not someone who keeps on changing his colors and allah says i have a question if you have kept money to buy a house do you have to pay zakat on it any money that belongs to an individual whether that individual is sane or insane an adult or a child whether the money is saved for educational purposes marriage buying a property had the money as long as it belongs to a muslim it reaches a threshold or more and a full year lunar year history year passes on it you have to give 2.5 on it as the cat regardless of the reason you're keeping it and allah knows best travis dorne says why is vohr and asar prayers silent why not if you were to say anything i would say why fajr maghrib and asia are loud prayers so the same concept applies to your question this is a form of worship that allah azzawajal tests people by so he subhana wa for a reason and for wisdom that he only knows about prescribed that some are silent and some are loud and we have to abide by that and we have no justification for that other than it's the instruction of allah azzawajal saima sehar says can we pray two prayers at one time although we are not travelers so saima is asking about combining prayers we have five daily prayers we pray until we die one is fajr this has to be prayed on time you can't pray it before or after you must pray within the allocated slot then we have zohor and asar for rakas for raqqa's silent silent this is a set then we have maghrib the first two of maghrib are loud the third is silent the first two of isha are loud the last two are silent these are two separate sets meaning that the first set zohar nasser i can proceed as a time to be prayed with the so although can be prayed together or i can delay to pray it at the assad time likewise maghrib and asia i can pray maghrib at the allocated time of asia or i can bring isha to be prayed with maghrib at the allocated time of mahir when do we combine between these prayers the most famous and well-known reason is traveling so the moment you leave the borders of your hometown traveling to another city country or anywhere else you're traveling you're not visiting or going for a picnic you're traveling then you can combine prayers in in and in addition to that only for a traveler you can shorten so the four i prayed too the four of us are prayed too the four of isha are prey too while fajr and marib remain as they are two and three so the first reason for combining is traveling there are other reasons that the prophet ali permitted the muslims to combine when there is hardship or necessity so a hardship is measured by truly being a hardship not something that a person does without without real hardship so i have a placement exam i have an exam that is so important i enter it at one o'clock p.m after the and finishes at maghrib time after sunset so i would not be able to pray us or on time they would not allow me out they would not allow me to pray in the hole so what to do if i skip the the test i'll fail the year or i'll fail miserably in my future in my career in my studies etc no problem when you pray the hurt for raka's after you conclude it make a comment and pray for raka's if you have a surgery whether you're a surgeon a nurse or the patient himself and you know that you will miss one of the salats so you can combine it to the one that is it's combined with there is no problem that no shorting and so on so if there is hardship yes you can but if someone is shopping in the mall and it is maghrib time and he is interested in continuing to shop and decides to pray maghrib and aisha when he goes back home no this is not permissible because there's no hardship he can't stop and pray anytime we're talking about real hardship that prevents a person from praying on time and allah azza knows best samia also asked can we make on shoes so i'm presuming that she is referring to mess which is wiping over the socks and she's asking whether i can also wipe over the shoes first of all there are conditions to wipe over your socks your shoes or your footwear generally speaking the first condition relates to the stated status of purity so you need to perform a full wooden which is washing your face on your arms to the ankles wiping your head and your feet wipe washing your arms to the elbows wiping your head and washing your feet to the ankles this is called a full woodle why do we call it full because you washed the feet you did not wipe over your socks so this is the original wado so this is condition number one now while you are in the state of purity which is immediately afterwards after an hour after two hours no problem as long as your water is intact your full original wudo is intact you the second condition cover your foot with footwear whether it is socks or shoes providing it covers the whole foot including the ankles so the back of the foot is covered the soil of the foot is covered the ankles are covered the toes are covered so if you do this this is condition number two fulfill only then when you break your wudu you can perform normal wudo but when it comes to washing the feet you simply wipe over the footwear whether it's your shoe or your socks bearing in mind that you do not take either one off because if you took your shoes off you cannot put them on and wipe over them again it's gone if you wipe over your socks and then you take them off for five minutes and then put them on again you cannot wipe over them your wood is intact but you cannot wipe over them again so i hope this clarifies it to you zed zubair again asks um i'm asking about prices rise raising if i bought some merchandise on a certain price and later on the market price rises am i allowed to raise my old merchandise price passes yes i bought this apple pen for 100 maybe 50 dollars maybe and a couple of weeks later it went short in the market and everybody was demanding it so it was on high demand when people ask me how much did you buy it for i say 150 if a friend comes and wants to buy it i'll sell it to you for 400 is this permissible yes it's permissible what's wrong in that it's demanding supply if he doesn't want it is it no it's too expensive end of story if i bought merchandise on the account that i will sell it for a dollar a piece but then when i received it or a year later there was shortage of that product and the prices went up to six dollars a piece can i raise my prices of course this item belongs to me whether i sell it below the market price or above the market price nobody has any objection or can have any objection to it because this is mine i can sell it i can burn it i can give it away for free or i can raise the prices to unbelievable uh margins eliaso muhammad can i name my son as al-fudail the answer is yes there's no problem in that faisal habib um is it sunnah to wear loose dress for men the answer is yes men and women are not supposed to wear tight dresses that reveals their aura so the aura of a man is from his navel to his niece he cannot wear or he shouldn't wear tight clothes that would reveal his this area and women are all our they cannot they must not wear something that exposes their bodies to non-mushrooms and allah knows best jr says i have developed a habit of praying to raqqa daily for my marriage and kids i also pray to rakha salat during tahajud's time this is not consistent i fear this could be an innovation because it is not a practice our prophet but my own practice please help you're right this is not permissible because it is an innovation your tahajjud is sufficient so restrict your night prayer to that if you committed the sin then yes you can pray turaka of tawba of repentance any time of the day not necessarily delaying it all the way to the end of the night no immediately after doing your sin you pray these twos praying to rakhas for your kids and marriage is not from islam you can make a lot of extended dua when you're prostrating in any of your praise whether or not and ask allah azzawajal to protect your marriage to guide your kids to cure their illnesses to make them successful at school etc but don't dedicate regards for that purpose because it was not done by the prophet as you had correctly pointed out is it mandatory to read surat al-fatiha as i was told that since it has nurukur or sujud like normal salah could you please shed light this is an issue of dispute the schools of thought of imam abu hanifa and ma and malik say that it is not mandatory to recite the fatiha it's only dua and the imam [Music] say ahmadine is part of the salat and the most authentic opinion is that it is a pillar of the prayer some scholars even said it's it's recommended i think everything is it's recommended but the most authentic opinion is that it is a pillar why because allah azzawajal described the funeral prayer as prayer in surah do not offer funeral prayer upon anyone who would die of the hypocrites and the prophet said allah there is no prayer valid without um without a fatiha so this is the most authentic opinion that fatiha has to be recited and that it is a pillar in salatul janaza and this is the choice of sheikh membas ibn fmin and the vast majority uh of uh the scholars we know who follow the salafi school of thought and allah azzawajal knows best this is all the time we have until we meet next monday was"
