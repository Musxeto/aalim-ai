  "transcript": "Abu Muhammad from the Emirates Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu How are you? I'm doing great Alhamdulillah Alhamdulillah. Sheikh just I want to ask about Hinnah for beard but black color, it's allowed in Islam or not allowed? Okay, first of all, using the Hinnah to change the color of the hair when it's white is a Sunnah and it's also permissible to add to it a special herb called the Katm which gives it sort of a dark brownish color The prohibition from using the color black was mentioned in other Hadiths For example, when Abu Quhafa, may Allah be pleased with him, the father of Abu Bakr was brought to the Prophet and all of his hair was white, totally white The Prophet said, Abu Bakr, you should have informed me, I would have come instead of bringing this elderly man to me I should have honored him and come to him So, the Prophet accepted his Islam and he said, change this white and avoid black So, the Prophet clearly, Allah's peace be upon him, told us to avoid using the color black So, you can use Hinnah, that's a Sunnah, and you can mix it up with other substances that would change it from being red into dark brown but not black And Allah, Azza wa Jal, knows best"
