  "transcript": "Rembrandt says in some places the Muslims who are dying of covered 19 their bodies are not being handed over to their families and they are being cremated what is the ruling about this in Islam it is totally prohibited to cremate the bodies of Muslims and non-muslims alike this is not permissible it is part of other faiths if we can kill the cold in faiths other religions so this is totally prohibited but if you are in a totalitarian regime and you have no way to get the body of your brother of your relative to give it an Islamic barrier there's nothing you can do you don't have an army you cannot fight them because they have all the means of fighting so this is something that is beyond your capability to handle and Allah is most forgiving subhana allah azzawajal"
