  "transcript": "shabbir says in an emergency situation can we make Gemara before the main' Jumeirah of the mosque the Adhan is called but manger mana will be held later but we can't wait in this situation can we perform Gemara or should we pray by ourselves the answer is you should pray by yourselves a message it where the congregation pray no one is entitled or allowed to pray in it except the mmm so if the call for the prayer or the Adhan is being cold and there are like 5 and 10 people sitting waiting for the Obama and you and your friends come in and you make your karma and make a congregation those in the message would come and pray behind you and this would cause the Muslims to split the a man would come and find there's a congregation being held their prayer is invalid because they did not seek the permission of the Imam who is the only one entitled to lead the prayer and they call for the otama for the prayer before the time was due so what to do 1 either you pray individually and leave to go outside of the Masjid and pray on the street or in the park where you're not considered to be inside of the Masjid and law knows best"
