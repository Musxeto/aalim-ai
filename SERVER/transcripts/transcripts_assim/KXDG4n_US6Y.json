  "transcript": "Sidi from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Nassalsin Sheikh Alhamdulillah Azza Wa Jal In Turkish I don't know what you say Rabarashkina Yeah, what can I do for you? You say Isen Okay Sheikh this is a question from a good brother Hafizahullah In Turkey there is a tradition of paying mahr only after separation so they don't pay it until there is a divorce so the brother wants to know if it is in accordance with Islam and if there is a possibility to pay a part immediately and another part at a later time or generally change the timing of payment Okay, first of all a dowry or a mahr is a woman's right when a man marries her whether this is given before the consummation of the marriage or during the marriage contract or at a later time even after the consummation of marriage it's all permissible it's a debt upon the man once the marriage contract takes place now some people would agree and write in the marriage contract that my mahr is divided into two installments one instant and immediate here is a one dollar bill as a mahr and the last portion of it if there were a divorce then I will pay the rest which is a thousand dollars and the woman agrees and they sign and that's it now this thousand dollars is a debt upon the man he has to pay it ASAP now if he doesn't and the woman is fine with that this debt the woman has to give zakat each and every year because it's her money and she lent it to someone who is capable of paying it so she has to give zakat for it some people exaggerate and say that yeah give us immediate effect one dollar as the first installment the second installment is a hundred thousand dollars to be paid if you were to divorce now this is used as a deterrent to stop you from divorcing and it never works because most men if they want to divorce they will just wait they will not see their wives they will not go to them they will not provide for them until she files for khul' if she files for khul' then she has to give up her dowry which she did not receive in the first place and the man goes free and this is not a smart thing to do now if the mahr is given up front a thousand dollars here's a thousand dollars but the woman makes a condition in case you divorce me you have to pay me a hundred thousand dollars or ten thousand dollars and he agrees for that this is not mahr this is let's say a late payment payment fee call it whatever you want a penalty but this is binding because both of them agreed to that so I hope this answers your question"
