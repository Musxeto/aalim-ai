  "transcript": "the issue of um masturbation khid is asking about a person who is far away from his family and he's a bit frustrated and sometimes he's under pressure so is it permissible for him to use what is known as a secret habit or masturbation to uh relieve himself a little bit or relief himself whatever the answer is it's an issue of dispute but the majority of Scholars say that it is not permissible because the prophet when he was addressing the youth he said whoever is capable financially and physically to get married he should do so and whoever is not able to do so that is to get married then he should fast and he did not direct them to masturbating which means that the prophet would not direct us except to the best and whatever else is not then it is not part of the Sunnah and it might even be more than that and this is why Allah mentioned this in where he says and those who preserve and and and and and keep their Chastity and private part except from their wives and their concubines and whoever seeks anything else meaning masturbation then he is a transgressor so Scholars say that doing so that is masturbation is considered to be part of the transgression that a person should avoid now in very minimal cases very rare cases it might be permissible if the doctors for example say that it's a must so if a person is in a medical condition and he has to undergo uh a tests lab tests for one reason or the other or the doctor says that you have to do this procedure now because it has reached a level that would harm you in this case it's permissible but to open it and say that it's completely permissible as long as you are far away from your wife this would be an act of transgression despite the fact that it is physically harmful and it has bad consequences on the relationship between uh uh the spouses um I'm afraid that"
