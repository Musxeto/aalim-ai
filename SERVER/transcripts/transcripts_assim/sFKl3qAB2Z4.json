  "transcript": "Um I heard that someone can break their fast uh during the ifa time by intending if there is no food but I wasn't sure I knew it but wasn't sure that it it is also applied at the daytime for which I have a lot of whiswas during the Ramadan that maybe I have swallowed something or because of something else I have broke my fast but uh didn't eat for the whole day but I was thinking in my mind that okay I will make it up later. So it's um going on like whenever I'm making up any fast still this uncertaintity is uh happening and I'm intending like I will repeat the fast again. So are my fasts uh valid because I don't know how many days I have thought like this. Yes I'm confused. All all your fasts were valid and you don't have to make up any of these days. These are merely whispers from Shayan. Ignore them and move on."
