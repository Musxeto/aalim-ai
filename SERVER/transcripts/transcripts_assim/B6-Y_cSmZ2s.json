  "transcript": "The Prophet ﷺ used to smile a lot. And he used to smile in the faces of his companions like Tamim al-Dari, may Allah be pleased with him. He said, since I embraced Islam, wherever I encountered the Prophet ﷺ, he would not see me except that he would smile in my face. This is something we should inject in our daily lives. Instead of having a grumpy face and a frown whenever someone talks to us. No, be friendly, have a smiling face, not cracking jokes everywhere, not laughing loudly, LOL. Rather, be like the Prophet ﷺ and through that we hope and wish that we will be with him in Paradise on the Day of Judgment. We have a short break, stay tuned and Inshallah we'll be right back."
