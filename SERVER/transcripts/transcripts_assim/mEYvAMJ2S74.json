  "title": "Quality vs quantity",
  "transcript": "nowadays we have a problem and this problem has been going on since Allah knows when this problem is that the majority of Muslims have a dilemma whether to focus on quality or quantity and this dilemma was solved long time ago and Allah has showed us the way and whenever there is quality this comes first then quantity comes afterwards in the Quran Allah in so many verses told us that the quantity is not a determining factor for example Allah says in the Quran that the majority of the people do not know the majority of the people do not believe the majority of the people do not thank Allah Asel so this shows us that the majority is not a criteria to judge things not only that Allah says in the Quran that even if you try your level best Muhammad peace be upon you the majority of the people will not believe so from this we understand that the quantity is not always something positive on the contrary the prophet Alat wasam used to supplicate and he used to tell us that even if you see user or what is known as interest money we call it RBA in Arabic even if you see it to becoming a lot and you might be deceived to think that this is something good the prophet tells us that eventually it will turn into something that is minimal and something that is in great loss without doubt it is a huge loss on the day of judgment because those who do deal in Bank interest or interest over loan definitely will be among the losers on the day of judgment quantity is not always a determining Factor the prophet saidat one dirham overtook a 100,000 Dirham and the companions were astonished how is that possible the prophet told us that a man who had only two Dirhams spent one in the cause of Allah and kept one so technically the man gave away half of his wealth while the other one who gave 100,000 Dirhams actually he had millions and billions so he took 100,000 and he spent it in the cause of Allah knowing that this 100,000 does not consist a small portion from his wealth therefore we have to focus greatly on quality rather than quantity and inshallah if we have time we will elaborate a little bit more"
