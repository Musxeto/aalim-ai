  "transcript": "Ibrahim from Guinea. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Barakatuhu. How are you Sheikh? I'm fine Alhamdulillah. How can I help you today? May Allah bless you Sheikh. Sheikh before asking my question allow me just to say this. I would like to suggest if possible for your technical team on the website to improve what we call load balancing of the server because basically Sheikh currently when me or some other people when we refresh the site when we want to ask question the site crashes so maybe a question. Okay. First of all as for the website unfortunately I have nothing to do with the website. The website is run by my volunteers my admins and they have full control over it and it's their responsibility. I have nothing to do with it and yes in the past three four weeks we've been having so many complaints and we spoke to the brother who made this website and he promised to solve it. To my knowledge couple of days ago two days it was solved and now it's not crashing anymore but the problem is that the box where you put and paste your question only appears at six o'clock p.m Mecca time and I can only answer 50 questions a day but people are waiting in the thousands to flush their questions in a limited amount of a number of seconds literally seconds because 50 then and it's closed. So unfortunately this is what's happening but inshallah it won't crash anymore. My admin is listening and it's their responsibility the other things that is attributed to my name unfortunately or fortunately. I don't have time to run these things."
