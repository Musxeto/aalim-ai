  "title": "Can I give my brother my headset when I know he will use it for both haram & halal? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh I ordered a new headset and my brother who's not practicing has a really bad headset and he says he wants my old one but like I know for a fact he listens to music and stuff but he also does use it for you know searching up for uh videos for his homework and you know some sometimes very rarely Islamic content but I know for a fact like majority of it is just all Haram stuff and if I don't give him this headset it won't it won't stop him from you know listening to music because he already has one that's he already has another headset but like now like I'm hesitant should I give him this headset we're like will I get everything he does like from listening to music exactly as long as he uses it for Halal and for Haram and you cannot pinpoint that he's only using it for Haram because he doesn't he uses it for a number of things and if you look at reality you would find that using his mobile phone using a car looking or watching the TV using the internet in your home which probably you're paying also for the connection using his laptop or the PC in the home all of these things contain Halal and Haram due to this mixture as long as you give him the headset not to assist him on Haram rather to give him more convenience to use it for permissible things is homework to some randomly maybe rarely Islamic lectures to normal things that are halal in this case with this intention that would be permissible and if you add to it your desire to call him to Islam softly and to attract him to Islam through being the elder brother who's kind and compassionate and not only is the Haram police everything is Haram Haram Haram maybe inshallah you will be rewarded for that and Allah Knows Best"
