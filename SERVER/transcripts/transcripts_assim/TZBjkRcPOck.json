  "transcript": "last time we stopped at the Hadith of mu jabal may Allah be pleased with him the great Hadith that the prophet taught mu the Hadith goes as follows mu ja may Allah pleased with him said I was riding behind the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam on a donkey and he said to me oh mu do you know what is the right of Allah on his slaves and what is the right of his slaves upon Allah mu said Allah and his messenger know best meaning I don't know the Prophet continued sallallahu alaihi wasallam the right of Allah upon his slaves is to worship him alone and never to associate anything with him the right of the slaves upon Him is not to punish any person who does not associate anything with him mu was happy so he said oh prophet of Allah may I not give the Glad Tidings to the people can I do that should should I do that oh prophet of Allah and the prophet said no do not inform them lest they rely on and the above Hadith was mentioned in the two the book of bukari and IM Muslim this great Hadith highlights a number of benefits a number of uh uh uh issues that we can learn and we will get to learn some of them inshallah later on when we uh discuss the issues that Imam Muhammad may Allah have mercy and his soul mentioned which he had stemmed from the verses previously studied and the Hadith of the Prophet wasam mu was with the prophet on a donkey which means that it is permissible to ride on a donkey and to have someone ride with you as long as the animal is capable of tolerating it and it's not uh uh too heavy for it the prophet would not waste timeat and therefore he asked mu because mu was a learned student of the prophet wasam he was among the great Scholars at the time of the Prophet Alam and afterwards the prophet would select him would choose him for the great missions so he would lead his people in prayer when mu go back goes back to them at night the prophet would send him as a judge and a messengers of his to Yemen as we know and mu jab the prophet said that he would come on the day of judgment a stone throw a distance of a stone throw ahead of all Scholars which indicates the greatness of knowledge that he possessed that is why the prophet would not waste timeat while he was with mu he said mu do you know the rights of Allah upon his servants and slaves and the rights of the slaves upon Allah mu did not even try to think or figure it out because if you don't have knowledge you simply don't have knowledge so don't try to do something that you would regret in the future always say I don't know and this is exactly what he said Imam Malik says whoever says I don't know this is half of the knowledge and in another narration whoever says I don't know he has given a fatwa so mu said Allah and his messenger know best and this statement can only only be said in the life of the Prophet Alam nowadays if someone asks you a question you cannot say Allah and his messenger knows know best because the prophet is not there anymore Sall Al wasallam and this may not be in his knowledge because he doesn't know what is happening at the moment he's not God he's a messenger and he died peace and blessing of Allah be upon him so you do not say it now so the prophet explained it to him the right of Allah upon his servants that they worship him and not associate others with him and this highlights the importance of of course under falls prayer fasting because this is part of worshiping Allah but the most important thing is not to associate others with Allah and then he said the right of the servant who fulfills this condition who does what Allah ordered him not to do and that is associate others with Allah and he did what Allah obliged him to do that is to worship Allah alone his right upon or over his Lord which Allah made this upon himself no one can force Allah to do this but Allah out of generosity out of kindness and mercy gave us this right Allah the almighty made it obligatory and mandatory upon himself not to punish those who do not associate others with Allah now not associating others with Allah has a lot of implications so you don't come and not pray not fulfill Allah's obligations not do anything and consider yourself to be a Muslim and that is why may Allah have mercy on his soul was asked what do you say that is the key of Jenna so why do we pray why do you do this and that he said every key has teeth for such a a key bring me a key without any teeth it cannot open and the teeth of each key and the key of Jenna is your prayer you're fasting Etc however this is a different issue whether ill is sufficient with any types of uh uh worship or you have to do worship because we believe that IM that belief is the belief of the heart the uttering of the tongue and the actions of the limbs without actions you cannot have full Iman or acceptable Iman as I said the issue of praying part of the things that are essential to be found or otherwise it would nullify a person is Islam or not this is an issue of dispute and this is not the time to discuss it but I hope yeah you got a glimpse of what we were talking about now this is the main text of this chapter we have a number of issues that the compiler has made and listed for us we will try to discuss this in following sessions inshallah and until we meet next time I leave you"
