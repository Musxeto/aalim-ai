  "title": "Should we say long durood on Friday or short one is OK? Durood in morning, evening adkhar authentic?",
  "transcript": "like when we are sending salutations from the prophet muhammad we have the long the root that we trained at the shahood and then we even have the smaller one that's there in the morning evening so is it okay to keep on reciting the short one or like especially on fridays or the longer one is recommended to do or either one is okay okay the most authentic opinion is that the longer one is mandatory in salat what you called uh we call it this is mandatory in prayers other than that saying allah was frequently on friday suffices saying it in the morning and evening atkar is not from the sunnah saying it ten times in the morning and ten times in the night or the evening whoever does this will achieve the prophet's intercession is not authentic it was weakened by sheikh al-bani uh may allah have mercy on his soul so generally speaking yes saying the short virgin does the job in sha allah"
