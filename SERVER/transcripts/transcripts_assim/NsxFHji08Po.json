  "transcript": "if I only pray on the the night of the decree then go to sleep is it sufficient to gain the reward of 83 years of worship Ahmed is referring toah Al where Allah tells us that worshiping Allah in the night of decree is better than a thousand months and this is equivalent to 83 years plus give or uh uh give or take and he says that if I pray alone would that be sufficient of course it would wouldn't be sufficient because you only prayed a portion of the night however the prophet told usam he who prays with the IM until he concludes his night prayer Allah would Grant him the reward of praying the whole night from is till the break of dawn so if you pray with the IM usually the IM in the last 10 nights of Ramadan they postpone and delay a portion of night prayer and they pray it like 2:00 a.m. or 3:00 a.m. if you pray both shifts or both portions with the IM until he prayed uh his Witter inshallah you would have attained the reward of praying the whole night but is not only limited to night prayer and that is why pleased with her said to the prophet if I were to know what is what should I say and he told her to say Allah oh Allah you are most forgiving and you love forgiveness and part hardening so forgive my sins so you should supplicate you should recite the Quran you should fill it up with all the good deeds in addition to night prayer"
