  "title": "What if you see a beautiful girl, can you propose directly or ask for her father's contact details?",
  "transcript": "What if you see a beautiful girl and want to propose her but feel fear and cannot speak to her? How to propose in that condition? You don't. Don't propose to her, first of all. Second of all, do not, I repeat, do not approach a girl even if you want to marry her. And sisters, if someone comes to you when you're in college, when you're in the street, when you're in the office and says, Assalamu Alaikum, I appreciate your hijab and I would really want to marry you but I don't know your father's name. So can I have your name, your email, your phone number and your father's address? And you think that, oh, he wants to marry me. Okay, here is my card. This is haram. Don't take yourself to that low level. Respect yourself. You're a Muslim girl. You are dignified. You have your honor and pride. Don't sell yourself cheap. Don't talk to anyone who comes and proposes to you. If he wants to know where you live, he will find. If he wants to know who you are, he will find it. But 99.9 percent, this is exactly like the elections in Arab world, always 99.9 percent, everybody is elected. 99.9 percent in your case, this man is playing with you. So don't ever respond or answer him. If you're sincere and you want to get married to this girl, you have to find a way to know her family and propose to her. Yes, this is your question. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it, inshallah, within the following two days or three days. And I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all."
