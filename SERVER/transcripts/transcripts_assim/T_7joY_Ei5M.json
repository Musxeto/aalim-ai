  "transcript": "says if I memorize through repetition is it permissible for me to read every night a specific Surah before going to bed among the other suras that we read such as Al mul and S or this would be an innovation I already memorize Al mul and S basically what she's asking is before going to bed she recites the prescribed suras that the prophet either recommended us to recite before going to bed or he used to do this himself now she is memorizing memorizing other suras for example she is memorizing Surah um Al Imran chapter 3 and it's a long Surah so her way or method of memorizing is by repetition she repeats the same Surah 10 20 50 times a day until it sticks in her heart and mind so she's saying can I do this before going to bed and the answer is yes isn't this an innovation the answer is no because you are not reciting this particular Surah thinking that it is related to going to bed's AAR you are reciting it so that you can uh confirm memorizing it by heart and you can do this before going to bed after waking up while on the treadmill while at work there's no problem in reciting it no how many times you wish without any problem inshallah"
