  "title": "Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem - The Unprescribed Holidays",
  "transcript": "[Music] we would like to welcome our dear brothers to the Islamic Education Foundation and Alami Branch we ask Allah subhana tala to bless you grant you peace and tranquility and to allow us to seek knowledge with pure intentions inshallah this is actually an honor that Allah allowed us to gather in this evening we ask Allah to make it a blessed even for the sake of gaining more Islamic [Music] knowledge with one of the most eloquent teachers in may Allah bless him and preserve him shim and this uh talk inshallah he will be uh discussing the unprescribed holidays in Islam uh because we noticed that this month Subhan Allah there are three different holidays that are unprescribed in Islam and you probably all know which ones I'm talking about and if you don't inshallah you'll hear the lecture so people need to be aware of the reality of what is permissible and what is impermissible and when we have um shakes uh and the teachers and instructors guiding us mentoring us teaching us uh with their different skills and abilities that way we will be able to share this knowledge inshah to the utmost once again and I pass the to [Music] Al the season is known as the holiday seasons nowadays and they have like black Fridays and discount uh uh season for people to go and buy presents and everybody's happy so many times I travel during these uh uh days abroad and when I don't have anything I scroll down the news channels and I see the countdown for the new years and everybody's happy in Tokyo and Sydney and Paris and New York and when I go to jida they don't have this it's boring why is this everybody around the world is Happy except us this is not fair so this is what usually goes around the minds of a lot of us and we have to first of all set the ground rules before we go and have a match we have to have ground rules before we have a debate before we have any kind of discussion the first rule is that we must know our religion because we claim to be Muslims as Muslims we have to submit our will to Allah so it's not what I like or dislike it is what the sh likes and dislikes it is what Allah loves or abhor that drives me so this is the most important ground rule that we should apply in all our our Affairs secondly if we look at the essence of Shar of the Quran and Sunnah we find that Allah orders us to choose the way other than the way of the Jews and the [Music] Christians so we ask Allah to guide us to the straight path other than the path of the Jews and the Christians as interpreted by the prophet are the Jews and the Christians and if you look into the Sunnah you will find this a lot and we don't have time to discuss this but as bullet points the prophet says pray in your sandals because the Jews do not pray in their sandals this of course I don't have to explain this and every single thing and I don't expect you in the time to go with your shoes to L mos in the first row behind the IM and having your shoes on people will beat the heck out of you this is not advisable so doing the has to be implemented with wisdom you don't say I want to do the Sunnah and go against the norm go against what the people think is acceptable yes if you're in an airport if you're in a park you don't have to take your shoes off show the people that you're praying with your shoes on but when there are carpets and we not sure of of the uh Purity and the cleanliness of your shoes no refrain from that the prophet goes on to say in so manys he always begin his address by saying go against the Jews the Christians and the fire worshippers as if this is part of the essence of our religion to go against their way so he says all of this is to grow your beat now this is the instruction of the prophet he says that also to hasten in breaking our fast and delay and postpone our pre-dawn meal because this is against the people of the book who do the other way around the prophet ordered usat not to imitate the kufar in the way they dress nor in their customs in the pleased with him and with his father he said the prophet whoever imitates a people he is one of them he is part of them now this ground rule is extremely important to know and learn but this has a different uh uh venue for it because it will take us away from our uh uh subject which is the unprescribed I I forgot the the the name of the lecture unprescribed or unper permissible uncried unprescribed okay uh celebrations so this will take us away from it if you know this then you understand why some of us May feel that this is Extreme Muslims are extreme they don't celebrate this they don't celebrate that they don't have a feast on this and they don't have a feast on that while other countries do while Muslim countries do while non-muslim countries do well as I said to be able to understand an issue you have to have ground rules you have to go back to the basics the third ground rule is the Hadith of the prophet that governs this issue quite well Malik says may Allah be pleased with him when the prophet came into Medina he found the people of Medina celebrating two days so he asked what are these two days that you're celebrating so the people said these are two days of pre-islamic era and the people play in them so they are jubilant they're happy they're joyful and they play in these two occasions two days the prophet did not look the other way he didn't ignore the issue he said no Allah has substituted you with two better days and now the issue of substitution means that one is gone and the other one fills in its place so from that day onwards none of the companions may Allah be pleased with them all had ever celebrated these two days and we don't even know their names or their nature to that extent that it is forgotten some Scholars say that one of the these days was the the celebration of the Persians the fire worshippers that continues still today and istan in in Persia and in other uh uh places but Allah knows best now when we talk about celebrations we are referring usually to and what is the Arabic linguistic meaning ofid is something that comes back often whether monthly or annually so it always it comes back again and again and it can refer to time and it can also refer to location as for time this is logical so when we have a date that people celebrate every year this is because it comes every single year on the same date as for the location this might strange to some but this is based on the Sunnah and the verdicts of the scholars may Allah have mercy on them all the prophet said and theth islim when a companion of his said oh prophet of Allah I vowed to slaughter a camel in bana buana is a village close to Medina I think it's so the prophet asked him two questions now the man wanted to sacrifice for the sake of Allah a camel is there anything wrong with that nothing he asked him two questions he said one is there any Idol that is worshiped other than Allah in that location the man said no so the prophet asked him a second question is there any for the mush the man did not specify a time a frame he only asked to slaughter in a place which means that the prophet is referring to the location is it often visited by the mush that it becomes regardless of the Time of the Season of the month and this is why the prophet said in an authentic Hadith you all know [Music] do not take my my grave as what do you mean prophet of do not often visit it like some people come to Medina five times a day they go to pray in the Masjid they go and visit the what are you doing I'm paying respect I'm offering salutation this not not permissible the permissible thing for a visitor or to Medina is to visit the grave at the first instance he sets foot in the like pleas with him used to do whenever he comes back from travel he begins by praying two in the Masid goes to the Grave gives salutation to the prophet and gives Salam to Abu Bakr and his father and that's it never goes back to the grave again this is the sunah now having said that the prophet told us that there are two days of in Islam and Scholars say that these two days are and and whatever falls under it what do you mean by whatever falls under it the prophet said in another Hadith and Hadith do not flash do not conflict they all come from the same Source from Allah and from the Prophet The Prophet said so the day of the nth the day of Eid the 10th the three days of 11 12th and the 13th are all days ofid so now we know that this falls under the same category and there is a weekly which is acknowledged by the Quran itself we have a whole chapter by its name this is the day that the Jews were misguided were sent astray and chose Saturdays and the Christians were also set astray and they chose Sunday and the Muslims were guided to itd so this is in a nutshell the meaning of linguistically and technically it is what for all or most nations of the world Muslims and non-muslims is something that is occasionally celebrated whether it's a happy occasion or it's a sad occasion so we have the fall of Nations they commemorate that day and we have the rising of a Nation or the sitting on the throne or whatever that they uh the day of independence they always commemorate that day and throw a party do something celebrated now the prophet alai wasam and this is part of the ground rules also warned us when he said that you shall follow the ways of the Nations before you even if they were to enter a lezard's hole you will follow them so this handpan or a uh an arms span whatever they call it um you shall do that so the companion said who are you referring to oh prophet of Allah the Jews and the Christians and the prophet who else definitely this is what I'm referring to now compare this Hadith to our times nowadays is there any resemblance are we following the kuf in every single thing they do definitely yes we following them in our customs We are following them even in their religions in some cases and we following them in everything we send our children from a very young age to wear their clothes to speak their language and to act like them our best time is spent in watching a movie or going to the theater as they say uh or listening to the music because this is civilization this is how we feel because we're weak we're humiliated we are underneath the surface people cannot see us anymore unless we try to be like them act like them then we get this so called um charismatic honor fi honor when we look like them or talk like them so let us go now to look into their festivals in Islam after setting these ground rules it's obvious that Islam has only three celebrations or three eids after Ramadan which is on the 10th of the last lunar month of the Islamic calendar and a weekly which is Friday the day of Friday now we find people saying that there is no restriction in celebrating other AIDS where did you bring the evidence from he said we look at the Hadith of the Prophet when he said Allah had substituted you now after he said that did the prophet am or his companions or the or anyone else celebrated any other than these two days on a yearly basis the answer is no now Allah says in the Quran talking about the Servants of of Allah and they are those who do not testify to falsehood and when they pass near ill speech they pass with dign now all the great Sal of the and of those who interpreted the Quran said that the Z the falsehood that they do not testify is attending the festivals of the disbelievers and the these festivals are part of the essence of the deed Allah says in the Quran to eat each of you we prescribed a law and a method the Jews have their laws and methods the Christians have laws and methods and so do the Muslims and they differ they cannot be intermingled or uh melted in a Melting Pot they have to have their own identity and this is what Islam preserves no matter where you look yeah if I see any of you in Siberia or in the jungles of Africa pick a better place in Paris in Rome if I see you I immediately recognize you as a Muslim why because you're th is above the ankles you are growing your beard and you look like a Muslim you act like a Muslim you behave like a Muslim so our identity is unlike any other's identity and that is why [Music] a great companion of the prophet and the son of a great companion may Allah be pleased with them both came to the prophet once and he was wearing two garments died in which is a yellowish reddish color and it is a plant that they dye their clothes in like zaffron but it has a distinctive reddish color to yellowish and no muslim wears this this is identified as the the clothes of the kuf Muslim the prophet when he saw this he said these are the dress code of the kufar do not wear them and in another narration the prophet was angered by this and he said did your mother order you to wear this when you speak to a a grownup man and you tell him did your mother tell you to do this what what does this imply you are reprimanding him so abdah ABD may Allah be pleased with him recognize his fault and he said oh prophet of Allah shall I wash them these are new clothes if I wash them the dye would go away the color would fade away and and then I will be wearing normal clothes this is logical the prophet is reprimanding him he said no you should burn them so this is a warning to the companion and to the old um of Islam not to resemble the kuf not to wear their clothes that no one shares it uh with them except them and I don't want people now posting questions and I see M the brothers are writing and uh yeah what's the ruling on wearing trousers and t-shirts sh should I take it off no don't be don't not here take it off elsewhere uh what should I do I wear suits I do this no no problem the majority of Muslims wear trousers and and shirts and Suits there's no problem in that what the problem is in in resembling what only the CAF wears so if a Muslim comes to me for example wearing a tuxedo Muslims don't wear taxed I go to Iraq I go to uh Syria I go to Egypt I go to Jordan This is not their normal way of wearing them this is cf's way or a white t or whatever they call it for certain kind of of if I go and one of the sisters comes back Mah and she wears a kimono kimono is wor worn by the non-muslims in Japan and this is a dress code of them if I see one I know that this is an UNM Muslim someone wears a Texan hat this is only for the CAF unlike the normal C that the youngsters wear or the soldiers where this is shared so there is a a thin line that we have to be careful when we uh look at it and the issue of celebrating a or having fun in uh the day of Eid this is in our religion but only on the Muslims Eid Abu Bakr be pleased with him once entered the home of the Prophet only to find a young girl playing with the doof two girls playing with the doof and singing so the prophet was there listening Abu Bakr tried to shut them up and the prophet said oh Abu Bakr leave them every nation has Aid and this is our Aid so this is permissible to listen to the D for the Muslims in the season of on the day of this is part of our religion now having said this ground rules that we know that we have only two eids every year and one Eid every week what about the eids we see nowadays Scholars say that aids are the V into two types religious and worldly so when you come to talk about religious festivals meaning that festivals that are related to your religion we find that there are such as the five days of day and three days of and the day of Friday and there are related to religion Islamic religion but they are not permissible uh to us or in a sense you can say that they go totally against Islam so we have Islamic eids religious we have non-islamic eids that are not religious not uh uh Islamic and go totally against Islam such as Christmas such as Easter what is Easter Christ up from the yes we they call it it is when they claim that Jesus Christ peace be upon him uh was resurrected after 3 days of his dying and being buried so they claim he was crucified he was killed he was buried then he was resurrected 3 days and this is the day that they celebrate the Easter so this is a religious Festival it is totally prohibited for Muslims it goes against Islam to believe in them and also the naus which is for the Persians there are religious festivals that are fabricated innovated and some claim to be part of Islam such [Music] as of the prophet because in Arabic can mean my birthday and yours so this is so is more term used in this event okay what else what is it in Arabic is it okay there is another sh but I don't know what they call it is what is it that oh okay then is the 27th of is and the 15th of Shan they call it Le something I don't know you guys have you know what I I mean huh and also there is the celebration of the Hijra the Muslim New Year so you find this everywhere happy New Year Islamic year ha happy New Year we know it's New Year what are you saying no no Islamic Hal yeah let's have a party five four three Let's Kiss what is this Islamic ald from all of this is nonsense this is not part of Islam we will come to that don't crush things give it some time so these things are they related in our religion no they are good celebrations what's wrong in it yeah why do you make I been to all Muslim countries and they all celebrate M except you wab you Sal you extremist in Saudi Arabia you don't love the Prophet this is one of the biggest problems we face that we go against our families we go against our communities by abiding by the Quran and Sunnah we love the prophet to the extent that people make fun out of us look at his th it is a maxi man somewhere down the line it will be a Min what is this sh look at his beard looks like a flying tree or look at his misw he's doing this he's doing that they're making fun out of us because we're abiding by the sunah of the prophet and then they accuse us of hating the prophet we're the only people who are promoting the of the Prophet so let us logic what they're saying they say that this is a good occasion and so many of them say that this is not related to religion so that they would not fall under Innovation said okay are you rewarded or not for doing this definitely rewarded so this is part of religion if I drive my car am I rewarded or not this is not religion if I wear my watch if I do this or that but if I throw a m what do you want one of my uncles may Allah have mercy on him he he died long ago and I used to ask him Uncle why do you go to the m he said this is a festival and we love our Prophet we we remember him and we do VI okay why do you do it only once a year not throughout the whole year not only that I said why at the end of the session here in Saudi Arabia I don't know about other countries the Imam or an says stories about the prophet's birth and after he reaches the place where the Prophet was born and he comes out of his mother's womb everybody stands up and they bring bottles of perfume and they chant welcome the light of my eyes welcome the grandfather of Hussein who's the grandfather of Hussein the prophet so they bring these perfume bottles and they start sprinkling perfume all over the place and everybody's standing up so I I said to him why is everybody standing up he said because the spirit of the Prophet came and now the spirit of the Prophet Alam is everywhere in that MJ okay Uncle why do you put food and water over there he said this food and water is healing to all sicknesses and illnesses because the spirit of the Prophet gave it bless [Music] and I said my uncle after all of this you say it's not part of religion what happens if I do not stand up I asked him this question he said if you don't stand up you will be paralyzed for life I had my second doubts second thoughts what what is this so you know from this that it is an inovation not only that did the prophet ever celebrate no did his companions no his followers follow followers no nobody celebrated the m so you love him more than them it's unacceptable is it part of the dean or not this is the $1 million question if they say yes then this is a contradiction to a chapter five where Allah says today I have perfected your religion and completed my favor upon you so is the dean complete at the time of was it complete at the time of the Prophet if yes then this is not part of the de if no then you have a problem they come and say they give you allegations they give you arguments they say okay the prophet used to fast every Monday and he justified this by saying that this is the day I was born in and the no doubt in that complete the he said it's a day I was born in and Allah revealed to me in it so there are two things Revelation being a messenger and he was born in it this is one point second Point had any of the companions who were born in Tuesday on a Tuesday or on a Friday ever fasted that day never I was born in whatever is it permissible for me to fast the day and say alhamdulillah like the prophet no this is an innovation thirdly the prophet fasted every Monday you want you love the prophet you fast every Monday and Thursday but he never ever paid any uh uh uh importance to the 12th of when is the 12th of and take this final piece of information 12th of by the consensus of all Muslims of Islam of Scholars of Islam the prophet died on the 12th of they all agree but they differ was he born on the 9th the 10th or the 12th so when you celebrate the 12 of RAB you're actually celebrating his death and this is not befitting of a real muslim okay so we spoke about the religious events whether Islamic goes against Islam or innovated such as the M the ETC now what about the worldly celebrations there are celebrations that do not relate to a corrupt a some something that is worldly like the national day for example like the week we have here the week of the team the week of uh the teacher the week of traffic the week of traffic we all know because we all put the seat belts and we are abide by standing at the cross uh uh the pedestrians lines Etc the problem is that these days Scholars differ some say that this is not related to religion and it's something to commemorate something that is worldly so it's okay other Scholars take a little bit harder line by saying that no this is something that is rotating and it is a so it falls under the category of that we do not have except two reads and this is more lovable and likable to me that we do not commemorate no national day no sitting on the throne no independence day no Day of the labors day of this day of that day of the father I think they have also but the father is not totally worthly Festival it's a little bit more inclined to religious because um honoring your father or even the Mother's Day honoring a mother would fall under the corrupt because it's related to a form of worship so we have the second category which is related to a corrupt a and we can have mother day as one of them Father's Day uh we can have what else Halloween Valentine Valentine Val where is Valentine soon is it two months 2 months 14th of February so Valentine this is a a corrupt Feast it's related to a priest who used to go against the government disobey them and marry the soldiers to their girlfriends and he was executed long time ago now we are celebrating it and mashallah all the youth and the youngst in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere they buy everything that is red so even those who don't drink uh uh these soft drinks they buy Red Bull for example because has a dread and Valentine they drink like five six cans of it and they die they buy pillows red pillows they buy anything and this is from your your Valentine and they sign postcards and what is this whoever imitates the people he's one of them you have Halloween you have um what is this Thanksgiving Thanksgiving is not a religious Festival because it was for the first migrants American migrants who came and they tried to cultivate the land and they failed a year or two or three and the fourth or fifth year they had their Harvest so they made this celebration and they're doing it till today so it's not per say a religious Festival but is it part of our culture is it part of our religion then definitely it falls under the category and there are feasts that are not related to a not related to religion and not related to elevated uh uh Feast but again they do not fall under the worldly permissible or the worldly uh acknowledged Feast such as birthdays so what's the ruling on celebrating my birthday or c celebrating anniversaries now uh this is also becoming a norm that people in their anniversaries give their spouses a bottle of perfume and then they abuse them the rest of the 359 days and this is normal uh but again in Islam is it part of our culture is it part of our religion then from what you have heard in a nutshell uh this yes s Patrick day Patrick day s Petri Patrick St Patrick day all he's a saint yeah if if he's a saint so whether he is St Valentine St Patrick St George St uh whoever it falls under their religion they dress green they whether they dress green whether they dress in any type of clothes again this is not part of Islam so we go back to the ground PS we have to have our identity we have to abide by our religion now we do not want to be aggressive and insult people no yeah for example yesterday I heard um on NPR uh one of the brothers in he's a professor of English of Arabic in an American University and he says as a Muslim every Christmas I celebrate it by fasting it why do you do this I just want to show the Christians the Americans that we also commemorate this day and we fasted as is this impermissible this is a so you are escaping one evil to another evil this is not permissible for Muslims to do now what is the ruling on uh congratulating them on these feasts so can I say happy Christmas happy New Year happy this happy that this is not permissible and the scholars say that congratulating them is not permissible why Christmas is the date in their opinion where the Son of God is was born they claim that the Son of God was born so when you congratulate say Merry Christmas what are you doing they accepting you're not accepting you are approving it yes I know you're right and he was born on that day have a blessed holidays so this is totally prohibited in Islam now one would ask Che I work in a company and every single I receive tons of mails from non-muslim uh colleagues who send me greetings happy Eid happy uh Ramadan happy this and happy that so what should I do when on their occasions I usually do the same happy New Year happy holid some some of them say I just say happy holidays this is not permissible say Islam tells us to greet the people like they have greeted us or better yes but they are greeting you on the true religion of Allah so if they say you say I witness that Isa is the Son of God what is this no they are congratulating you about your True Religion which Allah accepted and you don't have any doubt because if you have doubt that your religion is yeah they might be true I might know then you're not a Muslim one of the essence of being a Muslim is to be certain to have of your religion otherwise your sh of is in vain so when they congratulate us of our uh uh uh feasts and eids this is logical when their eids are due we cannot congratulate them what what would I do if someone says she Merry Christmas I would not reply and if I want to be cordial and not aggressive I say thank you or smile but no and to you as well and here is a bottle of rum enjoy that [Music] no this is unacceptable at all you have to have the dignity in your religion and uh uh to be proud of it and Allah knows best we hope you all have benefited and the FL is open for questions until we still have some time and even between the we could remain here and answer some questions as well in if the would like that so be with you all right so we have a microphone here if somebody would like to come up forward if you're not shy if you are shy you can stay in your seat just ask a question and sheim will be happy to answer your [Music] questions this is not pertaining the subject can I ask of the subject two questions yes see we have a here after yeah yes what what is the ruling the brother is asking on the ruling of what we know as in Arabic means condolence so the word is okay if someone dies and you go to their family and you give them their condolence expand his grave and fill it with with Paradise fragrance from Paradise Etc all of this is permissible the brother is not asking about this he's asking about the ruling on gathering for the 3 days that uh are post the death of a person where they have shares like you have now they have lights and you have people serving coffee tea uh and some uh families may bring a reciter to recite the Quran if they are a little bit she they put a recorder and they play a cassette so it depends on their social um status what's the ruling on this the most authentic opinion is that this kind of gathering is may Allah be pleased with him says that we that is the companion of the Prophet used to consider gathering for mourning gathering for condolences the morning of a decease and feeding the food part of wailing to wail for a woman you know when a woman uh uh is struck by uh the death of her husband thought husband she would be happy the death of of a Lov one a father for example she would start to whail and and you know tear her hair if she's not wearing a wig and maybe tear her clothes and and and slam her face all of this is waiting Haram this is from Jah from pre Islam uh uh uh major sin so with says that the companion used to consider gathering for the purpose of morning and feeding the people which we usually locals here do after so the people come you have my condol say stay stay we have food it is from the kitchen of so and so we have big RS and and they sit and they chat and they talk about real estate and they talk about elections and they talk about and they forgot the person who died this is Art of waiting tal so what to do sit in your home if someone comes in your home in your guest room knock your door yes accept them not between throughout the whole day says may Allah have mercy on Soul when my father died I left the the city all together I went to the Eastern Province so that I would avoid void this habit which goes against Islam No I don't ask you to do this sit home but don't spend money for G for paying for the uh uh the chairs and the lights and so on and and some of them even block the roads in front of the home so when you're driving you see may Allah curse those who did this this is part of the sunah not to curse of course the prophet Beware of the things that bring the two curses upon you what are they those who urinate or defecate in the road of people when they pass by or in the places of their shade so if there's a desert and there's a tree and you want to sit under the shade and you find that people have come and answered the call of nature what will you do may Allah curse whoever that did this because he has transgressed on one of your rights and likewise when you block the road you are trans transgressing on on one of my rights so this is th is it definitely it wasn't done on the prophet time nor the companion though they had the same grief and they had the same facility to open and the way I mentioned which is between and and the chairs and the lights and the coffee and tea maybe now they give free drinks I don't know all of this is definitely a format that falls under little bit sir um to the question um one of my colleague nonm Muslim colleague uh invites me for his wedding uh what should be my decision regarding for that should I give give or should it be or what attending the festivals of the kuar of disbelievers if attending a wedding in uh church or there is something related to the religion in their houses or in the Hotel this is totally prohibited and the ceremony itself is not permissible for a Muslim to attend even if it's your close uh relative not only a friend or colleague if it is done in the church or in the public uh civil court or whatever and now they're just throwing a party for for that uh non-muslim colleague it is permissible to attend because it's not religious however there shouldn't be anything Haram which I very very much doubt there shouldn't be any mixing between the genders only men and there shouldn't be any booze any liquor any uh Haram intoxicants there shouldn't be any Haram food served pork or whatever and this is very unlikely what is a wedding then this is a funeral not a wedding it has no booze it has no parting no music no Bachelor day this is a funeral so most likely it will not fall under the permissible category but hypothetically speaking if this is definitely no Haram in it there's no problem in going there giving him a gift with the intention of uh uh making his heart inclined towards Islam and softening his heart this is permissible however we should not take them as close allies yeah I should not hang with them 24/7 love them more than the Muslims no I have good relationships with non-muslims a lot of them I don't call them friends they're colleagues I give them all the hospitality I can I smile with them I joke with them but they're not my buddies I do this so that I can call them to Islam if I feel that they are rejecting Islam and not interested in Islam I'll go and look to for someone else so that that I can utilize my time and my [Music] efforts we have one question from the female section sister asks I am trying to convince somebody that birthdays are not permissible I have explained that since it wasn't celebrated by any of the sah it has to be wrong yet they asked for proof from or an A from the Quran please give me advice as to how to deal with this situation first of all uh um you can lead a horse to water but you can never make it drink right or not I can I can talk to you from here till F inah but I cannot convince you because guidance is in the hands of Allah he opens our hearts or seals them it's up to Allah subhanahu wa tala you have done your due diligence you have done your duty and you called them to uh uh what you think or believe is the right thing if they don't agree don't be more Roman than the Romans it is not for you to guide them Allah says to the prophet the guidance is on Allah's hands now they say they want proof proof over what like when we say to someone prove to me that praying 17 now between is prove it to me you think that the Prophet Alam kept on having a log book of everything that he will innovate and write it down this is illogical the prophet was given the concise of speech he was so eloquent two words you can write books explaining them he said whoever innovates in our religion what's not part of it is rejected so he says okay birthdays are not part of our religion hahaa it's like wearing a watch it's like wearing a pen it's like driving a car so why do you say that these are also not Innovations said yeah good remark celebrations of birthdays are they part are they part of the way of the Prophet did they did he do it the companion said no so okay the prophet said whoever imitates a people he's part of them so if you're not imitating the prophet you're imitating the westerners or the disbelievers or the Chinese or the the Americans then what are you doing you are part of them so this is a cultural thing maybe it's not related to religion but it's a cultural thing if even cultural things we're not permitted to imitate them as in thei I've mentioned earlier ofd of the two garments he was wearing the prophet ordered him to burn it rather than to wash it so this inshallah would answer the question if Allah were to open their hearts and guide them so there is a even SE who who have a custom they either do it regularly or occasionally they are shs and they wear black garment that's a good question the brother is asking about if there were to be a deviant sect or cult who uses or wears a certain uniform can I wear the same uniform if I did not have the ention to do it we have to look and analyze if when people look at you will say or NES what is Nies oh you don't read my posts in Facebook huh you don't what is NCIS non-islamic non-islamic state of Iraq and Syria why do we fall in their trap and say Islamic State this is if if I were to say I am President Obama with a little bit difference in color would anybody tomorrow say hey President Obama what's cooking nobody would say that why he's a liar we have who claimed to be a prophet nobody call him a or the prophet they say likewise if someone claims that they are the Islamic State of of Iraq and the lavant or of Syria why do we fall into their trap and whenever they do a terrorist attack they say it's the craftwork of Islamic State no we as Muslims as the people of the media as governments we should always call them NIS so when they do a terrorist attack who did this the non-islamic state oh Al Islam has nothing to do with it we call it in [Music] Arabic it's difficult but this is the least you can do to defend your religion so the brother again is talking about wearing the costumes if someone looks at him and says oh he's wearing the same costumes of those people I tell you don't wear it because then you are imitating them but if you wear something that everybody wears in including them then there's nothing wrong in that because they are the one who's imitating us not the other way around so I hope this answers your question you spoke of the separation of the holidays into two categories religious and non-religious okay a religious holiday they serve food is that food lawful and on a nonre they serve food that food also law very good question sh could you repeat the question for the females the question is in religious and non-religious festivals what happens if I were to be offered food from the participants so in in no problem definitely if someone gives you food this is Islamic festivals you definitely share it but for example in Christmas in duali huh is it duali in nus for example the Persian what's the ruling on accepting their gifts or giving them gifts now this is two separate big questions it's an issue of dispute the most authentic opinion is that when a non-muslim gives me on his celebration day on his Feast on a Christmas on a new year on the n r food if the food is halal meaning that it's has no meat in it why she segregate between meat and non meat ah meat they slaughter for their Festival so this is a dead meat for me I cannot eat that but if they give me candy if Diwali I think it has no meat because they're not their veg uh not them personally but they eat on well they can be I don't know anyhow so they give me vegetable uh uh to eat Etc the most authentic opinion is that it's permissible for me to accept and the evidence is Allah with them all was presented with a sort of sweet dish very beautiful and he ate from it whoa what is this the persons do it on their n on their Festival he said okay whenever you bring this food get it to me this is good and he did not find any hesitation in eating it on their day because this is not a celebration I'm not celebrating this is something that is coming to me now if it is har meat wise no this is not permissible for you to eat what about me giving them Scholars say that giving the non-muslims even an egg on their Fe is an act of kufur is an act of disbelief because this is part of approving their religion so those I know unfortunately you here in jeda in their homes they built a Christmas tree now and it's all lit and I've been in the past two weeks to Egypt and to the UAE and in the hotels there's a big tree with gifts and two statues of Santa Claus I didn't know which one to greet but I had to walk in Subhan Allah Muslim countries do this what is this what's what's remaining in our religion if we go this low so I hope this answers the question one more question from the females and then we'll wrap it up a sister asked events like Earth Day Earth Day in Kashmir also known as Kashmir Day celebrated in schools how to guide our children about these occasions actually this is part of the nonreligious days commemorating uh the Earth Day or environment day or the three week of the three Etc so I'm inclined not to celebrate such days but I understand those who celebrate it so if it is something in the school and it has nothing to do with religion and they commemorate the Earth Day or uh something that is related to the environment I believe that this is is okay but you explain it to them likewise they have the hijab day I think that comes every single year again if it's on a specific date I personally do not like this because it falls under the category of change it make it once in in February and once in January and so that it would not fall under the category of and knows best and we are looking forward inshallah to having you again with us we are quite honored and pleased that you have accepted this invitation to come give this presentation and we do thank the audience uh for attending this event and we also hope to see you again in the near future inshallah we ask Allah to allow you to benefit others of this stock and to continue to seek [Music] knowledge e"
