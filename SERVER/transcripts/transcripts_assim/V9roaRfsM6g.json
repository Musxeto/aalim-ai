  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] AC [Music] alhamdulillah a very important chapter in the books of f is the chapter that deals with menstrual bleeding and postnatal bleeding and this is one of the most sophisticated chapters due to the different opinions of Scholars and whenever there are so many conflicting opinions we ordered in the Quran to refer it back to the Quran to the Sunnah and take the default to the best of our ability so that we would make life easy for everyone so linguistically what is or mensis linguistically it is deriven from the word when the valley flows with flood water so mensis refers to flooding and flowing legislatively it is the flow of the blood that comes out or emerges from deep inside the uterus at certain times of the month when a woman is in good health and it is not connected to childbirth so that we would exempt it from postnatal bleeding now when does it begin usually and most likely Scholars say that females start to have their Menses when they are at 9 and not before that and it usually stays up to 50 and this is the norm maybe you'll find women after the age of 50 having their mensis but this is not the norm does it have a minimum Scholars say that the minimum of mensis is a day and a night does it have a maximum some say no it doesn't have a maximum others say well logically it has to have a maximum because the month you cannot have the majority of it menus rather you can have up to 15 days up to half of the month and the half has to be uh uh Purity and whatever is exceeding 15 days that would be considered to be and the majority the norm of mensis is five uh six or seven days now if the bleeding is for a couple of hours Scholars say that this is not mensis and it does not impact the life of a woman rather it is impure and it validates the woo but she can continue to live her normal life and such uh uh bleeding is considered to be an irregular bleeding so when a girl at a young age 9 10 11 years of age and she starts to see the blood for the first time Scholars say that if it has the same characteristics of the monthly cycle with his scamps and the color and the smell then it's considered to be or uh um mensis and if it increases or exceeds the 15 days period Then it becomes when do we consider a woman to have reached her Purity after the monthly cycle there are two signs the first sign is seeing the white threadlike discharge so the bleed in stops and when a woman wipes her private part on the toilet paper she sees a discharge that is white no brownish or yellowish colored discharge accompanying it this white thread like this charge is a sign of her Purity and this is what mother AA may Allah be pleased with her used to advise women who used to send her their pads confused are we Pure or not and she used to say don't hasten until you see the white thread like discharge and the second type of or sign of Purity is dryness so the bleeding stops after six or seven days and the woman wipes and nothing shows up it's she's clean as they say as a whistle here Scholars say she should insert a tampon without hurting herself lightly inside and if it comes out clean this is a sign of her Purity and she can uh perform and resume uh her life what is the ruling on color discharge whether yellowish or brownish this has two times to show or appear either at the time of Purity before the flow of the Blood starts or after the flow of the Blood starts so if a woman sees the brownish or yellowish discharge before the menes some Scholars say she should consider that to be her menus other Scholars say no we've concluded that menus is the flow of blood and if a woman is pure in her normal days and all of a sudden she sees color discharge if we tell her to stop to pray and fast and this and these discharges continue to three or four days and all of a sudden they stop and she's pure again this means that this period of time was wasted she didn't pray so those who told her to stop praying were wrong once the flow of the Blood starts this is when we tell her stop praying and fasting and being intimate with your spouse but before that this is considered to be just wash your private part change your soil underwear and and perform M whenever the time of prayer is due and there's no problem even if it continues to come out or to be emitted your prayer is valid because you've performed a woodo cleaned yourself after the aan now if these color discharges come after the flow of blood so the woman is in her mensis and the bleeding stops and she sees these colors colored discharges ah now these are considered to be part of her mensis because she did not see her Purity and the evidence of that is the of may Allah be pleased with her she said we did not consider the um colored discharges after the Purity to be impacting a woman uh uh Menses it's not part of her menes so after the Purity if a woman s sees her Purity and performs in a day or two she sees these color discharges says to disregard only to wash off and to to perform W and pray this has nothing to do with your mensis but if it's not after seeing your Purity if it is connected with your menses this means it is part of the Menses and Allah knows was [Music] [Music] best [Music] for"
