  "transcript": "so those people who conceal or hide the soul and not taught it what is the sin and what is a righteous deed is it is not major sin who conceals the soul first of all what you've stated is totally wrong you've stated that the soul can sense what is right and what is wrong and this is not true those who live in the west or in the east those who are disbelievers they have souls and their souls tell them wrong things all the time it tells them that pornography is okay watching movies and mixing and flirting with the opposite gender homosexuality is okay drinking wine is okay using usury and river is okay they're kafir they're disbelievers and if you talk to them they will sincerely try to convince you that this is fine so the soul cannot know or feel what is right and wrong generally speaking in the sense that yes all over the world killing another soul is prohibited and it's wrong we can feel it whether we're muslims or non-muslims everybody knows that transgression is haram is prohibited taking people's wealth unlawfully is prohibited these are general things that are by nature by default in our human nature we know but other things we can't and this is why allah had sent down to us his book al-quran and he sent to us his messenger the prophet muhammad to teach us to explain to us to guide us and to take us out from darkness into the light so it is wrong to depend on your intuition or on your feelings like the sufis do the super sufis say i don't need sharia i have my heart to dictate what's right and what's wrong and this is totally prohibited likewise the more tesla the deviant sect of al-murtazilah who say that good and bad is a logical thing and it's not it's only known through the sharia the quran and the sunnah you"
