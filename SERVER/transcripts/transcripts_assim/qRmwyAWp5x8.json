  "transcript": "says I keep having bad thoughts about Islam and Allah and I don't know why because of it I'm getting too disturbed I cry a lot I pray to Allah and that this should stop but they just keep coming I pray and do a lot of half-car but it just keeps on coming what is a solution why do we get these whispers because we are going on the right path to allah azza wajal the Jews the Christians the disbelievers they don't get these whispers and they make fun of us as was stated - even I pass may Allah be pleased with him they came to him his companions said the Jews and the Christians say that poor Muslims you have whispers and you have thoughts crossing your mind in prayer while we don't have such thoughts and whispers even as I said well this is true what would Shaitaan do what would the devil do with a corrupt heart if you're a thief would you go to a place with lots of jewelry and treasures in it or would you would you go to a peasant's house definitely you would go to the one with the jewels and the treasures the believers heart is filled with jewels and treasures and this is why it's being targeted by Shaitaan you're getting this because you are now at the fork of the road the more you get closer to Allah the more these whispers and thoughts would come and attack you which is a clear sign of Eman so you will keep on fighting it and struggling with it until you reach a threshold until you reach a level where it would not be any feasible to Shaitaan and only then he would say okay guys let's take a truce for a few months because now the more we increase in a whispers the more he increases in his robada and worshiping allah and this is not feasible anymore so are he you have no problem insha'allah"
