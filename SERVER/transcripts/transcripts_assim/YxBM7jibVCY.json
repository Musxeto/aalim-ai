  "transcript": "I would answer in every shirt thank you I'm sorry for him anything done wrong ask you anything wrong no probably she borrowed mine Thank You Abu Yussef he's a frequent callers a la hare and his first question is about those who raise their voices while praying now the Sunnah is for the Imam to raise his voice this is no problem in that because he is the one who's leading the prayer now the followers when they raise their voices if they raise their voices in an extent that annoys and disturbs those praying next to them this is not permissible however those praying next to that individual should be careful not to fall into the traps of Shaytan why sometimes it is truly annoying when someone next to you is reciting the fatiha in a loud voice now we both it's a silent tracker and he is trying to push away Shaitaan and the whispers of Satan by raising his voice so that he would not have any whispers but while doing this he's becoming my Shaitaan so next to me he is reciting what well lately either said this is how high he is and I'm trying to recycle who Allah who I hide and I'm making mistakes because I know the sewer he's reciting and he decides to get too loud this is acceptable for you to be annoyed and distracted but if the man is barely mumbling so he's saying you can hardly distinguish what he's saying yet do you feel distracted and annoyed there's something wrong with you because this is the norm that you make yourself listen to what you recite but in a very very undistinguished tone and way so that those around you would not be distracted you cannot just recite without having any noise at all because then you would fall under the influence of Shaitaan whispering to you distracting you you finish for records and I don't know what I recited seriously I was lost so we have to a little bit do this and we have a hadith when the Prophet are they saw that was salam in prayer after concluded a concluding it heard the man saying allahu Malik at Hammond Hammond and Cathy a non-playable Mubarak and fie the Prophet said who said this and the message I did and the Prophet told him about the virtues of saying it he did not tell him why did you raise your voice because it seems that his voice was not that high so this hadith shows that the Companions may have uttered and verbalize some of the things that we say silently but this was not the norm this was not as frequent as we hear nowadays from the people as Abu Yussef stated saying to her honorable of him in a loud voice where or in a bee-like voice where it is totally distracts you and makes you forget where you were and what you were saying"
