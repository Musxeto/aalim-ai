  "transcript": "[Music] the topic is the productive Muslim the productive woman and it's a big topic that has a lot of areas that can take a lot of time and we would like to make it as easy and concise as possible because there is a lot of negative stigma among the population when it comes to the role of women in society and in Islam it goes without saying that women women females are half of the society and they take care and upbring the other half so their role is very important and essential in Islam and that is why when we listen to the disbelievers to the non-muslims when they talk negatively about the role of women in the soci iety and how they are oppressed and how they are undermined whenever they want to do something sometimes without knowing it we tend to believe and this is related and due to our ignorance of the Quran and the Sunnah and no one doubts this no one says no I'm quite well versed in the Quran and Sunnah and I have the ability to distinguish between right and wrong unfortunately this is not the case and any simple test would prove that to you that we have a problem when it comes to knowledge about our own belief about our own religion a woman in Islam is either a mother a wife a daughter or a sister with all due respect to the aunts and I hope they don't get angry but they're included of [Applause] course so what does Islam tell us about mothers Allah asael tells us about the great role and the great suffering of mothers in the Quran and we recite this until the day of judgment also the prophet Alat wasam tells us to take care of our mothers a a companion came to the prophet Alat wasam and said oh prophet of Allah who's among my parents most worthy of my best companionship the prophet said Alam your mother so said the companion then who the prophet said your mother for the third time the companion said then who and the prophet said for the third time your mother and then your father so 75% of being kind respectful an obedient has to be devoted to your mother and so many times the sisters complain my mother-in-law does this my mother-in-law does that and she's an evil woman she's a witch she does uh uh uh black magic and she envies me and she gives me the evil eye she puts poison in my food and when I meet the Mother-in-law she's a sweetheart so why is this this is because because this woman does not realize that in 20 years time she will be a mother-in-law herself and what goes around comes around what goes up must come down so we have to take care of our mothers in Islam we have to take care as men of our wives and the prophet told us that the best of men are those best to their wives we have to take care of our children especially the daughters nowhere you will find in the Sunnah the prophet telling us to take care of our sons but when it comes to daughters Subhan Allah they are the mercy that Allah has given to each and every one of us daughters are the love of the life of the fathers and that is why they tend to spoil their daughters more than they spoil their sons the prophet Alat wasam as in the authentic Hadith may Allah be pleased with her said a woman with two daughters came to visit me and she wanted s she's poor now whenever I go through this Hadith and the Hadith was narrated by bukari which gives it the highest level of authenticity whenever I go through this Hadith I wonder the best of man kind is the prophet wasam and when we see the style the standard of living that he was living and we look at the tyrants and the Kings and the rulers and the filthy wealthy multi-billionaires one wonders but this is not something to wonder about because the prophet was given sallallahu alaihi wasallam the choice between dun being a prophet and a a servant of Allah or being a prophet and a king and he chose the firsta the Beloved wife of the Prophet Alat wasam if I had few wives like he did and I love this one definitely I'm going to give her the best that I have and the old women and yeah the other wives I give them something that would sustain their living but not as the favorite one not the Prophet The Prophet was the most just and fair person to have ever walked eartham she says oh prophet of Allah a woman came to me with two daughters of hers asking for sodak I looked around and I could only find one piece of date Subhan Allah one date no muffins no bet Crocker cake nothing only one piece of date so I gave it to her she favored her over herself what kind of a house is this where you don't have food if I open the drawer in my office I'd find sneak sneakers and and and and bounties and Mars and and this is only before breakfast the prophet's house a moon following a moon following another Moon meaning two months and no fire would be lit in all of the prophet's houses one would say huh they had microwaves no they could they did not cook for two consecutive months imagine Zu the nephew OFA may Allah be pleased with her asked mother what did you feed on she said nothing except water and dates for two consecutive months in the W in the houses of the best of Allah's Creation The Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam she gave that woman this piece of date she broke it into two halves and she gave her daughter one and the other one gave it to her second daughter so AA was wondering about this Mercy she didn't eat it herself and she favored her children with it so the prophet saidat wasam whoever is blessed and tested so it's not a blessing only it's a test as well with two of these females two of these girls and he's kind to them Allah would make them his shield from Hellfire to two daughters who does who has daughters among you okay 1 3 4 5 mallah I have 13 with the grace of Allah no males I have only 13 girls with the grace of Allah I think I'm growing a uterus because of being with so many females in my life they are Mercy by Allah if you take care of them if you bring them up as Allah loves if you teach them the Quran I think eight of them I L count eight of them memorize the Quran by heart with the grace of Allah not of me not because of me I don't know anything about them it's their mothers who take care of them and who mashallah uh uh make them who they are and that is why we put a lot of emphasis and we stress on the role of a woman in the society me as a husband as a man I don't know anything about my daughters except the half an hour a day that they sit with me ask me questions ask for consultations if we eat together we talk other than that we are men this is not our job it is our job but we are irresponsible when it comes to our families that's why we put a great toll and responsibility among our wives our mothers our sisters to take care and once a woman knows her responsibilities she takes the burden of what a 100 man cannot take now we can go on like this forever and what you what you will hear is nothing new it's just a reminder it's just an eyeopener sometimes we seem and tend to neglect what's right in front of us few years back I had a very luxurious and uh uh expensive office in a highriser and I had one of the best views in jeda overseeing the corish the the Sea and the ships and it's it was a very beautiful office with lots of Windows and I used to enjoy whenever some guests come to the office for the first time just to look at their expressions and smile and after like 7 10 seconds they look at me and find me smiling said why are you smiling I said I smile because of this dun the scene I see it every single day it doesn't move a thing in me anymore it did the first couple of weeks but now I'm used to it and now because it's the first time you see it you see it as a favor it's a blessing a for me because I'm I'm seeing it every day I'm not that interested to be grateful and thankful for this favor and blessing of Allah and everything we have in our hands is like this because it's in our grasp we don't see it hence we're not grateful in Arabic we say that health is a crown on the heads of the healthy one that only the sick people can see now we're healthy we don't see that as a blessing we take this for granted but if you visit a hospital then you look at in the eyes of the patients and they would see that crown and envy you for that now in order to be productive as a sister sister as a woman as a a girl as a daughter as a wife as a mother you have to know few ground rules first of all a woman is a and no one doubts this the prophet saidat I have not left behind me a FNA or a temptation worse on men than women so the worst temptation to men is women and why is that because Allah had built it uh uh uh built it in us men are attracted to women like metal is attracted to magnet this is human nature so some of the sisters would say Okay likewise women are attracted to men like Metalist to magnet and the answer is definitely not no way and if you bring 100 women and 100 men of course segre segregated and then in the 100 men you put a beautiful woman in a a super model Fox whoever just put her in the middle what will happen to the heads of the men 99% their heads would roll like a toy their eyes are everywhere but if you bring a 100 women and put the most handsome man on Earth Let It Be Tom Cruz or whatever maybe five or 10 of them would look and the rest rubbish he's too short this is human nature so the prophet is warning us be careful women and men must be segregated no matter how righteous you are no matter how Pious you are no matter how God-fearing you are this is human nature it's Fuel and fire put together you have ignition and that is why we understand why Allah made it mandatory upon women to wear the hijab but not the men because women can look at men without any problem may Allah be pleased with her of course women are instructed to lower their gaze but their lowering their gaze is lesser in degree than the lowering of the Gaze of men so men whenever they see a woman they have to look down or up but women they have the permission to look as long as there is no temptation on them so a lot of the sisters say sheh what's the ruling on women watching TV and seeing a lecture or looking at the shikh or news uh uh programs Etc say it's okay as long as there's no temptation as long as the sister is not staring at the man and and enjoying how beautiful or handsome he is and the evidence is may Allah be pleased with her in the prophet when the abans used to come and play with their Spears as form of training for war in the Masjid he would open the door and sit down for her to put her chin on his shoulder and watch them play so it was like giving her time to enjoy seeing them fight and play even if it was Haram he would have told her you should not look close the door he facilitated that to her and the funny thing is he used to ask her had you have enough had you had enough and she said no prophet of Allah why because the rest of the wives of the Prophet were looking and she wanted to look eat your heart out look what the prophet is doing for me of course it was the day of the prophet in her house otherwise he would have done the same to the other wives of his s wasam so it is important for a sister to abide by the hijab because this is means of protection to her and to the society and to the men at uh at large now hijab is not something that prevents a woman from being productive and this we hear it a lot and so often from non-practicing sisters so and this is true it's preventing her from being productive in her evil ways so a billy dancer would say hijab handers my work it's true it handles everything in your life because you're not committed to Islam but a proper muslima is not handed by her attire Islamic attire because this is for her protection unless she wants to be involved in something that is against Islam against the Quran and the Sunnah in this case yes it would prevent her from doing that and hijab is not only physical a lot of the sisters may wear the hijab May wear the and the clothes are loose and mashallah you can't see anything from her but you can hear her laughter miles away you could hear the way she speaks without any bashfulness without any shyness with men cracking jokes with naham laughing and and Subhan Allah this is against the mental hijab there is a physical hijab and there is a hijab that must be adhere to before that and that is leaving whatever is inappropriate for a sister to do with Anam so cracking jokes laughing talking softly Allah tells the wives of the Prophet not to soften their voices and some of the sisters give me a call on on the phone mobile asking question and I start melting and my wife is saying you're talking to a woman say she's asking she's asking questions this is Haram what are you doing one of the sisters called me on ask Huda live my wives were watching so I I I learned through the hard way later on and she said alaykum I love you for the sake of Allah and I told her on on live TV sister this is inappropriate to tell a man that you love him for the sake of Allah what kind of love is this and she said no the prophet said if you love someone you should tell him yes the same gender not the opposite gender the prophet said you're smiling in the face of your brother is a a charity so now you go out in the market whenever you see a beautiful woman you give her a big smile one charity this is inappropriate even returning the Salam the scholars the majority say you should not so if a man comes and says assalam alaykum to a sister she should not reply because this is means of FNA and likewise if she goes into a shop and she sees a man sayam alaykum how much is this no this is inappropriate as IM Malik IM Ahmad they say so there is a hijab that is physical we have no problem with that but what is most important is to have the hijab that is me uh uh meant and something that you do not feel and touch but you know that is there so this is one of the uh ground rules to be productive to abide by the hijab now one of the most important thing for you to know to become productive is the destructive role of the media and no one in his sound mind would doubt that the negative and destructive role of the media one would say she we have Huda TV we have peace TV and they are doing a wonderful and constructive role they're producing excellent material it said Allah mentioned inak chapter 2 they ask you oh Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam about intoxicant and gambling say there is a great deal of burden and some benefits yet the burden overweighs the benefits and that is it so okay it's you don't have to ask because Allah gave you the rule the the equation how to weigh if something is exceeds the benefits then it's Haram if the benefit exceed the uh uh disadvantages then it becomes Halal and when you look at the media nowadays the bulk of the media is beneficial or harmful it's harmful no one doubts that and the funny thing is most of the harmful things are supported and sponsored by Saudi money and this is a big the biggest chain when we have the two holy mosques and we care for them yet the majority of the temptation of corruption comes from NBC group uh NBC 2 NBC 3 NBC 4 drama Bollywood and the funny thing they have it even in Persian yeah okay you Saudis what do you want in Persia why do you translate your programs into Persian the answer because the Americans pay for all of this and that's why they're getting the movies free so that they can brainwash so that they can change the culture so that you feel that English is the best thing in life the American way of living the American dream and then where is Islam Islam is few raas at the end of the day fasting maybe a month maybe half of it depending on the environment and the weather and that is it this is Islam no this is not Islam this is American Islam but not this the proper Islam so we have the destructive role of media which every productive muslima must be aware of so that they would not be fooled if I watch television if I watch the movies if I watch the media in general I will tell you for sure that the muslima who wears the hijab is always portrayed as a  with special needs and cannot construct a full sentence while the woman flashing her beauty wearing her makeup what's this it's okay uh wearing her makeup and mixing with the opposite sex and being a free girl ah this is a sophisticated woman this is the woman that I'd like to be and if you watch any of the advertisements on TV channels how how a woman eats uh Galaxy chocolate bar what is this what are you do this galaxy I ate so many bars trying to have the sensation it wouldn't come so it shows you what they want of a woman of a Muslim woman and how they try to destroy the image the media makes up virtual fights so it's now inside of every one of us that men are fighting with women and we have women rights and we have women calling for equality and we have women wanting this or that and the end product of all of this is the end product of this fight is the production of another man so it's not man versus woman now it's going to be man versus another man because what they want is not a female they do not want a Woman They want another man to compete with the other uh uh man men and it is in my opinion wrong but let me ask do we have equality between the genders in Islam does Islam promote equality between man and woman yes raise your hands please very good no raise your hands please 2 3 4 5 6 only seven there is no such thing as equality in Islam between man and woman and never ever you will find this word in the Quran or in the Sunnah on the contrary the Quran states that a woman is not like a man when maram when mariam's mother pledged that whatever I have conceived I will devote it to Allah and Allah's worshiping and when she gave birth to maram what did she say I have given birth to a female and a female is unlike a male so this is a fact that was written down in the Quran so there is no equality but there is fairness and Justice and when I see these people in the west saying we want equality for the women you Muslim oppressed women we disbelievers men we don't oppress women we ask for equality I say you want equality go and conceive for 9 months and give birth to a child and then come back there's no equality man cannot do the things that women do and women cannot do the things that men do because Allah created them differently but assigned to each one certain tasks and certain responsibilities A Woman's Place is in her house this is the natural place now a lot of the sisters would get you know their horns coming up what are you saying and looking at each other is this a she talking about productive woman he wants her to sit in the home what is this didn't you bring someone is he just coming from the tent he's coming from the desert where is he living in in the in the stone ages he wants a woman to sit in uh her house well this is what Allah said in the Quran Allah says stay in your houses and this was addressed to whom to the best ever female generation to the wives of the Prophet to the mothers of the Believers so the best thing that a woman can do is to stay home and this is not an easy task most of us men would love to take this opportunity and this job every day when I wake up for work at 6:30 or I want to go to pray in the Masjid I I look at my wife and say of course after oh I love you and I say I wish I was in your shoes going to work having to smile to your boss and to your subordinates and to everyone you see driving in the streets of course you here in in bahin you drive we don't drive alham alham imagine if Saudi women drove how would things be we get Saudi men coming here in Bahrain and they're making accidents because they're looking left and right imagine what would happen in Saudi Arabia so we tolerate the abuse you hear at least have rules whoever is inside the round about has the right of way in Saudi Arabia it's not like that it depends on the size of your car I drive a big truck GMC so it's always my right regardless if I'm in the roundabout or outside of the roundabout um whatever I'm doing it's my right and you have to stop I have a lot of pressure I have a lot of things to do and my wife is sitting home relaxed wah she's not relaxed she's doing as much as I'm doing with the children with the cleaning with the cooking with bearing to be between four walls and the media is bombarding her with what are you doing with your life you're almost this old or or you have so many years on you and you're not enjoying life soon you're going to die why don't you go out why don't you live your life do it and they give you women on the media empowering women a woman that was in her house and all of a sudden she read an article and she decided to travel to the Far East and go to these countries alone and go on a road trip and hitchhike and she's a Saudi what is this she said I just heard a voice and I had to answer it Subhan Allah the voice of reason the voice of an angel or the voice of Satan himself coming in congratulating you and giving you a certificate of graduation so a woman in her house is far greater than any other woman one would say Sheikh I studied 5 years of engineering now I work in a factory on an assembly line and I design things and I make instruments and equipment I said ballah thousand pieces of devices and equipment that you do would not come close to a generation this sister who's in her house is producing when I see the type of human beings she managed with the grace of Allah to give to the society productive committed practicing to practicing Islam properly with the highest levels of Ethics well no matter what a thousand women do outside the house it cannot be compared to what this woman is doing in her house though no one knows who she is or what she had done yet history recalls and history knows what she had done now in Quran Islam tells us that a woman is not equal to a man the wife of aliz of Egypt when she seduced yfat and he ran away from her and she tore his shirt from behind and there the door was opened who did they see the husband of the woman what did Islam describe this husband they met her master so Islam considers a husband the master of a woman which means that there is a difference they're not equal Allah says so men have a level or a grade over the level of women this does not reduce their reward in Paradise no women and men whatever they do of righteous Deeds they get the full AER not only that a woman by praying in her house gets more AER than if she prayed in Mecca 100,000 times or in Medina a thousand times because this is what Islam recommended her to do to pray home not to pray in the Masjid and if she does this out of conviction Allah would reward her more than that sisters call me sheh if I pray fer in my home and I remain where I've prayed until the sun rises and I pray two ra would I get the reward of and Haj per perfect perfect perfect as in the Hadith and I say no the prophet Alam said that whoever prays F in J meaning in the Masid he will get this a and perfect perfect perfect every single day but if you have this desire to get this reward and you know that you can go to the Masjid and pray F and remain there and get the reward yet yet you refuse to go to the Masjid because you want to get the reward of obeying the prophet and praying home you will get the reward of the OM and the ha by simply sitting home and praying F and going to sleep you don't have to sit and because you've done this out of conviction and out of following the prophets instruction therefore a woman is like a man in the term terms of reward when it comes to forms of worship but in this dun there has to be a difference you have to have one captain of a ship if you had two captains this one would say go east and the other one says go west and the ship would sink that is why the family has to be run by one and that is the father of course the Holy Ghost and the son have nothing to do with this no the father is the father of the family what I meant and then the house has to be run by the husband and that is why you would never find in Islam a woman being a ruler of a country or a judge over a court or an Imam of a Masid except in America in America there is a Masjid where the Imam is a female and the congregation are mixed men and women praying side by side I saw this on a video on YouTube and it was so funny IM lead a woman leading prayer how would she make and the men behind her what what do we do sub subh and the funny thing is another American IM and we have excellent Islam coming to us from America when they don't abide by the Quran and Sunnah she says she an IM she's reading congregation and they're having this recorded ald praise be to Allah the lord of the Dominion she's translate instant translation in the Salah the most merciful the most beneficial this what kind of Salah is this she's a woman Leading Men and doing instant translation is this Islam the Allah this is not Islam so we have to have this level and this is part of you being productive you have to know that the man's word is important in your life because Allah hasel made it this way either it's your father's word you have to obey him or your husband's word and you have to obey him nevertheless the role of woman is not just being yes sir whatever you say Sir she can be a great advisor to her husband or to her father um Sal may Allah be pleased with her the wise woman the wife of the Prophet Alat when her husband died she said we belong to Allah and to him we shall return because the prophet said whoever is struck by a Calamity and he says oh Allah reward me in my Calamity and substitute me with something better than that the prophet says whoever says this when a Calamity strikes Allah will give him something that is better Abu Sal may Allah be pleased with him was one of the first to migrate to Medina and he was the brother of the Prophet Alam through suckling so through breastfeeding he was the brother of the prophet and their third brother is hamd the uncle of the prophet Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam they're all Brothers through suckling when he died um Sal immediately said this invocation this Dua thought to herself who could be better than Abu Sal what am I doing but she believed she followed and after her was over the prophet sent to marry her she refused what yes she refused the prophet did not take no for an answer he says why so she sent to him saying oh prophet of Allah I'm an old woman and I have a lot of children and I'm jealous so the prophet sent back to her as for the age I'm older than you as for the children they're in my custody they're my children as for your jealousy I will ask Allah Asel to take it away from from you and she married him now we know that this is beside the point huh but I'm trying to stall for time I don't have any good material to give you so I'm just making it storytelling we know that the wives of the Prophet Alam were two parties the first party led by AA may Allah be pleased with her with ha and the remaining and the second party was led by Zab bin J who is the cousin of the Prophet Alam and the previous wife of his adopted son Z before Allah abolished adoption in Islam and whenever they had a fight between them the prophet was smart he would stay away from that and this is a very good advice to anyone who's married for for with more than two never put yourself in between because one is equipped with high heels and the other one is with the do stick and you'll end up having blows to your head so stay away so whenever they had a fight they would always call um Sal why because Allah took away from her jealousy so she was not blinded by it she could see things clearly so she would say which is right and which is wrong between the wives of the Prophet wasallam so let's go back to um Sal um Sal was the adviser of the prophet in when the prophet signed a treaty sallallahu alaihi wasallam with the pagans of Mecca because they prevented him from going to om when the prophet signed it among the conditions and terms that he should go back to Medina he should not do this year but they came in so this was a problem when you assume you cannot take it off until until you fulfill your ritual whether ha or om a lot of the brothers or sisters make they go to meca oh I didn't think that it was that crowdy oh okay I'm not in anymore no you can't do that you are in the state ofam until you finish your ritual or you're blocked by something that may not allow you to finish it as in the case of the Prophet Alam so what to do Allah tells you shave your head and Slaughter your sheep or your sacrifice so the prophet came addressed the Muslims 400 plus you have to shave your heads now and Slaughter your sheep no one answered he said it twice and three times and no one did what the prophet said why not because they're disobedient they're still hopeful and Wishful that something will happen and they will enter mecah to fulfill their commitment and to do their om so the prophet went into his tent angry and he said didn't you see what your people are doing outside I order them and they do not obey me what did this wise woman say she said oh prophet of Allah go outside and call the barber to shave your head and look what they see what they do so the prophet took her advice and he did what she asked him to do immediately once the companions saw the prophet's head being shaved they started shaving one another until they almost killed each other with the razor blades because they wanted to be uh Hasty in uh uh following the prophet's example sallallahu alaihi wasallam so saying that a man has a level extra to a woman this is not from me it's from the Quran and Sunnah and as a Believer you have to have it inside of you you have to submit you have to be convinced it has to be your belief and conviction yes that man has a level over me now this doesn't mean that you become a slave this doesn't mean that you become oppressed and you don't have your say no you have your god-given rights but usually people would ask if all of these constraints are over a woman how do you expect her to be productive is this a l iCal question sisters is it can a woman be productive under these circumstances the answer is yes and very productive and I would say and I'll tell you how a woman is either married or single and by single we mean unmarried widowed divorced whatever so if a woman is single how can she be productive the sky is the limit as long as she's abiding by the hijab and following the Quran and the Sunnah she has no problem none whatsoever of being productive first of all she has to be productive to her parents obedient and respectful to her mother and father and once a parent is mentally and physically relaxed he can produce or she can produce so when when you have such a daughter in your house you feel relaxed in my house if I I'm sitting on the couch and I do this immediately one of my daughters the the obedient one would go and fetch me water because she knew that I was looking for a bottle of water or for something and when she brings it to me W I have the whole world in my hand what more can I ask for having such a beautiful girl supplicating at night when she's doing night prayer alhamdulillah asking for forgiveness for her father what more can I want from this life so she can be productive with her parents she can be productive with her CH with her siblings I know tens of examples of girls who started wearing the hijab and practicing and had a wonderful impact over her brothers and sisters transforming the whole family I know of a a girl that transformed the whole family her parents her siblings her uncles her aunts over the duration of 12 to 15 years but eventually everyone started practicing because of this Beacon of light in the midst of the darkness and this is from Allah now this girl is blessed and Allah tells us about Isa peace be upon him when his mother Mary came and he was few hours of age or few days and they said what are you doing Mariam who is this where did you bring it from we know that your parents are good your your mother is is righteous she's not a a prostitute and she pointed at him and Allah made him speak in his infancy by saying that I am the save of Allah and Allah made me blessed wherever I am so a single girl a single woman can be productive by being blessed wherever she is if he if she goes to the market she's blessed by the way she looks and everyone looks at her and wishes that his wife is like this his daughter is like this or she was like that if she goes to college then her student student female students would also learn from her if she goes to family gatherings all what comes out from her mouth are Pearls of guidance and people would learn from her so she's blessed wherever she is now compare this to someone who does not abide by the hijab like a lot of the Saudi women I don't know about bahin I don't uh go out a lot a Saudi women Mah they wear the and they're hair is flashing from in front and from the back what are you wearing you look at the sister's face she's not wearing the hijab and the eyebrows are mashallah Precision been plucked and drawn and nicely bleached mashallah super model and you put you have the eyeliners you have the mascara and you have the foundation the base and then you have the makeup and then you have the lipstick sticks and drone and I know this because I have 13 girls so is this blessed wherever she is or cursed wherever she goes compare this one who says the prophet says so and so and so and between this and say did you see the last video clip of Nancy aam wow she was wearing a beautiful dress Mah I didn't see it I'm going to see it now so compare Apple to Apple are you blessed if you are then you will have your impact on all those who are around you and Allah loves you and that is why he blessed you if you're not then know that Allah does not love you and that is why he did not make you among the guided ones verse 46 chapter 9ahba Allah is talking about the Hypocrites and he says had Allah wanted them to go out with you Muhammad s Al wasallam to tabuk for the expedition of tabuk on the ninth year of Hijra when it was hot and summer had Allah wanted them to march with you Allah would have supported them but because they lagged behind Allah did not make them go out and he said to them stay with those who lacked behind so whenever you see Allah is facilitating things for you Allah is making it easy for you to attend lectures Allah is making it easy for you to fast Mondays and Thursdays Allah is making it easy for you to pray night prayer or to give s or to have uh a relief work to the people in Jordan and turkey without doing any Haram and things are happening know that Allah loves you and if you feel and see that things that make Allah angry are happening to you and they're coming easy without you asking you're seeing DVDs of movies music mixing Haram relationships it's very easy and you're falling into it know that allaha does not love you a woman who's single can be productive it means that I as a cannot so I cannot go to the market and see women flashing their beauty and say sister this is Haram you have to cover this is not for me as a man and it's inappropriate and I may get a bad response it is you who should do this when someone in CNN or BBC comes and say that women in Islam are oppressed I can make a whole lecture like this tens of them but still I'm a man claiming that we're not oppressing women but when it comes from you and standing up for your rights in Islam and saying no we're not oppressed this hijab I'm wearing it's by my own choice and this is what I always tell my daughters I tell them that are you wearing the hijab my daughter's cover alhamdulillah are you doing this for me or or because you're convinced alhamdulillah I always get the response by Allah if they give us the wealth of the earth we will not take off the or the hijab one or two bad apples would say it depends if we travel if we do this but alhamdulillah the majority of them they're committed by their their own uh uh will so you should stand up and defend Islam by being a female and saying what you believe you can do as a single mother or s that is a single uh uh woman a lot in relief work in Daw work you can write if you have the intellect and the power to write articles and participate in the media by your writings and by uh uh uh voicing your conviction over the people the sky is a limit providing you are abiding by the Quran and Sunnah and not going one inch out of that if you're married then it's another ball game as they say your priority is your husband and that is why the role of a woman who's married in being productive as a priority comes her husband children and house yes she but I can help in building a rocket to NASA I can dig oil wells I can do no no no no all of this does not car any weight in Islam Allah tells you to stay in your home and you will be rewarded in the highest levels of Jenna to the extent that if you look at the women of Jenna you will find that four of them are the Elite in the top of all females who are they Asia ban who's Asia Pharaoh's Pharaoh's wife Subhan Allah and then you have maram and then you have Khadijah and her daughter Fatima now Khadijah we don't have a lot to know about do we but what what what work did she do to Islam and to humanity to take such a high position in Paradise nothing to our belief maybe two or three hads when the prophet came from he was frightened she comforted him and believed in him okay a lot of the women would have done this not in Saudi anyhow now this is beside the point uh what else she comforted the prophet Alat wasam to an extent that she deserved the highest level in Paradise how the prophet was sitting once with Khadijah sallallahu alaihi wasallam and he said Khadijah this is jiel coming and he greets you with the greeting of Islam and he says to me give khad the Glad Tiding of a castle or a palace in Jenna made of pearl it's a one Pearl that has no tired some you would not be tired she would not be tired in it nor she would hear any loud noise now Scholars commented and said yeah okay to have a palace in Paradise is great but maybe if the description was where she would have hundreds of cars thousands of maids tons of gold and silver would be more appropriate scholar said no the thing that she gave to the prophet Alat she's rewarded accordingly in Paradise whenever the prophet was in his home not a single child voice would sound and she tried her level best to keep the noise down not only that out of experience not from my wives maybe from my wives but not generally out of experience of phone calls and problem solving and marital uh Affairs women nag like crazy when they speak they do not stop I I know this for a fact and sisters call me complaining my husband does this my husband does that and she speaks for 17 once few days ago I timed it 17 minutes she's say and and I the good thing is I use uh um a Bluetooth uh headset so I can type I can eat I can go here and there and speak with sign language my kids and she's talking and talking and talking and then she finished so she said what should I do she I said I can't comp I cannot comment because I have to hear what he says this is the norm because you say every bad thing you know and you conceal the bad things in you she said no I don't do anything I'm like exactly what you have heard I said listen and I spoke for 2 and 1/2 minutes I spoke for 2 and A2 minutes I said you if I call him he might say that she she's nagging all the time and she's always in questioning me and interrogating me why did you do this why did you do that why do you do this to your mother why do you do this so and so why don't you bring me this and why do"
