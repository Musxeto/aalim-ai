  "transcript": "Venus says can I start the business of replic products by selling for cheap but letting people know that it is not the original item when you sell or buy a replica there are two rights here the right of the consumer he has to know that this is not an original I'm not paying this much for a counterfeit rather I'm paying it for an original so you have to tell them that no this is not an original and this is a counterfeit it's a replica and then there is the right of the owner of the brand the copyright if I have a company with a brand that I've invested so much and produced this item after being designed and tested etc and then all of a sudden you come and copy that and put my logo my name on your replica and sell it for tenth of the price you are depriving me from my rights it is like you're stealing off me and this is totally Haram and prohibited even if that person or that company is a Kaffir company Allah does not allow you to transgress and take what is not yours simply because he's a character otherwise we would have been rich by now we have pledges we have commitments we have deals and contracts treaties with others that compel us not to transgress like this and therefore even if the customer knows that this is not an orange an original this does not give you the right to sell it because the owner of that brand does not approve of it and hence selling it would be Haram and the money you make out of it is Haram fake items are used only by fake people if you allow yourself to wear a daytonarolex which is fake and you show off and you're happy going out boasting with it on your wrist you're a fake person if you cannot afford the original don't pretend you can fool the whole world but would you be able to look in the mirror at yourself wearing such a fake thing and be happy of it selling it is totally prohibited and a larger knows best"
