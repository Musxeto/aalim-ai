  "transcript": "assalamu alaikum and welcome back to with the Prophet I'm Ali Coleman of your host and we are joined by from Saudi Arabia Sheikh Azam Allah Hakeem our subject is about the application of Islam into our lives looking at Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him and how he interacted with the people around him in his time as an example for us to follow for all times we're honored to have you continue with us sheikh enough here for being with us Aslam o alaikum and welcome Saddam Lovewell Academy and it's a pleasure being here yes very knowledgeable person to discuss important topic and we're going to continue in a first episode we had talked about the example of the wives we had you know kind of marched through in cursory form looking at the strategic aim the purpose the benefit of the choices that the Prophet made in the selection of his wives and the and the larger impact it had in the society and the lives of the people around him we'll continue looking at his conduct and in home with his wives and asked the question about what was his conduct like did he practice what he preached Mahna Mahna rahim at home didn't I have a banana me know so along with Salaam Baalak idea well so I mean nabina muhammad in wada and he was happy he remained as to answer your question did he practice what he preached and the answer is definitely yes and if you study the biography of the Prophet RA salat wa sallam you will be mesmerised you'll be astonished by the blessing of allah azza wajal in his time see you can be don't one mm-hmm valentino someone who gives all of his time and love and affection to his wife but you will have to compromise when it comes to your business when it comes to your health when it comes to your social relationships the balance that was in the prophets lives life at a sato-san is unimaginable it is out of this world why the Prophet had nine wives okay yet he was able to be fair with all of them though within the twenty-four hours span and at the same time be the Imam of the Muslim Ummah teaching them receiving revelations from allah azza wajal judging their affairs and at the same time leading Wars and battles against the enemies of Islam and at the same time be a laws servant in praying night prayer fasting all day long giving charity and mingling with his companions with his friends attending their a PR their weddings consoling them how can you do this in it with 24-hour date amazing yeah so the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam we can maybe huh maybe we can do some of these things we can have a glimpse of these things but when we enter home we may change into a different person because I could fake it with you you're a stranger I could fake it with colleagues and co-workers with the people on the street but when I go home this is where my reality is revealed to me so I could not fake it with my wife with my children right there my subordinate there under me and this is where your true nature appears whether you're impulsive you have rage attacks you are rude this is where it shows so if you go inside the houses of the Prophet Allah saw - Sarah you will see a different thing altogether and a much more beautiful thing than most of us can hope to of course what about you know the sensitive man the modern man is supposed to be sensitive to the needs of well at least he touts himself in modern in our times you know this is a skill that you know we don't have to be macho all the time that we also can lower ourselves and be sensitive to the people around us most importantly our wives what do we have on record that the prophet sallallaahu leo solo was sensitive was careful was listening to them sought their advice was tender with them again this is like out of the world when you read the biography of the Prophet as you would think that being sensitive would be logical because of its benefits in life so if I'd like to have my peace of mind being sensitive would be the right thing to do in order to stop my wife from nagging from causing problems being sensitive would cause her to love me to respect me so I can deal with that I can like have a connection with that and understand it but what I cannot understand is being sensitive to the dead now this is something that shows a high level of loyalty the prophet Aristotle serum indeed was sensitive to his wives mm-hmm but especially to hadiza may Allah be pleased with her so whenever they slaughtered a sheep in the house of the Prophet as Sam he would tell them give so-and-so of the ship to holla she's the sister of hadiza give so-and-so to these women they were friends with hadisha Khadija was already gone and dead so one day I shall may Allah be pleased with her got jealous now I assure remember she is like 11 12 years old woman and one day a woman knock the door of the prophets house alayhi salat WA Salam and said the Islamic greeting before you enter she said assalamu alaykum the Prophet recognized the voice are a saucer and said Hal which is the name of his sister-in-law mm-hmm hadiya's sister and she's by the way the mother of the husband of his daughter so she had a son and this son's name is abu al Haas even a beer and he was married to his cousin Zeynep the daughter of the Prophet I saw him so she was his sister-in-law and she was the mother-in-law of his daughter so the minute he heard her voice she said Hal mm-hmm and I hit the roof may Allah be pleased with her she was so jealous yeah she said why do you still till day to remember an old woman whose teeth fell down and her gum is is red you can see that she's trying to portray a picture of of khadija when allah has substituted you with better than her pointing to herself as a young girl as a virgin as the daughter of abu bakr etc she had so many great features in her Mela be pleased with her now any one of us would would have said hmm you're right because hadisha is dead and you are the living one so just to save myself from a lot of headache and nagging I will just compromise it you're right not the Prophet is a sir mmm the amount of loyalty the amount of love he had to that great woman made him reply in mmm-hmm by saying by Allah Allah did not substitute it substitute me with better than hadisha she followed me when people rejected me she believed in me when people were disbelieving in me she gave me her wealth and money when people did not help me and Allah granted me offspring from her when he deprived me off string from all of you now this is a situation where a real man appears hmm so he drew the line I she said by Allah I will never ever mention her in a negative way again yeah she really that such a statement was a reprimand to her and that now she knows her limit gets our attention and it's not often that we hear about the anger of the Prophet so it makes us wonder too if we could just be in there to witness that exchange we're approaching our break I want to touch on our next subject by reading a small excerpt from the farewell sermon that the Prophet peace be upon him gave prior to his passing he was aware keenly aware of the vulnerabilities that women occupied the station the status at the occupied in 7th century Arab society and he spoke to this in the farewell sermon he said to his companions and followers be good to women for they are committed partners some translation si powerless captives are WAN in your households you look you took them in God's trust and legitimized your close female relationships or your sexual relationships with the Word of God so come to your senses people and hear my words he also dealt with the subject of discipline and said that it was permissible but you had to do it with kindness so the prophets Aloha Salam was aware that women were not in the strongest of positions in society and he addressed us and gave very clear guidance for how to honor women can we open this up inshallah when we come back inshallah Sharla okay we'll take a short break and come back to continue with the answer from shake us assalamu alaikum and welcome back to with the Prophet we will continue our conversation shake before the break we opposed you a pretty I gave you an excerpt from the farewell sermon okay and just talking about the can you would you like to respond to that okay now the poor the Prophet is our Salam when he addressed the nation and this was in the farewell pilgrimage and this was his last sermon to the public right he emphasized a number of points and if we had like CNN analyzing the State of the Union speech that would have been not more than categorizing the most important points mm-hmm among them that the Prophet isome highlighted the importance of being kind to women now he mentioned that you should fear allah azza wajal in how you deal with women because they are like captives with you what do we mean by captive see the relationship between man and his wife is very delicate but you cannot have two captains sailing the same boat inevitably you have to have one in command and this is in every management that you go through you have to have one CEO right you have to have one pilot flying the airplane he's in command he's in the left seat if both of them were in command it will definitely crash and marriage is like a boat there has to be a captain and there has to be someone who is not who follows orders so is it a relationship of Simon Says no it's not you have to look at it from 360 degrees all over okay so it's a relationship of love and compassion this is mentioned clearly in black and white in the Koran that among the signs of Allah that he created from you your partner's your spouses where you have love compassion kindness so this is how a lot looks or deals or asks us to deal with our spouses love compassion and kindness and at the same time the Prophet ordered us to be kind to women and the Prophet Isis M himself never ever beaten a woman okay never ever criticized the way he/she looks on the contrary the prophet alayhi salat wa salam prohibited hitting the face and cursing or criticizing the beauty of woman we do have a very serious problem with domestic violence in our time and not only our time but you know we're still struck Muslims or families are struggling with things like domestic violence and honor killings and things like this if we were to identify two problematic choices or relationship types that we as husbands choose to develop would you agree that some of us are a bit too harsh too tough and on the opposite extreme too neglectful and absent and yet we don't see either of these in the example of the Prophet so it's all well let me disagree with you in the sense that we have a problem with honor killing honor killing is not existing in Islam we don't have this in Islam it is found maybe in Jordan Afghanistan and Pakistan to my knowledge and this may have the percentage of like 5% of the Muslim world which is negligible and of these 5% the like point zero zero one that is taking place so we cannot generalize and say that Islam has a problem with honor killing we don't have any honor killing in Islam this is totally a myth that the media is trying to portray about Islam domestic violence this is found worldwide we know that this is found in the States it's found in Europe it's found in Africa in Asia and the reason is that usually men think that the superior physically and mentally and they have the right to correct what they think needs to be corrected and this is totally unacceptable in Islam the Prophet said Ali salat wa salam clearly he said do not beat women mmm now what do you want more than that is unmistakable it's very clear yeah you can you cannot think twice about it however beating the wife in the form of reprimanding her cannot be done out of the blue it is mentioned in the Quran that if a woman a wife is disobedient misbehaving with her in-laws is out of control what are my choices either to divorce her or to try to fix what is broken so if it's ain't broken don't fix it now now I have a problem my home my wife is disobedient she's not obeying when I'm instructing her to do she is bad-mouthing my mother and my father my siblings and she's out of control what are my divorces my choices as a man either to divorce or to reprimand if we divorce we end up with a divorced woman who is most likely not going to get married except to someone who's over 60 or to be a third or fourth wife which she will not accept so destroying the marriage is not a a good idea so the second choice is to reprimand is to try to fix it how do we do that Allah mentioned that in chapter 4 where a large al says that these disobedient wives if you try to fix what's broken you have to first do the following stage 1 admonish them advise them give them preaching that what they're doing is sinful at the sight of sight of Allah they are disobedient the angels were curse them the whole nine yards of advising and showing them the holding in Islam and this doesn't take like five minutes and then move to stage two no this may take like three four weeks yeah it's a procedure yes okay so you take your time it doesn't work move on to stage two and of course all of it is done in kindness and love of course patiently indefinitely then you move to stage two and stage two is that you show her the lack of interest physically so you abandon her in bed no intimacy you give her her your back show her that what you had for her the love you had for her does not exist anymore because of her actions and this may take like four or five weeks again and this means that you have to be patient because your impatience towards your desires and and and lust may cause the process of healing to stop after this if this doesn't work Allah tells us in the first stage you may hit your wife whoa sure what do you mean hit my wife this is mentioned in the Quran but it doesn't say that you bring a baseball bat and you start battering her hmm this is out of the question then how do I hit her it been Abbas the cousin of the Prophet has a syrup and one of the greatest scholars of Islam he interpreted this by saying you do not cause us car or a mark on her body okay you do not break a bone you do not shed blood okay and you hit her with the likes of this and he took his toothbrush the miswak yeah if you bring the miswak and you hit someone like a thousand times it's not gonna do anything right so the procedure of hitting is just it's not it's not like enraged with a closed fist across the face it's not it is it's a symbolic that listen after all these years of marriage and love between us you've reached a stage where you force me to reprimand you with such a fashion though it's not physically painful but it is mentally meant to be painful emotionally yes so this is the last straw that might break the camel's back if this doesn't happen then right and as you said this is at the last stage it's like launching the nukes and that even that is with the toothbrush so the other before the break you gave us another example in the life of the Prophet this is a peace be upon him what we're talking about how he applied these teachings and we had the example of Aisha being reprimanded for her views may Allah be pleased get her towards that Khadijah and he didn't you know do anything that was harmful in fact it was her response to his reprimand showed the effectiveness of his of his character of his way of his methods with her even in his rage correct I'd like to ask about the subject of loyalty those this loyalty as a principle has many applications not only in a marriage relationship but but in all we'll look we'll start with the subject of loyalty looking at the marriage relationship with what would you say about that what picture do we get about his loyalty the prophet sallallaahu his loyalty to his wives well indeed loyalty is interpreted in so many different ways we spoke about his loyalty to his dead wife right but when you come to his loyalty to the living the best manifestation of such loyalty would be in wanting his wife to accompany him in paradise so the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam was caring was loving was but this is not enough you want them to be with you in Jannah so if you look at the way he dealt with them all of them you would find that he gave each and every one of them a very high standard of treatment he used to sleep with them in the same bed even if she was in her menses because a lot of us know that a woman in her menses cannot prayer fast some like the Jews go to extreme by kicking her out of the house not eating with her not mingling with her as if she is an impure creature Islam is on the opposite the Prophet s RAM used to sleep with her in the same bed used to lean on her lap while she was in her menses and recite Quran the Prophet Allah saws used to bathe with his wives and they used to fight over the water leave some for me leave some for me all of these the Prophet used to do we know that before he goes out of his home to the Masjid he used to kiss his wives and a lot of the men come in the house who leave of the house and they don't kiss their wife in D there's not this love and showing of their emotions among a lot of the Muslims we we've reached the end of the episode check and it has been enjoyable and we really appreciate you opening up the subject especially about hitting and discipline we hope to continue in sha Allah and hope you'll be with us sha Allah thank you so much that will in this episode for with the Prophet thank you for being with us we pray that it was a beneficial until our next time together Salaam alaikum wa rahmatullahu workout"
