  "transcript": "are you doing it for the sake of Allah or not of course I'm doing it for the sake of Allah but I'm not your typical who would jump the moment you tell him oh we would like you to give us a lecture sorry it's not organized it's not scheduled I don't have this in me so do I have the passion [Music] yes alhamdulillah dear respected brothers and sisters today we have a guest none other than sheim Alim uh no much introduction needs to be done the she is very well known unless you would like to uh introduce yourself my name is I come from Saudi Arabia and I'm an old grumpy grandfather coming here to roast whoever wants to be Ro hosted we'll start with you so it is a big honor to have you with us here in Kenya so jumo Kenya so she um if you can Enlighten us through your experience in the dawa uh dawa sector how you managed to start da and where you are now as I always say and this is not part of me being humble because it's very rare to show my humbleness when you don't have any humbleness um I always say that I am not a typical D in the sense that I did not choose to become a d i was pushed by the People by the community to give lectures to give of J to give D and through the process with the grace of Allah Allah blessed me to learn more and more to get in touch with SH to be able to help people and I found myself in this position not that I had chose to be there and I'm just doing what the people want me to do this doesn't mean mean are you doing it for the sake of Allah or not of course I'm doing it for the sake of Allah but I'm not your typical di who would jump the moment you tell him oh we would like you to give us a lecture sorry it's not organized it's not scheduled I don't have this in me so do I have the passion yes to do what to help people to answer their questions I enjoy answering people questions even if it takes half of my day I have no problem with that I have problems with giving lectures because lectures require preparation require uh sitting down and putting your thoughts require delivering it in a specific time while answering questions help people helps people you can see what you're doing the benefit of it and it's selfs satisfactory and at the same time it's a form of worship to Allah so in a way I hope this answers your question about the beginnings and the ends you just pointed out a very uh beneficial point where it's straight to the point you know not bitting around the bush and asking very complicated questions ask the question you give them an answer right I tried to do this yeah to the level best uh of my ability because like she Al albani who whom I've studied a lot of his material may Allah have mercy on him in the beginning in his fwa whether it's F or fwa in Jed his audio tapes he always reiterated that one of the best ways to learn is to ask questions and to listen to fatwas because you can develop a sort of a methodology of thinking of how to obtain that answer how to look at the situations because it's not one size fits all each and every questioner has his background his motives his agenda and you just cannot say yes or no it has to be according to where the question is coming from so alhamdulillah yeah Allah blessed me with this and I hope that Allah Keeps On Blessing Me and uh preventing me from going astray or saying something that does not please him mean and when you started you were talking about uh being humble and as we know the prophet wasam says whoever humbles himself correct so you do have some humbleness in I wish I do did right aldah and also what you just mentioned now I think it's also a prophetic way of teaching most of the time the prophet sallallahu alhi wasallam used to ask the sahabas correct example in theith do you know the person who is bankrupt you know and that type of uh Q&A interaction gives people a way to contemplate deeper about things and it attracts their attention no which day which month which land and it's all in and so they're saying this this so when he says his statement afterwards it resonates it sticks in their minds and they understand it and so many times he used to repeat it three times so interacting asking questions so many times people ask you a question and you know the answer you can say yes or no rather you'd ask another question so that it would open venues for them for understanding more of what you want to convey rather than just yes or no answers mallah also one thing uh you said that really made me think that this wasn't your choice to be in this uh part of uh this field in life being a uh reminded me of M even in the Quran Allah mentions and also so with with a huge difference between M and US yes this is a gift from Allah but we can't compare ourselves to this the thing is when I say I did not choose this no it was a time when the IM of jum left so they had someone they needed someone to give a day or two earlier they looked around and they saw the only person qualified is a teacher and I was an English teacher at the time Allah so they said you're a teacher you know how to address people and you are practicing Muslim so you're the best Among Us so please give I couldn't say no and I hate to be under the spotlight I seriously W I do not love fame or to be recognized I wish nobody knew me but unfortunately this is how life is yes so when I gave the it took me 4 hours to prepare because I don't like to cut and paste yes I have to do my own thing so I have to research each and every bit of information so I would be certain that it's authentic and it feels more natural also yes and you give it for 15 minutes and that's it not long my 15 minutes yes my two is 15 to maximum 17 minutes that is the sun of the Prophet Sall Al and and it's it's easier for me to come out and say what did I say and the people would remember yes but when I speak for an hour and we all have the ability to speak for hours and you ask the people huh what did you learn very good but I don't remember anything it was from east to west yes so when I gave the alhamdulillah people liked it Al so they asked for more yes and they got addicted and and it kept fulfilling me because I'm researching for 4 hours to give 15 minutes you're benefiting yourself before benefiting I'm finding beautiful pieces of knowledge and sometimes you have to call to ask them about the ruling they explain things over and over again to you so with the grace of Allah this is one of Allah's favors and blessings upon me one one uh I wouldn't say Calamity but also one of the problems that we Face uh especially in our community here in Nairobi is many of the ks people rush to masss where it's only 10 to 15 minutes but most of the masss they do 30 minutes 40 minutes and scientif scientifically speaking I think the attention span of a human being might be 10 to 15 minutes after that just there what is the the prophet said the shortness of a man's oration and while having his Salat the two of prolonged this is a sign of his knowledge unfortunately we' Got It reversed we speak about this and about that and about the beginning of time and what the flood of n peace be upon him did and then the things that happened at the time of M and Isa and everybody's dozing off and after an hour and when he prays he prays with one Ayah here one Ayah there alhamdulillah so this is not the Sunnah this is a sermon delivered once a week so you should utilize it to benefit the Muslims when they go back home they went they go with something tangible they can give to their wives and to their children and to implement in their lives uh just a quick uh story of what happened a few months ago um he'll forgive me he forgive me U mentioning him but inshallah it was time for it was so I was picking him up from it's a little bit far so the Masid is almost like 20 minutes 25 minutes but with traffic it might be even more so we delayed a little bit the was supposed to start by 1:00 but he raised the member by 10:5 and by 12 120 it was done when he was entering people were Furious because he's late he's late but when he finish his people are very happy and the late comers were also Furious yes we were expecting it to be a little bit longer now that's a lesson for them are they even getting an egg she for the people who come the moment IM says they don't get anything the Angels wrap up their books and they sit to listen so the egg should have been before the IM said and a question um for a person who comes after the IM finishes Salah is he going to pay is he going to pray two or four no no he has to he has to go to pray two raas because he will pray J when does a late Comer prays four R is when he misses the r of the second so the Imam prays the first ra stands up prays the second ra makes if he raises his head and says and you join it's too late now you have no you have to pray four after he offers you pray four full of um she also in terms of engaging the youth what are the ways that we can actually the people who Allah subh has chosen to be in the dawa field what advice can you give them so they can be better connected with the youth because there's a big gap between the mash and the youth especially here in Nairobi this is again too generic the youth have different inclinations some of them love sports n some of of them love humor unfortunately others love social media some love something that is new so for you in the field of Daw you have to always prioritize teaching and delivering the authentic knowledge of Quran and Sunnah with the understanding of the three favorite Generations teaching and correct AA now the means vary I could organize as a DA Organization no football match once a week I could take them for om once every couple of months I can go canoeing if we have Rivers I don't think you have Rivers here we do okay very good you can do canoeing you can do hiking you can go to safaris and you can maybe see a lion and to try to be friendly good luck l some of the tribes here as well yes you could do so many things but you have to focus on what attracts the youth not for the sake of attracting them rather for the sake of teaching them the correct AA the right methodology of thinking the Sunnah of the Prophet the when you embed these all in your da you get fruit you get Beauty you get sweetness that they've tasted they will not find anywhere else so they'll come back again you have to have this essence of unity the youth don't need you to preach them 247 yes just preaching preaching preaching they need you to play with them they need you to be their elder brother to be with them to feel that you're there for them if they want to uh ask you for advice or consultation you're there for them so the Di has to be always there accommodating their needs like the Prophet Sall wasallam used to accommodate his companions needs unfortunately now there is an idea of you know once you're in a position where people look up to you you don't need to be like you need to be always serious you can't pull a joke you can't be sarcastic like you need to be always serious I know the feeling yes I know how to who cares sue me I don't care then people come to me and say you joke a lot and you do this you have to be more serious you're a I'm not aim nobody told you to come to me I'm not a scholar you guys come to me yes but you make you crack a lot of jokes This is How I Live you've been with me and you've suffered I haven't suffered I've I've really benefited from alhamdulillah but people around me know that this is how I like they say this is how I roll yes I I'm I'm not uh always serious I try to be humorous I try to be uh fun to be around because this is How I Live Now if this contradicts your idea of being a Sheikh or a tough luck nobody told you to come and listen to me some people even object to how rude I answer some of my questions so if someone asks sh you know now these uh uh Gregorian months they're all originally from Pagan religions like January and February okay so she we don't want to use them said okay don't use them go to the doctor and say I'd like to book an appointment or to go to the Airlines and tell them I'd like to book a flight and they tell you when what's the date you say and see what happens be realistic nobody say you go and worship these pagans or their uh months but this is something you have to live with yes so when I answer such a question some of the brothers said oh sh this is too rude you should not have answered sue me what are you going to do now nobody told you to come and listen to me a gazillion go and listen to them ask them but at the end of the day this is what I do and this is how I roll no I answer with what I feel that would please Allah if I do right Allah will reward me if I do wrong I hope that Allah would reward me for doing my and Allah knows best uh probably uh just a simple advice for the Youth she what can what advice can you give to the you a simple advice is difficult but a sincere advice no don't do the mistakes I have done in my life which sure if I tell you I have to kill you so I would highly advise the youth to utilize their youth now in my old age so many things I've regret I regret now I should have picked Spanish and French because I can't speak them but I didn't I could have done wonders in dawa in these two languages but I missed my opportunity I can do it now but I'm too old to do it in the sense that by the time I master it and I know the ins and outs of it like I do with English it will be too late no I have to focus on my priorities let them do of the Quran I don't memorize the Quran I know it inside out with the grace of Allah but I don't memorize it you come and say lead the the Salat yeah I know maybe 15 ju maybe 17 ju 20 ju I don't know I'm not that aware of it but had I had the opportunity now no I would have spent my life revising it memorizing it understanding it don't waste your time because I've spent all of my fortune all of my income on buying cars and this is something maybe a lot of people don't know in my life I bought approximately 25 to 30 cars I used to buy a car or or two sell it buy another car what type of cars if you don't mind me asking I had all types of cars Mercedes BMWs all types of four-wheel to Nissan Safari Patrol Land Cruiser vxr Jeep sherokee Trooper Isuzu GMC four-wheel drive two types of them Mustang I had two Mustangs one convertible one not convertible um I yeah all kind of of and Mustangs by the way are ugly cars I don't recommend them you want to buy something buy a vet yes Corvette masah nice by Camaro that is more realistic all of my friends who graduated with me and started to teach in high school with me today live in their own apartment buildings on the rooftop they have a penthouse they rent all of the other apartments and they have a good fixed income mhm while the past three years 30 years they had only one car Toyota caresa 1982 the same car all of them and they were happy I was happy I wasted my money I enjoyed life to the fullest I used to go off-roading I used to save people when they're stuck in the desert I used to do many many things enjoy Halal entertainment but where is my money down the drain no regrets the youth should utilize their time their wealth their knowledge so that when they're my age like we say they put the fifth gear and cruise inshah without any problem the Arab say the happy one who is who takes lessons from other people's mistakes um the prophet sallam mentions that three things are from happiness I have them all you know so I don't think you wasted your money I think you utilized people don't know Arabic why do you say the in Arabic when people don't understand you translate uh three are from happiness um a righteous wife um a spacious home correct and a good car a comfortable a good mode of Transport yes correct correct and with the grace of Allah I have all three alhamd so yeah no reg I have no regrets in the sense that Ya Allah no no no don't get me wrong I've enjoyed my life to the fullest and I'm still enjoying it with the grace of Allah I'm here in in the beautiful Nairobi where people pay money to enjoy your weather we pay money in Saudi Arabia to enjoy this beautiful weather in this peace in this yeah uh uh beautiful environment and Beautiful People nice people kind hospitable generous alhamdulillah though they did not feed me lunch today nor breakfast but alhamdulillah I'm fine with that inshah we'll recompense that with dinner inshah may Allah reward all the in-laws for their Hospitality as well a mean a mean I believe um this has been a very beneficial sitting with you I don't think so but if you say so thank you so much for [Music] love"
