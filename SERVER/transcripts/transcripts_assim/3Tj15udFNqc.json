  "transcript": "applying oil to your hair should I wash my hair thoroughly before making Woodill or not for Woodill the answer is no why because in Woodill we're instructed to wipe over the head and not to wash the hair meaning that even if you had hair gel on your hair which has a very thick layer when it comes to Waddle no problem you just wipe as usual without any problem this is what the Prophet used to do either his salat WA Salam when he used to go to a harem he used to put a tent bead on his hair which is similar to hair gel that keeps it intact and and in one place and he used to perform model as usual as wiping over it so you have no problem in the hustle you have to wash your hair and scalp thoroughly"
