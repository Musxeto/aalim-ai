  "title": "Mom orders me to wake my sis up for school, if my sister wears haram clothes, am I facilitating sin?",
  "transcript": "Salma from the UK Basically my mum sometimes tells me to wake my sister up for school but the thing is like she sometimes wears like haram clothing and I'm kind of scared if I'm like endorsing her sin if I just like tell her or like wake her up to go to school. Is it disobeying if I just don't listen to my mum? No there is no problem in waking her up to school but at the same time giving her advice about her clothes. These are two separate things. Waking her up to school is permissible because you're obeying your mum and she has to go to school or she wants to go to school. Whatever she does in the process is her own sin and your mum's sin. There's nothing wrong in giving her nasiha and advice. Have you ever taken a counselling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counselling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it that's good for you. If you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
