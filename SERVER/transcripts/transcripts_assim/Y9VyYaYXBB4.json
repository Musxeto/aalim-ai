  "title": "Relatives do black magic, is there any Dua we can read before eating or drinking things from them?",
  "transcript": "my question is our entire family believes that our one of our relatives performs black magic i don't know for sure but all say that they perform it so everyone is afraid to drink or eat anything they bring us is there any dua can be recited before eating the meal so that one will be protected inshallah mainly for those who won't recite their morning and healing we have a relative that all other relatives believe that he is dealing in black magic so what is a dua that may protect us from eating or drinking when we go and visit first of all it is totally prohibited to doubt muslims i think it's chapter 49 verse 13 where allah says that stay away from a lot of doubt because little of it is haram so you cannot accuse someone on the claim of your intuition or maybe as you wouldn't like it when someone comes up to you and say you did this and you did that i know i don't have any evidence but i feel that you are a liar that you're a cheater that you uh back bite people and you are not indulged in any of what was mentioned how would you feel betrayed oppressed they're doing wrong things to you this is exactly what you are doing to your relative now let us assume that it is beyond doubt and you have evidence that can stand in a court of law or a confession that he does deal in black magic and if this is the case then observing your ascar in the morning in the evening after father prayer before going to bed and before leaving the house would with the grace of allah shall protect you and if you have this evidence that does not accept any share of doubt when he presents you with something to eat or drink don't consume it simple as that and inshaallah you have to make sure that you're not doing wrong to this person"
