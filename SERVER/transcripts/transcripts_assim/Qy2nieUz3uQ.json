  "transcript": "third question is from mona she says is it permissible to become a fashion designer now mona or a fashion designer like every other occupation it has a job description so an electrician has has a job description an engineer a doctor a an hr manager everybody has a job description from your job description you can tell whether my income is halal or haram is it permissible to become this job title or not for example someone who says that i'm a banker my job description states that i have to open bank accounts and i have to facilitate giving interest-based loans i have to call people to pay it back i have to invest money long-term and short-term investments that generates money through haram means definitely your job's hara so mona has a job description of a fashion designer what is your job my job is to design dresses that's good no problem in that women should wear dresses in front of their husbands fathers mahram's other women they need to wear clothes so if this is your job to design something that is to be used in halal generally speaking there is no problem in that but if your job description involves designing something that is totally haram so bathing suits for example nobody doubts that this is haram clothes that reveal the aura and they are to be worn in public this is haram but it is something that is to be like laundries to be worn in front of a husband there's no problem in designing that you see a fashion designer is not something that a woman does and designs clothes and dresses and that's it it involves usually a catwalk or a fashion display or whatever they call it and this involves them putting models and walking and catwalks and down the runway or whatever they call it and all of this is haram so if your job description involves such things definitely this is not permissible for you otherwise if there is nothing haram involved then insha'allah it is permissible amen you"
