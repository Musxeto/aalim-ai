  "transcript": "Fahim from India. Wa'alaykum Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Wa'alaykum Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Sheikh, how can we make our heart saleem or how can we achieve to that status? The scholars say that a healthy pure heart which would only benefit those who come on the day of judgment and save them from being thrown in hell is a heart that has no doubts, it is a heart that has no desires and lustful things, and it is a heart that has no shirk in it. Doubts that are created by shaytan and make you doubt things and issues in Islam, your heart can't be healthy and saleem without casting them with knowledge. Desires and lustful things that corrupt and tarnish your heart cannot be fought off except with righteousness and piety. Shirk cannot be warded off without having tawheed. So you have to work on these things and inshallah you'll have a healthy heart. you"
