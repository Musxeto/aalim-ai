  "title": "A drop of urine fell on my clothes and I saw it only after I prayed.What should I do?",
  "transcript": "Muhammad sends us a question he says a drop of uh uh a drop or smaller than a drop of urine fell on my clothes and I sow this after I prayed what should I do now the most authentic opinion is if a person has an impurity on His Garment on his body or on the spot he's praying on and he knows about this his prayer is invalid because prayer cannot be performed without the condition of Purity and Purity is divided into two types in Arabic they call is uplifting the moral impurity and this is done by performing wo or by having total bath depending on the impurity whether it's minor or major and this is not something physical you can see so it is a description when a person answers the call of nature now he is impure minor impurity I I cannot see that once he performs wo this impurity has been uplifted I cannot see that but it is a description so this is part one part two is removing the impurity the physical impurity so a physical impurity whether it's on your body on your thob or clothes or on the place you're praying on a condition that you have to remove it so that your prayer would be valid if a person does not know that he has this impurity do we say repeat your prayer because he knew after he finished his prayer or do we say your prayer is valid it's an issue of dispute among Scholars and the most authentic opinion is that if you did not know about it as brother Muhammad uh uh's case in this case your prayer is valid so because you did not know about this impurity and you only found out after you finish your prayer your prayer is valid and the evidence behind this is the Hadith where the Prophet Alat wasam once prayed in congregation he was leading the prayer and he was praying in his sandals or slippers and the companions prayed in their slippers they used to follow the prophet in every single detail and in the middle of the prayer the prophet am took off his sandals and his slippers so the companions all of them took off their sandals when the prophet concluded the prayer sallallahu alaih wasallam he asked them why did you take off your sandals a companion said you took it off so we took it off as well and the prophet told them and Justified to them his action he said while in prayer the Archangel peace be upon Him came to me and told me that there is impurity on my sandals so I took them off so whenever any one of you come into the Masjid he should look into his sandals to check whether there is impurity or not now one would say this Hadith is a clear example and a clear evidence that if you knew about the impurity after the prayer was over your prayer is valid why because the prophet did not break his prayer in the second or third raak and then told them listen let's pray again because there are or there is an impurity on my shoes or my sandals no he continued praying which means that the raak or two or three that he prayed with his sandals that had impurity but without his knowledge were valid and of course one would say may one may ask how would the prophet pray in his sandals isn't this is this allowed the answer is unfortunately because we don't have knowledge we tend to see things and we're shocked about them and sometimes we in Anger protest not knowing that this is from the Sunnah praying in your sandal praying in your shoes praying in your slippers this is part of the Sunnah the prophet Alat said pray in your sandals or in your slippers because the Jews do not pray in their slippers so it is part of the Sunnah if you are in an an airport or in the market or at the park and you want to pray you don't have to take your shoes off just check that there is no impurity on them and then pray this is a Sunnah however you have to be careful because I don't want any of the youngsters who are enthusiastic mashallah and have strong Iman going to ISA prayer after listening to this with his shoes to the Masjid now this is not acceptable because the Masjid is covered with carpet and your shoes would make this carpet dirty not in impure but dirty and this doesn't go well with the people so you cannot inde defy and say no this is Sunnah I'm going to do it no this is unadvisable this is not advisable because you have to preach with wisdom with good preaching so that people would accept your call and Allah Asel Knows Best"
