  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] can dear brothers and sisters in Islam and welcome to this new episode tackling some of the hadiths of the Prophet Alat that deals with the Purity and the health and the livelihood of our hearts the Hadith we have today is a famous well-known Hadith however seldomly and rarely you'll find people contemplating upon it and acting accordingly Abu Hur may Allah be pleased with him said the prophet sallallah wasam said indeed Allah does not look at your appearance or your wealth but he looks at your hearts and your Deeds this Hadith is well known to all of us where the Prophet wasam highlights that the heart is where Allah looks and evaluates and as stated before the heart is the king and if the king is good righteous God-fearing then all of his subjects will follow suit which means that when the heart is sound and healthy and righteous then the body would follow suit which as a consequence your Deeds would follow suit as well and the opposite is accurate when the heart is corrupt then the whole body would be corrupt and as a sub as a consequence your Deeds would be corrupt the prophet saidat Allah does not look at your appearance he doesn't look at your physical bodies your shell your colors he doesn't look whether you're handsome or ugly whether a woman is beautiful or not and he does not look at your wealth at your money whether it's a lot or little because these things as the scholars say Allah gives health wealth and this duny to whom he likes and whom he does not like but he does not give Iman good Deeds except to Those whom he loves so Allah looks at your hearts and deeds what is stored in your heart if it is filled with certainty honesty sincerity if you love goodness for people if you're humble and merciful then this means that Allah loves you but if the opposite is there if bad characteristics showing off boasting arrogance deceit cheating lying and it's filled with hatred enmity and envy then definitely this is a dead heart and it would surely reflect on the body and as well as your Deeds as safarini may Allah have mercy on his soul says Allah doesn't look at our images at the Shell rather he looks at the deeds and the hearts how many he wonders how many beautiful bodies are those classified at the sight of Allah among the Dwellers of Hellfire beautiful bodies you might find someone who is Tiny skinny you can see his bones he doesn't have any of the measures that would classify him as handsome or beautiful yet he's among the highest in rank in paradise and you may find someone who's Mr Universe body like steel carved from steel and you see them biceps and the lats and the thighs and the squads and waa mashallah this guy is perfect Mr Olympia but he is among the Dwellers of Hellfire so it does not matter what the shell looks like what counts is the heart and the deeds and this is what people must strive to fix to fill their hearts with piety to act according to the Shar so that Allah would be pleased with them because if they don't the opposite is true Allah would give them his anger and resentment and Allah Asel would punish them for that this is why the images the appearance the lineage the wealth that you have all have no value at the sight of Allah many people that may look beautiful gorgeous astonishing they've got wealth they've got power and fame and Authority yet their hearts are deserted are shallow and Hollow it is empty look at the famous celebrities actors singers billionaires famous people who walk and Swagger on the on the red carpet what Iman do they have zero the vast majority of them zero You' find a Muslim woman so claimed Muslim coming out in a dress that exposes her body no hair covering full of makeup addressing men very beautiful a bombshell shockingly astonishing and the outside is beautiful what's inside desert nothing and this is what Allah would look at and whenever you find someone who doesn't have this Fame who doesn't have this lineage who doesn't have this wealth and doesn't look as glamorous as they do but his heart is filled with Iman this is the winner in this life and in the Hereafter and listen to this Ayah which is a game Cher an Ayah a verse that would flip how you measure and evaluate things Allah says and do not marry polytheistic women until they believe and and a believing slave woman is better than a pothy this is what Allah says a slave woman is better than a polyst what does that mean it means that as the scholars of T say even if that slave woman is someone who is ugly who is of a different color who is this or that she at the sight of Allah is much better than someone who's glamorous who's beautiful who's shocking who is this and that but does not have Iman in her heart and Allah says do not marry potic men to your women until they believe and a believing slave is better than a apst even though he might please you you or appeal to you those invite you to the fire but Allah invites you to paradise and to forgiveness by his permission how do we compare this to that how do we compare the way people evaluate things who do you choose for your daughter in marriage someone who prays in the Masjid five times someone who memorizes the Quran someone who does all what is needed to be done unfortunately not you choose someone who's rich someone who has a bank account someone who has a good job even if he doesn't pray it's okay Allah will guide him inshallah you will make him pray giving your daughter to such a beast is destroying her life and her Hereafter and likewise when you you want to marry as a man who do you choose to marry oh she she has to be Miss Universe she has to be someone who's shockingly beautiful she has to have this hair this height this figure this complexion Subhan Allah what about Iman what about hijab what about the knowledge of the beautiful names of Allah and the Quran and the Sunnah oh oh this would yeah yeah that's that's a plus as well so people are misguided and so many people we talk to when we tell them what you're doing is wrong it's Haram what do they say out of arrogance Allah knows what's in my heart so many people brag I pray I fast I take I pay S I give money to people so that they go for Hajj I'm a charitable person I'm a good person so he claims but his heart is filled with corruption with resentment to the Shar he looks down at the commands of Allah and he thinks that is this the religion of Allah if this is the religion of Allah I don't want it why are you doing this so this is extremism this is too much what is too much Quran andah is too much the the times change and we live in a different era oh so now you want to change the religion so it fits your whims and desires they who claim that their hearts are filled with righteousness and piety are liars because their actions contradict what they say exactly like the Hypocrites who came and to the prophet Alat wasam claiming that they're Believers the first Ayah in a chapter called the Hypocrites a chapter in the Quran by the name of the Hypocrites what is the first Ayah Allah says when the hypocrit come to you oh Muhammad they say we we testify that you are the messenger of Allah and Allah knows that you are his messenger and Allah testifies that the Hypocrites are liars so they say what they do not believe like the vast majority of Muslims today unfortunately not that they're Hypocrites no no no but they have characteristics of hypocrisy like in the Hadith four characteristics whoever have them in him he's a hypocrite and whoever has one of them has a characteristic of hypocrisy if you speak you lie if you promise you break your promise it to the end of the Hadith says Whenever there is belief in Allah in your heart Whenever there is love for him then as a default your body has to act according to what you believe and what is in your heart your rhetoric should comply what is in your heart and that would appear on what you say and on what you do but if you say something and do something contradictory to the Shar it means that it is negatively reflecting what is in your heart so what you do what you say reflect your heart and what is in your heart reflects what you say and what you do and from this we learn that we don't have to look in the matter every time and make sure that our beards and our hairstyle is fine the clothes are mighty fine that the watch matches my shoes and women usually care about shoes and purse and and the likes this is the outer shell you may get compliment and praise from people it doesn't count what counts is when Allah compliments you and Praises you what is in your heart make it your priority today to fix the sicknesses and the illnesses of your heart and if you find out that it reflected on your body on your actions on what you say positively and you are aligned with the Shar then you are in good hands and inevitably you will go to paradise and be there but if you say and do what is against the Shar this is a clear indication that your heart is corrupt and that Allah is not pleased with what he sees and inevitably you'll be tormented in your grave and on in the Hereafter in addition to the torment you get in this life depression and anxiety fear worries and lack of tranquility and comfort and peace"
