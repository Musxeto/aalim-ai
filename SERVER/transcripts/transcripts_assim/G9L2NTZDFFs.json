  "transcript": "and can we appoint someone else to fulfill our oath fulfilling our oath is quite generic what do you mean by fulfilling your oath if i swore to go to the souk that's an oath and the following day i don't feel like going to the oath to to the souk to the market can i ask someone to go in my place that says no i took a oath to do it myself i have to do it if this is what is meant because you cannot deputize someone if you said i will go but if you said for example i will send food to that family tomorrow and you took an oath tomorrow comes you appoint someone you authorize someone to go and give them food this is okay but if you're hinting to expiating the oath as i would imagine you're doing so someone made an oath to go tomorrow to the market and change his mind he has to expiate his oath by feeding 10 poor people or clothing them can i ask someone to do this on my behalf the answer is yes i don't have the money my father can you feed 10 people on my behalf for breaking my oath and my father says yes there's no problem in that and allah knows best you"
