  "transcript": "y from Germany I'm a bit confused about a topic that you mentioned before actually I would just like to have a bit of clarification which is the topic of manh you said once that it's uh like a modern term and it's not really from the Sunnah but then I later heard you briefly use it in a way other um lecture so I would just like to have clarification is it to be used or not this is what Shakespeare said to be or not to be that is the problem and the question the word manh is used nowaday in order to divide the Muslims so we we know that abide by the of of the and we follow that and we have strong conviction of it now lately people came up with another terminology saying that no no no no a is not sufficient why I'm not from the and I'm not from the m so no you have to have the manhaj and they emphasize on the manhaj as being the secret weapon which enables them to segregate those who don't follow their Sam their the number four or five Scholars of their time of their manhaj so whoever do does not follow them he is out of the manhaj and he is to be discredited and look down upon and think his a is also corrupt this is what I've been criticizing and saying that this is dividing the umah Allah did not ask us to follow a particular manh in the Quran and the Sunnah rather to follow the Quran and the Sunnah with the understanding of the favorite three generations and this is what we're doing now you say that I've used this word elsewhere and you confused you should be confused number one I am not infallible I'm not a prophet or a messenger my words must not have a form of something that is sacred and I've said something it becomes a law no we're human beings we make mistakes so I may have used this word to indicate something but definitely I'm not at all using it in the same fashion these wackos are using it to divide the um and Allah Knows Best"
