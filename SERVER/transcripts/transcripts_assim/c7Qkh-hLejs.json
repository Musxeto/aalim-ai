  "title": "Have to watch a Christmas movie in school & need a doctors note to skip it, what to do?",
  "transcript": "Yasin from Germany. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. Sheikh, in my school the people in my class want to watch a Christmas movie and I can't skip that day unless I have a confirmation from the doctor that I'm ill. How should I get the confirmation without lying? Can I sit with them and put headphones on and like not look at the movie? Jazak Allahu Khair. Wa Jazak. This is the same issue that you may face when you are in Germany with billboards when you are in the tram or in the subway if they have subways or in the public transportation when they have TV screens and they show things you don't want to watch. What do you do? You don't get a medical excuse not to attend. You just look the other way or listen to something that is useful and this is sufficient for you inshallah."
