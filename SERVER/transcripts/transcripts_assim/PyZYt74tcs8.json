  "title": "Sinful if I help my friend who doesn't wear hijab to find place to rent? she might do business there",
  "transcript": "foreign get a place for rent and I think she and her mom are going to be doing the business there I don't know what the business is and she does not wear the proper hijab will I be seen for if I direct her to someone else who will help her but I I feel like I am deceiving myself to her help her if the business turns out to be Haram because this third person doesn't care whether it's a Ramo halal uh did you give Salam before you started your question yes did I reply yes I'm sorry for replying I should have said hi or howdy because I don't know if you're a Muslim or not you just gave me salaam but I'm not certain see the concept of judging people and doubting things is a huge Pandora box once you open it things go down the drain now you're if you listen to yourself you say she's interested in doing business but I don't know what kind of business so if she asks you for a bottle of water will you give her the answer is yeah yes how would you know if she's not going to change this water into ice cubes to use with her gin and tonic you don't know so next time someone asks me for water I'm going to refrain or better more I'm gonna interrogate them what are you going to use the water for are you going to say Bismillah or you're going to just drink because if you don't say then I may take the this is too much overthinking and pre-judging people without any Islamic legitimate reason someone from out of the blue a Muslim or a non-muslim even a non-muslim comes and says can you help me rent a house sure I'll help them oh Sheikh maybe he'll get his girlfriend true maybe he'll drink intoxicants true maybe he'll do his Christian prayers there true but this is beside the point what I'm doing is halal means of assistance and help so as long as you don't know what their business is the default is their business is halal inshallah if it turns out later on that it's not this is not your sin you're not obliged to interrogate or check on her business whether she's wearing the hijab or not that's a separate issue altogether it has nothing to do with you helping her getting an apartment because so many people come to me clean shaven and they ask me questions say hmm should I answer them or no I can't give them fatwa because they're clean shaven I don't know what they're gonna do if this happens or that all of this is irrelevant and you should not overthink in such a fashion you will destroy your life you will destroy your relationship with others because you're judging them when you're not their father or their mother so I hope this answers your question do that"
