  "title": "Can we put a steel plate to identify one's grave by putting his Name, DOB, Bio etc? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh Shake since our local graveyard does not have a numbering system or anything similar so only for identification purposes unlike kuer headstone can we just place a simple steel name plate on the grave where just a disas name and his designation would be written it is permissible to put something that is not extravagant not high it's not built on the grave to identify the grave and who is buried inside and this was done by the prophet Alam and the companions they would put a stone or something to mark that grave which belongs to their loved one or their friends so if one puts a small steel plate or whatever that is not a tombstone that cost an arm and a leg and it's not built over the grave with cement and blocks and uh marble and the likes it's just a simple sign or something to indicate that this who buried there is so and so that's not a problem inshallah I personally would not recommend putting his biography like people sometimes do or put his CV uh so and so born this date died in this date he assumed the following position Ians in these uh uh companies and he used to do this and he used to do that he his hobbies and hey wait wait this is a great this is a cemetery I'm not getting married I'm dead why are you doing all of this just write the name and that's it what's the use of born died and the place of birth and death and a copy of my ID as well there's no need for that and Allah Knows Best"
