  "transcript": "Yasin from Germany. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. I wanted to ask you what are the signs of a sealed heart and how can it be opened? Jazak Allah Khairan. This requires a lot of elaboration, Yasin. Nevertheless, a sealed heart is a heart that resembles the hearts of hypocrites. They don't remember Allah except seldomly. So, a sealed heart never remembers Allah. 24 hours, 7 days a week, watching movies, listening to music, thinking about music or poetry or anything that does not contain Allah. A sealed heart, whenever Allah is mentioned, there is a form of resentment or hatred. Whenever Islam, the day of judgment, death, your grave, hellfire, he feels agitated and discomfort. A pure heart is enlightened with such topics and looks up to it and looks forward to it. A sealed heart would negatively reflect on your actions. So, you skip Salat, you skip Salat, you relate to Salat, you don't pay attention to mandatory obligations. Usually, you are totally depressed and confused and nothing would fulfill you temporarily except watching movies or engaging in haram acts. The moment you quit, you get these negative thoughts back again. The owner of a sealed heart usually is rude, is arrogant, disrespectful to the elders and to his parents among many, many signs and Allah Azzawajal knows best."
