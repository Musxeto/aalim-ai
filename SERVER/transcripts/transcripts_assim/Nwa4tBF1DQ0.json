  "transcript": "Ismail from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh I was saying that in the past I've done things which I'm like I'm not completely sure of their sins but I really want to repent from them but the reason I don't repent from them is because I think I saw a video in which you said I don't know the title or whatever but they said fearing that Allah will not forgive you is a condition of sincere remorse so I'm thinking if I repent and I don't know if they're truly sins then I might be what you call thinking about what you call speaking about Allah without knowledge so can I repent from these sins or no? I didn't say that thinking Allah is not going to forgive you is part of your repentance. Part of your repentance is to believe positively that Allah will forgive you as long as you're remorseful and you fulfill the conditions of repentance. If you're not aware or if you're not certain whether this is sinful or not but you still repent that's a good deed. Repentance is a form of worship. Allah says Repent to Allah all of you believers so you may prosperous and be successful. So whether you're repenting from doing something haram or something that is makruh not recommended or from abstaining from doing what's obligatory or from abstaining from doing what is highly recommended and must have repentance is highly rewarded and graded as a form of worship and there's no problem in it. you"
