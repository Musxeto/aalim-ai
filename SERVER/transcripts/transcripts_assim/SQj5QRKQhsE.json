  "transcript": "Oh salam al rahim alhamdu lillahi rabbil alameen for salat was salam ala nabina muhammad anwar ali he was average main a movado assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh we're still discussing the chapter that deals with jun hwa with friday the read of the muslims that happens every week and today we will discuss hadith number 135 and hadith of Jabbar ayman Abdullah and who will read it for us yes brother narrator Joe be ripping up the Laura Delano a person entered the masjid while the prophet salallahu alayhi wassalam was delivering the khutbah sermon on a friday the prophet sallallahu wasallam said to him have you offered your prayer the man replied in the negative the Prophet sallallahu wasallam said get up and offered to ricotta this is one of the etiquettes of Juma and that is when you enter the masjid generally speaking whether it's juma or not you have to pray 2 rakats before sitting down this made some confusion to the companion because now he entered the message it yet the Imam was offering the hot book the Imam was delivering the sermon so he was a bit confused whether to sit without praying but listening to the hog ba or to pray the enemy is offering the sermon and then he would not listen to it so he did what was best in his mind and this companion is soo lake I look up a fannie may allah be pleased with him so he sat down this leads us to another point which is that the prophet alayhi salatu salam was paying attention to what was happening in the masjid so he saw something wrong he interrupted his sermon and asked the man did you two rak'ahs he did not jump into conclusions he did not say stand up and pray because there is a possibility that the man prayed at the back where the Prophet did not see him at a salsa so he asked him and the man said no I did not and then the Prophet as Salam ordered him to stand up and to pray and that is why scholars differed in regards to the ruling on praying before or when or while the Imam is offering the sermon the scholars such as shafi mad they say that it is mandatory for a person to pray 2 rakats before sitting down even if the imam is delivering a hook but why because of this hadith other scholars such as a man malik an imam abu hanifa may allah have mercy on their souls said no he must sit without praying 2 rakaats why because they said there are other hadith where the Prophet erase all of them said whoever addresses his brother or his friend or the one next to him by saying Shh listen then he had committed levu he had committed an act of uselessness and they said that if instructing people to do good things would be level then praying two rak'ahs would be low level as well and this analogy this PS is not accepted at all and this justification is completely rejected why because we have the instruction of the prophet alayhi al-salam and we have the authentic hadith one would say didn't the companions know didn't the Imams like imam abu hanifa mimetic know about this hadith why did they say against it first of all as Muslims we think highly and regard them greatly as imams of islam so we do not doubt them we do not accuse them on the contrary we respect them to the extent that we say maybe the hadith did not reach them they did not know about it maybe maybe they knew about it but thought it was not authentic maybe they thought it was a santak but they thought that there are more overwhelming evidences either way we follow their teachings and Abu honey if I said may Allah have mercy on his soul if you find a hadith that goes against my teachings take my teachings and throw them on the wall meaning disregard my teachings because the hadith is the pillar that Abahani if I saying we abide by and all of this has been reported by element Malik and also a limb am a chef I'm a medic says everyone among us whatever they say might be accepted or rejected except the person in that grave and he points at the grave of the Prophet RSO salam you may never ever reject what he says you have to accept everything he says but if i'm alex says all the other scholars all the other companions you may accept and you may reject because they're human but the Prophet Adam he is the messenger of allah and he never utters the thing he never says a thing except that Allah has dajjal has commanded him to say therefore we respect him and malik we respect them abu hanifa we respectfully ma'am shafi we respect an imam i am adam in humble yet no one is above the quran or the sunnah if they go against the Quran and the Sunnah we give them the benefit of the doubt by saying they did this due to a reason that we may not know of but never ever accuse them of wrongdoing or misleading doma i Willa they have been accepted by the whole Ummah so it is part of the Sunnah to pray two rak'ahs before you sit down we move on to hadith above the lognormal may allah be pleased with him and the brother would read it for us please narrated Abdullah I bloomer the Prophet you should deliver the two khutbah while standing separating them by sitting in between them now in this hadith we learn what the prophet used to do on Friday because this is not mentioned in the Quran right we don't have mentioning of how many hook buzz in Friday therefore we have to learn it from the sooner eben Omer tells us that the Prophet array salatu salam used to deliver two sermons and he separates between them while a short pause by sitting down and he used to deliver these hot bus while standing there for scholars say that it is mandatory to have two hot bus before jummah if you have it after the prayer your prayer is invalid and if you don't have any prayer day mum comes in and calls for the prayer and praise two rak'ahs Juma this is invalid it is a condition that you have two sermons before the friday prayer and they differed what is the ruling on sitting in between them the majority of scholars and which is authentic opinion is that sitting is sunnah it's recommended if you don't sit your hot ball your sermon is correct what is the ruling on delivering the hot bus standing up only imam shafi'i said that it is mandatory if you're capable of standing up you have to stand up the majority of scholars say that it is not mandatory but it is highly recommended and it most likely that it is mandatory because the prophet Adam had never ever offered it while sitting down but if hypothetically we have someone who is a scholar but on a wheelchair or a scholar who is unable to stand and he sits his prayer is valid and it's no problem and doing it some think that it is part of the Sunnah to hold a sword while giving the hood wha so some of them while giving the hotbar have soared indicating that Islam was spread by the sword and this is not part of the Sunnah at all some of them even hold a stick but it is not part of the sooner if you're healthy if you're young and if the pulpit has a fence like the majority of pulpits now where you can lean on you don't need anything to be carried and it is not part of the Sunnah to carry something in your hand now what is the hotbar are there any particular etiquette there are a number of etiquette that we have to learn but we will postpone this until the break so stay tuned and inshallah we'll be Salaam alaikum and welcome back there are a number of etiquettes that must be followed when giving the hope of the Juma so these are addressed to the person giving the juma and in fact it's one of the greatest roles a Muslim can assume in this life because he is assuming the role of the prophet alayhi salatu salam and imagine how many people you can guide and lead and direct to Islam through your sermon but first of all we have to learn what are the etiquettes and what can be done in what must not be done scholars say that there are pillars for the sermon of Juma and among these pillars one you must praise Allah you have to say alhamdulillah and you have to offer sir rotation to the prophet alayhi salatu salam allahumma solli Oh sallim ala muhammad and you have to recite at least an ayah at least one verse and which is one of the main things your sermon has to be considered among the people as a sermon so if someone says alhamdulillah was salatu salam ala rasulillah pull who Allah who I had a la somma the meal is William you will at Wyndemere cuckoo and I had a cansada this is not something that is considered to be a sermon the prophet alayhi salatu salam used to open his friday sermon with a number of statements scholars say that one of the famous ones is hot battle Hodja and what is that to say in al hamdulillah module 1 astorino wanna stop Pharaoh when our villa Mincher Orion facina women say Yadier Molina Mahela who fell Amidala woman you lil fella had yella wash Allah Allah Allah wahdahu la sharika lah wash and Muhammad I would do who wore a pseudo this is normal then he decides three verses yeah you are latina a minuto cool ahahaha to party wallet a mutiny lower and to Muslim moon yeah Johannes with tokoro become a lady halacha common nationwide mahalo Hammond has 0 jaha rowbotham in houma rijal and cathedral money sir what a cool Mahalo it has a luna me he well or ham in la canada come rock eben yeah you holla de namur otaku la la pelu colon CD de la camara elimu a low hum dono become way my Illawarra sola philosophers a thousand edema then he always used to say i'm bad and then he goes and speaks about following the quran and sunnah and avoiding bidder for in a stock al-hadith e que la mula Mihiel had had you Mohammedan sallallahu alehiwassallaam were several more the worst of things moved aside to her the things that are innovated waka ama desitin beta every bitter everything innovated this is a bitter or cooled a bit 18 balala and every innovation or every beta is something that leads you astray and every de la la vaca low volatile pinner it ends in Hellfire now imagine this by itself can be can be a sermon because includes most of the Dean poor Anne Henson and warning people about beta and instructing them to follow the Sunnah then scholars say that the Companions when they described the prophets way of giving the khutbah they said salala herrera salem whenever he delivered the Hopa after opening it with such words he used to raise his voice his eyes would turn into red and his anger would be extreme as if he's warning an army as if he's warning his people that an army is coming by daytime or by nightfall so if you're warning your people that there is an army coming to attack how would you say guys there is an army that is about to annihilate you in five minutes take care have a good day no one would do this and that means that the Prophet are they saw Salaam when he gave his sermon he used to react with it so many times you going to masjid and imam is speaking in a voice that makes 50 or seventy percent of those attending sleep especially if he's talking about fire so says fire hell is a very horrible place people are tortured and it's so huge the temperature is hot and everybody's sleeping while the Sun is you should make the people react by saying fire is something that throws fear in the hearts of the believers why because it is Allah's anger when you speak like this everybody is watching you and comprehending every single word that comes out of your mouth and this is what the prophet used to do is awesome not that he was a violent person on the contrary we have no single narration that he killed or beaten anyone with the exception of omean ahadith he's the only one that we know that the Prophet killed him but we don't know the prophetess m to be violent or someone who is driven by rage and anger under contrary sallallahu ala he was and no one was calmer than him but when it comes to friday sermon it's once a week it is crucial and important that you deliver it in the same attitude and the same manner that the prophet used to adding salatu salam also it is important to know that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said that the length of a man's prayer and the shortness of a man's sermon is a great sign of his comprehension and knowledge what does that mean it means that on Friday the shorter your sermon is the longer your prayer is this is a sign that you are a person of knowledge you understand the sooner nowadays it is the other way around people put long the speech the hook by the sermon for half an hour for 40 minutes and when they pray pull your car on pure Aloha head so short and this is not in accordance to the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salatu salam the soul of the hotbar of the sermon should be reminding people of allah azzawajal and preparing them for the day of judgment and giving them what benefits them sometimes you go to masjid and the hood but from the beginning to the end is about elections and about who to elect and the role of politics in islam what is this is this part of the hook above the prophetess m know sometimes unfortunately you have paid imams so they are working as an occupation not as an obsession and a need to teach people so they read the same book for the past 20 years every gemara they read the page every Giamatti read and every six or seven weeks people start to challenge it themselves what do you think the hot would be it's going to be about this or that so no no I remember it's gotta be about this after haha didn't I tell you they know it my heart now is this is do you consider this to be part of the teachings of the Prophet s son not at all therefore it is recommended that the Imam invests a lot of time in preparation of the friday sermon because it is the only sometimes it is the only sermon that people here throughout the whole week in Muslim countries we hear it in the radio we see it on the TV with every answer or maghrib prayer there is a lecture laser that's in the masjid so you're always gaining knowledge whether you like it or not in some Muslim countries people don't hear any word of advice except in friday and even friday it is fabricated it is something that is so funny and one of the brothers asked me a question last time what is the ruling on giving the hata in your native language scholars say if the majority of the people don't speak Arabic then you have to have the pillars in Arabic and that is al hamdulillah salatu salam ala rasulillah they say that not only praising allah and offering salutation to the prophet you have to give the Kolyma which is a shadow a la illaha illallah what I shadow and Mohammed Abdullah Sulu so it is not only sufficient to praise and to offer the siltation these are important which is the Kolyma or the Shahada and after that you recite most of the verses in Arabic and you translate them and the rest of the hotbar is in your native language that's why when I travel abroad special to England I deliver all of my hot bus in English but if I'm in Saudi Arabia I deliver all of my foot bus in Arabic and it should be in Arabic but if the majority do not understand it wouldn't be wise at all to have it in Arabic while nobody's understanding what you are saying and that is why scholars say if a person is far away from the Imam and is unable to hear him or the Imam is speaking in a language that he does not understand what should I do in the remaining half-hour scholars say read the Quran make the care make because I'm not benefiting from the sermon I'm not understanding or I'm not hearing and therefore it is okay for you to engage yourself in something else among the things that the prophet used to address some always repeat harrell Hadi had you Muhammad or shuttle or more muhahaha the prophet used to always emphasize on that the best of guidance is his guidance and the worst of things are innovated matters and all the time the prophet used to warn us from innovating unfortunately the majority of Muslims are innovators and this shows you how far they are from the teachings of the Prophet erase a lot wassalam and how engaged they are in this dunya for their own welfare so those Imams who innovate they don't want the welfare of their followers and congregation they want the welfare of their bank accounts and their pockets so they keep on fooling people and keep on diverting away from the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salatu salam the hotbar has to be the main subject has to be how to get people closer to allah this is the core and the soul of the hood ba whether describing hell or describing paradise or talking about the sunnah or talking about halal and haram teaching them regulations and rules of Islam you have to have this objective in your mind to draw the people closer to allah azzawajal this is all the time we have until we meet next time fee amanillah assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
