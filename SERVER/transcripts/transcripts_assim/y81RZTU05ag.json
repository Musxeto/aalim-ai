  "transcript": "Oh what is the origin of taraweeh some say that it is a bid ah and what is bida an innovation or a beta is something that is invented in religion that is not part of it with the intention of worshipping allah and getting closer to him so some say that allah has a beta and this is not true the Prophet himself alehissalaam initiated the sunnah and the Hadees is authentic the Prophet prayed taraweeh prayer leading the Companions for three or four nights and then he refrained he stopped so the companions started calling him out Oh prophet of Allah come come and pray like you prayed the previous night's we like it so the Prophet came out to them and he said I have seen what you had done the previous night's had I not feared that Allah would obligate this prayer upon you I would have continued so listen to the prophets justification is a lot of Salaam it's a good thing I love it I know you love it but because I was afraid that Allah would make it obligatory upon the Ummah which leads which would lead probably to hardship I stopped it I was so merciful to my Ummah I didn't want to burden them with more obligations so the one who started it was the prophet Arizona after he died what he had feared does not exist anymore and that is no one can't obligate night prayer because he's dead how can it be obligated that is why when romanovna hubbub may Allah be pleased with him in Ramadan went out to the Masjid he saw the Muslims praying in groups three people here ten people there five people here but they were not in congregation all of them so he ordered obey Him niqab to lead them in Tarawera so the all creating congregation taraweeh behind one imam rather than being segregated and spread all over the masjid behind many Imams and when he saw this he approved it and said that this is something that is good and he used the word be done near metal bit OTT II had a but Buddha here is not religious because in religion the origin is there which is the prophets doing Anna's son bit ahead is the linguistic terminology which is something new and because they were praying in groups different groups what he had done is something new which is nice described as Veda but it is not a religious Buddha that is bad in Islam again because the one who did it was a prophet a less awesome so he revived his Sunnah sallallahu alehiwassallaam"
