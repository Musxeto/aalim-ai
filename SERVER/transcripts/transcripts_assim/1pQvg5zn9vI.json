  "transcript": "foreign used to say in this fortress of muslim book lit of course glory be to the possessor of total power sovereignty magnificence and grandeur now these attributes are taken from names of allah azzawajal the barut is taking from al-jabbar and we don't have the time to expand on explaining the beautiful names of allah you can go to the beautiful names of allah which we had made an earlier playlist of and you will find the meaning of these beautiful names the melakut grander so knowing allah's beautiful names adds great value to your life to your prayer to your worship to every aspect of life and when you don't know these beautiful names you have complete darkness you can't see so we have to learn in order to know who we are worshipping we finished record what do we do we rise up from rakur and what do we say when we rise up from rukur as we are standing up we say that may allah answer one who praises him now semiya means to hear and a semmer has different meanings one of the meanings is to hear so when someone says do you hear this bank it's hearing of realization that something has banged and it also refers to understanding so when you hear something and you understand it is not like those who do not understand it it's a different way of semmer and the third meaning which we have here is to answer so allah azza hears everything so why do we say allah azzawajal here's the one who praises him no allah here's the one who praises him and even the one who does not praise him but this kind of hearing means in arabic to answer those who praise him and there is the hearing of the hypocrites who hear but they do not implement and this would be affecting them on the day of judgment when they're thrown in hellfire for hearing and not obeying so as you rise up you say so not as many imams who don't know the sunnah they rise up completely in while standing up erect they say so that their voice would go into the microphone this is wrong the sunnah is to say it as you're rising up now when you rise up who does or who says only the imam and the person praying alone who's left over the moon the follower the follower does not say allah then what does the moom say the moon says once he rises up and this is the minimum rabbana wallach this is said by the imam and the person praying alone and the moom the follower the prophet used to say alaihis wasalam in addition to that o lord for you is all praise and abundant beautiful blessed praise so this is something you can say that's all no no no no no this is just the beginning as you say semi allah almighty the prophet used to add to that the heavens and the earth and all between them abound with your praise so all of this is a bound of your praise and all that you will abound with your praise this is the heavens and the earth and what's between them o possessor of praise and majesty the truest thing a slave has said of you and we are all your slaves oh allah none can prevent what you have willed no one can prevent what you have given and no one can give what you have prevented and no wealth or majesty can benefit anyone as from you is all wealth and majesty this is too much man when you look at imams in the masjids when you look at individuals praying what is this it's especially in in countries that they don't follow sunnah as we call them the ferrari imam you don't even have time to say alhamdulillah because the guy is already on the ground prostrating while the prophet saws as you have heard says these beautiful words of praising allah azzawajal after rising from the raku position this is something that we have to incorporate in our salat this is not just for the sake of knowledge and oh yeah i know what to say you have to start to practice it today immediately and say it and by the way you've noticed that there are a number of vicar whether in rokur or after you rise from the raku you alternate likewise in the dua of inauguration all of these you don't say them together you say one at a time and you try to vary from one prayer to the other so you would have full concentration instead of just parroting it and saying it without paying any attention to it this is all the time we have until we meet next time on foreign love"
