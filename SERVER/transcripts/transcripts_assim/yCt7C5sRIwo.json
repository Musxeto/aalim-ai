  "title": "Not giving Salam to a person who does not pray, does not have a beard or sins openly- Assim AlHakeem",
  "transcript": "if I do not initiate sonam to the person who does not pray five times who does major sins openly who does not have a beard is it recommended or only permissible or not recommended so basically where the tariff is asking on the ruling of beginning and initiating salaam to such an individual and the rule is that the prophet told the sorry salat wa salam spreading peace spreading salaam spreading the greetings of islam is one of the means of attaining cordial relationship and the love between the Muslims and this is the only way you would be able to enter Jannah now having said that the scholars mentioned the issue of al Hajj and there is two by caught a Muslim so you don't greet him with the greeting of islam you don't smile in his face you don't treat him as you treat other muslims and this concept of al Hajer was learned from the story of kab new malik may allah be pleased with him and his two companions the three of them did not go out with the Prophet Elisha Lobster and his companions on the Battle of Tabuk and a number of hypocrites between 50 to 80 of them also did not go but these three were close companions of the Prophet as Salam so not going with him was dubious and they apologized when the profit came back at a source and that they had no excuse so the prophet alayhi salatu salam ordered the muslims the whole community not to communicate with them to dis communicate with them and ordered them not to talk or socialize and after fifty days the Prophet even went further and ordered their wives to separate from them so this sort or type of boycotting on all social levels is founded in our religion however scholars say that this has to be done if there is something tangible that we can benefit off for example if there is someone who is sinful who is doing a lot of bad things publicly and he's a Muslim and I decided to buy caught him and not to give him Salam and not to smile in his face and not to deal with him in any fashion or type of way but the consequence would be that when he sees this he gets more and more indulged in Haram and he turns to those who encourage him to do Haram in this case my boycotting him had backfired and I should not do that because what I aim for is not my self-satisfaction rather what is beneficial for him and for the religion of Islam but if I know and I notice that by boycotting him he is shameful he is remorseful he is trying his level best to get back to Islam properly any quitting doing sins I'm reducing by the way I'm treating him his evil in this case then this is beneficial going back to products question he says if I do not initiate Salaam party why don't you want to initiate Salaam to this individual he says because he doesn't pray five times a day how do you know that he doesn't pray five times a day because he doesn't pray with us in the Masjid maybe he prays in another math maybe he doesn't pray in the masjid at all but he prays home okay if he prays home then he is a kafir of course not he's not a kafir he's a Muslim see what you are doing brother Tariq is going a little bit extreme ready to label people ready to label Muslim as cancer or fasiq or sinful and this is an idea that you're building up in your mind and it's very dangerous Allah did not order us to label people so if he doesn't pray except in home he's a Muslim if he doesn't grow the beard he's sinful but he's still Muslim if he sends openly he parties and he dreams he's a sinful person but he's still a Muslim this does not mean at all that I should refrain from giving him Salam depending on the previous rule we've mentioned earlier why so many times I meet people and they say to me we don't like practicing Muslims and I ask why they say that they never return our salams whenever we pass by them at work or in a mall and we say salaam-o-alaikum they look at us with disgust they look down at us and they do not reply to our salams they're always frowning in our faces this is problematic thou are wise you will never win their hearts like this they say yes but in the self we have narrations that we should not speak to them we should not smile in their faces we should shun them he again we come back to the pros and cons advantages and disadvantages by your action are you fulfilling the sin or you're fulfilling your own desires this is problematic so look at the prophet alayhi salatu salam he was most of the time he had a smiley face he would never frown unless there is a sin so you have to follow his footsteps and look besides be will be aware and be careful not to jump into the Huaraz saddle and giving takfeer to everyone know this person he's dating Anna Muharram woman he's a kafir this person doesn't wear a go appeared and his trousers are below his ankles he is nothing this person doesn't play with us in the Masjid because by looking down at everyone else you will eventually end up saying that I am the elite I am the best among all those around me and there's no one better than me and this takes you straight to hell thinking so this high of yourself and boasting about it is arrogance and one should not have this therefore when you want to initiate salaam as long as he is a muslim and it is not proven that he's not and for example if someone says I am NOT Muslim anymore I'm a disbeliever I'm an atheist this person we have to maybe sit with him for a few minutes half an hour try to bring some sense into his head if he's adamant and if he is insisting that he is not Muslim anymore in this case definitely we cannot treat him as a Muslim he's an apostate he's a kafir okay then should we kill him no this is not your job this is not done by individuals this is a legislative issue this is a crime and the only one qualified and has the power to execute such a decision is the Muslim ruler the head of the state who has deputies who has judges in courts so this is a crime this is something that has to be taken in front of a panel of judges Muslim judges who would try to talk sense into him in Islam it doesn't just tell you kill and this is not done by individuals any individual who kills an atheist or an apostate just from his own whims and desires he has to be himself the murderer has to be executed on what basis do you take the law into your own hands without verification without knowing whether this man is like you accuse him of being a kafir or no posit or not it is not a jungle that we live in we have a legislative body we have judges we have the Muslim ruler who governs the country this is their responsibility and they have to look into it and carry out whatever the law says about this"
