  "title": "Mubarak Hair of Prophet ﷺ(Characteristics of Prophet ﷺ) Ash Shama'il Al Muhammadiyah assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "we begin in the chapter that deals with the hair of the Prophet so there were many Hadith describing the prophet's hairat may Allah be pleased with her said I used to perform the major Ritual Evolution and Allah's Prophet Alam uh uh together from a single Basin from a single bucket and he had hair above the shoulder level and below the ear Loops may Allah be please and with his father said that the prophet of Allah was a medium height Broad shouldered and the hair of his head touched the lubs of his ears said to anas may Allah be pleased with him how was the hair of the Prophet Alat wasam he replied it was neither crispy curled nor lank his hair used to reach the loops of his ears may Allah be pleased with her she said that the prophet Alat wasam uh arrived boldly at Mecca and he had four braids of hair that when the prophet wasam arrived to Mecca he had had four braids of hair anas may Allah be pleased with him said that the prophet alham uh um his hair was down to the middle of parts of his ears may Allah be peace with him and with his father he said that the prophet used to let his hair hang down over his face whereas the polytheists used to part the hair of their heads the the people of uh the scripture also used to let the hair of their heads hang down and he used to favor emulating the people of the scriptures with um respect to things about which nothing was commanded but the prophet of allaham then parted the hair of his head Sall wasallam and finally um Han said I saw the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam uh with four braids of hair okay this is eight hadiths in this chapter what do they all relate to first of all the the length of the prophet's hair and we spoke about this and we said that there is and so the prophets haam did not reach his shoulders meaning it did not go beyond Al and is to reach the uh ear loopes and it was more than the ear Loops so it was in between the ear loops and the shoulders sallallahu alaihi wasallam and he had sometimes braided his hair and this shows you how long it was so braiding the hair again is not something that we should look down upon unless it is not recognized in the community the Arabs at the time of the Prophet used to do this frequently men used to braid their hairs so there's no problem in doing it when everybody around you is doing it but when you are in a community or a society which braiding the hair would be a bit feminist in this case you have to refrain from that so that nobody would tarnish your reputation but if you were among people who praise longing their hair and Men braid their hair as a sign of being Macho and and and and manly then there is no problem in doing this because the prophet did it sallallahu alaihi wasallam but is it aah the answer is no this is not part of the Sunnah that you get closer to Allah so we don't do it saying that oh the prophet did it Sall Ali wasallam then we do it no this is part of the Customs like the fact that the prophet used to write as we will see inshallah in the future he used to ride mules so is it part of the sunah for me to take a mule to to work of course not and if you do then people would look down upon you and say there there's something wrong in your head you don't say oh the prophet used to do this you guys hate the Sunnah no this is part of the Customs so you do what people acknowledge and accept as long as there's no recommendation in terms of religion that the prophet orders you to do it like growing the beard this is an obligation this is part of the religion it's not part of the Customs because the instruction is Crystal clear in it so you don't shave or shorten your bead because this is the norm and the people would not uh consider this uh normal as for parting the hair it's a fact that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam used to dislike anything that's imitating the idol worshippers and the disbelievers but when we have the idol worshippers in one hand and the people of the scripture the Jews and Christians on one hand the prophet used to lean more over to the people of the scriptures against the idol worshippers so this is a well-known fact the people of the scriptures are closer to us than the Hindus than the sik than the Buddhist because those are Idol worshippers we we may be a bit incline to the people of the scriptures though all of them are disbelievers in Mecca there were no Jews and Christians there were only vast majority were Idol worshippers so the prophet Alam you used to let his hair down why because the idol worshippers used to split their hair half to the right half to the left while the people of the scriptures used to let their hair down so the prophet Alam used to emulate them against the idol worshippers the posts when he went to Medina the V majority of the people were Christians and Jews Idol worshippers were all in Mecca so here the prophet Salli wasallam decided to split his hair into halves one to the right one to the left to go against the Jews and the Christians to show the identity of a Muslim and this also highlights that a Muslim has to have his identity and has to show the people that he does not mimic or imitate the disbelievers in what is part of their religion and Custom anything else that is commonly used wearing a watch using a computer riding a car this is commonly used among all the people of the planet so there's no saying that whoops I should be riding a bicycle because the disbelievers write cars no there's nothing as such but what they're identified by no one does it except them we should have our own identity and not imitate them and Allah Knows Best sallallah alhi wasallam mam [Music]"
