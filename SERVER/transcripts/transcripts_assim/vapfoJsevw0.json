  "transcript": "a sister says I got married four months ago and my husband is okay in short they got married and they have financial problems they don't plan to have any children can they postpone having children for a while the answer is yes if it's for a legitimate reason such as uh studying being in a country that is overburdening you with uh expenses and taxations and you don't have enough money and you fear that this would be problematic no problem in delaying it for a year or two or so but not to do that for a long time"
