  "title": "He thinks about worldly problems during salah, he's not bothered by it Is this punishment from Allah",
  "transcript": "my friend doesn't concentrate in his and he always worries about uh worldly things deliberately he doesn't even try to remove those thoughts and he also shortens his prayer to do those CHS and works nowadays he's failing at everything what he used to handle very smoothly is this a punishment from Allah for not conting in Salah deliberately and shortening it what do you mean by shortening it he does not prolong it or he prays four he prays fouras as fouras but he does not pray it like how good Muslims pray okay first of all again once a person prays and fulfills the mandatory acts of prayer meaning that he does the r he does the sujud he recites the Quran but he does not take his time he just does the bare minimum saying subh once in subh once in and the likes he has done what is mandated but he did not do what would get him closer to Allah and this is why in the Hadith when a person prays Allah says to the registering angels look how much my servant has acquired from his Salat so they write 1/ half 1/3 quarter fifth sixth until the 10th of it and they accredit it with that only due to as you've stated shortening the duration of the prayer doing the bare minimum not concentrating not having not reaping the benefits of the Salat and tasting the sweetness of it and one tenth of the Salat is 10% what is this so Allah with his mercy and generosity says look whether my servant has prayers so that you would compensate and complete the missing parts of his F prayer therefore the bare minimum is to pray the F prayers as I've described earlier but once one per a person a intellectual smart person doesn't want to have the bare minimum because you don't know if the bare minimum is sufficient or you're below that and you will have to do time in Hellfire for that so he tries his level best to perfect take his time in his F prayer does it with and he tries his level best to pray voluntary prayers before and after according to the prescribed Sunnah so it would compensate whatever is missing in his Salat he would offer DHA prayer he would offer night prayer he would offer Witter he would offer as M as many Good Deeds so it would complete what is missing maybe then Allah Asel would reward him the highest levels in Jenna is what's happening to him at the moment a punishment from Allah for his flaws and shortcomings this is only in Allah's knowledge however any one of us would attribute any Calamity or any problem in life to his own flaws and shortcomings and sins and Allah Knows Best"
