  "transcript": "says you have mentioned that the Dua of looking into the mirror is unauthentic now if people say this Dua because it has a beautiful meaning to it can we read it not while looking into the mirror but other times is it okay and if few people read it while seeing themselves in the mirror even after knowing it's not authentic then does it become B what is the Hadith what is the Dua the Dua is that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and this is a weak Hadith when it mentions the mirror whenever he looked into the mirror he used to say Allah oh Allah as you have perfected my creation that is the physical appearance also perfect my moral conduct and my character because what you have as in terms of physical appearance is nothing when it comes in comparison to your character and your moral conduct how many handsome men and gorgeous beautiful women are there today Millions but who among them is beautiful and character kind honest generous Brave does not cheat does not lie few so this Dua is a request and you're urging Allah asael to perfect you inside out now the Hadith is authentic so whenever you want to say Allah or as you have perfected my appearance and my creation also perfect my character you can say this whenever you want now only to limit it when you look in the mirror the is not authentic but can we say it the answer is yes you can say it because it's a Dua and some schools of thought say that the weak Hadith when it comes to things that are not related to Halal andam things that are not related to things that are related to normal things that gets you closer to Allah then this is permissible to uh say inshallah Khan okay sister am"
