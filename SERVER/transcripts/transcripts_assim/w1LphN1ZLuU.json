  "transcript": "i think we have farooq from sweden uh i have two questions one regarding the obama i know that we do follow after the adam or any evidences for such if if there is so farooq's questions number one we know that it is sunnah to repeat after the evan and to say the prescribed dua and we will get the intercession of the prophet alaihis allah accordingly now what to say when the irma is being called well the scholars of islam looked into it and said the hadith talks only about the adhan and the process to be followed but there is no hadith none whatsoever that talks about iqamah so the answer by default would be to say nothing how is that of oh sheikh it's the same wording and most likely it's a time of answering the dua etc all of these are speculations assumptions without proof we have no say because as the scholars say that ibadat forms of worship are based on a tawkif they're based on evidence i cannot come and say i think this irvada looks fancy let's do it do you have any evidence from the quran no but sounds good man no this is bidah yeah come on everything you guys say why is it bitter well because the prophet didn't do it ali and he's the one who said whoever innovates in our religion what's not part of it it's rejected so why would it be something nice why do you claim it's a bidder the prophet encouraged us to pray in congregation and he also prayed after the so why not pray these two sunnah as long as we're all in the masjid in congregation okay that's a nice thing but during the lifetime of the prophet sallam did he ever perform such a congregational prayer of turakasuna after the guy says no says okay why didn't he do this either he did not know that it was rewarding or he knew but he kept it secret and either choices is kufur because you're accusing the prophet assam either by ignorance or by betrayal the third option is that you're innovating you're doing a bidder and this is a bidder so in a nutshell brother farooq you must not say anything when the when the is being called nothing some people when the imam when the mother says and this is not from the authentic sunnah and we should refrain from saying that you"
