  "transcript": "Asaph's question was that he went back to his hometown and he is saying that the issue of giving Dawa to the people now how is that to be done the issues you're asking about unfortunately are prevailing nowadays among the Muslims celebrating birthdays this is in the vast majority of Muslims who are not practicing is a normal thing they tell you that this is not part of their religion and there's nothing wrong in it we say it is not part of the religion but is it is part of their customs so you are imitating the disbelievers something the Prophet did not do either his thoughts are all his companions or the tab earring or the tabi tabi mean picking it up and adopting it is inappropriate for a Muslim it's sinful the Prophet said I assume in the hadith about the lognormal may Allah be pleased with the man with his father woman - Abraha becoming and whoever imitates a people he is from among them so imitating the people in what it is only theirs when I travel I wear a t-shirt and a pair of jeans am i imitating the Kafar no the vast majority of Muslims wear it if I'm invited into an official occasion I wear a suit but if I were to put a Texan hat this is worn only by the kuffar this is not permissible if a woman wears a cameo a kimono I think it's called I am I don't know the Japanese women dress which is make them very tight and walk like inches every step of the way this is imitating the disbelievers this is not our customs we are not allowed to imitate them we have our own traditions and dignity and dress code and we are identified by it so this is totally different celebrating birthdays and even worse Christmas Christmas is something religious New Year's is not religious it's according to their customs and imitating the disbelievers in it these things are unfortunately prevailing among the ignorant among the Muslims how to give them dower you have to look at the bigger picture I don't focus on the small things because it will be an issue of debate on and off on and off but give them that in the bigger picture and that is by having them love to follow the Quran and to follow the Sunnah to appreciate the dignity and the honor they have in abiding by the Sunnah to appreciate their the pride of Islam by not imitating the disbelievers generally speaking once you build this up once you build the love of the Sunnah and every single thing in their lives it would be easy for us Allah to redirect them and tell them that we have to leave this for the sake of Allah Azza WA JAL see I always give the same example and it's a beautiful example and this is why I always repeat it life our lives is a big picture Islam is a frame in Islam we are told to put this frame and cut all the loose edges from the sides of our lives so we have to cut all our desires or our wishes and habits and customs and hobbies that go out of the frame of Islam once we do this Islam fits like a glove over our lives and we are properly considered to be a proper practicing pious Muslims if you fail to do this you're not a proper Muslim you're not a practicing Muslim because the peep now say oh I cannot give up this hobby like I love this wish that I have these desires these habits so they start to break the edges of the frame and bring duct tape and bring extensions of wood and use nail and hammers to reform this frame eventually you have a distorted frame that fits your life but this is not Islam it's a new thing it is not the frame of Islam that fits your life and I hope this answers your question"
