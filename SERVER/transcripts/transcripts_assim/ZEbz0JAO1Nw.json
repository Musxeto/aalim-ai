  "transcript": "so NASA Rena says that she lives in India and basically she is interested in opening a boutique a shop where she sells women's clothing whether it is dresses short sleeves pants trousers leggings whatever so she says what's the ruling on that see this is a controversial issue basically selling is Helen well I had a Louisville bear muharram Arriba Allah has made selling and transactions halal and Allah has prohibited usually and interest-based launched so selling is halal what's the ruling on selling the pen halal it's not mine but hypothetically this a cup this PDA whatever hello but if I know for certain that it will be used for something that is prohibited then selling it would be prohibited so what's the ruling on selling a kitchen knife Charl a woman comes and buys a kitchen knife she uses it in her kitchen no problem but if I know that a particular individual who had just had a fight in front of me with a man who's bigger than him and the man beat the heck out of him so he comes to my shop and says quickly give me this knife how much is it $10 his ten dollars give it to me quickly and I can see sparks coming out of his eyes and that he's going to kill this person with using this knife or at least attack him then selling it is totally prohibited for me the concept I hope it's clear now selling clothes in a boutique might be halal might be Haram if I am certain that the clothes we'll be used in Haram is not permissible if I'm not certain it can be used in Harlem but it also can be used for halal a woman comes and buys lingeries from me obviously she's not gonna do this and wear it in the streets she's gonna wear it to her husband which is Haddad so there's no problem in that so the scholars say that you have to evaluate and see if you are certain you must not sell if you're doubtful or uncertain then selling it is Allah insha Allah"
