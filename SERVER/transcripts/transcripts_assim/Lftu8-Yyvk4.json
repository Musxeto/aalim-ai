  "transcript": "Bin Ammar from Morocco. Assalamu Alaikum. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi. Sheikh, many of my colleagues call each other like hajj when they see each other or one of them does something strange like they say, what's up hajj or like it's not like that hajj. And they say it in a way like to make others laugh or something like that. And when I hear when I hear this, I like deny it in my heart, but I don't say anything. And once I advised one of them and told him like that hajj is a religious term and it's better to avoid such a thing. He said to me that in our customs hajj means an old person. So is what they are doing mocking of the religion? And am I sinful for like sitting with them? First of all, this is not mocking the religion because hajj is not a religious terminology. In the sense that in many Arab countries, they have this culture. When people come back from hajj, they win the title of hajji or hajj. So whenever they would like to address them, instead of saying mister, they say al-hajj Asim, al-hajj Abdullah. And this is not from Islam. It's a cultural thing, especially in places where hajj was a delicacy or something that was exclusive only to a very handful selected people. It is not a religious terminology because I pray five times a day and nobody comes up to me and says ya musalli, because I pray. Or when I fast, they say ya saim. So hajj here is not an Islamic terminology. And it's true. People may call different people ya hajj. For example, when you go to Mecca, whoever is in front of me, he said ya hajj, give us way. And he's not a hajji, but it's just like saying ya sheikh. Also in Arabia, we often say to any Tom, Dick or Harry, ya sheikh, kam saa? Not that he's an old person or a scholar even, because usually sheikh is reserved to people of knowledge. And in some countries and cultures, it's reserved to people of wealth. And in many cultures, it's reserved to any Tom, Dick or Harry, anyone, even a janitor or a servant. You say ya sheikh, please do this and that for me. Other countries, they may call anyone ya Muhammad, even if he's a Christian. Based on that, Muhammad is the most popular name in the world. So they tend to call it as a name of, it's like what people say, bro, do this for me. And he's not a brother, but it's just something that they say. So I don't see any mocking of the religion. Should one avoid it? It's best to avoid it. But again, you can't force people to do things they don't want, especially when we don't have any clear evidence that this is something that is haram. Thank you."
