  "transcript": "what is the rule in a divorce for visitation Arrangements between the father and the child is it allowed for the father to enforce overnight stays through the courts in a non-islamic country when the mother doesn't give permission for overnight stays and who has the custody over the child that is only one year old first of all this is something that has to reach an agreement between the spouses as for the father he's the father he has the rights of visitation he has the rights of having his child stay overnight but when the child is one year old no this is too much he needs to be a little bit older in order to be taken care of without the presence of his mother as for the cfir court stating the rules of custody and the meetings and the likes you have no other choice if one of the spouses or the divorced couple insist on going to man-made laws that go against Islamic Shar he's committing a very very major sin some Scholars say he's exiting the fold of Islam for turning his back to Allah's law and insisting on taking man made law as in the case for example when a woman divorces her husband and insists on taking half of his property half of his wealth half of his business the law is on her side by doing this she is throwing the law of Allah behind her back and not paying any attention and rather preferring man-made law over Shar and this takes her out of the fold of Islam even if she prays and goes for Hajj and fasts Ramadan as mentioned in chapter 5ah in verse 44 45 and 47 so this is a huge sin that people are unaware of that may take them out of the fold of Islam and Allah Knows Best"
