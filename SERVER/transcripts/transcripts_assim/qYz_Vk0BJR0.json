  "transcript": "not over him at hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa november oath here my ten little I mean sayidina muhammadin wa ala aalihi wa sahbihi ajma'in my bad dear brothers and sisters in islam assalamu alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh after the death of mother Khadijah may Allah be pleased with her the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam was in mourning he was sad and he had so many things on his plate the Companions noticed that they noticed that he had girls in his home to take care of with no woman in the house he had so many obligations regarding his followers or an that is revealed to him idol worshippers that he is obliged to give Dawa and to call them to Islam how to protect those who followed him and believed in him so many things were occupying his mind with a touch of grief and sadness that no one can misses only then a suggestion for him get married was proposed to the Prophet also Salaam by how Allah bent Hakim and see she was the wife of earth man even mother owned one of his close companions so she she suggested Oh prophet of Allah why don't you get married so the Prophet said to her alayhi salatu salam who-who should I get married to what are the proposals that you have for me she said a virgin or someone who's not a virgin you pick so he asked her who was the virgin she said the daughter of your beloved companion the most beloved person on earth to your heart abu bakr as-siddiq his daughter aisha then the Prophet said Alice awesome who is the nun virgin and she said soda bint Zima and the Prophet is salatu salam praised her and complimented her when he heard her name so the Prophet said to her go and check them out ask whether there is acceptance or not how low went to Abu Bakr his house and this is something that we will talk about tomorrow insha'Allah and then she went to sodas house she met mother soda and she asked her or actually she gave her the glad tidings what blessings and goodness from Allah had come your way so she said what is that and she said to her the prophet alayhi salatu salam had sent me to ask for your hand soda was overwhelmed with joy this is something that had never ever crossed her mind not in her wildest dreams and she said to her I wish meaning that I am more than happy to accept and I wish that this can materialize but I'm still not believing it please go and speak to my father and so this father was not a Muslim and her brother was not a Muslim as well and he was a staunch enemy of Islam but at the time he was at Hajj so holla went to meet this old frail man and she said to him Muhammad the son of Abdullah had sent me to ask for sodas hands this non-muslim although all the idol worshipers were at war and were at with a lot of enmity and hatred to the Prophet Allah saw some end to the religion that he had brought to them when he heard his name he said he is an honorable worthy man this is the first thing that came into his mind and he said it and he asked Allah you proposed to me now what about your friend soda does she accept him as a suitor to her she said she loves that so the father said call her to me so they came he addressed his daughter Muhammad has sent a proposal to you and he's an honorable worthy person would you like me to marry you to him she said yes Father so he said to her - holla call him and he came and he got her married to him so who is this Saluda may allah be pleased with her and what is her story you see when a person is used to traveling first-class and in staying in five or seven stars hotels it would be difficult for him to go a little bit below his standard and we know the standard of hadiza may Allah be pleased with her so why did the Prophet Ali salatu salam marry after her this soda and who is she what does she have well sodas name is soda bent Zima hypnotized Allah Maria al-qura she and her mother's name was a shoe mousse been twice she's the first woman the Prophet married after the death of his late wife Khadijah been to Hawaii late may Allah be pleased with her and the Prophet remained with soda for three years he was married to her alone for three years she had no other co wives so what is the story of soda soda was among the first to accept Islam among the Companions in Mecca she and her husband who was her cousin his name was a sacra nimnim they both accepted Islam suffered greatly on the hands of the idol worshipers in Mecca because they did not have that much power or influence and they did not have the backing of a strong tribe to defend them you see when Muslims accepted Islam in Mecca each person had one of the dignitaries of Mecca to protect him though that dignitary himself used to torture other Muslims and used to express enmity against Islam but due to a reason or the other that individual that went into his protection was safe from others soda and her husband did not have that protection so they fled Mecca and they migrated to Abyssinia they crossed the Red Sea in boats on the allah knows what kind of boats were they and they lived there under the protection of Ana Joshi who gave them safe haven and allowed them to worship Allah as they wished they fled with their Eman with the religion they fled prosecution all what they wanted was to worship allah azza wajal that's it nothing else let us worship our God and this is what Allah mentioned in surah al-buruj women are Momin whom Allah I you my noble ahilla Aziz Allah meet the enemies of Islam the only thing that they do not like is that we worship Allah alone if Muslims were to worship other than Allah the non-muslims would be okay with that they will not prosecute them they would not fight them they would not kill them the main reason for their attacks their hatred their enmity their will to annihilate Muslims is because Muslims worship Allah alone and they submit their will to Allah alone no hidden agendas Muslims are like an open book you can tell exactly what they think what they're thinking about so they stayed in Abyssinia worshipping Allah though their hearts were still connected to Mecca to the Kaaba to their homeland and to their surprise rumors spread like wild fires it spread like wildfire in Abyssinia among the Muslims that all the idol worshipers have accepted Islam they were so happy they were so joyful because now they can see the light at the end of the tunnel they realized that this is the time for them to go back to their homeland only to discover after a treacherous journey across the raging sea in boats that only Allah knows what it was made of when they reached Jeddah and then moved on foot to Mecca in a journey that took them four or five days when they reached they're exhausted and tired they were faced by the brutal reality that what they had heard about the idol worshipers accepting Islam was fake news it was a lie so each one of the migrants looked for one of the dignitaries to enter in his protection and they managed to do so except as a cron and his wife soda they had no one and after that long journey a sacrum who was in his late 50s maybe early 60s fell ill and died leaving a widow who was Muslim among her family who were idol worshippers she had no one to turn to she had no one to seek his protection so you can imagine the grief and sorrow she was in after all what she had suffered throughout the years and for what for just simply worshiping Allah the Almighty here was the breakthrough he was the salvation when the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam proposed to her she accepted in a heartbeat she would not think twice who would think twice what we can learn from this is that the prophet alayhi salatu salam marriages were not based on his desire of women though that would have been totally acceptable and normal no one in his right mind would condemn a man for liking women this is human nature men like women and this is why they get married and this is what allah mentioned in the quran that it was beautified in men's hearts the love of women of children of gold and silver all of these things were made beautiful to us by Allah Azza WA JAL but what you should notice and pay attention to that the Prophet a little of Sam was not as they accused him of being a womanizer when he was 25 years of age in the prime of his youth and strength he married a woman 15 years older than him and stayed law lawful and loyal for 25 more years not having a second wife not having a concubine nothing totally devoted for her love when she died he could have chosen anyone from the Muslim companions around him anyone would have been honoured to give him his daughter or his sister he could have chosen Miss Universe if he was looking for less than desire he remained unmarried for a while and when they the Companions proposed to him that he gets married he married a woman in her early 50s a woman described in the books of history as being huge and big in size that anyone could identify her those she though she is covered from head to toe but she can be identified by her size in an authentic hadith Rome are used to tell the prophetess Salam why don't you cover your women and not let them go out and one day soda went out of the prophets house sorry so Sam fully covered and Omar saw her and say said to her o soda we recognize you we know that your soda so she went back immediately and complained to the Prophet erase salif's of what Roma had said and then Allah revealed to the Prophet ala so Sam that it is permissible it's okay for them to leave their homes for necessities like at the time answering the call of nature which was done outside the city for everyone they didn't have any toilets in their homes at the time so she was a book a big woman in size and no one had ever said that she was beautiful or glamorous or wealthy or that she had anything special in her that would attract men and we don't say this male of a bid to discredit her or to look down upon her she's our mother no one disrespects his mother but it's just for you to contemplate is the Prophet Muhammad that is awesome a womanizer he chose a woman only for her religious commitment she's a widow she's alone and she needed someone to protect her the Prophet took it upon himself to be that someone he married her he opened her house for her she stayed with him for three years and the Prophet did not go and look for any other woman though he could have but he didn't and this is a practical lesson that the Prophet is giving us allahís alot was sallam giving men that when you get married is not the beauty that counts it's not the wealth it's the chemistry that you find with this woman who if she is Allah fearing she would make your house a paradise three years the Prophet lived with her never-ever alayhi salatu salam complained about her or said anything negative about her or the books of history reported a fight between them she was a good righteous pious woman and the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam loved her she was also a witty smart woman after the prophet alayhi salatu salam married different wives for many different reasons as we will come and discuss this inshallah she felt that she was too old for the prophet alayhi salatu salam to give him his marital rights so she took the initiative and said to the prophet alayhi salatu salam o prophet of allah i love what you love and on what I care about is your comfort and peace of mind and because you love Ayesha more than your other wives I grant and give willingly and happily my night to Aisha so every night you go to your wives when it's my night don't come to me go to Aisha and when sis has night you go to Aisha so you spend two nights with her rather than one night with her and one night with me the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam appreciated that for her mother aisha herself she said there is no woman on earth I would like to be in her shoes I wish I can be like her except soda Benzema she is one heck of a woman when she got old she gave her night to the prophet alayhi salatu salam as a gift and she gave that night from herself to me so the Prophet used to give me Aisha two nights and all the rest of his wives one night each she was a wise woman she did not have what we call possessive love nowadays women want to own their husbands he should not leave the house without telling me where he's going I would occupy his mobile phone with missed calls until he answers where are you what time are you coming back why don't you tell me and if he were to think of getting married again she would turn his life into a living hell this is possessive love this is not realistic no one says woman go and search for another wife or your husband no one says this but if it were inevitable if he is in need - getting to get married a woman has to be as marked as soda weighs the pros and cons and knows when to take a step back and let the ball rolling the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam said to the wives of the prophet when they gathered once and they asked the Prophet Allah salatu salam o prophet of allah which one of us wives will be the first to die after you to catch up with you after death which one is the first to die so the Prophet said that in salatu salam the longest the one with the longest hand or longest arm so they brought a measuring tool and they started measuring their arms to know which one of them was the longest arm and they found that zina been Josh was the one with the longest arm after the death of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam it was soda that died first only then they understood the meaning of the longest hand or the longest arm which means the most of you who gives charity the most and the most generous of them all was soda may Allah be pleased with her the mother of the poor and the needy she used to give all what she had to the poor Ahmad once sent her money and she looked at it and she said what is this it's like dates so many of them and within minutes she distributed the whole sack of gold and silver to the poor and the needy and she left nothing for herself this was soda bent Zima the mother of the believers a woman that had nothing to attract men there is normal men to get married to her yet she drew the attention of the prophet alayhi salatu salam with her Eman with her religious commitment and this is what qualified her to be the mother of the believers your mother and mine may allah azzawajal be pleased with her she died at the reign of Omaha table may Allah be pleased with him and some say that she died at the year of 54 Hedra and allah azzawajal knows best ha ha Allahu Alem when especially in melee Aslam was allah llahu wa sallim wa barik i don't be in a Muhammad while he was happy here to me assalamu alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh today i'm gonna talk about the book interactions of the greatest leader prophet muhammad sallallahu alayhi wa sallam reminded us through his guidance and example that islam is complete submission to the will of allah for one who submits a mere declaration or display of belief will not be taken for success but his or her heart and soul will certainly be put to test allah tested the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam severely in order that he sallallahu alayhi wa becomes an example for his companions to follow similarly he tests the believer to see whether he lives a righteous life in accordance with the instructions and commands set by Allah all lives according to what his desires dictate whether the faith he displays is firmly rooted in his heart or is it merely on the surface he will be tested to see whether he will continue to have faith and love of Allah when in a calamity as he does when in comfort whether he will continue to remember and worship Him if given bounties and comforts of life as he does when he lives a modest life Allah will undoubtedly test him to see if his faith trust and love of him is unconditional or is it conditioned upon good health and a comfortable life free from stress and anxiety the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam showed us through his own example that for a righteous Muslim this life is a testing ground where he will continue to be tested until he meets Allah for him tests will be conducted on earth while he lives are not after he dies he knows that as soon as death arrives and he steps into the next world his tests are over there he only receives the result of his tests and enjoys the fruits of the deeds that he committed during a short span of time called life assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh um aisha says can a woman correct from behind if the imam makes mistake in recitation of the Quran during Salah what if there are only women praying behind there Muharram Imam in this condition can one of them correct him the general rule is that the prophet alayhi salat wa salam once was leading the congregational prayer and one of the Companions spoke out of ignorance he did not know that speaking is not allowed and he started saying things so the companions started clapping on their thighs after the prayer was over the Prophet corrected the situation taught the man who needed teaching and then addressed the Companions that if anything happens in the salat you should say subhanAllah to draw attention for clapping is for women so if a woman during the salat notices that the imam did not sit for the first issue hadn't stood up she claps to bring her his attention that you made a mistake why because she's not allowed to talk during salat now this differs when women or a woman pray with a group of muharram or one maha so in this case if you are praying in the house with your moms your father your brothers and maybe your sons all of them are there your MA none of them is a nun Muharram if the a man makes a mistake there is no problem none whatsoever for a woman to speak out and correct the mistake of the a map and if he makes a mistake in movement she can say subhanallah not clap because the reason for not speaking is that none Muharram may be affected by her voice how soft it is and Shaitaan could come and mess up with their minds during salat but muharram brothers fathers uncles sons they all know her voice and they know her there is no problem in her to speak but if there is a single man with them who's a nun Muharram this is a no-go Sohail says if Allah has decreed everything and written down how we will spend our lives and where we will end whether hell or paradise then what is our role in all this and why should we work hard when our destiny has already been predestined Sohail this question is problematic because one of the six articles of Eman actually the last one of them is known as one took me Nabil hidari hi he washe ra to believe in predestiny whether good or bad so to believe in predestiny you have four things that you must believe in first a laws knowledge of what was in the past in the present and the future and what did not happen how would it be if it were to happen to a laws writing of such destiny three allows creation of such things that will happen and for a divine will so you have to believe in all of that in order for you to believe in predestiny so when we you say then why should we work hard when our destiny has already been preordained question number one do you believe Allah is knowledgeable and says yes hamdullah do you believe that Allah is fair and just the answer is yes hamdulillah do you believe that Allah Azza WA JAL owns everything in this universe the answer is yes in this case you should act and behave to the best of your ability because you do not know what Allah has pre-ordained for you because if you believe in destiny then you should know that everything is written down but you don't know whether I'm going to do a sin or I'm going to pray 2 rakaats you choose and the choice of yours is already preordained you have a choice you see but Allah preordained upon me to do this I say go to the highest building in your town 20 30 40 stories high look down it's a long way now you jump if Allah preordained that you'll fall on your feet safe unharmed and walk away it will happen but if not you will die will you do that I said no of course not am I crazy why not said because I know that I'm gonna die likewise if you sin you gotta go to hell will you send mmm no I don't think I have to send I shouldn't sin okay why why do you cook food so that I can eat if I don't eat I'm gonna die of hunger why don't you say it's already preordained I'm just gonna sit and watch if Allah wants to fill up my stomach Allah would do that so you have to acknowledge these things in order not to allow Shaitaan to play and manipulate your mind we have Mohammed from Nigeria salamualikum' shaikh ali khan salaam I apologize for taking so much time off the phone yes nothing okay Mohammed from Algeria yes sir I am a man in the Sweden any new Imam Mossad I can't speak good English can I speak I can ask the question in Arabic please yes yes go ahead but make it short because I have to translate it for that viewers okay yes he had come a tad now yes I know mr. Khalid al-mihdhar kid on my scale Kabir I did follow that infringer will ensure America market value and she said Ramadan MPD she who keep the stop another weapon semihot I come with a she had Xavier absolute rated Alek okay Barak illogical so brother Mohammed he said he's from Nigeria but now he's asking about an issue of Sweden so maybe Nigeria is a town in Sweden ah I haven't been there so yet so he's asking about a common problem worldwide and this problem is always found in UK when measure is actually do some sometimes you find an hour and a half difference between opinions this can't be this much an hour and a half the only 5 minutes 10 minutes I can tolerate this but when you say an hour or an hour and a half so in Sweden especially when there is problem with the shortness of the night when they have like 4 hours 5 10 minutes more would add a lot of value to them so they're having problem with the moon sighting as well ok Mohammed this isn't something that be answered in a very direct and precise manner because the moon sighting depends on the Islamic Authority in Sweden so if you have an Islamic Center that the majority not all because definitely will not have all the Muslims collaborating with it but the majority of Muslims consider that Islamic center or that Islamic sharia board to give them the rules on divorce marriage inheritance fatwas to rule cases between Muslims so they considered to be an Islamic Authority they give the timings of Ramadan and eat and you have to follow that whether they do this through calculation which is wrong or they do this through sighting of the moon which might not be very accurate or possible or they do it through following Saudi Arabia which a lot of the Islamic centres are doing nowadays especially in the UK because it's always difficult to cite the moon always clouds raining etc so they thought it is safer to be with Saudi Arabia all the time and a lot of scholars have permitted that so this is for moon sighting as for fetcher prayer and Asia prayer and moderate prayer etc sunset we have no problem in everybody knows when sunset is but even though if it is not possible the scholars have to improvise and come up with a calculation a method of calculation the most reliable method of calculation that I know of is on malpua when you have an app it tells you would you like it to be collaborated or to be synchronized with Karachi University or with esna or with the Muslim League or with amon korra choose o McCory this is the best forefather Laura Esserman rib timings Asia is not accurate because they always have it as at one and a half hours after sunset throughout the whole year eleven months and in Ramadan they make it two hours which is totally wrong so what to do when it comes to Isha you can use the University of Karachi or any other one because usually it is almost accurate why do we say that o McCory calculation is accurate because this is what the great scholars such as solid fusion has stated here in Saudi it was said that the failure time is not accurate and so many people came and said no this is too early you have to wait another 15 minutes to pray or 17 minutes and she came and said this in that so they confused the people i heard this from sheikh muhammad and soil he'll manage it himself when i asked him this question he said i asked chef solid follows an myself so this is a connected chain of narrators and shakes our heifers and said my son i went to a place outside the outskirts of Riyadh and I spent the whole night facing the east anticipating and waiting for the honest or the true dawn to break and once I noticed it it was horizontal it coincided exactly with omoi timetable so dependent this inshallah you will be successful Abdul from the from the US okay we think I think we lost Abdul okay Tish waar says if the husband tells his wife not to go out or not to do something and if you did it you would be divorced well she actually be divorced if she did it and what should the man do if he wants to uplift that condition this statement is known to the scholars as conditional divorce and what do we mean by conditional divorce it means that you make it as a condition if you do this you're divorced if you raise the cup you're divorced if you open the door you're divorced if you don't cook food by two o'clock in the afternoon you're divorced now real men don't say this only people with little intellect who are unable to control their wives or at least to communicate with them they would use this format in this condition and it's a long issue of dispute among scholars the most authentic opinion is it depends on your intention demands intention so the woman doesn't know what's his intention a man says if you go to your sister's house you're divorced and the woman goes to her sister's house and she comes back the man calls Shay I said so and so on so what to do should I kick her out of the house not my wife anymore or what is there an expiration the question is directed to the husband when you said that statement did you intend to divorce her if the man says by Allah I did not intend to divorce it I just wanted to stop her from going there there because every time she goes to her sister she comes back and she twists her mind and she nags mean demands more money etc so I just wanted to prevent her for going there I have children I love my wife in this case we say this is not a divorce this is a conditional oath and it was broken go and feed 10 poor people if the man says my sister-in-law runs a brothel and only prostitutes go to her house and I told my wife if you go there your divorce because I don't want to have a wife having any connection with such bad reputation in this case the divorce takes place and a large version knows best Abdul from the US Abdul yes yes ah he why it can sound a lot thank you very much all information is being given us I've been working you from Buddha from United and now I am in red I'm working you here I'm very sorry mute your television Abdul mute your television yes what can I do for you are he okay my question to you is we are trying power at home now in the riad yeah my question to you is I'm saying that our and we're at home and it is permissible to follow the Kaaba from the TV okay any more question okay so Abdul is asking about the ruling on praying behind a TV screen as they pray live in Mecca in the holy Masjid al-haram so can we pray in congregation the answer is no this is not permissible and if you do pray you have is invalid first of all because this is not an actual congregation this is virtual they are in a city and you are in another city their sunset is different to your sunset their mother is different than your mother not only that even if you were in Mecca itself and you were residing in one of them towers adjacent to the harem and you can see the Kaaba and you can see the worshipers doing Tawaf and you can hear that more than and the Imam leading the prayer you cannot pray in your room though you can see everything below you why because if anybody calls and says where are you you would say I'm in my room you wouldn't say I'm in the Masjid so are you with the congregation you cannot say I am with the congregation because you're not so their prayer in their rooms is not permissible let alone to pray behind a TV screen and la knows best Farha says is it permissible to recite the prescribed words after sunnah prayer instead of for prayer what if we are in a hurry and want to pray Sunnah immediately the prescribed Sunnah is that you recite your dua your ask our that is after the fact and after you finish your of car you go and pray your Sunnah this is the norm but if someone has an emergency and he has to leave there's no problem for him to pray the Sunnah in a different location where he prayed the fog it is not permissible to pray your Sunnah in the same place you pray the father as we've mentioned this before unless you speak to someone and afterwards you can leave and read your earth car without a problem insha'Allah bushra says can we give food items or basic groceries with our zakat money because of this lockdown as many people lost their jobs and they do not have money to feed their families these are two different and separate things zakat money must be given in cash to the poor if you want to give them extra charity by buying them food and groceries may Allah reward you this is excellent but if you want to buy with the zakat money food to give it to them this is not permissible unless they authorized you why because they know what to do with the money better than you do so you think that oh they are in lockdown so they need groceries the poor thing maybe they said no we want cash we have to pay for medicine we have to give somebody's his debt that he's been calling us and bugging us for the past six months or we have to pay the rent or we have to pay the electricity bill so you don't know what they need they are poor and needy you give them cash and let them act according to what suits them best but if you take their authorization and tell them listen your zakat money it is X Y Z it will buy you only this much but if you authorize me to buy you groceries and food I can buy wholesale and I can give you this much instead of this much which your money could buy and they say yes please go ahead then there is no problem in doing that and Braun says in some places the Muslims who are dying of covered 19 their bodies are not being handed over to their families and they are being cremated what is the ruling about this in Islam it is totally prohibited to cremate the bodies of Muslims and non-muslims alike this is not permissible it is part of other faiths if we can Cal call them faiths other religions so this is totally prohibited but if you are in a totalitarian regime and you have no way to get the body of your brother of your relative to give it an Islamic barrier there's nothing you can do you don't have an army you cannot fight them because they have all the means of fighting so this is something that is beyond your capability to handle and Allah is most forgiving Subhanahu a soldier a sister says how should a husband and a wife develop love and companionship among each other as divorce rate is on the rise these days and youngsters have become very intolerant of each other and they don't think divorce is such a big deal because they say this is something halal so it's better to move on than live miserably this is a big problem and I faced this problem because I do counseling sessions and it handily lag we've managed to solve so many marital problems which most of them are based on eye-opening the wife thinks that she is not receiving her rights while the husband thinks that he's not receiving his rights and both parties only care about their rights and no one ever asks about their obligations not only that we tend to only see the short comings of the other side rather than seeing the good side so many sisters call and they complained about their husbands and I stopped them and I say don't mention anything bad about your husband tell me what's good in him and she starts saying I can't it's a very long list too it consumed the half hour that we have together so I said subhanAllah all these good things in him can't overwhelm and cover these short comings of his these small faults they're trivial and they managed to open their eyes and sees oops subhanAllah how ungrateful I were I was so couples need tutoring need to know what their rights but also what their obligations are they need to know the seer of the Prophet a sermon how he used to deal with his wives and how he used to tolerate them they have to know how important a man should be to his wife and her obligations towards him and at the same time a man has to know how to value his wife how to cherish her and to be good to her because the Prophet said that soon the best of you is the best - of you - his wives and I'm the best among you - his wives so these things can't come in a small capsule that you swallow and voila you become mashallah a super hero it needs knowledge it needs training it needs tolerance it needs to look from different angles to understand what is happening otherwise life and marriage would not go on this requires a lot of talk that cannot be covered in answering a Q&A session this is all the time we have tomorrow inshallah our program would begin at all I do not see is it one or two I think it's from one up from two o'clock yeah from two o'clock to till three o'clock p.m. Mecca time so from 1400 hours till 1500 hours Mecca time is shot a lot and it will remain till the end of the month at this time in the afternoon I hope inshallah to see you then and until then I leave you a Manilla was Salam aleikum la he what I get [Music]"
