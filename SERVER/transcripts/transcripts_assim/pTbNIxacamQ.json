  "title": "Permissible 2 sell Marketing Web design services 2 companies that may use for haram? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh so my question is concerning the permissibility of my job I'm worried that there may be two dubious things within it I'm working in the UK as a sales agent and I sell my company's marketing and Web Design Services to various Halal firms once I get the deal signed my company and the clients are likely to do dubious things such as include maybe photos of women without hijab on the client's website although that's not the main purpose of the website so let's say like for a construction firm so that's the first thing I'm a bit confused on if I would be blameworthy for that and the second thing which I'm a bit worried about I can answer you I can answer about one thing the second thing needs for you to go back down the line and and wait for the queue inshallah or call me tomorrow as for your question Hamza if your job is to sell designs or to market the services of your company which is a company that designs websites makes uh profiles for Halal companies sells uh these things there's no problem in that inshallah there is no problem in doing that as long as what you're doing is halal and you don't have prior knowledge of them including such Haram items which are little but Haram still which such as photos and the likes so in this part there is no problem in your uh income and Allah Knows Best"
