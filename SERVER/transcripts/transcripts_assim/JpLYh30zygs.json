  "transcript": "Roma from Spain yes guiding me to Islam alhamdulillah it was a great step but my question is resonated with a previous matter refusing I was a member of a Christian class and I was quite let's say intellectual searching for knowledge so I had a great library with so many books currently as a Muslim I don't need them neither I use them so I thought of selling them on a second hand website and with the money I get try to buy Islamic books or other teams or the Articles they say is this permissible because I can't serve disbelief between other people and is permissible to insert in the boxes Islamic small informative books that can that we can find in matches and if this is neither possible what should I do should I board the books this is my question okay brother Omar the ruling in Islam is that we can collaborate upon righteousness and virtue and we must not collaborate upon Vice evil and sin the books you have if the contents are halal or permissible if the contents are Islamic or can be beneficial you can sell those and benefit from the money but if the contents of these books are of an evil nature contents that call for Darwinism and evolution or promotes atheism or Christianity or Judaism or any other religion this is not permissible for you to sell and you have to dispose of this by burning it or by throwing it or shredding it so that no one would be harmed by what evil is in it and Allah Knows Best foreign"
