  "transcript": "well order Eli daddy said I me what he may assure it also awesome news theme Oh lahaina rahim alhamdu lillahi rabbil alameen sallallaho salam of our Academy Borussia lamitan Lily lemme nabina muhammad anwar ali he also happy as rain dear brothers and sisters in Islam Salaam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh the Prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam spent the first three years calling the people after he was revealed to after he was commissioned as a prophet anthem as and a messenger of allah so jeal he spent the first three years calling those whom he thought that would be accepting his call would be accepting his Dawa and it was done in secrecy because it was not wise to go ahead and announce it to the people when the age of Islam was still at its beginning when it was still very young among those who followed and accepted his message where Abu Bakr the first man to accept Islam of course rhodesia mella be pleased with her was the first woman to accept Islam and the first child was a little because the cousin of the prophet alaihi salam and the first of those who follow or who those who were slaves was zaid even Haditha may Allah be pleased with them all she may have questions please regarding those who converted to Islam and we know that they were pagans they used to commit crimes since prostrate to idols what about these actions after Islam that's a very good question and this is one of the reasons that they have accepted Islam so rapidly it is a well-known fact in Islam that the minute a person reverts to Islam all of his previous sins are washed away i'm giving the lass may allah be pleased with him he was one of the greatest enemies of islam but on the 8th fear approximately half of course after his eighth year after Hydra after the battle of high bar and before the Prophet SAW solemn conquered Mecca he came with a highly demon will heed and with others with from the elite to accept Islam so the Prophet SAW solemn spoke to them about his lamp and the usual thing would be an mabaya and mu by amines to give your allegiance and acceptance to Islam and to say that you accept the Prophet SAW Sullum so the prophecy Salem stretch his hand to amaryllis who was accepting Islam I'm put his hand stretched it then he pulled it away so the Prophet asylum ask him what did he do this what's wrong he said well I will accept Islam but on one condition i would like to have a condition I don't want to accept it as it is I'd like to have my own condition and the Prophet new sallallahu senem that he wanted to ask that Allah forgives all have his sins so the Prophet SAW Salem smiled and said I'm didn't you know that Islam he raises whatever was before it and this is one of the blessings of Allah if a person was the worst criminal ever if he committed adultery if he done harm to people if he was a crooked person if his heart was black because of the bad things that he has in his heart the minute he accepts Islam it is immediately erased and now he is facing a la sua gel with a new record with a white new record ready to be filled with good deeds and that is why most of the Companions accepted Islam on the spot and some of them it did not take much to convince because as we know Islam is a religion of nature it doesn't call you to do things against your nature and the this is one of the most appealing things in Islam for example in some religions it tells you that if you want to reach the peak in pi c you must not marry you have to remain unmarried until the day you die then you must not have sex and you must not enjoy life Islam says that this is a contradiction to nature this is something that Allah Almighty has built in us so I think no one can do this any there there can be people that may be able to do this but is this natural no Islam is a religion of nature and that is why there were three of the prophets allah Solomon's companions that were so eager on worshipping allah azzawajal to the extent that they went to the prophets houses and they started asking the mother of the believers the wives of the prophet saw said lamp about his daily routine in worship so they told them that the prof saw some praise and does this and does that and he fastened and they felt that this was very little not enough it's not enough we have disparage to worship Allah and we can do more so one of them stood up and said well as for myself I this is an oath that I pray every single night from sunset until the break of dawn I will never ever sleep the second man said well as for me I will fast all of my life so from the break of dawn until sunset I will not eat a thing or drink a thing and I die he'll only eat during night time the third one said well in this case I myself will not marry until I die which means that he will fight the temptations natural temptations of having having sex of multiplication he said that I will fight this and not marry again the prophets allah seldom heard about this and his companions came to him and told him that these three people said this and they will do this and this and this the Prophet was very angry at his a lot of surveillance and he went to the masjid he stood up in front of the muslims and he praised allah and he prayed on the prophetess m and then started to teach them what is this that i heard about people from my followers not wanting to sleep not wanting to eat not wanting to get married by allah i am better than you are and I know more of a la than you do and I more Allah feeling than you are yet I sleep and I pray I fast and I break my fast I eat during some days and I marry women by Allah those who want a way different than my way are not from my followers tisha you said the Roofus salah salem start this is Dawa secretly he started to call people in secretly so if I am in the same situation I traveled to a non Muslim country and I want to start calling people to Islam shall I do the same as above so semester to do or Yanni this is not clinical we have tackled this in a previous program and we said that it depends on your situation now the reason behind us studying the syrah is to look into the phases that the prophets allah salem followed in his lifetime and we will apply this in accordance to what we face for example if I go to Europe or if I go to the West in general calling people to Islam is not a crime that you will be punished for so it is not acceptable at all to call people in secret but I think many the religion is complete now and I have to apply the religion as a complete thing so I can till the one who is addicted to alcohol for example drinking why and so that I can ask him okay you have to gradually give up this habit this is this bad habit so I have to give him the final rule the final decision this is haram or any this is different completely to our topic what you're referring to are the things that were abrogated where NASA was there so at the very beginning Islam said that do not get close to prayer while you are drunk and before that it was they were asked what about intoxicants so Allah said that there are some benefits and there are some harm and the harm is more than the benefits and then the second stage was do not pray while you are in the drinking process if you're drunk do not come close to prayer which means that this limits their time of drinking and the third and final stage which obligated all the previous two was do not come close to intoxicants so this is different because this is obligation but what we're talking here about phases of Dawa and this depends entirely on the situation and I gave an example before just as a reminder if you go to a country where it is a crime to be a Muslim where it is a crime to recite the Quran as the case as it was in 20 or 30 years ago in the Eastern Block in the Soviet era it was a crime by law and all the muslims were 70 years and over those were the only one that knew online soldier the youngsters did not know anything except Lyla hello and vodka this was the only thing they knew and they were underground groups teaching the youngsters the fundamentals of their religion so here this is applicable we can use the secret phase because preaching Islam is a crime in these countries but if you go to a country where there's no oppression towards Muslims you can practice your religion in public then you have to practice your religion in public as we don't have anything to hide you get my point yeah it is very important for us as Muslims to show the world that we are transparent we have nothing to hide we are in the open we don't have any secret cells or whatever they accuse of of having because this is our religion we're proud of showing it and sharing it with with others but the only way acceptable for us to hide and conceal our religion and our when there is a threat on our lives or on a threat on the spreading of Dawa this al hamdulillah in the majority of the countries all over the world is is not practice unfortunately it might be practiced in some Arab countries where the regime's fear Islam and feel the call for Islam I have once met a group of brothers that cannot study any book afsaneh and this they're traveling from one city to the other I'm afraid that we have a break so do please stay tuned inshallah we will be right back if you're 18 or if you're 18 if you'll be muslim for 50 years or five minutes this is a show for you you know when five times a day I our foreheads touch the ground in prayer we beg for what's most important in our lives we want to be good people better muslims we want to serve Allah Almighty with all our hearts in the show let's talk every week we're going to talk about Islam in life how to relate with other people on how to serve Allah will have studio guests will have a live studio audience there'll be an email for you to write to talk I heard adopt TV so if you're looking for something different looking for something that will make you think maybe even touch your heart this is the show for you Salaam alaikum and welcome back as you know the most active one among the companions in calling the others was abu bakr siddiq may allah be pleased with him he tried his best to call those who were among the elite and among the poor ones he used to spend a lot of his money to buy the slaves and set them free such as Bilal and so on among those who converted or accepted Islam at the very beginning very very early stage where as Madonna fan sattva vikas a brahmana bin auf of a banana la palabra vanilla a Subaru awam they all accepted Islam at the very early stage and they themselves where the base that Islam stood on because they were the greatest companions of the prophet alayhi salatu salam I think it's not an easy task to be cause for the guidance of any person it's not an easy task but remember it's not your doing now don't mix up your effort with the guidance of Allah sahaja listicles it's a cause and remember that Noah may peace and blessing be upon him spent nine hundred and fifty years calling his people to Islam The Messenger of Allah Noah yet his son died as a non-muslim in the flood when he called him o son come and ride with us in in the ark he said no I will go to a mountain and I will stay away from water and he drowned we have to know also that the prophets allah salam did his best to call his uncle Abu Talib and he tried to convince him just say the word c'est la illaha illallah and I will use it to intercede I decide I'm a la even with those who and whom he loved he he was the one that took care of him yet Allah so jeal revealed to the prophet sallallahu salam that you do not guide those whom you love but it is Allah that guy's guides whom he wishes so it is not our effort though it is a reason because you cannot sit back and say well I pray to Allah that he guides all the people to Islam you have to work hard and you have to put all the effort that you can in this mission as one of the scholars used to say that that will work calling people to Islam if you give it part of you it's not enough it will only be enough if you'd give if you give it all of you all of your time all of your effort then you will find the fruits for your dad one present look listen little did exactly as abu bakr bucker I said they may allah be pleased with him did now the devil was in a secret phase and the prophets allah salaam work was so excellent to the extent that we have a number of companions each saying about himself that i was a quarter of the islam i was quarter of islam in the sense that there was only abu bakr the Prophet SAW salem bilal and myself and among them i was out of a fairy among them abdullah road and so many of the companions they all claim to be either the third of islam or a quarter of islam or one out of seven which means that the Prophet salah salem did not disclose the others to each to all so that it would be hidden and secret so that no one would leak some of the information cheers at this very early stage of doubt and besides being secretly did the prophet muhammad sallallahu slm concentrate or focus on some thing in particular that's a very good question we have to know that at this stage the Prophet sallallahu ala seldom did not teach the people how to pray as it was not made obligatory yet he did not ask people to pay the cat he did not ask people to perform Hajj he did not ask people to fast Ramadan so the only thing that the Prophet salah salem used to teach his followers was to believe in allah azzawajal to know Allah more and more by His blessing by his attributes the prophus allah salam only taught his companions the concept of hell and heavens he told him that whoever does well we'll go to heavens and whoever does bad will go to hell he taught them that Allah social was merciful that he was panna cotta was kind that he was powerful he kept on teaching them the Holy Quran weather whatever Quran was revealed to him he immediately taught it to them and they have they studied it and knew what allah azzawajal wanted from them you have to imagine the environment where the prophet saw salem was preaching his Dawa now everyone around them was a potential enemy who was waiting to kill them to attack them so they had to keep everything in secret secret they had to strengthen their faith and believe in Allah and this is the priority in all forms of Dawa yes that's why when the rock-solid lhasa absent-mindedness able to a Yemen he advised him the first thing to call the people of Yemen to was too they have to worship none but Allah alone and then if they accept that you have to inform them visas allah and his JK of course this this is quite true you have to go gradually with the people it is not wise for me as a Muslim to go to someone who is not a practicing Muslim and who may not be praying practicing a prayer prayer on time and who has so many bad things in him it is not Islamic for me to go and tell him your nails are long you have to cut them short yeah there are priorities so the first thing for me to do is to fix his belief in Allah soldier by calling him to worship Allah alone by fixing his misconceptions about Allah and about his a predestined registration destination and so on by doing this I am following the footsteps of the prophet salallahu a solution so in these years the only thing that the prophets assalam did was to titian doran to ask them to worship Allah as ocean alone and to prepare them for the following stage okay is there a order of the priorities of giving down I mean the five pillars of slab or there is another way your priorities usually are determined by the need for example if someone who is not a Muslim and there's so many bad things it would be unwise to tell him do not drink do not fornicate and the man is not a Muslim yes so my priority would be to call into Islam it there are always priorities even with Muslims who do not pray and at the same time who smoke okay what is more serious prayer prayer so I call them to pray and let them smoke while praying no problem because this is more important and fart important that smoking alone so you have to weigh the pros and cons to be able to know what your priorities are the prophet saw Salem was preparing the his companions and part of his preparation was to tell them to be tolerant not to be aggressive part of his teaching was to and preparation was to tell them of the things to come to them and this was done by telling them about the tales and stories of those who came before them for example he told them as in surah the bridge about the village that converted to Islam and the current read a leader a burger the dug ditches and filled it with fire and ordered anyone not who embraced Islam and refused to worship Him to be thrown in it so we were told that this what would happen if you stick to your faith that you have to be tested and probably this would end tragically but at the end you are on the winning side agree so he kept on trying to teach them not to seek anything for themselves to stand for the truth as him for the sake of truth not to stand up for themselves he also taught them how to ignore the ignorance ignore them by not going into discussions with them or go down to their level all of this is one of the prophecies of his that he is the true Messenger of Allah how is that good the prophet saw solemn kept on promising them you will prosperous you will win you will conquer the whole world everybody will follow your message and call but if you look at them situational situation that's strange we are unable to pray in the math we're unable to disclose that we are Muslims very fuels and they were on the handful of people only so this tells you that the message of the prophets are seldom was offending and real because he had the trust in Allah so jeal and Allah subhana Allah showed him that you will prevail ok she is the Ewing wisdom behind that the poor and the weak people who were the first to follow the Prophet salut salut this as mentioned again previously when Cesar asked abuso fian who follows him the weak and poor or the rich and strong and he told him the weak and poor this is the habit of the followers of all messengers that the week are the people that usually the weak and poor that follow the messengers why because they do not have anything to attach them to the ground the rich and strong have their power have their positions have their wealth to hold them down while the port have nothing to lose this is something that they believe then they're convinced that it is true so they accept it as it is I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program so inshallah until we meet next time fee amanillah assalamualaikum warahmatullahi avocado Oh Oh Oh who Oh"
