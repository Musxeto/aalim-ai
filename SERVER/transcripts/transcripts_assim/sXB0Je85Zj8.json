  "transcript": "says what's the ruling on inheritance inheritance is a lot to talk about and the time does not suffice us but it's important to know that there are principles for example inheritance happens either because of kinship asaba or because of marriage the allegiance and this happens when someone frees a slave there is a sort of inheritance between them and allah azzawajal has prescribed in the quran and also in the sunnah but the vast majority is in the quran of the rulings where percentages are given to some categories and other categories are not giving a particular percentage so the husband and wife they either get half quarter or one-eighth depending on the gender depending whether they have the deceased has an offspring or not so this is a fixed it cannot be increased or take the whole lump sum the mother gets a third or a sixth the father gets a sixth or the whole thing a third or a sixth all the whole thing so he inherits either through percentage or through the remaining the son and the daughter they also inherit but the daughters inherit in percentage if they have no male siblings so they either get a half if she's the only daughter or they get two-thirds if they are two daughters or more if they have a male sibling then they don't get a percentage they get the rest of the inheritance where the male gets twice the female and so on so it's a full package and you have to know the rulings and the circumstances and the conditions what blocks a person from inheriting so that you can understand"
