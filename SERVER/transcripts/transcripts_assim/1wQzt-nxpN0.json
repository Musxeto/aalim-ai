  "title": "I heard the Salaf were HAPPY with good and bad Qadr, so should we be happy when someone dies?",
  "transcript": "Ibrahim from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. Sheikh I heard recently the Salaf used to, how do you put it, they used to be happy with the bad Khadr and the good Khadr. And what is that? That they used to be happy, the Salaf used to be happy with the good and the bad Khadr, meaning they accept the good and the bad and they'll be they'll be pleased with whatever Allah gives them. No, this is not true. Who said this? I was watching it on YouTube. Akhi, Akhi, Akhi, there is a difference between being happy with a bad Khadr, which is the death of your son, the death of your mom, the death of your father. This is bad Khadr for you, which is a calamity. You're telling me that the Salaf, when their children died, they would throw a party and say, hey, my son died. Definitely not. So they were not happy. However, they were content. This is called Ar-Rida. Yes, this is a different thing. When the Prophet's son, and I apologize for interrupting, but they're just wasting, saving your time and mine and the viewers. When the Prophet's son Ibrahim died and he was an infant and he was the only male child, the only male offspring that the Prophet had at the time, Alayhis Salaam, when he was like 62 years of age. So he was very happy to have him as the idol worshipers were always mocking the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam for not having a male offspring that would carry his name. And they used to call him Al-Abtar, the one who's cut off. And that's why we read in the shortest Surah of the Qur'an, the one who hates you and says these awful thing about you is the one who's cut off and would not be remembered or mentioned later on in time. And this is a prophecy that is fulfilled till date. No one remembers Abu Jahl or Umayya ibn Khalaf or Utma ibn Rabi'a, Shayb ibn Rabi'a and the likes. Nobody knows who they are or calls their names. But the Prophet's name Alayhis Salaam is mentioned all over the world, five times a day, around the clock, seven days a week, and so forth. So when his son, whom he had great hopes on, all of a sudden died, he wasn't happy, he was content. So he said, Al-Qalbu yahzan wa al-'aynu tadma' wa la naqulu illa ma yurdi rabb wa inna ala firaqika ya Ibrahim wa la mahzunoon. The heart is saddened, the eyes weep, and we do not say anything except that which pleases Allah. But by Allah, we are saddened and heartbroken for departing you, Ibrahim. That's it. End of story and life goes on. So I hope this answers your doubt."
