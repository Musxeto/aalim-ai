  "title": "Rulings for a miscarried fetus Aqeeqah, Naming, Washing & Shrouding | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "finally maja says if a woman has a miscarriage what is the ruling for funeral Attica naming of the baby etc a child in a mother's womb is not considered a baby until it passes 120 days of pregnancy this is when the soul is breathed then so if you get a miscarriage before completing 120 days then this miscarriage a fetus or whatever is not washed is not prayed upon and you don't have to give a paper it is 120 days over then you have to wash it you have to shroud it you have to offer funeral prayer on it and bury it in the graveyard of Muslims and it's a different issue of dispute among scholars whether a period is recommended or not the most authentic opinion is that is recommended and that it is also recommended that you give a name to that miscarriage fetus and insha'Allah it will proceed you to Jenna drag you in the gates of Jannah interceding for you and for the parents that is"
