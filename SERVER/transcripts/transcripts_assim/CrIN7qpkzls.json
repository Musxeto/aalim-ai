  "transcript": "so my question is that um I couldn't find any evidence that wet impurities transfer so is it permissible for me to just neglect the ruling since there is a difference of opinion on the issue and there is no evidence for it especially if I feel the ruling could be difficult to follow due to my previous careless carelessness first of all it's not up to you to choose what to follow and what not to follow if you're not a student of knowledge that has the ability that has the necessary tools to search and investigate you cannot just shoot from the hip and say but because I was negligent and lazy and now the whole house is soiled with najasa so I search in Islam uh web Islam q a and didn't find anything satisfactory so everything is okay it's not up to you this is to the scholars to judge and say their verdict and the issue of people with OCD obsessive compulsive disorder regarding impurities and issues of najasa some people are so negligent even if they say see impurities in front of them they would say no this is dried or anything I I could care less okay wash it so no I don't want to and they walk with wet feet on it while they still see the traces of najasa and they know it's impure and then you come out of nowhere saying that I couldn't find any evidences proving that it transfers after drying why did the prophet sallam order the companions to pour a bucket of water on the urine of the Bedouin who urinated in the Masjid you might as well told them to just leave it until it dries off this is something that it's not this is not the place to discuss it but to answer your question Sammy no you're not qualified to get such a ruling and Allah Knows Best"
