  "title": "Can we use the English words & terms when giving Dawah like saying God, Jesus, Mary, etc",
  "transcript": "consider subscribing CD from Germany I'm sure there's maybe a person who claims to love God but is also insulting Allah so my question is if we make doubt to a person who doesn't know Arabic for example if you go to a English-speaking people that we calling the names of Allah Azul and his books and Messengers and Angels Etc in their language for example said saying Allah we say God instead seeing the Easter we say Jesus Etc I don't relate the beginning of the question to the end of the question in the beginning if I'm not mistaken you were saying about people insulting Allah they claim to love Allah but they insult Allah Allah is God they say they claim to love God but they don't know that Allah is God so they think this is the difference okay so so this is a misconception and a mistake that can be resolved easily so you may avoid the name Allah and you just can't say Jesus is Raisa the messenger of Allah you can say God in reference to Allah azzawajal until you convince them and you find some Middle Ground then you can explain to them that Allah is translated in your language as God and what are the attributes of God the following he's a Creator he's the facilitator he's The Giver of life and death he's a provider and these are the attributes of Allah so it's just the name that is confusing them because most likely due to the islamophobe media they're relating Allah to anything that is evil in their minds because of the media and that's why whenever they hear Allahu Akbar they associate it with a bomb or with someone going to kill to kill someone else not knowing that this is the inauguration of prayer it's a beautiful word and thicker and means of remembering Allah azzawajal so there is no problem in avoiding the Arabic terminology for a legitimate purpose like this and Allah Knows Best foreign"
