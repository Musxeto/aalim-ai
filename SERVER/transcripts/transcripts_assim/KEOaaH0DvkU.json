  "title": "\"Speak about Allah's grace upon you\" Should we hide or boast about Allah's blessings upon us? Assim",
  "transcript": "my question was how do we apply this ayah in our lives like we know that we don't tell all of our blessings to everyone so basically on what occasions to whom and which of our blessings do we proclaim this ayah is governed by other ayahs such as all family and followers of the wood peace be upon him act with the things that we have bestowed upon you in expressing your gratitude as for the ayah you've mentioned which is the last ayah of surah to speak about allah's grace upon you not necessarily boasting about oh allah has given me a million dollars allah has given me mansions allah has given me health and wealth etc rather not to conceal what allah has given you by showing the opposite you find some people saying that allah did not give me this or that oh allah has deprived me from health oh allah has not given me so much concealing what allah has given them so that the people would perceive them and would look at them with pity and a feeling of um not remorse feeling sorry for them and this is what allah azzawajal does not uh want you to do to show your any gratitude that oh allah azza has not given me when allah has given you this is a great way of expressing your ingratitude to allah azza rather speak out moderately to show people that allah has blessed them allah has graced them and as well as i were blessed and graced by allah azzawajal without boasting about it without attracting people's uh envy or evil eye rather not to conceal it and to say the opposite and allah knows best you"
