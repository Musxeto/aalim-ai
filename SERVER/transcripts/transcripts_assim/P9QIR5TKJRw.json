  "title": "Umdatul Ahkaam - Purity - Part 12",
  "transcript": "alhamd I believe that Hadith number 17 was not fully explained and therefore it would be much better for me that we go through it again inshallah to elaborate on some of the benefits we can learn from it so brother would you please read it for us abas may Allah be pleased with him and his father reported the messenger of Allah May the blessing of Allah and peace be upon Him happened to pass by two graves and said they their occupants are being tormented but they are not tormented for a grievous sin one of them did not keep himself safe from being defiled by urine while the other carried taals and namima between people he then called for a fresh twig and split it into two parts and planted one of them on each grave the companions asked him oh prophet of Allah why did you do this he said perhaps their punishment may be lightened as long as these Twigs remain fresh moist very good so we spoke about the dangers of not cleaning yourself properly for prayer and not protecting yourself from what would come to you when you urinate and not being able to clean that however we've also spoke about not allowing Shan to whisper to you and give you WIS that you are dripping that there's a drop or two left and this happens a lot with the practicing Brothers only practicing Brothers huh why because Shan knows how careful they are about things related to Purity to prayer so he makes life difficult and this is the way Shan Works he's very smart he is very stupid when he refused to prostrate as Allah commanded him other than that he's very smart his CV is so long yeah if you see the case uh studies that he had made and how many people he managed to deceive he's very smart so he comes to you if he finds that you are strong in Islam in religion and your commitment he makes life difficult he tells you instead of washing three times make it five you're a good practicing Muslim did you urinate well no clean yourself more and more and more maybe maybe something came out without you knowing every Salah you change your whole clothes take a bath he makes life difficult until he completely breaks you and I've seen a lot of Muslims lose IM because of this I've seen people personally I know that have lost IM not practicing not praying not doing anything because of these after being people of strong Iman practicing and some of them I know used to give lectures in Masid I've seen them personally I know them and look what happened but if he sees that you are soft in Dean so when you perform W only this portion this is all dry it's okay prayer instead of praying four you pray three well yeah next time inshallah I'll make it for and he goes on until he destroys your Dean completely by not having any de anymore so you have to be careful urinating is something that humans have been doing since Adam until they die you urinate in the day five six 10 times a day it's a normal process don't get confused urinate relax you finish urinating do not squeeze yourself do not squeeze your private parts T was asked so many times of about what is known in Arabic by meaning that you squeeze yourself internally or you actually squeeze your private part physically and says don't do this and used to say but I still feel like there's a drop or two and he said don't do this and when kept on asking for permission IB T told him that urine in your private part is like the milk in the mother's breast if you leave it it stays if you ask for it it comes out so it's the same methodology you urinate you finish you relax you pour water on your private part and move I feel don't care about what you feel neglect your feelings and then Shan will lose hope give up and leave you insh Allah it's not time for questions but uh let's take this Mah regarding this topic huh what if it actually happens to some people they have medical problem would actually happens it's not wasasa so what do they have to do in that case Okay the question your question shik uh in the India Pakistan and bang Bangladesh most in mostly it happens here this particular Hadith is quoted very often for when people die and on the graveyard they put flowers and you know and okay I understand I will get into this inshallah okay try to make the questions in the last of the segments so that we control things regarding your question if a person has a medical problem it's a different issue completely but who is capable of diagnosing this a doctor a physician and I tell you 99.9% have no medical condition at all why because a medical condition means that you are unable to control urine and it's coming out 24 hours a day this is different those who have waswas if you ask them when do you get the feeling of a drop or two they say only after urinating and just before Salah okay the rest of the night do you you're having it no I'm okay I'm clean so a medical condition is the one that is continuous every 15 minutes every 10 minutes he gets a drop or two coming out unintentionally without being able to control it there are medications for that but I'm talking about the wiw that comes every time you urinate especially when you want to make Wu so it's a different story now now coming back to your question the prophet when he took the twigs and he planted it on the graves people nowadays not only in Pakistan Bangladesh and India even in Saudi Arabia even in Egypt even in Syria they are saying that okay this is the grave of my father we've just buried him I'd like to put flowers I'd like to put some leaves some grass anything that is green so that Allah would reduce the punishment and the torment over him is this permissible I'm following the sunah right right or wrong is this permissible or you don't know you don't know alhamdulillah this is good this is half of knowledge the scholars say I do not know is half of the knowledge so whenever you're ask say I don't know this is a sign of your knowledge this is not permissible to do why the prophet did itam I'll tell you why first of all the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam is a prophet who told him that they are being tormented they're being tortured and punished now when you say that my father is in his grave are you saying that your father is being tortured no I don't hope so so why do you put this on said maybe no this is something of the Unseen of the you have no knowledge of it you have no power over it so you cannot say first of all second of all when putting these Twigs the prophet Alat wasam he himself said I hope that Allah would accept my intercession in reducing their torment now when you put all the grass and the leaves and the Twigs you wish on a grave do you have any promise from Allah that Allah would accept your intercession no so on what basis are you doing this thirdly and finally has any of the prophet's companion ever done such a thing no not only that has the prophet ever done a similar thing to his wife Khadijah when she died to his daughters Zab omum r they died in his lifetime did he do this to the martyrs of did he do this to who died in the first or second year of Hijra he did not do this to anyone except to these two graves which indicates that it is not part of the Sunnah and it is a grave and serious Innovation for us to do it so I hope this answers the question we move on to the following Hadith inshallah uh Hadith abuur number 18 and who would give us the honor yes Muhammad Hadith number 18 abuur may Allah be pleased with him reported that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said were it not that I might overburden my umah the Muslim Community I would have ordered them to use tooth stick Sak or miswak for every prayer at every time of prayer okay now we move on to a different level of purification which is not part of the wood of the evolution but it completes it using off the seak this is the toothbrush that Muslims use it is made of arak and they get it from under the ground usually sometimes they get it from top of a tree but usually it is part of the roots arak and the Sunnah is that you use this whenever you are performing Evolution and just before you pray this is the Sunnah and the prophet Hadith is quite clear in that we have a break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back assalamu alaykum and welcome back the Hadith of siak which Abu Hur may Allah be pleased with him narrated tells us and shows us how merciful our Prophet is he knows how important the Sak is but he also measured the pros and cons if he were to make it mandatory it would be extremely difficult for people this is why he did not go to that and said had I not feared that I would burden my um I would have instructed them so what do we understand from this we understand that it is highly recommended to use before wo after woo and before going to prayers are there any eates of using the Sak yes in a class of knowledge while the she is giving interpretation of the Quran or of the Hadith or the and a man just gets the mwak and he does this well the she is giving his lesson this is inappropriate if your father is advising you or if he's shouting at you and you yes Father I understand do this again this is inappropriate so you have to know when to use it the prophet said before the uh wo before the Salat and else we'll know when to use it so you have to be respectful to others if you think and believe that this might not be appropriate for dawa sometimes if I'm giving dawa to someone in a three-piece suit Armani suit and he's wearing this and that and his guy comes from high class and while giving him da I'm brushing my teeth in front of him and spitting you know the small particles would he accept Islam I'm giving him a bad image about Islam so you have to know when to use this beautiful Sunnah one of the mistakes that a lot of the Muslims do is when the is being given in the Masjid just before the says he goes the brother remembers that he did not use it through so immediately does this and the is reading the fa maybe no this is wrong when the says allahar you should immediately go and join the prayer if you forgot to brush your teeth this is something is gone don't don't yeah waste your time trying to catch up because it's gone do it later on inshallah the following Hadith Hadith of H who will read it for us narrated Hua may Allah be pleased with him whenever the prophet may peace and blessings of Allah be upon him got up at night he used to clean his mouth with a s okay in this Hadith it tells us about one of the e icates of night prayer the prophet wasam whenever he got up for night prayer he used to brush and use the seak to clean his teeth and why is that why is that anyone yes mam man when we get up after sleep there's there is a bad smell okay who smelling it because there a kind of a lithen there to to get the kick you know of coming to the normal self after this once you in the sleep you in the lethargic mod come come alive you know real into into the real mod yeah yeah yeah maybe s by because then he's going to offer prayers he's going to do sujud and when a person is in sujud is's very close to Allah there are Angel okay I'm I I will shock you a little bit but before shocking you first of all did the prophet Alam used to eat garlic and onions did he eat garlic and onions never the prophet never ate garlic and onions and once he was in the house of Abu anari as we've mentioned before and they brought him food made of vegetables and when he asked what is it made of they told him garlic onions Etc he refrained and his companions refrained and he said go ahead and eat and they said how can we eat if you're not eating he said I communicate with someone you do not communicate with meaning jbel comes and he speaks with him so he does not want his mouth smell to be bad now the Hadith is when some of you wakes up at night he should walk and brush his teeth well because the prophet says when he prays and recites the Quran the angel comes from behind him while he's reciting the Quran until the angel puts his mouth next to his mouth so whatever Quran comes from your mouth goes into the angel shocking but this is an authentic Hadith the angel When you pray at Night comes and puts his mouth on your mouth and whatever Quran comes out of you enters the Angel's mouth now imagine when you pray night prayer inshallah tonight when you before F prayer wake up an hour or so make W brush your teeth wear your clothes everybody's asleep non-muslim would say he's stupid what is he doing Muslims would say he's stupid what is he doing because they don't know the that the honor of a Believer the prophet says the honor of a Believer is his night prayer the honor of a Believer is his night prayer and his pride is not needing what is in the people's hands so I don't look at what you have in your wallet I'm not looking for a race I'm not looking for a good position I'm not looking for you to give me your car so I can drive this is my pride but your honor the prophet says is night prayer so when I stand up tonight inshallah in night prayer I wash my teeth knowing that when I say allahar and I recite ald the angel comes and puts his mouth on my mouth if you get this idea how is your recitation going to be out of this world how is your concentration and out of this world but when we don't think of this after you finish Salah did it add any value no did you feel that you have gotten closer to Allah no so why are you praying because I don't Allah I don't want Allah to throw me in hell no this is one reason but it is not the reason the prophet says my satisfaction in this life has been only made in prayer my satisfaction is when I watch a movie my satisfaction is when I listen to music my satisfaction is when I watch my bank account grow my satisfaction is when I marry and divorce marry and divorce marry and divorce the prophet satisfaction is in prayer and until we reach this level we will not live don't consider yourself living until you reach this level otherwise you are a walking dead man so we move on to the following Hadith which is a very long Hadith um I don't know if we going to have time to read it because what we need from it is very little but um maybe we will take questions if do you have questions yes brother sh uh we are used to with toothbrush and toothpaste anybody using a miswak is you know sort of looked you know down Market you know using miswak old and this yes what is the advice that people more and more use misw the problem is a is not with if you're using the miswak you are a second class if you're using uh toothpaste and a toothbrush you are sophisticated if you floss whoa you are from out of this world no no no it's not this the issue is in what we believe to be our means of dignity and pride I do what I do not to impress people sometimes to impress people means that I take off my clothes and wear uh boxers or or shorts and walk in front of them this what would impress them sometimes impressing them means I have to kill someone or have to beat someone because this is what the audience want and that is why in the old nations in the Roman Empire they used to bring Warriors and Gladiators to fight and people are happy why they're impressed Islam tells me do not impress people do the things that please Allah and would add value in you getting closer to him so I come to see with wisdom and as I said be wise always use the things that would appeal to people so that you draw them closer to Islam as a Muslim I pride on using the miswak but if someone uses the same Sunnah but using a toothbrush I would not say you're an Infidel or you're wrong you chose a lesser thing it it adds value to you you do it but never ever look down at people who are making Sunnah and say nowadays people who wear their thobes above their ankles or their trousers above their ankles they're looked down at right what is this don't care about people I do it for the sake of Allah because I know if it exceeds the ankles it will be in hell those who do not grow their beards and they say that why this is uncivilized you have to shave it I say that my Prophet told me to grow the beard it is not a Sunnah it is a must it's an instruction because if it was a Sunnah and not a mandatory thing I would have shaved it today but because it's mandatory I'm not shaving it so you have to have your pride on the issues that follow uh the Sunnah and not to give much attention to pleasing others and Allah Asel Knows Best I'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time"
