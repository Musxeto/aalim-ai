  "transcript": "and she says is it true that Allah has a hidden name by which if requested he would grant the supplicant whatever he asked and the only reason why the prophet salallahu alaihe salam did not reveal that name to us is because he was afraid we would ask for dunya so this question has two parts does allah have a great name a hidden name the answer is yes and this is known as a small law hill album then a the great name or the greatest name of allah azza wajal and we know that allah has many names and the more valuable and great something is the more names we give to it and this is an Arabic language so the sword for example has many names the lion has many names Hellfire has a lot of names and so is the Day of Judgment and Allah has the highest example of all definitely the Prophet told us I assumed that Allah has 99 names a hundred minus one whoever counts them whoever implements them in his life he will enter Jannah but this does not limit Allah's names to only 99 yet this is what we know but there are much much more than that among these names Allah selected a particular name or a set of names that when a person supplicates to allah and he says oh allah and he uses the name grant me this protect me from this then Allah would answer his call and the scholars have differed in identifying this name and half of them in Hodja may Allah have mercy on his soul said and reported 14 different opinions and the most likely because there are a hadith that are authentic and there are a hadith that are weak regarding the greatest name of allah azza wajal and some are direct some are indirect so the Prophet said are some in an authentic hadith that this great name is found in Surat al-baqarah surah al-imran and so up aha and in all these three suitors I'll hide you'll pay you Miz mentioned so some said it's a higher Caillou others said that it is the phrase Allah la ilaha illa who Allah know him some had a summit Allah Allah merely deulim unit as in reported in hadith and the Prophet said he asked allah by his greatest name some say that it is and this is not authentic repeating the pronoun who who who meaning him or others and there are many narrations now the most authentic is that allah the name allah is the greatest name of all because it is the name that identifies allah unlike when you say for example as Samir this is a name and a description that can also be used with humans so a human being is Samir Bashir as well where Allah nothing had ever challenged Allah in this name and said that no I am Allah no one ever did this and no one can ever do such a thing and the second opinion so that the most authentic is Allah the second it's a lie you'll pay you and then the narrations go on and a large audience knows best"
