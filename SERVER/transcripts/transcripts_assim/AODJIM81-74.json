  "transcript": "Shazia says is this hadith authentic which people claim is from Bihari risk and help is provided to you because of or through your weak family members the translation is not accurate but the hadith in general is correct the Prophet said a Borneo otha a comb which means or translator of it to seek me if you want to find me seek me among the weak because victory is granted to you and provisions through your weak ones meaning that Allah blesses us and provides to us and grant us victory over our enemy through those who are weak those who are poor those who are sick because they are closer to Allah so JAL when they make dua Allah accepts them the barriers are less than ours we have so many barriers between us and Allah Azza WA JAL when we make dua so through them and their blessing the Prophet tells us through them Allah would grant you victory and Allah Azza WA JAL would send you provisions and this is an indirect indication that we if we want victory and we want to be provided for we should take care of the weak ones so it is not that we should await for victory and for provisions by neglecting them and rest assure that we will get some provisions no we have to take care of them we have to cater for them so that Allah the Almighty would provide for us"
