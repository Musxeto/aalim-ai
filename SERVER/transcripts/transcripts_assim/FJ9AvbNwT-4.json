  "transcript": "Isam has a question he says last night in Isa prayer the Imam did not stand up for the fourth raak we stood up and some people alerted the Imam but the Imam waited for some time and then he stood but at the time we were in Ru so do we have to follow the Imam or can we complete The Prayer by ourselves and if we completed The Prayer by ourselves do we have to prostrate for the mistake first of all the prayer is composed of pillars mandatory acts and voluntary Acts or Sunan if you deliberately do not pray the Sunnah of the prayer your prayer is valid if you forgot it your prayer is still valid and you don't have to prostrate for forgetfulness or for that examples raising the hands when saying Allah abbar this is a Sunnah putting the right on the left on the chest this is a Sunnah if you put your hands down your prayer is valid because this is a Sunnah it's not a mandatory act moving your finger in the T it's a Sunnah so these acts we are not talking about them mandatory Acts if you forgot if you forgot them or skipped them due to ignorance or due to forgetfulness your prayer is valid you compensate this by offering to ofah whether before Salam or after Salam this depends on the act itself that you had made a mistake in now pillars is a different ball game altogether pillars are the essential parts of the prayer if you miss one of them deliberately your prayer is invalid like mandatory acts if you skip them deliberately your prayer is invalid but if you forgot them and you were able to remember and to make up for that forgotten pillar while in prayer itself your prayer is valid you have to also offer experation of two suud of sahu forgetfulness uh uh prostration one what are the pillars of of of Salah there are many 14 15 of them so the first is a pillar reciting the fa for the IM and for the individual praying on himself for himself this is a pillar uh making standing this is pillar R uh uh Tranquility in R raising up from R Etc all of these are are pillars so a unit of Salah like in Isa the first unit the first raak the second the third and the fourth these are all pillars that have in them a number of different pillars so we have two scenarios one if the Imam sat in the third raak thinking that it was the fourth meaning that he had skipped the fourth raak the second scenario if the Imam stood up for a fifth raaka thinking that he only prayed three and this is his fourth but actually it was the fifth in both scenarios you are not allowed to follow the Imam when who said she we have to follow the Imam he's our Imam he says yes but now he has derailed he has diverted from the actual prayer and you're not allowed to follow him if you know that he is doing such a grave mistake which is in a sense going out of the prayers format so whether he skips a or adds a you are obliged to alert him like you have said the the the the worshipers said Subhan Allah Subhan Allah if he complies alhamdulillah you follow him if he refuses he thinks that he's doing the right thing in this case you have to complete your pray pray on your own so your intention is to split to leave him to leave the congregation and finish the remaining Rak on your own so if he sat in the third raak as you had mentioned in your question you stand up for the fourth on your own not with another IM and you finish your fourth raak and you make tah you offer Salam and that is it do I offer uh a forgetfulness uh prostration so the answer is no you didn't do any mistake now the second scenario is if he stands up to the fifth raak and you say Subhan Allah and he does not comply and sit he continues in this fifth Rak you have the option whether to finish on your own offer tah and go out of the prayer or wait until he finishes his fifth raak sits for tah offers Salam and offer Salam with him I would recommend that you finish the prayer on your own we have"
