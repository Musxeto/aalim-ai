  "title": "Why do Duas of bad people who earn haram & do haram, get accepted while ours don't? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "why do bad people dua get accepted even though they earn haram and do many sins while ardua does not this is a question that indicates a person does not have strong iman who owns everything allah and who questions allah whether to give or not to give no one so if allah decides to give a kafir the wealth and the health and gives the believer poverty and illness can anyone complain can anyone object definitely not allah azza said in the quran do they the dis the believers do they think that we give them wealth and offspring that we are pushing good things their way nay they do not know they do not understand this is a form of pulling their legs and when the disbeliever or the sinful person does haram and thinks that well allah gave me this wealth and health which means that he loves me and what i'm doing is right this is only to pull his leg and when allah deprives a believer when he calls and prays for something this is for your own good maybe you ask allah for something and allah gives it to you maybe you ask allah for something allah does not give it to you because allah knows that if he gives it to you it's going to be bad and maybe allah azza deprives you from something while deflecting harm from you so a believer has full trust in whatever allah azza does and never complains and allah azzawajal knows best"
