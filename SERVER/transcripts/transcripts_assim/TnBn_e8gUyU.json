  "transcript": "so um concerning and passing with on them I just want to ask about because I heard from I can't remember if it's a lecture or something it's always not good to not you know it's good to not annoy the worshipers clearly it's passing one so my question is how does one balance you know um to making sure that one has passed windows and making sure one does not you know annoy the other worshipers with the other exactly okay I did not understand your question at all you're talking about passing wind what does this relate to annoying others yes there are instances one by one man passes wind during solar and then the old or the smell might actually you know um you know cause a little bit of discomfort to the other worshipers during Salah well actually if you can control it no one in his sound mind would ever say okay go ahead and and password you're asking about something that happens in voluntary how can I be responsible for something that would annoy people if it's involuntary I I'm not known to have uh wind incontinence and I'm not doing it willingly so who are you to blame me I just passed friends I could not suppress it it's like someone is in the prayer and all of a sudden he starts to have a nosebleed and the blood is covering him no one in his sight and his sound mind would come say what is this what is this Blood come on you're you're making the whole place uh look disgusting and you may uh soil the carpets and are you crazy are you nuts this is not with my own will I'm not doing this voluntary so there is no harm in this on the individual unless the person has this incontinence when it comes to wind so he knows that he passes when every 30 seconds and he cannot control it in this case no don't come to the Salah don't come to the Masjid you are harming people pray home and you have an excuse for that but other than that if it happens uh um on voluntary then involuntary then you are not sinful for that and you should not worry about that"
