  "transcript": "[Music] ald we move on to Hadith number nine of this blessed book of and the Hadith of Abdullah z may Allah be pleased with him the companion of the Prophet Alat ABD would you do us the honor please narrated Alini a person asked Abdullah z may Allah be pleased with him the grandfather of of am bin Yahya can you show me how the messenger of Allah may peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him used to perform ablution Abdullah z may Allah be pleased with him replied in the affirmative and asked for water he poured it on his hands and washed them twice then he rinsed his mouth three times and washed his nose with water three times by putting water in it and blowing it out he washed his face three times and after that he washed his forearms up to the elbows twice and then passed his wet hands over his head from its front to its back and vice versa beginning from the front and taking them to the back of his head up to the nape of the neck and then brought them to the front again from where he started and washed his feet up to the ankles very well also there is another narration that he started from the beginning of his head till the back of his head and then going back where he started from in another narration the prophet wasam he said abdah Z he came to us and we got him a bucket of copper made of copper and all of these hadiths are agreed upon this Hadith is similar to the Hadith of which we spoke about last time we met but there are differences slight differences and as you know a student of knowledge does not take his knowledge out of one Hadith or one Ayah this is wrong methodology you have to look at the evidences and the proofs from Islam Quran and Sunnah as a whole because you can come to one Hadith or one verse and apply it not knowing that it was abrogated so someone comes to the verse of the Quran where Allah says oh you who believe do not approach prayer while in the state of intoxication so one says oh alhamdulillah is quite early it's about 7:00 and F is quite late 6:00 I can drink and drink and drink and have no problem Allah says do not do this while you're intoxicated which means it's okay for me to drink no no no no this it was abrogated by another verse where Allah says completely abandoned drinking it's Haram it's an evil uh doing so if you go to one verse without looking and searching for the other verses if you take one Hadith without looking at it through the whole of Sunnah you will go astray so we have to combine evidences and so many times people say the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said so and so but in another Hadith he said so and so so they go in contradiction can this be can the Hadith go against the Quran can the Quran go against itself it is from the same Source it's all from Allah that is why the student of knowledge has to be very very careful when he studies these different evidences and this you will find in the science of or the fundamentals of what to do when we have two conflicting evidences what to do there are four steps first step we have to try and combine them both how to combine them both and this is the best and most favorable way of doing it how we look at these two evidences and see if we can apply them both at the same time if alhamdulillah we've applied them both and they're all there example Allah says in the Quran it has been made unlawful for you the dead meat and blood this what used to be done in the Jah time where they used to slaughter and still people do it now I think there some countries even in Europe they consider this to be a delicacy when they slaughter an animal they drain the blood in a bucket or in a above and this would be used for food for whatever now this is them and this is running blood which is completely prohibited so the dead meat which is not slaughtered islamically or it was slaughtered to uh other than the name of Allah or it died by falling from a mountain by being stunned by being suffocated by being electrocuted any reason other than slaughtering or hunting if it's not a tamed and a domestic animal this is MAA and dum blood so this is an Ayah verse from the Quran then we get another Hadith the prophet saysat it has been made for us permissible two Deads and two bloods the two Deads the Lucas and the fish you don't find someone fishing and then says Okay allahar I want to slaughter it Slaughter what the fish you do not Slaughter okay but it suffocated it died it did not have any yes this is the meat of the sea we eat it as it is so the prophet is telling us that the Locust you know that comes in millions and millions of flying objects this is it has meat and it can be eaten without slaughtering so this is dead it's found dead in Arabia and a lot of the other countries who face this they usually put it in big bags on the floor from from the ground they put it it's dead and they use it and they eat it they eat our crops we eat it so they pay for it and two bloods the spleen and the liver because liver is what it's blood it's not meat it is full of blood it is made of blood so one when he comes to these two Hadith what do we do we combine by saying yes every single dead meat is Haram except these two and every blood is Haram except these two organs as the prophet said so the first Ayah is general and this Hadith is specific it is taken out of this General context an exception this is the best way of doing it likewise if you go on I can give you examples but this is not fundamentals of and I don't want to distract you so this is the best way of doing it the second way if we're unable to join we have two evidences conflicting with each other we don't know which one is which we don't know how to combine them one goes left and the other goes right they're opposite then the scholars say we have to look at the date if we know the date the latest abrogates the first this is called n and we have a lot of Nas in the Quran Allah says in the Quran that abrogation is there and the example the clear example which we've mentioned a while ago intoxication first of all Allah stated that they ask you about intoxication and gambling say there is a lot of sin in them and benefits but the benefits are far less than the sins and the burden so it becomes this is a question so now we know it's Haram before that it was permitted for them to drink but do not approach prayer while you are in the case of intoxication so in the beginning you're not allowed to pray while being drunk but if you're not praying it's okay to drink then they ask you about gambling and intoxications the sins are far greater yet it's not Haram I'm telling you it's not recommended don't do it the third level Allah says verily that these things are from The Acts of Shan so stay away from it so this completely abrogated everything that came before it thirdly if if we have two conflicting evidences we cannot combine the two together by saying that this is general and this is specific we do not know the time which abrogated which in this case we have to look in the Hadith or in the degree so if it's a a verse of the Quran and a prophetic saying conflicting we say we'll take the Quran if there are two hadiths one in bukari and one in aidi bukari is much higher and by doing this we are taking the strongest of the two however sometimes they are in the same level we cannot join we cannot know which one abrogated which and at the same time they are in the same level both in bukari both in the Quran what to do this is very hypothetical that that's why we don't have examples for it but if this happens Scholars say in this case you have to stop how do I stop both evidences are correct but my intellect my logic is unable to work it out so I accuse my logic I accuse my intellect by saying I abstain I stop and we have to look for other Scholars to give us their feedback because they may have more information and more knowledge than I do and in this case we have applied both Hadith I stop until someone clarifies it for me this is all the time we have for the first segment we have a short break don't go away stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back assalam alikum and welcome back the Hadith of Abdullah z may Allah be pleased with him differs with the Hadith of may Allah be pleased with him in the sense that first in the Hadith of abdah Z it clearly states that rining the mouth and inhaling blowing the nose is how many times three times in the of it did not say so we didn't know now we know this is one of the benefits of looking into all the hadiths to learn exactly what's the right thing to do also is a little bit different because we wash the hand how many times in theith of we wash the hands three times inth ABD we watched them twice what do we learn from this ah we learn that the number can differ can funu I can do this and I can do that and that is why so many people tell tell us how many times can I perform wo how many times do I have to wash my hand the prophet he performed Doo by washing each limp once and he did that by washing each limbs twice and he did that by washing each limp tce but he never exceeded that so the maximum is three the minimum is one can I differ yes depending on the weather depending on the quantity of water depending on the need for cleaning the organ itself for example I washed my hand once rened my mouth blew my nose washed my face once when I came to my arm it was a little bit dirty so I wash it three times no problem no problem so it depends you do it once you do it twice you do it three times it's all the same alhamdulillah wiping the head is once this is clarify IED here now the scholars say it is not permissible for you to do it twice one would say a what's wrong I'd like to wash my head what's wrong in that isn't that cleanliness what do we say to this man if someone says I don't want to wipe over my head I want to wash it is he doing something well isn't it cleaner isn't it cleaner for the head he is it is cleaner for the head when you wash your head isn't it more cleaning than wiping it yes but what is the problem ah there is a big problem what is the problem listen to the of the salaf may Allah have mercy on his soul one of the greatest and he you know when I look at their life story I feel a little bit silly say says about himself I have prayed in the first row of the Masjid of Medina for 40 years not missing one prayer 40 years huh in the Masjid of Medina and he says and for 30 years I never looked at the back of someone in front of me meaning he never prayed in the second second row always in the first row 30 years now compare this to ourselves when some of the Muslims may pray 2 minutes before what is this what is this we have a big problem we have to fix we have to advise ourselves the most important things in our lives is is our bank account no no no no no is my job no no no no no no is my wife no the most important thing in my life is my prayer so let's go back to our topic what did he do he saw a man coming between of and so thean is is done people are waiting for the IM to come and the man was praying two volunteering said my son don't do this the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam forbade us from praying between aan and of except the two ofah authentic authenticated it what did the man do like all of us no you're teaching me he said Abu Muhammad meaning I will pray despite what you have said I will pray do you think Allah will punish me for praying for him look at the attitude he is thinking that I'm doing it for Allah so what did say he said my son Allah will not punish you for praying for him Allah will punish you for going against against the Sunnah of the prophet and likewise if someone is making wo and then he puts his head under the faucet and washes his head what are you doing he say it's more clean it's good it's better I tell him Allah will punish you for going against the Sunnah and that is why the prophet when he performed W he said whoever exceeds he has made an aggression someone says I would like to to make five times washing my hands and and feet we tell him you have made an act of aggression because you went against the sunah of the Prophet okay you forgot but I will remind you what about washing the neck do you do it here a lot of you Muslims do it right after wiping their head they do their ears and they do this or they do this is this part of the Sunnah not at all all it is not it's okay it's cleanliness no it's not you're going against the Sunnah now again if you want to clean yourself after woodoo after prayer go and take a bath it's up to you but don't associate these acts with woodo wo is a form of worship it's a ritual that you have to follow exactly what about some of the Dua that we find in books when we wash our hand we we wash my face oh Allah making my face new light and make my arms light oh Allah don't let me watch things that is Haram while doing W they're saying these duas is this part of the sun no alali said this or so and so said this with all the respect to all Scholars we respect them but we take our religion not from Scholars not from imams we take our religion from the Quran and the Sunnah if the prophet did itam he says yes he did it give me your Hadith authentic Hadith because I can give you a thousand unauthentic Hadith it was reported that a man who used to make Hara Hara is some type of Arab food which is made sometimes it's a sweet and it's also a meat uh done with bread so it it it has two names so the man was working in this business and nobody came to him so he put a sign on his shop saying Abu Hur narrated that the prophet said eat Hara because it makes your back stronger and everybody started buying from him and the Man became a millionaire you make Hadith you fabricate Hadith no problem you go to hell no problem but as Muslims someone says the prophet said few days ago I was on Facebook and I found and Facebook is something I would not like to go into now because there is so many fitna so many sins so many mixing so many flirting so many pictures so many bad things of Muslims showing off Muslims showing off this is Christmas 2010 you go to the album you see people mixing dancing partying clubbing drinking smoking pot and his name is abdah ABD Muhammad he's a Muslim you go to sister's Facebook page interested interests in men sister what is this and so I'm not going to talk about Facebook but one of the brothers posted something on his page saying that the prophet said Alam when a man takes his wife's hand in love and compassion Allah looks at them with Mercy reported by IM bukari in theah this Hadith is fabricated it's not in the bukari not in the musl in not even not even in for the or for nowhere in any books of the Hadith it is fabricated it's from somebody's mind yet people are so I wouldn't say courageous they're so stupid in lying on the prophet and the prophet says whoever lies on me whoever fabricates Hadith on me and tells people the prophet said and he did not say that he should take his place in hell he should look at his seat in hell because he's lying on Allah he's fabricating in the religion of Allah so all of these duas are Innovations and a fabrication that we must not do however one would maybe ask himself is it permissible if I'm in the state of woo to make another woodoo we have it in iic we say we renew our wo I'm in the state of wo I prayed I'm still observing my state of woodoo now it's time for is it permissible for me to go and make W again or would this considered to be wasting of water what do you think permissible permissible the evidence Allah said yeah oh you who believe whenever you want to pray offer Evolution so this is general not only that in the Hadith of the Prophet Muslim the prophet was asked when we eat mutton meat do we have to offer woodo the prophet says if you wish meaning that if you're in the state of wo and you eat mutton you eat sheep meat if you don't your woodo is intact if you want to renew your woodo the prophet did not tell him no don't do it the prophet says if you wish meaning that you can offer this I'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time"
