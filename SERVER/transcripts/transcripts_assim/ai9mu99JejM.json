  "transcript": "from the u.s he says is the night of decree a must to be on odd days or or can it be on even days the answer is it can be on odd days and it can be uneven days because we cannot tell which days are even and which days are odd until we finish the month because if the month is 30 days then it is obvious that it is 21 23 25 27 29 but if it is there is 29 days but if it is 30 days then it's obvious that it is 22 24 26 28. and this is why in another hadith allah the prophet said al-azhar try to detect for three nights left five nights left seven nights left meaning from the end not from the beginning but sheikh we don't know whether the month is going to be 29 or 30. so we can't tell when it is three nights left until we know it is is it 29th or 30th in this case the possibility is there that the odd knights are 22 24 26 20 eight etc depending on when the the month ends"
