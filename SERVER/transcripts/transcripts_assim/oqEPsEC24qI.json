  "title": "Is Wearing a Cap Necessary? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "Dr Zakia is it a Sunnah to wear the head covering wear the cap um because we do see a number of people particularly those people who have returned from Gulf countries and such like Hajj Etc that deliberately remove their cap um whilst they're praying is there any basis for this at all as far as the first part of the question is concerned that is it a Sunnah is it must to cover one's head there are various Hadith which say that Prophet mallam his head was always covered whether with a cap with a turban whether with a helmet and even the head of the sahabas covered it's mentioned in s Muslim number two in the book of Haj Hadith number 3148 it says that when Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam addressed the people on the day of the victory of Makkah he was wearing a black turban so there many Hadith saying that covered the further according to Hadith which is narrated by Omar it says that M Sall Ali wasallam wore a white cap it's n by Omar and according to tabani he has rated this as Hassan Hadith one of the categories of say Hassan and according to Imam sui it says it is a highly authentic Hadi he says in his book volume number four page number 112 where he say that this is a highly authentic Hadith wasallam was wearing a white cap the Arabic word is kufi for a cap in India we say topy it is authentic and there are other Hadith saying that the sah also covered the head a similar Hadith is mentioned in s bukari volume number seven in the book of dress Hadi number 5802 says that bin Malik pleas with him he covered his head he wore a cap So based on all these Hadith almost all it's unanimous agreement among the scholars imma of the scholars that covering the head is must it is the Sunnah of the Prophet it is must it's encouraged all all the four schools of thought the Hani the Shafi the Malaki the H all four schools of thought and all the four imas they agree that covering the head is must and when you pray while praying also it's must to cover the head it's must and if you pray bareheaded it's Mak the reason that why people when they come back from the Gulf countries or when they come from Hajj they normally even in India previously a few years back maybe 10 15 years back the people when they PID in the MOs 99% or 99.9% whenever any man prayed in the mosque he had his head covered maybe 20 years back but now we find that 25% 1/4 or one third of the people they pray the Salah bareheaded the reason is that previously it was known that it is must to cover the head so even when they didn't cover the head normally at least while offering Salah they used to cover the head alhamdulillah even though they didn't cover the head normally always they covered the head at least while offering Salah it's a good sign when people go to Gulf country they they realize and they come to know that covering the head is not f for the to be accepted and there are many people because they come from different parts of the world in Gulf countries and they have different ways of practicing Islam there is a Hadith in which one of the sahabas to show to the people that it's not F he just put one piece of cloth from the shoulder down below the knee and he prayed Salah and it's accepted so if you ask that is it f to wear a cap or cover the head while offering Salah it's not a f but it is must so this is what they fa to realize that it is must so why should we not do it when they come back from the Gulf country and they come to know it is not a f they try and show the people that we have knowledge and they purposely don't cover the head and now we find in the mosque about 25% one third of them don't cover the head which I feel is going away from the Sunnah of the Prophet these people they fail to realize that if they ask the scholars of these Gulf countries top Scholars all of them they cover the head all of them they cover the head so just because it's like lack of knowledge is dangerous just because fine Salah will be accepted but is must and according to Al he says that covering the head is must and praying bareheaded is Mak and he says that the of abas with him what he narrates about Prophet M wasallam that he kept his cap as a Sutra in front of him while offering Salah it's a it's not authentic and some of the scholars especially from Egypt they have given the fatwa that you know because inam when you're performing Hajj or doing umrah you don't cover your head and the Salah is accepted therefore covering the head is not the criteria for offering Salah if you read the Hadith of the Prophet wasallam never did the prophet left his head uncovered while praying except inam except for performing Hajj or umra where the Prophet didn't cover his head all other times he had his head covered the reason that during umra while inam the head wasn't covered is because it is is Haram to cover the head many things which are must are Haram during the state ofam if you say that because in ha you don't cover the head that it's a rule that you should not cover the head in Salah is totally wrong there are many things which are must for example cutting the nails is must in the normal day-to-day life but inam it is Haram similarly covering the head is must but inam only it's Haram so giving this logic is totally wrong inam you don't have to cover because it's not allowed it's violating the rules ofam otherwise you should cover the head and if people at least covering while offering Salah they should continue they will get Saab and that's what all the four said even n Alani binas and all the scholars and Imam Malik said that from the time of Islam till today always the scholars and the sahabas and the Sal all in they covered the head and they wore the turban you know that there were Tobin or a kfy etc so I encourage that the Muslim should cover the head it's one of the recommended acts of the prophet"
