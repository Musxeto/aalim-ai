  "transcript": "says is complaining to someone about Allah's about Allah is it like saying why did Allah do this to me why did he do that this is indeed a grave sin and one of the major sins when a person is not content with the Divine decree of Allah and you have to understand that Allah owns literally everything in this universe so if Allah were to throw everything in this universe including the angels and the humans and the animals in Hellfire would anyone have the guts to ask why or object or complain no we belong to Allah and to him we shall return so if he throws us all in Hell Fire he didn't do anything wrong it's his own possessions that he could do whatever he wants and hence when someone comes and complains of Allah's decree and says that why Allah is doing this why Allah is doing that this is a major sin but if he exceeds and transgresses even further it can take him out of the fold of Islam when he mocks Allah or he says something that degrades Allah in this case he would have left the fold of Islam may Allah protect us so we should be patient and content because we believe and trust in Allah's wisdom in Allah's fairness in Allah's knowledge and we know that he possesses everything if he does something it's for our own good but we fail to see the wisdom behind it we shall wait until we meet him on a day of judgment and then everything would be clarified to us inshallah"
