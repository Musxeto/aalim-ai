  "transcript": "foreign that the prophet allah used to say before concluding his prayers alone in you so many times he seeks allah's refuge because there's no one on earth can give you such refuge except allah this is our connection with allah azzawajal i seek refuge in you from miserliness and cowardice i take refuge in you lest i be returned to the worst of lives and i take refuge in you from the trials and tribulations of this life and the punishment of the grave what is mazilinas it is the inability to give those who are in need and it's my right my responsibility to give to them and i have the money to give to them but i don't want to it's an inner feeling that it is so abhorred to allah azzawajal that you must fight it and you can't fight it without seeking allah's help if you look at the seerah of the prophet salam you will find out that he was never ever keeping things away or keeping them back he would give unconditionally even if he needed these things because it's for the cause of allah and because his nature is a person of giving you seek refuge in allah from cowardice and a believer is not a coward he's brave why do people become cowards because they fear the future the fear the consequences they fear those in front of them a believer knows that allah is by his side and he is acting according to allah's religion so he's not afraid of course there are cases when out of necessity allah himself tells you back off so someone at gunpoint tells you to curse islam or curse the quran and if you don't he's going to kill you allah says as long as your heart is filled with iman go ahead no problem in that so this is a time of necessity there is a permission for you to go for something like that and you seek refuge in allah azzawajal that you are not returned to the worst of lives what is that it means that you seek refuge in allah from becoming old to an extent where you lose it and this is what is meant by are when people have to serve you change your diapers when you don't have the memory to remember is this my son or my grandson or a total stranger when you lose track of time and you become even worse than a child now you're becoming a burden to everyone around you it's a test from allah but we seek refuge in allah that we do not reach that stage we always ask allah to take our souls when ah we are in the prime of our health when we do not need people to carry us or to help us when we don't be a burden upon or among others among the well-known duas very short very concise straight to the point the prophet used to make before concluding the prayer oh allah i ask you to grant me paradise and i take refuge in you from the fire imagine in other hadiths whenever you say this hell fire says o allah protect him from me and paradise says oh allah admit him to me and so many people think that these are part of the dua of the morning and evening and this is not true saying it three times allahu mayna salukal jannah or three times allahumma naada becoming is authentic but not to relate it to the morning and evening saying them seven times as many people think the hadith is not authentic so saying it in prayer once is recommended and part of the sunnah of the prophet wasallam now remember when you say things over and over and over again this makes you live and die upon these things and your heart is a vessel if you fill it up with good stuff then it will show and reflect on your whole body fill it up with quran philip fill it up with zikr philip fill it up with dua it will show but if we'll fill it up with filth and trash it will show up and you can tell someone who's righteous and practicing by the looking in their faces there isn't that glow that you could see in the dark but there is a glow that is recognizable while those who even in secret nobody knows about them watch movies listen to music watch porn do haram things even in public when they're good people could sense sometimes maybe smell the bad odor of sins though they're trying to conceal it may allah preserve us and not expose our sins to the public therefore when you keep on asking allah azzawajal for jannah for paradise and seeking refuge in him from hell fire this inevitably has to reflect and show on your character your behavior your body the way you deal the way you worship the way you act with people because this is what you live for this is your prerogative this is your target going to jannah destination jannah so i know what leads me there i'm gonna follow that and definitely i know what takes me to hellfire and i'm going to avoid that to the best of my ability this is all the time we have until we meet next time whatever [Music] foreign"
