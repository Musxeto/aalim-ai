  "title": "They had Haram relations & got married without repenting but never did zina, marriage valid?",
  "transcript": "Ahmad from Australia. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu. So just my question today is basically, so if a guy and girl used to do haram acts in the past, such as oral sex, but never the full zina, such as penetration of the private parts into one another. They then stopped talking about like not too long after they had their nikah, but they learned that they didn't repent. Is the marriage valid or invalid? The marriage is valid and they should continue and move on and not look at their past and ask Allah for forgiveness. And have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days. And I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all."
