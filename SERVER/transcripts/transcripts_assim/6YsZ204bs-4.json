  "transcript": "[Music] muhammad from the philippines so my question how can we maintain the feeling of remorse after committing a sin because sometimes we may not feel the remorse after committing a sin muhammad from the philippines how do we get the feeling of remorse after sinning it is not something that you swallow a pill for that or take an injection remorse is a result of a number of factors number one of acknowledging that you have sinned number two acknowledging that you have disobeyed allah number three knowing who allah is so and and you can add to that number four not knowing whether allah will accept your repentance or not and many more all these factors when they come together and you realize that you have done a grave and serious mistake and you've disobeyed allah and you're not sure whether allah would forgive you or torment you for it this intimidates you this throws fear in your heart and this results in you not wanting to do that sin anymore and being regretful for what you had done this is remorse now if you can't find the feeling of remorse then you have a big problem and this is not something that you can say okay what should i do should i uh uh beat myself up no simply acknowledge the fact that there is a very big possibility that you'll be thrown into hell on the day of judgment because of your your sin you're not feeling any remorse you're not feeling any fear or regret well tough luck what can i do for you you have to generate this by knowing who allah is and the gravity of your sin you"
