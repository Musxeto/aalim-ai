  "transcript": "uh sadman says what if a sister asks to read books and do nafil ibada as her as her dowry what is the ruling on this the issue of dowry which a wife is entitled for before the marriage contract is done and it's her right in islam the scholars say it has to be monetized it has to have a value so it can be something tangible like money like gold like a particular sets of books a car or a benefit from something that's worth money such as the rent of an apartment for a year or to live in an apartment for a particular number of months or her dowry is to drive a car of a certain nature for two years these all have values because driving a car for two years means i would pay the rent of x amount in order to get that card so anything that is tangible that has a value [Music] can be used as a mahar or as a dowry reading books can't be monetized can't be evaluated in terms of money um offering 20 rakaas can't be monetized so such things would appear wrong when the woman seeks holler so they got married the woman says my mahar is that you fast every monday and thursday because it's okay and he fasts every monday and thursday and they're married for a year then the woman finds out that he's not the right husband for her she asks for divorce and the guy says no i don't want to divorce you i love you so she files for hula so they go to the court and the judge says return her dowry the man says i didn't give her any dowry i she asked me to fast every mondays and thursday and i did that so what should what should she return to me now so this is problematic musa peace be upon him when he fled pharaoh after killing the coptic and he met that righteous man who had two daughters and he offered one of his daughters as a wife in compensation for musa to work for him for ten years or eight years then if he would to complete ten that that would be fine did the work that work can be valued because to hire a man to work for you for a year you have to pay an x amount of money so after 10 years as if he had paid that amount of money if she wanted huller she would have been forced to give him the same amount of money but when it comes to fasting mondays and thursdays when it comes to memorizing surat al-baqarah so i will not marry you until you memorize sword al-baqarah and i memorized it she wants huller this is the problem so asking for a dowry that has no specific tangible value is not permissible she has to ask for something that has monetary value you"
