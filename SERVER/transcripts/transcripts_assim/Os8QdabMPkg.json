  "transcript": "since the time is running and the time is up we'll just take one more last question before we end the session the last question hi Zakir Nik sir hello I from Sri Lanka and 19 years old I accepted Islam on my own and my family are Hindus and they don't know that I reverted to Islam when they know it I don't know how would they react they will get hurt for some day I made my Salah while my parents were not there I could concentrate on my prayers and I miss one or two prayer because of my classes and school I don't know what to do I love Allah I will do fajer prayer so my parents won't know about it I plan to tell about this to my parents when I get into a position where I can make decision on my own for now I completely rely on them what should I do this Hindu brother from Sri Lanka was 19 years old he says that he has accepted Islam recently and since he belongs to a Hindu family he's not sure how will the family react what would the father say what would the mother say what would the brothers and sisters say so what he's doing is that he has accepted Islam he's praying silently he's praying F Salah he prays most of the Salah one or two Salah he misses and he says since he dependent on the the parents completely maybe once he gets independent he will tell them what should he do number one it's not compulsory for a non-muslim when he accepts Islam that he should Proclaim it in public if he feels that danger to his life and he feels that there'll be retaliation from the from the society from the family and difficult he need not say it he agrees himself and accept Islam like this brother has done now the question is what should he do now since he says he dependent on his parents for his living and he doesn't know how old they what should he do my first advice to you would be brother that say to it that you pray all five times Salah and you're praying your F Salah Mah very good you're missing one or two avoid missing that also the major point is that you see to it that your behavior towards your parents towards your mother towards your father towards your brothers towards your sister should be multiple times better than what you were before what you were when you were Hindu and once you accept Islam your behavior to your mother your behavior to your father your behavior to your brothers and sister should be multiple times brother should be better if you loved your mother maybe 10 points now you should love 100 points if you obeyed her most of the time cud you obey 100% now accept those things which they say which is against the Sharia which is against the Quran which is against the teaching of the Prophet everything else for example your mother tells you my son why don't you wear a blue shirt and you don't like blue blue color now once you accept Islam there is no harm in wearing blue color you tell your mother okay you want do I don't like it I'm wearing blue color because of you she should find a marked difference in your behavior same thing with your father help your father obey him love him more love your mother only don't do those things which is prohibited in the Shar remaining you obey them follow them help them they should say what has happened to my son how come is become so obedient how come he's loving me more now later on maybe after few weeks after few months when you think the time is right you can tell them that you know the change has come in my life because I'm a Muslim and my religion Islam says that paradise Lies Beneath the feet of the mother my religion says that father is the gateway to Heaven you have to obey your parents my religion tells me my Quran tells me that you can't say o to your parents even if they reach old age you have to love them you have to respect them you have to obey them so if you start telling all these things I'm sure they'll be impressed not only will they be happy with you even they will accept Islam so you are now the source to lead your parents and your brothers and sisters to Jenna so see to it that you create an environment that they love Islam if there are any misconception if there any islamophobia you remove it and you see to it that you slowly solely do dawa to your parents and to your siblings to your brothers and sisters and inshallah pray to Allah subhana tala May Grant you Jenna I pray to Allah to give you the guidance and the sa and the knowledge to invite your family members to Islam invite your friends and inshallah may you inshallah go to J fos this was the last answer that we had time and inshallah till we meet two weeks from now on the 17th of August two weeks from now now on Saturday same time till then"
