  "transcript": "um the next question she is I have been married for a few months now and I had followed all the Islamic guidelines my mother is not talking to me and it's been more than 6 months even though I've tried my best to reach out to her but she wants nothing to do with me I'm not sure what else I can do why so how would I know see see such questions they assume that I have a crystal ball I don't but because I've done a lot of counseling I could tell number one either he married her against his her mother's his mother's will so she's from a different tribe different Clan different ethnicity and or not the mother's niece as usual number two he married her but he's not allowing his mother to control her so so she's living in a joint family but the mother is not happy because she wants her to wake up early after faer start cooking breakfast and cleaning and doing the shores and washing and ironing and everything and he as a real man says no she's obliged only to serve me I married her you want to have her you marry her but alhamdulillah this is not Halal in Islam so I'm the one who married her she Serv me and my children three a possibility that he married this woman the mom was happy everything was fine he moved out and the mom is refusing to talk to him because he's breaking the family ties and his siblings are thinking of doing the same and she's losing grip over her flock so until I know the reason but you get the point and that's PR Allah"
