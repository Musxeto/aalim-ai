  "transcript": "[Questioner] from the U.S may Allah \nforgive me for what I said behind your back   I mean okay so my question is that um \nI couldn't find any evidence that wet   impurities transfer so is it permissible for \nme to just neglect the ruling since there is   a difference of opinion on the issue and there is \nno evidence for it especially if I feel the ruling   could be difficult to follow due to my previous \ncarelessness carelessness first of all it's not   up to you to choose what to follow and what not \nto follow if you're not a student of knowledge   that has the ability that has them necessary \ntools to search and investigate you cannot   just shoot from the hip and say but because I \nwas negligent and lazy and now the whole house   is soiled with najasa so I search in Islam uh web \nIslam q a and didn't find anything satisfactory so   everything is okay it's not up to you this is to \nthe scholars to judge and say their verdict and   the issue of people with OCD obsessive compulsive \ndisorder regarding impurities and issues of najasa   some people are so negligent even if they say see \nimpurities in front of them they would say no this   is dried or anything I I could care less okay \nwash it so no I don't want to and they walk with   wet feet on it while they still see the traces of \nnajasa and they know it's impure and then you come   out of nowhere saying that I couldn't find any \nevidences proving that it transfers after drying   why did the prophet sallam order the companions to \npour a bucket of water on the urine of the Bedouin   who urinated in the Masjid he might have well \ntold them to just leave it until it dries off   this is something that it's not this is \nnot a place to discuss it but to answer   your question Sammy no you're not qualified \nto get such a ruling and Allah Knows Best [Music] and have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford \nit that's good for you if you cannot you're   entitled for one free session and this is for \neverybody if they can affirm by Allah that they   cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give \nthem one free session without a problem a full   half an hour so come to me and let's speak \nabout it inshallah within the following two   days or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for Allah"
