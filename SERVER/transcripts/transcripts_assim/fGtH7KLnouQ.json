  "transcript": "Sumaya from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaikumussalam to Allah. So I wanted to ask a question um when we're praying when we go to Ruqa'a I never paid attention to this thing but it has become a frequent thing nowadays so when I go to Ruqa'a I don't know when exactly I'm in Ruqa'a like if I want to say Subhanallah it's like I'm still moving like I'm not settled so I have to wait for some time for me to be settled and then say Subhanallah and I don't want to wait that I want to pray like in a much lesser time than I usually do which is very long. First of all you have to focus on the quality of your prayer not on the quantity so you should not be mindful of the time rather on whether my prayer is valid or not whether I'm achieving the best results out of it or not. Secondly for you to be in Ruqa'a is for you to place your hands on your knees this is this is when you are settled so while you're going down and you say Subhanallah this does not count the moment you place your hands on your knees this is the Ruqa'a position you can say Subhanallah without any difficulty once is the minimum and the sky is the limit."
