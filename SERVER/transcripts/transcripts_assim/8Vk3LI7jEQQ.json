  "transcript": "um my question is about if a woman is asking for hola from my husband and the reason why she's asking there's overwhelmingly big problems but one of them is the husband doesn't apologize ever when he doesn't do wrong and over the years she could she could not make the husband see what is doing wrong or apologize so they already have a time that she's going she's going to be moving out of the house and then she to the husband and say if I done anything wrong to you I apologize then the husband apologized for what he has been doing and weiz that and she feels like it's sincere and that changes her mind and then when she tells the husband the husband says well I've already going to move forward with somebody else my family had already made the family I just have to travel to go do like introduction and see if we can do a contract so the if the woman wants to stay with with him I don't know is he is she sinful because now is moving forward because she told him that omina has he already given her no no yes or no no no if he has not given her then they're still married is done when a woman says listen I I'm fed up with being married with you here is my Dowry or here is 10,000 dirhams in compensation for me getting and the husband says I agree then they're they're separated there's no way for them to go back again if she change her changes her mind unless they remarry again if this did not take place there's still man and wife so what is your question now so my question is now is he has already met over the phone with the family of the to be white okay is is the woman s if she says I want to say because now because she was asking for hula before and is already trying to move on is it simple for her to say I want to stay so if if she says okay as long as you've moved on and looked for another woman I can't stay with you married to another woman and I still want to go for this is a valid reason if she is unable to fulfill his rights and if she says no I'm happy to stay at a as a second wife that's also her uh choice to make and Allah Knows Best"
