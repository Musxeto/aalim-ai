  "transcript": "Hajjah from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Walaikumussalam. Okay, I have a question here about the Salatul-Tasbih. You know, if I have to make the, you know, what you read between the two, the two Sajdahs, what you read between the two Sajdahs, if I could read that the whole four hours, and then if I could… Salatul-Tasbih Hajjah is an issue of dispute among scholars. The vast majority of scholars, such as Ibn Taymiyyah, Ibn al-Qayyim, Sheikh Ibn Baz, they rendered it as a fabricated hadith, and hence it is not permissible for you to offer them. Because the hadith is fabricated, the format of the prayer is one-of-a-kind, not found in any other prayer similar to it. And finally, the only narrator of the hadith was al-Abbas, the uncle of the Prophet ﷺ, and none of the companions had ever reported such a hadith with huge and immense reward, which the Prophet said, whether you do it once in a year, once in a month, once every week, once every day, or once in a lifetime, it's the same. There's nothing like that at all. Therefore, the hadith is not authentic, so don't pay attention to it."
