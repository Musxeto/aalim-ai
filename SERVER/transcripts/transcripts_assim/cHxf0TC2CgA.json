  "transcript": "Al-Husayn ibn Ali, his grandson, he was a young toddler playing in the roads of Medina with other boys when the Prophet ﷺ saw him. When Al-Husayn saw the Prophet ﷺ, he ran to him in a playful manner and the Prophet extended his hands. So Al-Husayn would go right and the Prophet would do this, go left would do this until he embraced him and he took him and kissed him and he said, Al-Husayn is from me and I am from him. May Allah love whoever loves Al-Husayn and by Allah we love Al-Husayn because the Prophet loved him, because he is a great companion, because he is the son of Ali, one of the ten heaven bound and the son of Fatima, the daughter of the Prophet ﷺ and he is one of the masters of the youth of Jannah."
