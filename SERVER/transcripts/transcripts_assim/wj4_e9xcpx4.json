  "transcript": "like Peyman Salameh he al hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa salaam wa and Mama Russia Martin Delilah mean nabina muhammad in while early he was happy he marine and bar assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh su rockin never chapter 78 verse 12 allah azza wajal says were burning faux-pas cumin saba and she dad this translates to and we've built above you seven strong heavens now these beautiful heavens above us for us we see only one but it is so perfect you don't see any cracks in it it is complete it is full and it is strong and mighty it doesn't fall upon us it doesn't collapse on us allah azzawajal has perfected it and we know that there are seven heavens we believe in that we've never been there and all what we see is the first heaven but there are a lot more and the Prophet told us our assumption that in between each heaven and the other one there is a distance of five hundred years in traveling now whether this is light years long this is something we have no knowledge of and going into there doesn't increase your Eman it doesn't benefit you and this is what as Muslims we should focus on on what benefits us what increases our Eman but to ask questions about things that have no relationship to us to our Eman to our conviction this is not something of interest to a Muslim for example we know the story of the boys the youth who went into the cave and they had the dog with them and they stayed there for 309 years as mentioned in suratul calf the cave if one says what type of a dog they had was it a German Shepherd was it something else a greyhound a hound or ever was it a chihuahua was it a Doberman who cares so no I have to know you don't have to know this doesn't get you closer to a larger so when you look at the heavens above you will see wonders but we take it for granted how Allah as the origin managed to keep these stars in this beautiful sky and nothing comes to us nothing collapses there are no cracks it's complete it's full in the following ayah Allah says what John cor genoise Hodja and have made therein a shining lamp that is the Sun now Allah says in the previous ayah were Benina Foca Kamsa branchy Dada and we have built above you seven strong heavens we who is Allah referring to first of all there is no one worthy of being worshipped except Allah this is a fact second of all allah does not need anyone of his creation so allah azza wajal is over his throne does allah need the throne the throne is dependent on allah so gel in its existence and allah so gel does not need the throne a logic does not need those who carry the throne from the angels no matter how mighty and strong they are Allah does not need gibreel Ezra feel me ke the great leaders of the Angels Allah does not need a servant see not need the heavens he does not mean anything because allah azza wajal is the one and nothing else matters there was Allah and nothing else with him Allah is the first without the beginning and the last without an end subhana wa ta'ala so if you believe in this when you read verses in the Quran where Allah says we did so and so or we said so and so it is only Allah that does this Allah Azza WA JAL created the angels and he orders the angels to do certain things not because he needs the angels but because he is the sovereign he's the king and he orders those whom he had created to serve Him as he wills not because he needs them he needs no one subhana Allah so Allah Almighty has made therein a shining lamp this beautiful Sun that comes every morning we take this for granted imagine if this Sun came few miles closer to earth what would happen to the inhabitants of earth it would melt it down and if it went away few miles it would freeze the entire earth allah azza wajal is the one who keeps it there exactly what he wants it so that the people would benefit from this huge star it is so hot that people complain where I come from Saudi Arabia it is hot it is humid it is this it is that we don't appreciate unless favours upon us and if you go to places where the Sun does not come as often you would find people complaining for the lack of the Sun only then we can appreciate without the Sun you will not have the ability to cultivate your crops and fruits without the Sun there would not be the process of evaporation and rainfall without the Sun the germ the viruses would annihilate life on this planet but with the grace of allah azzawajal the sun is there you would not be able to sweat and to get all these impurities and the things that would harm your body out without the heat of the Sun without the Sun you would find corpses as they are they would not start to dissolve and turn into substances that go and blend with the earth so there's so many things that we benefit from the Sun and allies opening our eyes don't you ponder upon this that we have made therein a shining lamp for you and then Allah says the all-mighty ones l nominal maserati man and had jaha and have sent down from the rainy clouds abundant water when you look at the water that comes down it comes like pouring down I've been into the beautiful Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia few months ago and when it rains man it rains it pours down subhanAllah and they have this beautiful drainage system unlike any other drainage system in the world in minutes it's gone it's normal life as usual and this water is what people live on it's what they use to farm their lands it's what they use to drink to wash themselves it is what they use in their livelihood and when allah azza wajal is angered by people he would hold subhana wa ta'ala this blessing and favor for him and you will have droughts and you have famine and this is a test from allah azza wajal but when Allah gives water and rainfall and greenery and crops to a people this doesn't mean that he's pleased with them it's a test so allah azza wajal has created us to test us and that is why you would find muslims being tested and you find disbelievers also being tested as well and rain can be a blessing and it can be a torment it can flood the lands it can drown people and subhanAllah a lot of nerve disease once was in hatch and they heard the sound of thunder and the people in hatch in alle fat they were terrified and he was smiling and when they asked him why are you smiling when the people are terrified he said this is the sign of Allah's mercy upon us rain is mercy from Allah so your general speaking and thunder and lightning accompanied this mercy so he was smiling because this what was making the people terrified is a sign of his mercy then how would it be when allah azzawajal is angered and when at last they were gelid is going to punish people how is it going to be definitely something that is beyond our comprehension may Allah protect us all from his torment and Punishment we have a short break stay tuned and I'll be right back assalamu alaikum and welcome back so this ring when it comes down what happens allah azzawajal says that we may produce therewith grain and vegetations allah almighty says the no creature be he have been one about so that we would produce extract plant grow happen this is in reference to grain so corn wheat barley all of this is considered to be drain when about huh this is vegetation so anything that is green the grass the plants that we use fruits vegetables all of this is considered to be nevada and allah azza wajal uses the water so that these things can be produced Allah Almighty says virgin not in alfafa and gardens of thick growth a garden Jenna see Jenna means a garden and it also means paradise in arabic paradise is alpha dose which is the highest level of the gardens of Eden tamna trodden the Jannah and it is the middle part of it so on the horizontal level it is the middle and in the vertical level it is the highest this is known as firdaus paradise now this paradise is the a'dope of those who believe and Jenna is also a garden so they share the same name though the gardens here are nothing compared to the gardens in Paradise because anything that is surrounded by a wall is called the garden so in paradise there is a wall that surround and your garden is different than mine I have my own exclusivity and so would you in sha allah the almighty if we are admitted to Paradise and a large L described as gardens of thick growth because when you have trees that are so close and so green to the extent that they are intermingling with one another and there is no place for the light to come through this is how you describe their thick growth that they are all round each other to the extent as if they're all one unit and because of their proximity to each other and because of the thickness they are called Genet in alfafa as if they're wrapping round each other from palm trees and grapes etc now these where the favours and blessings of allah azzawajal upon humanity as an eye opener some of Allah's favours and blessings things that people take for granted so what do we learn from these previous favors and blessings one we learn that Allah Azza WA JAL is most wise is most knowledgable is most capable is most strong that all of these signs that we see around us are from his own doing and no one else can do that except him subhana WA Ta'ala he has made the earth flat he has made the night to be as dark he has made the daytime a place to live in he has made the heavens and he has made the Sun and he has made this and that all of these are signs of allah straightness a lost power and a lost wisdom also from going through these beautiful verses of the Quran we learn that he who is capable of doing all of these things there are so huge and so great when we look at a lot of almighty being able to erect such mountains and to flatten such earth to make the clouds run with pouring rain water we believe in the ability of Allah as the origin to resurrect us because most of those who reject the idea of Resurrection would say that how is it possible that such bones that are turned into dust they can be resurrected again to be a normal human being what Allah so Jill is showing us that the creation of the heavens and the earth which is far far greater than the creation of a human being he's capable of doing that not only that the one who produced this human being from nothing it is easier to bring him back to life from creating him from nothing in the beginning so allah azza wajal is establishing this nakida this conviction of resurrection and that when you die you'll not turn into ashes or into dust and that is it end of story there is a sequel there is a day of judgment and you'll be resurrected and you'll be held accountable for each and everything you had done in this life and Allah Azza WA JAL also tells us that we will get this knowledge whether we like it or not if we do it the easy way we will become Muslims and we will believe but if we decide not to believe we will get this knowledge the hard way and that is when death arrives and then the veil is taken away from our sight and we see things as really as they are in this case then we have a big problem so after a la soldier has mentioned all of these things that open an individual's eyes to the reality of allah azza wajal being the supreme creator of this universe then allah subhana wa ta'ala moves on to ayah number 17 where allah the almighty says in neoman fossil economy apart-er now if you acknowledge the fact if you acknowledge the truth and you know that you will be held accountable when you know that Allah has created all of this you should know that you will be held accountable so Allah says verily the day of decision the day of separation is a fixed time what is the day of separation or the day of decision it is the day when the people are segregated into believers and disbelievers disbelievers are thrown into hell believers are admitted to paradise so Allah is telling us that this particular day is at a fixed time do we know what it is no we don't and don't bother about asking when the day of judgement years because this is not gonna benefit you anymore what counts is when is the day of your death because this is the day of separation the day of judgment for you whether the day the actual day of resurrection is a day from now a year from now a gazillion years from now it doesn't matter to me what matters is when I die because this means that I cannot do anything else and this is the day where I will begin to face accountability until the day of resurrection so the day of separation the day of decision yomel fossil is the day of judgment the day of reckoning and it has so many different names and why is that because in Arabic the more the thing is important the more names it has so for example Hellfire it is important it is scary we have a number of names for it we have Jaheim we have an R you have Jahannam we have so many names for it when you go to the Prophet is awesome he has a number of names when you go to Allah the Almighty he has countless names we know of 99 of them so the day of judgement has a number of days and it's called Yom will Fussell the day of separation or the day of decision where Allah Allah separates between the people of the truth and the people of falsehood the people of disbelief and the people of belief the people of aggression and the people of fairness the people of hell and the people of paradise etc and it has as stated before a specific timing a specific date that only Allah the Almighty knows of this Day of Resurrection is the day when the trumpet would be blown into and all those who are dead will be resurrected and stand up as a person a one man they were all stand up together at the same time and there will be all gathered in one closet in one arena in one place there will be naked they will be barefooted there will be uncircumcised they're all in shock and awe and fear and terror anticipating what allah azzawajal would do to them in naome and thusly economy apart-er so after hearing all of this you who are in disagreement or asking one another about the message of the prophetess I'm about the Quran about the Day of Judgment be aware there will be a day of reckoning and a large though they would hold each and every one of us accountable for their actions Allah is telling us in neoman fossil Kaname okata it will come inevitably it will surely be there so be careful because you are definitely going to be there and you're not going to miss it this is all the time we have until we meet next time via Manila Salam alaikum warahmatullahi oh my god"
