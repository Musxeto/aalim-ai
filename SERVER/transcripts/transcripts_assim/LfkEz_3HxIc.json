  "title": "Is it permissible for a Muslim to study in a Christian Missionary school",
  "transcript": "Sadman from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh there is a renowned college in my country that is run by the Christian missionaries and I want to get admitted into that college for a test but I found out that in the uniform of that college there is a Christian cross and this is also a only boys college so should I get into that college or try for that if the college does not promote or teach upon you or impose upon you that you study Christianity or to wear a cross and the likes there is no problem because the vast majority of colleges worldwide even in Muslim countries are not Islamic colleges they're secular but if they impose upon you that you study Catholicism or to wear a cross or to engage in their prayers in this case this is not permissible and Allah knows best"
