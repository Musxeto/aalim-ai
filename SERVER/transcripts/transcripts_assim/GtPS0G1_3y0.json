  "transcript": "alhamd we have the final Hadith with us inshallah in the chapter that deals with zakat before moving into Z and we would like someone to read this Hadith for us yes brother narrated Abdullah when Allah granted his Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam the booty on the day of H he distributed it in those whose heart have been inclined towards Islam Lam and did not give the ansar anything they felt something as it did not get similar to what the people got the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam addressed them for that by saying oh ANS didn't I find you astray and Allah guided You by me weren't you divided and Allah joined You by me weren't you poor and Allah made you rich by me and whenever he said something they replied Allah and his messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam have more favor on us he said to them why don't you answer me and they would say Allah and his messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam have more favor on us he then said If you have wished you could have said that you came to us with so and so aren't you satisfied that the people go back with camels and sheep while you go back with the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam if it weren't for the Hijra migration I would have been one of the ansar and if the people were to take away in a valley or a mountain Mountain Pass I would have taken the valley or the mountain pass of the ansar AL ansar are what touches the body while the people are what is wor over that you will find after me a difficulty and selfishness so be patient until you meet me at the pool in this great Hadith it's an incident that took place when the prophet Alat wasam on the eth year after the conquest of mecah he went to fight the people of T in the battle known as the Battle of H and they ambushed him but Allah asael granted him Victory and they retreated in defeat and due to their wrong strategy and arrogance when they went to fight the prophet Alat wasam they took all of their women and children and all of their livestock and all of their gold and silver and this was stupid because a wise man told them and I think it's his name told them that what you're doing is wrong because if war was against you if the battle was against you these things will not deter you from running away and if it is with you and if you're winning there's no point in getting them out and the minute things were as we know they fled and left their wives and children and their livestock and all of their wealth and the prophet Alam was very happy he took all this money and he distributed it and the prophet did not keep anything for himself he distributed everything and he gave the money most of it to those whose Hearts were inclined to Islam in the sense that he is giving people to buy their allegiance to Islam so that they would love Islam sometimes it is not just black and white you either want Islam or you're an enemy of Islam sometimes you need someone to give you an introduction give you an incentive give you a reason to accept Islam so this does not mean that those who do not want Islam they're enemies you either accept it to day or I will kill you no this is not Islam you call people to Islam you give them Daw if they accept alhamdulillah if they do not accept this is their own free will but in the categories of zakat the eight categories mentioned in chapter 9: 60 it is mentioned that among them are those whose hearts are inclined to Islam meaning that if you give them money they probably would like Islam and mostly this is in the tribes men or the tribes leaders so this practice was there you give the dignitaries you give those who lead their people such an incentive which makes them love Islam because if they accept Islam all those behind them would follow suit so the prophet started giving away camels not one or two he gave Abu sufyan har 100 camels 100 camels is a lot he gave his son muaah 200 camels and some gold some say that it was about 100 oun of gold each or something like that he gave this he gave that all those who about 3 weeks ago were in Mecca and we were fighting them he gave them all money and he did not give the ansar the people of Medina not a a single penny nothing so they spoke among themselves in well the prophet Alam found his relatives found his people he migrated from them about 8 years ago now he is homesick he loves them that's why he gave that to them he's a prophet it's his right of course this was not the case so at the leader of Al we know that they're and the leader of the house is and the leader of is so he came to the prophet and said prophet of Allah my people are saying so and so and he reported it so the prophet looked at him and he said s what do you say and S said oh prophet of Allah I am only a man of my tribe meaning that I speak like them the prophet said collect them all in a place not a single soul with them who is not from the ansar so we don't want anybody from the muhajirin or from any other tribe only the people of Medina and when they gathered the prophet Alam addressed them and said oh ansar what are you angry of didn't I come to you as stated in the Hadith didn't I find you astray and Allah guided you with me uh weren't you divided because they were fighting miserably weren't you divided and Allah joined You by me weren't you poor and Allah made you rich through me and whenever the prophet said something they looked down in the ground and said Allah and his messenger have more favor on us this is nothing Allah's favors and the prophet's favors are far far greater than this and the prophet phet is you know shouting at them speak up so then the prophet said why don't you speak up so they said what should we speak what should we say Allah's favors are more than this he said if you wished you would have said they kicked you out and we accepted you you came to us poor and we fed you and gave you money you came to us beaten and lost in battle and we granted you Victory by Allah they said that you're a liar and we were the only one to believe you now who's saying this the prophet and then he said oh people of Al ansar is it for the filth of this dun this money is that you found something in your hearts against me isn't it sufficient for you that people take the camel and the sheep with them to their houses and you go back with the prophet of Allah Sall wasam what honor is this and then he started telling them about what he wishes he said by Allah if it weren't for the migration from Mecca I would have been a man from the ansar I would have been from you but I migrated so I can't be from the ansar and by Allah if you choose a valley or a pass through a mountain and the people choose another Valley or a way I will stick with what you choose you to me are the cloth that touches the body the prophet is giving a description what is more important to you what touches your body or what the people see when you wear it what touches your body this say as closest so he says that you ansar are the thing that touches the body and the other people are the things that we were or I were and the prophet said Alam oh Allah forgive the ansar and the sons of the ansar and the sons of the sons of the ansar forgive them and have mercy on them and the people wept until the tears filled their beards and said we have accepted the prophet as a division our provision you know when you divide money they said we've accepted the prophet as our division which is our division our portion and then the prophet told them that beware you will face difficulty after my death and if this happens then anticipate or wait in patience and tolerance until you meet me by the pool or by the how we have a a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right asalam alaykum and welcome back now one may ask now this great Hadith this beautiful story what does it have to do with zakat there is no mentioning of zakat in it well Scholars say that verse 60 goes like this Allah says what translates to which means a zakat here are only for the poor and also the who are poor and I'll give you the difference between the two inshallah and those employed to collect the funds remember Omar he used to collect the funds those who are sent by the governor or the ruler they can have portion of the zakat as their payment only those who work for the government if I were representing a rich man and he's telling me that these are the money give it to to those who need it can I take some of it no and for to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined towards Islam so again this is the fourth category which we can give zakat to and then Allah says and to free the captives and for those in debt and for Allah's cause that is Jihad and for the way fairer that is a traveler who is cut off from everything this is a duty imposed by Allah so this Hadith is suitable because it talks about those who we give money their hearts are inclined towards Islam now what's the difference between and and they all seem to be alike Scholars say that there are a number of words in Islam when they are isolated from from each other when they are used alone they mean the same but when we talk and join them they each have a different meaning for example islaman they all mean the same once we say Islam and IM oh it's a different issue it's a different issue likewise when we talk about a mskk anyone who's poor he's mskk what about fak anyone who's poor he's but when we say Al and Al together then there's a different meaning what's the difference between them Scholars say that Al is one who is unable to find what he needs so food he's unable to find food that is sufficient for one day or two days some even prolong it and say who cannot find food for a whole year meaning that he does not have what is sufficient for him for for a whole year and this is what the old jurors used to also consider food is not to be found only today but you have to have what's sufficient for you and your family for a whole year and Al is someone who's better off someone who's better off than fak but he's unable to find what completes his needs he finds the needs but what completes the needs he doesn't find them such as they say for example he has food he has shelter but he doesn't have money to pay for his daughter's tuition for school now this is not something that is a a life or death issue but it completes his needs he does not have money to take his son to the doctor he does not have money to pay for the electricity bill he has a car he has a house but he his car broke down and he cannot go to work and he cannot earn money except by fixing the car so we give him from the zakat you get now the difference the poor is someone who is completely poor he doesn't even have a car he needs something to sustain him alive while a mine is someone that may have a good salary but it does not last until the end of the month so for example and this is not our topic but zakat is our topic in general and I'll give you an example example if I have a janitor a man who cleans the building and he has a wife and three kids and his salary is so and so very little but mashallah at the end of every month do you need money he said no I saved 200 I saved 300 I have enough your family everything is fine we don't need anything is this poor no is he MK no he is well off alhamdulillah though his salary is very little but if I have another person whose salary is 10 times as much yet his family he's got a father and a mother he pays for a wife and children a house his normal expenses he does not go on holidays and buy fancy cars his normal expenses exhaust his salary so when it is on the 20th of the month he runs out of money completely is he legible for zakat say yes we can give him zakat money because though his salary is high but it's gone in normal expenses not in something that is considered to be extravagant so I hope this y explains things and we open the floor for your questions first question can we give a zakat money to those who have entered Islam I mean for his funding of his house for sustainance you can't give money to those who reverted to Islam providing they are poor or mkin but if someone's Rich a movie star who has millions and billions and he reverts to Islam and I give him money no I give money to someone who is not a Muslim or he just reverted but he's on the brink of going back so I give money to the one who I am hoping that he comes a Muslim I can give him zakat if a revert is Rich no I cannot give him from the zakat unless I have very ample and strong doubts that he is going to go back into his old religion regarding the question of gizia you mentioned about uhab that Jews and Christians what about the people who are living in Islamic State who do not belong to these religions some other religion what happens to them do they also pay the jiz or what it is an issue of dispute among on Scholars whether jizya can be taken only from the people of the book Jews and Christians and some also included al- Maus fire worshippers with them or is it for all people to pay jizya if we say only the Jews and Christians can pay jizya this means that the others have to be either kicked out or executed and it appears that no it is a general statement and Allah mentioned the gizia for the Jews and the Christians inah to talk about what was General however it appears that it's an issue that is much wider and this depends not on individuals remember this is something only for the rulers to take part in so as for us it's a theoretical thing at the moment I don't think and I don't believe that any Muslim Muslim State takes zizia from those who are living on their soil not a single Muslim state in my knowledge or to my knowledge and Allah Asel knows best for example if you have a land then you consider it as your wealth and you give it every year the zaka on it but now you think to do a construction on it and you have done the construction so on what should we give the zaka on the land or on the business we do from that construction are investing when you're constructing you're investing so that you can sell it yes okay I will even broaden the answer a little bit because people need this if you have a plot or a land and you bought it for the reason of reselling it again and buying a big land and reselling it again and making profit you have to pay zakat every year 2.5% on the current price because this is considered to be an item number four of the categories of zakat things that are displayed for sale things that are displayed for Commerce so if you buy a piece of land and your intention is to sell it immediately after you get a profit and buy something and so this is your intention but if you buy a piece of land on the hope that you will build a house maybe 20 years from now or on the hope that you will build a building to rent not to sell huh there is no zakat there is no zakat because you remember if you master the four categories you know that anything that comes out is not considered to be zable got me okay now if I bought a land with the intention of building a house or an apartment building and selling it with a profit in this case you have to pay zakat why because it's displayed for selling and buying on what should I pay the zakat on the initial amount I paid for the land or for the construction that I paid for whatever I've constructed which is not finished yet Scholars say that after one year when it's time for the zakat you have to evaluate so people who are professional would come and say hm the land is a million and the construction at the moment if you sell it as it is people will give you 200,000 the whole thing cost 1.2 give zakat on 1.2 what about if I buy something and the value goes down I bought it for a million and for trade to sell and buy after a year the land prices fell down and it's now cost 400,000 how much do I pay zakat for for the million initially or the 400,000 on the current price of today and the opposite is correct if it doubled from 1 million to two millions I pay the zakat over the two millions yes brother assalam alaykum Salam what would you suggest zakat on nonh Halal money zakat on nonh Halal money there is no zakat on nonh Halal money simply because it is not owned by you you cannot pay zakat on my friend's uh property because this is not my money I earned it through sell in drugs I earned it through selling intoxicants I stole the money this money is not mine it's Haram money and me being Haram means that I cannot keep it I cannot utilize it I have to spend it yes brother can the income tax be given through zakat money that's very good question can we consider income tax to be part of our zakat and the answer is no zakat has to be paid in in the eight categories and your government is not one of them income tax is probably be going to be spent on buying arms on pavement of roads on building schools and hospitals and all of these are not part of the sources where you allowed to pay your zakat for I'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time oh"
