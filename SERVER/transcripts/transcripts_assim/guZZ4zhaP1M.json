  "transcript": "Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim. Assalamu Alaikum Ya Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. But do not, do not specify Ya Sheikh. Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud, may Allah be pleased with him, said, among the signs of the Day of Judgment, Salamul Khassa. To privately select someone. All of this is just Salamu Alaikum for some. I apologize. Ma'aleesh. Sorry. Thanks for the beneficial knowledge Ya Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. My name is Nasrullah and I am from Kedah. So, what is your opinion on some people who say there are some sunnah that are not applicable or not suitable to be practiced in our modern age or in certain environments. For example, I mean, they are inclined to say that, they are inclined to see some of Sunnah Al-Masru'iyah as Arab customs or cultural things. For example, they think that growing beard for men is a cultural thing. They say that the Prophet, Alayhi Salaatu Wasalam, didn't shave because he didn't have jilat or shaver back then. So, do you agree with them? And if not, what is your advice for them? And a little bit more, Ya Sheikh. Can we take those who befriended or make a coalition with these people who belittle the sunnah as our leader or our ulil amr? Because, for your information, we are in several states and are going to have state elections. First of all, I don't answer political questions because this is way above my pay grade. I am not from this country. So, why are you asking me these questions? Okay, fine. So, this is not an appropriate question to be asked for me. It's way above my pay grade. My pay grade is very low. Ask me about halal, haram. I will answer you. Okay. So, as far as your first question is concerned, those who say these things about the sunnah, we would simply ask them, Do you know the Quran? He said, No. Do you know Arabic? He said, No. Have you read the books of sunnah? He said, No. So, how dare you have the audacity to say such nonsense? I don't waste my time with such ignorant imbeciles. Yes, if he's a scholar, if he's a renowned da'i who has influence, I'll speak to him and debate with him. But, laymen who make fun and, Oh, the Prophet did not shave because he did not have Jalut 2 or Jalut 3. And, how did he shave his pubic hair? This is from the sunnah. Ten characteristics as in Hadith Muslim narrated by Mother Aisha. Ashru khisalin min al-fitra. Shaving the pubic hair. It's shave. They used to have razors. Plucking the armpit. They used to have creams to do that. So, they had razors. So, such an ignorant imbecile who raises such a topic, I don't even waste my time replying to him because he doesn't know anything. So, as for what is sunnah of ibadah or sunnah adah, this is for the scholars to determine. They have rules. They have regulations. They have usool. And, they know what is part of the culture and what is part of the religion and the beard. With the consensus of the four schools of thought, shaving it is haram. Not from me. And, the Prophet said, akrimu al-liha, atliku al-liha, arkhu al-liha, asbilu al-liha. All of these are verbs that order you to just let it be. Do you think I like my beard? Seriously. Do you think I like it? If I can shave it, wouldn't I be the first one to shave it? I'd like to be normal, yakhir. Like everybody else. But, I do it because my Prophet did it, alayhi salam. And, he had a wide, big beard that would fill his chest. And, the companions would know that he recites Quran in zuhr and asr from his back when they see his beard trembling. How would you see his beard trembling if it's not wide? So, I do this because I love my Prophet and Allah knows best."
