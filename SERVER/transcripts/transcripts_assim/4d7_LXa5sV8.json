  "transcript": "have a good time and then go together [Music] the angels will bring bigger to us would descend to us alhamdulillah we're winners okay no no they can hear me very well I know I know my my voice is very distinctive you know people recognize me from my voice unfortunately yes so what is the topic perfect I like globalized world so I get different topics unfortunately so Islam in a globalized world Islam uh versus islamophobia the burning of the Quran so I wrote something I don't know if it's it's something that is uh beneficial or not but we will see inshallah what can you do I'm already here they paid for the ticket I'll have a good two weeks time inshallah and go back home without a problem so I will speak about the islamophobe now when you say phobia this is the fear of something so there are people who have phobia from the dark from closed places from meeting people so when we say islamophobe what is scaring them what is making them frightened of Islam something they don't like I can agree with that I have no problem if people fear something in Islam and they don't like I have no problem with that must everybody like Islam No you don't like Islam no problem but when you act aggressively when you attack this is not islamophobe there is a big difference so when someone speaks ill about Muhammad excuse me I'm an old man some of the brothers here the youngsters drink with their left hand what's the ruling if you drink drink with your right if you eat eat with your right if you give give with your right if you take take with your right because shaytan eats drinks gives and takes with his left so while talking I see people drinking with the left I cannot stop the message please don't and it's embarrassing so this is a general reminder never raise your hand the left to the mouth it's a sin and the prophet saws someone drinking and eating with his left hand so he said to him eat with your right hand the man out of arrogance said I can't so the prophet said may Allah make you never can so the man's hand was paralyzed very dangerous I don't know why they're laughing this is serious when you become paralyzed this is serious the prophet made Dua against you so never raise your hand to the left hand to your mouth now I'm wasting time so that one hour is finished the topic can be easily finished in five minutes but just to accommodate time so when they started to speak ill about the prophet Allah depicting pictures Charlie hebdo in France in Sweden in Holland writing things about the prophet Allah this is not islamophobe this is hatred this is aggression when they started burning the Quran and disrespecting it and this started in 2005 in Guantanamo Bay when the American soldiers wanted to torture the Muslim prisoners and the Muslim prisoners did not do anything so they did not know what to do so they started to take the Quran tear it up throw it in the toilet and the Muslims were outraged this is what they did and they started to try to disrespect the Quran in Bangladesh and Afghanistan in Europe in Germany in Sweden in many many different countries then they started to attack the hijab first they started to attack the new cup of women okay we take the nikab off they started attacking the hijab the head covering no problem we take it off they started attacking modesty so even if a girl goes to to the school wearing decent clothes no no you have to wear a bikini go to the swimming pool with other boys this is serious this is how they're forcing girls and boys in Sweden in Norway in Denmark to have physical education mixed how can I take my daughter there how can I take my son when my son is a teenager and he sees his classmate with him we say we're Muslims it no this is not not good so it's okay we want homeschooling no we will put you in prison and we will take your children and give them to Christian families this is what they're doing in Sweden by the way all immigrants Syrian Iraqis afghanis who go there few months they take the children why physical abuse child abuse you're not good parents and they give it to Christian families and this is democracy this islamophobe no it's not islamophobe it's hatred against Islam so when you look at this continuous attack against Islam why what did we do to them in Indonesia how many Muslims masha'allah 300 million 240 I am not very good in math so let's make it an even number 300 million 300 million Muslims masha'allah what did you do to them why do they hate you if we want it to be aggressive and we wanted to fight and hate them if we spit on them they will drown it was just Muslim serial they will drowned the whole country was drowned so many Muslims so why do they hate Islam now they hate Islam because they are bullies they came hundreds and 150 years ago they took our lands they took our wealth they enslaved Us in India in here Holland in all Muslim countries were conquested by these disbelievers now we're becoming alhamdulillah a strong power we're becoming independent they don't want this they want us to be their slaves so they are bullying us now what does a bully want when someone bullies you what does he want when your boss at work bullies you when your husband I'm talking to the sisters The Gents said he knows he knows no I'm not talking so when your husband bullies you what does he want when your mother-in-law bullies you what does she want every bully wants a negative reaction from you he wants you to be depressed to be sad to be intimidated so this is what a bully usually wants so if we react like they want they win we lose so what to do when some people start bullying us about our religion we have one or two Solutions number one do what they want so they start to curse the prophet Allah what should we do yallah Bismillah let's go demonstrations a hundred thousand five hundred thousand protest demonstration carrying banners everyone their political agenda so Banner for this organization Banner for that organization and they go masha'allah hundreds and thousands of people in the process we burn some shops we break cars we attack the police the police are Muslims their relatives no no no problem we love the Quran said no no we are avenging the quran's burning they're burning it in Sweden not here he said no no we have to show them so what will happen they will win we will lose look at those who are protesting why are you protesting because I love the Quran how much do you memorize from the Quran nothing okay do you know Sunnah said do you pray I said yes every Aid alhamdulillah I pray AIDS prayer so when you look at the people it's their enthusiasm it's their love to Islam but this is not Islam the prophet did not tell you Allah do this so this is the action number one when somebody bullies you you do this now some Muslims reaction number two they don't do anything why the vast majority of Muslims don't care why because it doesn't concern them either burning the Quran so this is the word of Allah okay so what are you gonna do huh I don't know why because they don't know the Quran they have no connection with the Quran and the vast majority of Muslims today if I say um which Surah is this Ayah in see little little people are laughing the vast majority are soon Google search what eye is this [Music] this is not an Ayah this is a Hadith you're very funny I wasn't joking this is a Hadith and the sad thing is 99 people don't know and this is the most famous Hadith in Islam the most famous Hadith in Islam Imam he says Islam revolves on free Hadith one of them the second one is is mashallah they don't know the difference between Aya and Hadith are you a Muslim Sidious where show me so this is reaction two reaction One let's burn property let's break cars let's attack the police reaction number two nothing so what is it that we're supposed to do now Islam is a civilized religion because if they burn the Quran we bring the Bible and burn it [Music] have you seen any Muslim burn the Bible subhanallah why because we're civilized we're Muslims we agree that this Bible is not the correct Torah and the correct injil it has been altered it has been changed but we do not insult your religion I don't agree with your religion but I don't insult your religion why because Allah told me not to do so in the Quran Allah says yeah this is this is Quran what does it translate to Allah says and do not insult those they invoke other than Allah the idols they worship don't insult it it's idols Allah says don't insult their Idols why lest they insult Allah in enmity without knowledge when you insult my Idols I will shout what you worship which is Allah no stop don't so Islam is a very very high civilized religion not like them they don't believe in religion they don't believe in Christianity they don't believe in anything they believe in their corrupt ideology so how and what is the best way to deal with such I wouldn't say islamophobe I would say how to deal with such aggression hatred and enmity against Islam we have to turn the table on their heads and this is what I tell people that bully you when people bully you you should turn the table on their heads how by not reacting as they anticipate sometimes I communicate with people of ignorance and they don't like my Approach they don't like the way I speak like a lot of Muslims they don't like what shirazim says because he's very aggressive he's he puts it in your face he doesn't you know he's not diplomatic he's not any soft he put it in your face and leaves I don't care so they don't like what I say so after arguing with them some of them may become a little bit aggressive and he said you don't make any sense you're an ass I said yes this is my nickname as I am so my students come they're insulting you no no this is my nickname this is how my name is spelled a-s-s-i-m this is my name so they said no no no no sure they are insulting you said listen when someone comes to me and says hey us am I going to grow two ears and a tail do I care what people say about me I know myself when you say oh Sheikh you are the best chair am I going to you know become like a balloon and when you come to me and say Sheikh you're the worst Sheikh am I going to be sad and start crying and weeping I know myself I don't need you to evaluate me likewise when they attack Islam when they are aggressive against the Quran or the prophet Allah I will not go to their level and do what they want me to do positively someone comes to you and says you're like this you're this you did that you don't defend yourself because he will continue to argue with you don't go into debates just give a big smile and take your mobile and check your WhatsApp messages [Music] let him speak speak speak after one hour he will look around this he will he will feel ashamed because you're not reacting so any bully that comes to you said look at you your dress is not nice look at you Chef you're wearing a dress like women and you're wearing hijab a big smile okay then what nothing I'm not gonna answer you so this is number one we have to ignore them we have to not give them any attention rather we have to be proactive how number one they insult the Quran what should we do glorify the Quran how to glorify the Quran okay you're insulting the Quran in Sweden today inshallah every day I will study the Quran for one hour I will read the Quran I will memorize one page I will learn the tafsir and next week I will come with five six brothers and we will meet in the Masjid in a tenure Masjid huh okay they will come here [Music] that's why he's checking his WhatsApp message so we come to the Masjid we study the Quran and we start sending sms and WhatsApp messages about this beautiful Ayah we spread the beauty of the Quran and we memorize it and we spread it between the people one of the most beautiful reactions I have seen in the world for this burning of the Quran what Kuwait did beautiful Kuwait is a very tiny suburb of Jakarta yeah the old kuwaitis maybe 200 000. so what did they do they printed 100 000 copies of the Quran in Swedish and they will go and give it to the sweets so you burn it no problem we will distribute it to one hundred thousand now some of the Swedish people they say what is the Quran I don't know Google it I don't know what the Quran when they get a copy let me read and maybe Allah will guide them to Islam so see this is proactive this is positive thinking also if you look at the Western World America Europe Canada they all collaborate they are good strong friends when it comes to attacking Islam this is in the Quran this is Allah says and never will the Jews and the Christians approve of you until you follow their religion so they will never be happy with you and I until we follow the religion take off your hijab I took it off shave your beard this is for the men I shaved it okay now eat pork I don't like pork no you have to drink wine do this do that so you end up leaving your religion only when you leave your religion they give you Asylum they give you residency they accept you but if you're abiding by your religion they will never be happy with you and this shows you how Hypocrites they are Every Nation they say we are having freedom of speech we have democracy our people are independent we have no control over them now who approved this attack against the Quran the courts they went to the court and they said we would like to have permission to burn the Quran in front of the large Masjid of the big Masjid on the day of Eid and look at the timing and look at the permission the court looked into it said Quran okay no problem Bismillah this is me Bismillah they approved it so why would you approve such a thing oh Sheikh because we have freedom of speech will not like you you have freedom of speech huh last week the Muslim countries in the United Nations gave a resolution to make attacking and insulting religious figures like Quran the prophet to be a crime the majority approved who disagreed Belgium Finland France as usual Germany Luxembourg Britain and America these are our favorite countries I like Hollywood I like Taylor Swift why is they where why are they doing this to me I love these people ah because they say we have freedom of speech okay you have freedom of speech I agree this is your right can I speak about Holocaust the burning of the Jews at the time of Hitler can I say um six million I think this is a little bit too much maybe six thousand if I say this immediately will put me in jail I will not be able to do anything it's a crime All Over America and Europe why no freedom of speech here okay can I speak about the lgbtq plus plus one two three we don't have any alphabet alphabets are all gone they took it so can I speak I said no this is hatred I didn't hate anything I just saying that this is against Islam so no this is why we will ban you in UK we will ban you Australia we will ban you in New Zealand we will ban you in America will ban you in Europe what did I do I say I just said it is prohibited in Islam and in Christianity and in Judaism this is what's in the book I didn't say kill I didn't say Throw don't fall I didn't say throw anything from a building or stone no no nothing I just said that this is a mental illness so no this is what is freedom of speech so why is freedom of speech only limited to attacking Islam and the Muslims and and the likes therefore when we look at their Independence the people are independent we have no control of them yes in Arabia you control the people in the Middle East you control the people but in in the Western World no no they are free to say whatever they want to do okay in this case we have to speak to them in their own language what is their own language we will not attack we will not kill we will not burn we will not break we will not destroy anything what is the language they understand who elected the officials the people who elected the judges the people the people what do you say about burning the Quran freedom of speech okay alhamdulillah you agree in this case I will speak to you with the language you understand 240 million let's assume Muslims in Indonesia boycott Swedish products don't buy anything Swedish oh no this is crime why are you doing this you're hurting our economy freedom of speech I'm just telling the people don't buy Volvo I don't know Volvo is a Swedish not anymore I think Tata owns it it's Indian I don't want to get into politics Maybe the owner of Ikea here generally speaking if we boycott these countries that are insulting our religion alhamdulillah we have many other alternative substitutes why insist on buying this if we do this they will feel the burn they will feel the pain and we will honor our religion also we have to support the Akida foreign this is an essential part of our religion what is loyalty so he is my Muslim brother I'm loyal to him but he's from a different country and he doesn't speak Arabic no problem he's Muslim he's my brother and this one he is Christian but he's an Arab and he is neighbor to me no he's not my brother my brotherhood with you is and our allegiance to the Quran to Prophet Muhammad this is our Brotherhood so we have to revive this loyalty and to also disavow those who do not relate to our Akita and show them that we have this Brotherhood in Islam Allah says in the Quran there has already been for you an excellent pattern in Ibrahim and those with him when they said to their people indeed now their people is what so they said to their own people indeed we are disassociated from you and from whatever you worship other than Allah we have denied you and there has appeared between us and you animosity and hatred Forever Until You Believe in Allah alone this is what we have to have in our religion you're a Muslim you are my dear brother I don't like you but you're my brother I will support you I will help you I will stand next to you in Salah Toe to Toe shoulder to shoulder and we will eat from the same food I will help you but if you are not a Muslim or if you are a openly sinner I cannot have this friendship and closeness with you among the ways and the best ways to counter this aggression against Islam is to give dawa and muhammadiya gives dawa this is the role of muhammadiya is to give how to give dawah I'm not a good speaker or a loudspeaker I'm not very good in giving speech I'm not very good in writing articles how to give who said dawah is only giving is being a Muslim that's all if you do not lie if you do not cheat if you do not say bad words everybody recognizes you as a good Muslim this is Islam this is the best dawah when you come on time nine o'clock and you leave on time five o'clock but when you come 10 30 and you spend half an hour eating breakfast and one hour before Adam before you go make Allah go to the Masjid pray 10 or 15 or 20 and then praise and then pray I pray another 500 raka and you go to the office at 3 30 then have lunch and read the newspaper and read and leave 4 30 telling your friend to sign on your behalf what is this you're not a real Muslim so to be a real Muslim and to give a good dawah is what Allah says in the Quran and who is better in speech than one who invites to Allah and does righteousness and says indeed I am of the Muslims this is the best form of dawa if people see me in Siberia in Alaska in Europe in Saudi I'm the same maybe I will be wearing jeans and t-shirts but I'll be the same I will not change that the clothes don't make a difference my behavior my attitude my smile I don't smile a lot but drink with your right hand and not your left hand so we do our level best to give all the time because I'm a proud Muslim and I'd like everyone to become as proud as I am finally good thank you good okay finally don't fear for the Quran because Allah azzawajal says indeed it is we who sent down the message that is the Quran and indeed we will be its Guardian it's protected by Allah imagine this is the beauty of the Quran if we bring all copies of the Quran in the world and we burn it today all not a single copy is kept tomorrow we will write an exact copy of the Quran in no time why because we have at least 100 million have it knowing the Quran by heart every single letter in my Masjid I pray lead the prayer and I make a mistake in one Ayah nine-year-old child behind me corrects me after I finish the uh uh the Salah I hold him from his neck foreign because he is preserving the Quran so don't be more Roman than the Romans in the sense that the Quran they burn it I am sad but I will not react like they want me to do when we have an old copy of the Quran in the house torn or maybe some uh soup or some soft drink was spilled on it what do we do with it to protect it what do we do with it we burn it we burn the Quran because we want to preserve it we burn the Quran to honor it not to humiliate it so they do it to humiliate it but we do it to honor it so at the end of the day Allah will preserve and protect his religion his book and the prophet Muhammad when is Muhammad [Music] I'm not going to speak more but I think we'll be opening for the questions yes [Music] or through WhatsApp thank you um okay uh yeah um thank you thanks also for sharing glad to meet you in person right now so because I usually look at you on YouTube with your boom sound effects from here um also we'll talk here on YouTube so um Indonesia I will ask you uh English also but because because it's the important topic so okay um [Music] not me the Indonesia is is the issue that he writes [Music] freedom of speech that is um [Music] okay um [Music] so I would assume that I understood what he said but if explains it to me that there are sects and Cults that are involved in Bida so where is the freedom of speech when we want to denounce their Buddha and is this the right thing okay first of all ah azzawajal says in the Quran wisdom Fair preaching so if I see someone doing Bida should I put him on the ground and start jumping on his stomach is this logical if you're doing Buddha and I come to you and say what is this well you're in hell you are doomed in hell you are ignorant imbecile will you accept from me you will not accept there is a an art dawah is an art it's diplomacy its wisdom so first of all it's a very very important issue for the Youth especially the youth why because the youth are very young so what's your youth young of course we understand this no no you did not get what I meant they youth like they say I'm hot blooded baby can't you see I have this fever of 103. so I'm Hot Blooded you know I just want to kill people I want to destroy I want to do something why this is the youth they can't control themselves no number one you have to control yourself because in Islam we judge things by the consequence what do you mean if I do this what will happen it would this and this or this and this okay then I have to do whatever is good because when my actions lead to good I do it when my actions lead to harm I refrain like the Ayah do not insult the idols they worship so that they would not insult Allah azzawajal so I will stop so I have to look when I see Bida some people make it their role in life like a fly you know fly they fall on food on uh waste on dirt on garbage so whenever they season Haram nobody will accept this from you people have to love you have to respect you have to know that you want good for them then they will accept some of the youth the moment they are guided to Islam and they start practicing Sunnah masha'allah they start to grow the beard the soap goes short they put the misoise in very good it's only five days and they start controlling this is not good Haram you're doing kufur your go to hell mother what are you doing this is not appropriate you have to wear the hijab you should not sit with my uncles you should not listen to music you should not look my sister my brother how will they treat him get out of the house go go somewhere it's your mistake because you don't have knowledge you don't have diplomacy you have to know the consequence if I do this what will happen big problem stop little problem um no problem Bismillah go ahead so now we come to the people who do innovation it is not my role to criticize oh jamaa X they're Innovative Jamara why they're very bad W is this and I just pick and choose who's right only me I am the only one who's on the Sunnah everybody else is in Hellfire this is this is wrong to show people what Islam is not to attack others so you following the Sunnah following the Quran and Sunnah with the understanding of the three favorite generation teach the people this instead of attacking this Jama this group this people this this no no don't attack just present Islam as it is in me in the meantime yes we say for example we go and pray in Fajr in the Masjid this is a new Bida now everybody's looking hmm Eda every day after Fajr Salah and thicker people make sajdah what is this every day so this Allah has given me so much this is Buddha would you say this he looks at you is wahhabi from Saudi yes subhanallah did the prophet do this no did the companions do this no so do you know more than them said no no this is for Allah not for you okay this is so you have to have diplomacy you have to know how to speak to them it's not very easy I hesitate three four times before I speak to someone because I know how he will feel against me but I see him I said immediately what do you want I said I find Masha Allah you always pray in the first row in the Masjid Masha Allah I love you for the sake of Allah very little people pray Fajr in the first row now he's okay thank you yes very good mashallah people don't make Decker now his guard is down he's comfortable with me and he said but I'd like to ask you one question but please please don't be angry with me I'm like your younger brother he said younger brother you're 50 years older than me that you're doing I know in the first book there are two sajdas tilawa when I recite the Quran and says that Sugar said yes once in a lifetime when they told him that the Army has won he made but what if my wife cooks good Nasi goren and ding ding and and uh so should I make such that Shakur said no she does this every week then what you're doing after Fajr is not from the Sunnah marriage please forgive me 99.99 this is thank you and they stop it is shaytan who is making us you know hesitate and be afraid but not everyone I have to go and say okay don't do this don't do this don't do this you have to be diplomatic and you have to present the dean of Allah azzawajal instead of criticizing people I don't know if this answers your question do you want it in Bahasa inshallah the translation [Music] are you proposing yeah you don't know it needs their names so one good uh how to answer or react from Christian crimes that say Islam has many branches included how should we uh first of all do I have to answer every question a Christian says against Islam no I have to present the Real Islam so when someone says Islam has many branches she uh Sunni ahmadiya not muhammadiya and and so I said listen no Islam has only one branch it is the branch of the Prophet Muhammad this is Islam now we talked usually to the Shia when they say no you have to be Shia you have to say was the prophet Shia and they said there was no Shia at the time of the prophet if there were no Shia at the time of the Prophet why can't we be like the prophet Allah end of story so when they say to you this you can say to them okay Christianity has Catholicism the Orthodox Protestants and they have many books they have this and this and this this is not something you can say about a religion the religion of Islam is found in the Quran you want to ask me question ask me about quranism and I hope this answers your question [Music] [Laughter] [Music] Oklahoma for as you mentioned as we mentioned before uh there are so many countries about this one at the same thing we'll say employment products it might be a confidence might be distracted no my question is about if the uh in a recent page Romania faces critical role so shaping public opinion about Islam how do you think this impact effort to compare the Islamic organizations okay first of all the media tries but they will never succeed because the religion is not mine or yours it's Allah and Allah in the Quran said that he will give Victory to his word and to his religion so I have no problem with that the problem is what did we do in the media to honor our religion now if you go to the vast majority of Muslims Instagram or Facebook or face hell I don't know what and you look into it do you find in the timeline ten percent about Islam you will never find ten percent five percent maybe one percent and the rest is all about movies about women about their profile picture I'm looking like this now today I'm and and you see pictures yeah the people are proud of their pictures and it's ugly but they say no it's good it's nice and you get likes likes of whatever if you put a picture of a dog you will get likes so the Muslims are not honoring their Islam so the media will continue to write things about Islam but it will nobody believes it nobody believes that this is bad about Islam because Muslims alhamdulillah are strong but we have to see what have we presented to Islam so when the media does bad things what should we do burn demonstrate protest no UE right good things about Islam we be proactive and positive inshallah um how do you forecast next 10 years of Islam so and how can you should be prepared for them my crystal ball is in the room [Laughter] so I cannot forecast what will happen in 10 years time what is this [Applause] now why why do I say this I could have I could have said onshaallah in 10 years time the Muslims will be stronger the Beards will be longer and but this is not reality you want what's beneficial what's beneficial is not what's in 10 years what's today you ask yourself do I pray five times on uh from five times a day on time oh for sure it's very early I can't I pray it at seven o'clock and Bohr is this and Asar I sometimes I get sleepy but alhamdulillah if I pray on time and you want the forecast after 10 years you'll be in hell pray on time abide by the law of Allah deal with Muslims like Muslims if you took their money unlawfully give it back to them don't cheat don't deceive how is your relationship with your parents are you disobedient go and kiss their feet and say I'm sorry and be good to them how is your relationship with your kinship I haven't seen my uncle in six years why because he lives in the next street subhanallah you will never enter Jannah if you cut your kinship and this is your forecast don't look about the Muslims forecast who cares I don't care about you I care about myself if you all go to Jannah and I go to hell no the hell with you all you go to hell I go to Jannah let's be clean I don't care about you I care about myself if I go to Jannah inshallah you all come no problem but I don't put you in Jannah and then maybe I go to help me no so don't care about the forecast what will happen care about what Allah will ask you in your grave what Allah will ask you on the day of judgment this is all what you care about as for the forecast I know 10 years 20 100 years Allah will make this religion Victorious so when Mahdi comes when Risa peace be upon Him descends the victory with being shout out to Islam when I don't know but I will not wait and say inshallah will come okay we need you to go and give a lecture no no no my ID will come inshallah everything is good no you have to act you have to do something you have to show Allah your sincerity and then Allah will take care of his religion foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] if you read Surah al-baqarah Allah speaks in the first two three eyes about meaning and then two three eyes about and then eight nine years about al-muraf about the hypocrites the Hypocrites are everywhere and in the beginning there were no Hypocrites in Makkah why because Islam was weak when they went to Medina and Islam became strong then the Hypocrites appeared whenever Islam is strong hypocrisy becomes widely spread because they are enemies of Islam they cannot attack Islam because if they attack Islam people will fight with them so what to do they work from underground they put doubts in your head about Islam oh this is not Hadith no Hadith is not good we only believe in Quran we believe only in the Quran whoever believes in the Quran and rejects I don't have to any sugar coated because Allah says in the Quran you have to follow the prophet I said you have to follow the sunnahu yeah whoever goes against the prophet salaam and follows other than the way of the Believers we will put him in hell so we have to know that the hypocrites they will come and try to undermine Islam how to deal with them we have to expose them we have to show the people that this is against Islam without giving we're not Isis we don't give taxi but we have to expose them Allah says in the Quran you should identify the Hypocrites in the way they speak you can tell that they're using crooked ways when they speak they don't speak they try to undermine Islam so we have to expose them we have to show in the media whatever allegations they present we put counter allegation because the Jihad of the kuffar it was is with the sword the jihadist of the Hypocrites is with the tongue and with the pen so this is the role of the ulama the scholars Whenever there is an attack on Islam they come and clarify this for the Muslims inshallah [Music] regarding facing pregnancies first of all AMA who may be deviated and deviant and using other than the way of the Quran and the Sunnah the best way to deal with them is to ignore the moment you reply to them you give them status you give them strength and people say oh I didn't know this let me check his profile his website and they will learn from them and this is one of the ways of bullying this deviant when you walk and there is a dog that would bark at you will you fall on your hands and knees and bark back [Music] if you're a dog yes but if you're not you will walk away so these deviant want attention they want prominence they want fame if you talk to them and unfortunately unfortunately unfortunately a lot of the Muslims are looking for fame people come to me Allah you're very good pray to Allah that I become famous like you I pray to Allah you never become famous do you think we like being famous I wish nobody knew me Wallah I wish that nobody knows me or think of me as famous I don't want to be famous so you ask or you learn knowledge for the sake of Allah not to be a scholar not to be a island not to be someone people watch you and follow you no you do it for getting close to Allah if Allah wants to make you famous yes the vast majority of people nowadays they want fame so even duat unfortunately every time you go to their website Instagram this is me in Sunset this is me at sunrise this is me eating durian what is this he said no no this is for dawa whatever is teaching people Allah and benefiting people but you want thing and most Muslims nowadays they want fame if they are not followed they say things that is bad about Islam so that they would people mention them and this is very dangerous it would take people to help may Allah protect us all foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] on your body I don't know if I understood the question correctly but if I understood it then I'm the life not to correct me he's saying that we have to react and I said yes you have to react but your reaction can be positive and can be negative a negative reaction is when you don't react you don't do anything you just sit I said okay no problem a negative reaction is when you go in demonstration and you break burn demolish and do things that are bad the positive the Islamic reaction is to take a number of steps one learn the Quran spread it social media uh printing books doing dawa being a proper Muslim this is the best reaction to it because when you just demonstrate and protest this is what you find in Bangladesh in Pakistan in Indonesia in other countries every time something happens let's go to the streets and people protest mashallah then what nothing next week protest protest this is not the doing of the companions this is against this is for hooligism this is for uh barbaric people to express whatever they want and this is why even in politics you don't like what let's go to the streets this is not Islam so it's you have to govern and control your actions through Quran and Sunnah demonstration is not from the Quran you honor your religion you honor the Quran by the steps we mentioned earlier and Allah Knows Best [Music] or not okay so women will hate me join the club welcome in Islam let's look at women involvement in Islam how many of Juma did Madara Isha give and she's the most knowledgeable of all companions how many zero mother um Sophia hafsa all the mothers of the Believers who are close to the prophet and knowledgeable never participated in politics never participated in public speeches nowadays we have beautiful sisters coming in my place and giving khutba to men and the men [Music] good speech awesome this is not halal the prophet said and this is in the Masjid we are in the Masjid the best role for men is the first the the worst role for men is the last the best role for women is the last and the worst role for women is the first why Allah is telling you keep women and men segregated and far away this is what Allah says this is what the prophet taught Allah the prophet said foreign do not enter upon women meaning women are in a room do not enter so one man said o prophet of Allah what about my brother to come into women you know the brother-in-law my uncle my relatives I trust them they're my relatives the prophet said if you want death to come to your wife and and women folk allow your brothers and Nan maharam to come and mix this is the prophet saying Islam nowadays no no this was 15 centuries ago now it's okay it's free we have Indonesia Got Talent so no problem women come and dance and sing what is this this is Islam say this is Islam she's wearing hijab because her hair is afro not because she's feeling Allah I see women wearing hijab and they wear leggings and they were tight clothes discovering their hair yeah because it's not any well prepared this is not Islam women should be in their homes they should teach women in schools in universities only women the moment a woman mixes up with man we have Monica Lewinsky versus Bill Clinton when she was yet he cheated with an intern because this is free mixing so no women in politics is zero accepted in Islam you stay with the women teach them and and be with them and mix with them as you wish seven days a week no problem the moment you come with men this is not a very good and positive thing at all I don't have close except I finished okay foreign
