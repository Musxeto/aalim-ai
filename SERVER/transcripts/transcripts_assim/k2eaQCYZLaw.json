  "title": "Will Allah forgive me for having an affair with a married woman? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "basically he says that a man had an affair with a married woman would Allah ever forgive him take this as a rule of thumb our Lord Allah the Almighty the creator of the heavens and the earth forgives all and every single sin with a major or minor whenever a person comes to him expressing remorse and repenting to Allah the Almighty and seeking his forgiveness the only sin that Allah does not forgive if a person dies without repenting is shirk or cover that is disbelief or associating others with Allah so this brother who committed adultery with a married woman definitely he has committed one of the major sins in Islam in the hadith the Prophet was asked a resolution about the most major sins so he said to associate others with Allah though he had created you the Almighty then to fornicate or before that the second major sin is to kill your child fearing that he would feed with you meaning because of poverty and thirdly the Prophet said Allah salatu salam to commit adultery with the wife of your neighbor your neighbor is the closest one to you and he has many rights over you instead of giving him his rights you are committing such a major sin and all of these threes thins 3 sins are mentioned at the end of surat al-furqan where allah azza wajal chapter 25 where allah azzawajal says well Adina LIUNA mala HeLa and after what I have to learn a new facility Harlin allahu allah allahu allah as noon al qiyamah so these are the sins that are mentioned and indeed Allah Azza WA JAL forgives such sins to those who repent and seek remorse providing that they repent and seek Allah's forgiveness"
