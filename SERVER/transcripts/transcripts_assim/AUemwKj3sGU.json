  "transcript": "[Questioner] says, there is a service \nwhere people can get their groceries delivered early or sometimes \neven at a cheaper rate. This service also gives you access to \nmovie channels which I will not use. Can I get this service in order \nto get items delivered early? This for the purpose of not advertising, \nthis service is an app where you can buy things online and they deliver it to \nyou whether it's groceries whether it is accessories whatever you name it they \nhave it now they have a extra service where you pay money so like you pay \nthem two or three maybe four dollars a a month, which they say that now you qualify \nfor our elite member, which means that we can deliver you, instead of five days, we \nwill deliver you the following day, maybe in the same day. And we will not charge you for certain \nproducts that are part of our elite services. And they also have this movie and series service, \nwhich is of course all haram, but we're not interested in the haram aspect. We're interested in getting our groceries \nor our items that we buy online on time and free of charge. So is this $4 that I pay a \nmonth something permissible? A great deal of scholars say \nthat this is not permissible. Why? They say because this is like gambling. And people say, why is it gambling? If I buy a lottery ticket I may lose the dollar \nthat I bought it, which is most likely, or I may get a chance, one in a \nmillion, to hit the jackpot. Yeah, this is gambling. This is maisir. This is totally prohibited. But when I pay $4 and I frequently make six \nor ten or 20 orders a month and I get a good price, fast delivery, excellent handling, \nthis is a service I'm paying for. So the majority of scholars \nsay, no, this is gambling. There are a group of scholars, or there is \na group of scholars that say that this is service fee which you are getting in \nreturn a service so if the company themselves are offering and there is \nno burden or extra cost on you which translation Arabic to [ ] so it's \nnot winning all or losing all as in gambling as in insurance for example, \nlosing all my premium or winning all getting way way more than what I paid \nfor. No this is a service you're paying for and you're getting in return what \nyou have paid for. They say that this is permissible and there is nothing \nwrong in that and I'm inclined to this opinion and Allah azza wajal knows best."
