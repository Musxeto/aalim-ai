  "transcript": "So the first question is, if my parents get a dinner invitation and I don't know the family but I know my parents' friend circle, 99% of them usually backbite, can I disobey them and not go for the dinner? A lot of the youth ask these hypothetical questions and when you ask such a question, it's not an isolated halal haram, yes or no? But when you come and say, Sheikh, my parents want me to go with them to a gathering and 99% they will be backbiting, free mixing, can I say no? So I said okay, say no because you can't participate in haram. So the guys go and confront their parents as if they have conquered Al-Quds and freed it. No, I will not go with you, this is haram, free mixing. What will you do? I'll sit home and watch Netflix. What was this the Sheikh told you to do? No, but I asked the Sheikh, one plus one equals two and he said two, khalas, alhamdulillah. There is diplomacy, there is wisdom, there is kindness and dutiful and being obedient. So many of the youngsters are professionals in diverting and repelling their parents away from Islam. Your parents hate Islam because of you and you're the reason because you don't have the diplomacy. Ya Akhi, you know how much it means to your father that you go with him. Yes, there might be haram, don't sit where it's haram. So I don't go Sheikh. No, no, go. But show your father that you're going for his sake and to honor him in front of his relatives and friends. When there is haram, take yourself out, go to another room, go outside, do anything, put your iPods, try your level best to have a win-win. Yes, you're not allowed to sit where there is backbiting or free mixing, but improvise. Don't make it a clash. It's not either black or white. There always can be a room for innovation in a halal way, not innovation. Innovation to make things softer. Your father would appreciate though he knows where you're coming from because you came and honored him and you show him that I'm coming just to honor you, my father. And Allah knows best."
