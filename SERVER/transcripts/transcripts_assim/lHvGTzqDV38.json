  "title": "Nutmeg Spice allowed in Islam? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "Alia from Ireland? Sheikh I want to ask about, I have read a\nfatwas about nutmeg, they flavor spices that we use for food, they say that it is prohibited\nand it has intoxicants so i use it for flavoring of the food, is that allowed or it is not\nallowed? As you have read alia, nutmeg is a spice that\nif consumed in large quantities, it intoxicates you so the ulema, the scholars have differed\nin this regard. some of them say that it is totally prohibited\nexactly like the case when we have some chocolates with brandy or rum in em so if i eat 3, 4,5\nmmm it tastes nice but its not intoxicating, i'm not going to be wasted, i'm not going\nto have a hangover uh next morning but, still its prohibited Why? if i'm not intoxicated,\nwhy is it prohibited? because the Prophet said ï·º, in definition, to us, what intoxicates\nare, he said Ma Askhara Katheeruhu fa kaleelahu haram, whatever consumed in large quantities\nand intoxicates you then a very little amount of it is prohibited, so if I'm a social drinker\nand I'm attending a wedding and they say well lets give a toast for our bride and groom\nand I drink a little bit of champagne, I'm not gonna be intoxicated but its totally haram\nand its a major sin and I'll be cursed for that. Now this is the general rule, whatever intoxicated\nin large quantities, little of it is haram and this is why some scholars say it is totally\nprohibited and I'm inclined to follow that opinion. Other scholars said that due to the fact that\nits an issue of dispute and its not intended for itself, blah blah blah, a little bit of\nit is permissible and I beg to differ so if you ask me about my own opinion which is backed\nby evidences, as I've just stated, I say that you should avoid putting it in your spices\nand Allah azza wa jal knows best"
