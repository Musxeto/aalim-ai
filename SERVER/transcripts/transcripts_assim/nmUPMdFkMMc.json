  "title": "Two Umrahs in one trip valid? Did umrah, now in Madinah, can I do another umrah? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I had asked you this on that I came in uh sa Arabia inan in Makkah I did my umra now in Raman I'm in Madina I would be going back to M for a few days but now I'm confused whether I should do an umrah again because it gives you a reward of Hajj but on the other hand doing two umras in one Journey even Innovation as you have said many times so I wanted guidance in this respect answered you I think whether on my website or on Twitter and I told you you can make another om you assume your from Medina because you are still a traveler so yes the not being recommended to make another om is for someone in meca who made and stay in Mecca he goes to Mid perform from there and goes and makes on second om the following day he goes to M performs and comes and performs a third this is not from the Sunnah nevertheless no one said it's not accepted it is accepted but it's if you looking for reward this is not the right way of doing it because the Sunnah is to have one omra per travel as for you you have already traveled to Medina so when you're coming back this is a second Journey besides those who are deprived from coming frequently some people come for om once in their lifetime they don't have the means to come again and again we tell them yeah if you want to make another om for your father for your mom no problem in that because you're different from someone like us who goes every month for example maybe twice a month that's different because we're so close to the Haram with the grace of Allah or someone who's wealthy who could afford to travel that is also different and Allah Knows Best"
