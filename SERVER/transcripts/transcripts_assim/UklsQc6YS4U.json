  "transcript": "oh my she says how should we help our Syrian brothers and sisters is there any authentic site where we can donate the plight of our brothers and sisters in Syria is not the first and it's definitely not going to be the last now I've tried my level best to be balanced in answering this question we have great sorrow to what is happening to our brother and sisters there our hearts are filled with sadness and rage at some times but we have to be proactive it is not only happening in a lota it is happening all over Syria and it's not only happening in Syria it is happening in Menem are there oranga are being far more slaughtered than them it's genocide and this is not taking place only in these places you have Afghanistan you have era you have things happening in Libya and before all of that we have the Forgotten cause of the Muslims the real core of the problem which is Palestine which nobody ever speaks about and this where the media comes they take the initiative because we are passive so we sleep for a couple of months and all of a sudden it is crazy everywhere on Facebook on Twitter on YouTube on whatsapp on the media atrocities problems killings bloodshed explosions in a Muslim area so the Muslims are hyped we want to help we want to do this good this is what we to be doing 24/7 but then it comes down and they make it happen somewhere else in a third place and a fourth place what happens is that the Muslims get fed up they get accustomed spreading these photos and videos of Muslim Muslims being attacked kills the heart these are our brothers and sisters and they're suffering yet you're enjoying watching their bloodshed and their plight did they allow you to show their pictures wouldn't that be backbiting wouldn't they feel sorry for themselves that people are circulating their agony and pain so what can we do it's a very simple question that requires a very serious answer in La Jolla Hawaii room area told me I'd tell you why you may be enforcing verily Allah would not change what people are going through until they change themselves you want victory you have to change yourselves if you look all around you the Muslims are not committed to their religion bit by bit they're compromising their own religion if the Prophet has somewhere among us if the Companions were to come alive and see our style of living they would not recognize any of it unless of nematic may Allah be pleased with him was once crying so Azuri asked him anis why are you crying and you are the companion of the Prophet Allah saw Salaam now remember that he is the companion of the professor he said I looked around and could not recognize anything which is similar to the time of the Prophet Elisha lot Salam it for the prayer the only thing that I can relate to is praying five daily prayers and even that you have wasted it meaning you that have been in what would happen if he came in our times and looked at us we've diverted big time away from Islam and this is not beating around the bush every one of us is not complying to Islam we try to make Islam fit our lives rather than make our lives fit into Islam and we ended up with a mutilated Islam that does not relate to the Quran in the Sunnah so we would like to have victory if we want victory we have to change ourselves we have to go back to the Quran and Sunnah fix our communities fix our families fixed our neighborhoods and ensure that everyone is relating to the Quran and the Sunnah nevertheless there will be resistance nevertheless we will have the people dividing into two parties Eman with no hypocrisy in it and hypocrisy full-fledged hypocrites with no Eman in it but at least we can draw the line unlike the present times how can we help the brothers and sisters in Syria make a lot of dua how many times do you make dua for them in the last third of the night at nighttime when you pray 200 how many times do you pray for them in your suit this is something you have to ask yourself how do we help our brother and sisters in Syria by financially contributing and this is why um Aisha says is there any authentic site where we can donate you have to do your homework and ask generally speaking you may trust the Islamic organizations abroad because they're monitored so that there won't be any money laundry or abuse of the money and at the same time they have the liberty to go and help unlike a lot of the other Muslim organizations that were shut down or blacklisted for no apparent reason except that they are helping Muslims so you have to do your work and you have to look for it insha Allah as the origin"
