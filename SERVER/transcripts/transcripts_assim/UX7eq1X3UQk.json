  "title": "How does a Muslim handle Kufr or shirk being discussed in School? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Yunus from Germany. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu. So, in school, in kafir schools, they often teach filth, like homosexuality and so on, and math and useful stuff. The thing is, if they talk about very bad things, like kufr shirk or so, for example, they talk about Romans and what they believed in, for example, they talk about such things. Can I participate and talk, so long as I only say what's in it of itself, correct? Like, they talk about Romans, okay, then I say they made this war because they wanted gold from the Persians, and then, okay, the teacher will definitely say, and they believed the gods commanded them to do this. Or, like, if you talk about homosexuality, and I say, I don't think being black makes you a bad person, I know. I will directly cause the teacher to brainwash students, and in class, there are Muslims and so-called non-practicing Muslims, and the latter one may be influenced. So, it's clear. No, it's not clear, but it's obviously clear to me that there is a problem, and the problem lies in the process thinking, the thinking process, how you process things like this. If you're in a kafir country, and you are obliged to study in their schools, and you know that a very important concept in Islam is to weigh the consequences of whatever you're going to say. So, if the consequences are negative, and the disadvantages outweigh, you stop, and if the advantages outweighs, then you should proceed. Through this thought process, you can evaluate things. So, if you know, if you commented that your comment would result in negative comments, actions, maybe something that is bad, maybe extending the kufr to other venues, in this case, you have to refrain, and you have to study and answer in your exams according to the curriculum and the syllabus. You're not obliged to go and say, no, this is wrong. Islamically, this is the right thing to do. They will give you a zero. What's the point? So, you have to understand and weigh the pros and cons of your actions, and of what you are going to say. You don't have to be a superhero in every incident. Someone said something bad, you have to stop them and be the religious police, and tell them this is wrong, and start a debate. This is not logical. You are in a kafir country, and studying in a kafir school. You have to be diplomatic, you have to be wise. Otherwise, do homeschooling and relieve yourself from all this trouble, and Allah knows best."
