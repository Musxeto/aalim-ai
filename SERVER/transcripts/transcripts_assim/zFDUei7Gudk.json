  "title": "Dripping water from hand shower to floor splashes on my clothes, is it najis",
  "transcript": "Audrey from Bangladesh I think I watched your videos about dealing with bus faster regarding impurities but I have a specific question in our University in the washroom I use the hand shower to spray water on the toilet seat the hand shower has a leak for which water drips from the shower to the floor which is usually wet sometimes this dripping water sometimes this dripping causes water to fall on my shoes and maybe the spraying of water causes water to get on my hands I can't see any visible impurity on the toilet seat or floor so since this is the toilet am I supposed to take the water that got only no you should not because as you have said maybe there is an adjuster on the ground maybe it doesn't work in Islam especially for those who have vishwas who have uh OCD so everything is pure by default until proven otherwise and hence the water in the toilet floor is pure until proven otherwise yeah but there is a possibility that there is najasa there is urine there is impurity there is this there is a possibility but it's not a real thing it's not certainty yes Sheikh but there is a possibility it might be I said okay yes your father might not be your biological father they might have adopted you do you have a DNA test no Sheikh were you there when you were born no I was too little I could not see anything so how do you know that your father is your father I know Sheikh subhanallah so the issue of maybe can destroy your life maybe this mug is nudges maybe the water they made the green tea with is impure or it is from sewer water mixed without them knowing maybe there are this maybe they are that I would refrain from wearing anything because maybe one of my grandchildren touched it with soiled hand I cannot pray in the message that cannot lead prayers and this is not Islam Islam is a religion of ease and simplicity everything is pure till proven otherwise and this is what you should Implement in your life"
