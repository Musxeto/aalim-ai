  "title": "Can we include deceased in our sacrifice (Udhiya/Qurbani) | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "should we offer audrey on behalf of the dead well the prophet is salam used to offer althea on behalf of the living and include anyone else in it from the deceased is legitimate he never offered a separate udhiya for mother khadija for example or for his uncle hamza and they were beloved to his heart so he only offered one ram for himself and his family so you are supposed to slaughter one ram or sheep and there's no problem in including the same realm of sheep your deceased parents your uncles your aunts all your loved ones unless the deceased had made it in their will that every single idol of her you do that on my behalf after my death from the income you get from this building or from this plot or from this shop so if he made that as a will and it is less than one third of what he possesses of his wealth then there's no problem in that inshallah"
