  "transcript": "in Germany there is a law that you have to pay late payment fee or interest depending on the nature of the contract when it is demanded from the selling side so if you miss a monthly payment in any contract it has to do with money involved you are ordered to pay if demanded so for example what makes a contract for internet the provider does not have interest or let payment fee in its general terms and conditions but if you miss a payment or two they will use that law for it so is it allowed to make a contract with monthly payments for needed things like internet if not would it be okay to pay the whole contract at once when it is set for 24 months Whenever there is a late uh payment fee this is riba and this is generally speaking not permissible but if everything in the country runs with such a late payment fee and you cannot do anything about it there is no other alternative so even your flat you or your apartment that you're renting your car your electricity bill your water bill utilities whatever the internet the mobile they all have this clause to ask people to refrain is asking them to live in the jungle or to the forest and be away from anyone else and this is not applicable or possible so when it is this restricted in this suffocating in this case you have to fear Allah to the best of your ability now if you have a full year in advance that you can pay pay you have to pay it so that you don't leave any room for chance or error or mistake but if you don't and this is the only way you can live and survive in this case fear Allah to the best of your ability and Allah knows best face"
