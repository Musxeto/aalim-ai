  "transcript": "I searched very long I found an answer but I I fear that it was from Shia ISO and there came a man to our house and he he said that 38 o'clock and then he drank from a glass of water so some of his spits came on there okay he ate Park like a few hours ago so I know there was snatches on that um on that class and that glass was wiped with a sponge and this sponge came on many other other things and I know you're some sometimes hesitant to answer such questions by but give me an idea how far does it spread is it 10 plates is it one touch is it is it 20 places now the whole kitchen is must I burn the house just tell me a rough idea how far is how far does it spread one spread two spreads this is that is good Varun because what you're doing is cascading things it is a ripple effect that shaytan is throwing in your head this is exaggeration and overthinking now he ate pork and Dead Meat and living monkeys and dogs and and whatever definitely 100 nudges he is not nudges his sweat is not nudges and his saliva is not nudges because when I describe what is on the glass I say a man's saliva I wouldn't say it's pork I wouldn't say it's rotten dogs it's saliva now when someone drinks from a glass and there is a saliva I don't take it to the lab and ask them please can you check what he had for dinner and lunch the past 12 hours just to know whether it's nudges or not so you don't have to burn the house you don't have to check you don't have to wash your hands after shaking hands with them because there is no pork on my hand there is no pork on the glass so don't let shaytan exaggerate things in your head that has no basis ask yourself two questions number one is Islam a religion of ease and simplicity or number two is Islam a religion of hardship and difficulty of course you're going to say number one Islam is a religion of ease and simplicity ask yourself a second question what are you practicing in your daily life ease in Simplicity or hardship and difficulty you're going to say definitely hardship and difficulty in this case you are not practicing Islam maybe Buddhism maybe Hinduism maybe I don't know what religion you're following because my religion is not what you're practicing and I hope this makes sense"
