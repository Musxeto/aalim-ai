  "transcript": "so the next scenario is uh again I think it's common in a way and of course there's circumstances that change it but a woman says I talk I socialize with men at my workplace I don't see anything wrong with it because we're co-workers or we just friends how would you respond to this statement there is an imbalance of hormones maybe she wants to get out of the closet because if she claims that it's okay then I'm afraid she's you know going places yes there is no such thing as relationship Sorry by the chef just to clarify I hope you even for the opposite gender it's not just to the same is that what you assume of course okay I didn't understand no no when you say when a girl says that I have a good relationship with my men coworkers and there's nothing wrong with it so she may is coming out of the closet now she's going to make a a surgery and she's going to switch sexes in the sense but no when you put fuel next to fire you don't say Allah it doesn't explode it's going to burn and the funny thing is that even in the west they say I have like 10 15 girls in my workplace and we've been friends you've been friends because you didn't find the right one and each and every one of us is looking for the right moment and Satan is waiting he's not in a rush you know take your time in the US the president of the US the highest yeah uh position who has a gorgeous wife in a successful life what did he do with an in yeah and what happened it almost derailed his office and career and and and marital life now what would happen in normal cases he waited for the right moment this is what Satan does so Allah when he commands that we segregate between men and women it's not for no reason this is not just for the sake of segregation because it is danger and no man would say oh no I'm not affected yeah so the interesting thing sh is that like we we hear this you know conversation a lot and it it goes back to I see them as a brother I see them as a sister I don't see them in that way it's the circumstances that like how do we what's as you mentioned you answer the question perfectly but now they bring up these you know points that don't have any backing but it's almost as a copout to to still continue these don't quote me I'm a I'm a I'm a Sheikh I'm a fundamentalist I'm a wahabi extremist no no Steve Harvey MH Family Feud yes the well-known comedian standup comedian and and a celebrity he was asked the same question why don't you have friends that are female that are females he said there are no such friendship because men are waiting for you to open the door so that they can put their foot in it's an opportunity so don't ever be deceived y I seen it and this is words of wisdom and I pray to Allah that he guides you into hislam he's he's a good person he's has a good heart and all what he misses is to convert to to accept the word of of of of of the truth but this is a guy from the United States of America always been there lived there and he knows because he's human being he's he knows nature tells him to do ahead"
