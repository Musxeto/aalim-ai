  "transcript": "thank you thank you alhamdulillah I mean so the Battle of her is officially over the prophets of Allah instructed his companions to bury the dead the martyrs at the side of Allah at first the companions took their dead ones to bury them in Medina and while they were in the middle of the way the prophet sent his Messenger to call them back to be buried in Orchard and this is the Sunnah where whenever a person dies he is to be buried where he dies especially in the battlefield and among those who were buried the father of the famous companion of the Prophet Abdullah he was buried along with his brother-in-law and subhanallah and this is a miracle and a sign from Allah azogen usually usually the trend is whoever dies after a year Earth dissolves their bodies and it's all gone this is nature tells us that after approximately 30 years of the battle of or 36 years there came a flood that revealed some of the graves in uh so fian who was the Khalifa The caliph at the time sent to them that redirect and and relocate the graves of your loved ones who were buried in so jabber went he dug out his father and his uncle who was married to his aunt and when he dug them out they were as if they died yesterday nothing has changed the body is still the same everything was still the same to the extent that he says that my father had his hand over one of his wounds and when I removed his hand it was you know still moving it's not stiff like a dead man and it started bleeding again this is unbelievable but this what took place and happened and this is a sign from Allah now this is not the norm with all who die in a battlefield in in Jihad but this was a sign from Allah and akarama something to honor these people with and of course it would bring Comfort to Japanese we were told that the prophet saws comforted jabber and his aunt because his aunt was crying when they brought jabber and the prophet sallam told his aunt cry or don't cry it's up to you he was given the shade with the wings of the Angels till he was resurrected that is his soul so don't be afraid this man is in Paradise and he also comforted a Jabber by saying jabber Your Father Allah brought him and asked him o my servant wish wish whatever you want to wish make a wish so Abdullah what was his wish you think what do you think he wished money to come back he wished oh Allah I wish to come back and fight at your side so can I can die again and again and again Allah said well I've already ordained this preordained this before that no one dies and comes comes back to life so if are we allowed to cry Upon Our dead Brothers well crying is a natural thing this was done by the prophet sallallahu when one of his grandsons died and he had him he held him in his his arms and he started crying and also when his son Abraham who had less than two years old he was less than two years old his mother was Maria the Coptic that was given to the prophet saws by the mokocus of Egypt when he also died the prophet sallam cried and one of the companions objected by saying prophet of Allah you cry the prophet says Allah that this is the mercy of Allah and whoever Allah takes the mercy from his heart is is not a normal human being so crying is allowed what's not allowed is to shout and scream and to behave as if you are not accepting the ruling of Allah some women would tour would tear their their clothes or pull their hair or slam their faces or shout all of this is a measure all of this is considered in Islam as a major sin and a Muslim is not allowed to do this yes I was just going to comment on the same similar thing there are groups which used the Islamic label and the slashed their faces and put blood on their faces when people die yeah this is completely against Islam because whenever you want to label a group you have to put this group to know if if it's an Islamic group or an Islamic you have to you have to put this group through the acid test and our acid test is so if anyone claims to be Mourning the Dead one the Dead uh loved ones by slashing their faces or hitting their heads and backs with chains and swords and and bleeding and considering this to be form of worship to Allah let's see the origin of this does it exist in the Quran and the Sunnah or the actions of the companions if it does not then definitely this is an innovation and a fabrication on Islam it has nothing to do with our religion was a great companion of the Prophet Allah who died at the cause of Allah and wished to come back to fight at the side uh or in the uh for this for the sake of Allah but Allah told him that this was already preordained that those who die do not come back to life and this brings us to another issue is Jesus Christ dead because if he's dead then Allah pre-ordained that the dead are not to be sent alive the answer would be no he's not dead we believe that Jesus Christ did not die peace be upon him and that he was resurrected alive to the heavens and he is awaiting the time where Allah would allow him to come and descend to Earth and he would not bring a new message he would rule with the message and the laws of the Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam going on after all of this took place now the prophet salallahu and his companions are in their wounds yet the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam told them to stand behind him face the Qibla and start supplicating so the prophet sallam stood in front of them and he started supplicating and the things that he said are so strong in Arabic I might find difficulty in translating it into English but I may give it a try he started by praising Allah and saying oh Allah all praise is due to you you Allah no one can give what you withhold and no one can with hold what you give and no one can guide whom you set astray and no one can set astray whom you guide no one can bring close what you put far and no one can can put far what you brought close oh Allah grant us your blessing your forgiveness your mercy and your provision oh Allah I ask you to give us the enjoyment on the Hereafter that does not turn away from us and does not change o Allah I seek the joint on the day of poverty and that is the day of judgment where when everybody is poor nobody owns anything who can dare and say I'm a rich man I'm a powerful man holds everybody in front and says I am the king I am the owner who has the final word who has the Kingdom behind under his uh uh possession and Power and no one dares to answer to answer because it's only Allah on the day of judgment so he's asking Allah for the enjoyment on the day of poverty he's and he says oh Allah I ask you the security on the day that people fear oh Allah I seek refuge in you from the evil of the things that you've blessed us with and I also seek refuge in you from the things that you've prevented us from having o Allah beautify faith and belief in our hearts and make us love it and make us also hate blasphemy and make us hate sins and disobedience o Allah make us among the same and the wise oh Allah let us live Muslims and submitting our will to your will and also let us die as Muslims submitting our will to your will and make us catch up with the righteous on the day of judgment without being ashamed and without being tested oh Allah have your wrath and anger over the disbelievers who disbelieve your Messengers and who reject people from your path and way and have your wrath and Punishment on the people of the book the Jews and the Christians who also fight against the justice and fight Islam beautiful supplication in their wounds nothing but supplicating to the all Mighty I believe we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we will be right back it comes to you the truth and the attribute of the one who created you that he's one and alone running this universe that he doesn't become born he doesn't die he doesn't eat and go to the bathroom this is not God we have problems here yeah it doesn't make sense who was Jesus worshiping that is this recorded in the gospel despite all of the other issues about the gospels we put those aside we just say it's mentioned there in Jesus worship God and welcome back the prophet salallahu buried the Dead supplicated with his companions in a clear evidence and a manifestation of worshiping only one Allah and in accepting whatever Allah azzawajal has decreed upon the Muslims no questions no rejection no objections to what Allah has decreed on them they went with the wounded to Medina and as soon as the prophet sallam arrived in Medina and this was Saturday it's one day event he thought that there is a possibility that the policist would come back and attack Medina because going to Makkah it's about three days ride so maybe they had second thoughts and we didn't do anything let's go back and finish what we've started and that is why the prophet sallallahu told his companions whomever was with us yesterday in in must come and go with us to Hamra al-assad in order to fight the mushriks see if did any one of the campaigns complain about too much fighting battle after battle did one or one of them complain no not not even one of them complained because again this was their objective what is their objective is to support Islam to support the prophet Allah and to get the honor of dying at the cause of Allah so it was excellent for them this is their bread and butter now the prophet Allah encourage them to go to and as we can see on the screen Assad is about eight miles away from Medina it's not that far but again it's outside of Medina So the instructions were clear only those who fought with us were to come out with their wounds and no one else and this was also to show the politics the strength of the Muslims even when they're down and wounded what's the wisdom from to take only the the people who fought before because he wanted those who were with him to be stronger and when you see those who view attacked yesterday still standing in front of you today this means that you you are actually seeking to die at the side of Allah with your wounds so they all went as the prophet sallam called them to go out now exactly as the prophet saws thought in the middle of the way Abu sufyan stood and said to the people what have you done you've done nothing Muhammad is alive Abu Bakr is alive Ahmed is alive and all what you've done were 70 casualties it's nothing let's go back and finish what we came to do in the first place foreign though his father was killed in the Battle of Bader but he was a smart man he said people now we've barely escaped and come on who are we are we fooling we know what took place so if we go back there they're going to come with fresh people who are eager to fight and then something bad is going to happen and we don't want this the majority where with Abu sufian and they all said no we're going to finish what we started now the prophet sallam reached hamrah said and he was met by a man called and he was from a tribe that had good relations with the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam no he was not a Muslim so the prophet Allah met this man and this man was an ally of the Muslims so he gave his sympathies to the prophet sallam and he felt sorry to what happened to his companions and to his uncle especially so the prophet using his wit told him if you see the disbelievers try to turn them back and away from us and This Is War so Mamet went and on the way he met abusafian and those who were with him the the enemy Army and they trusted him so they said my bad where did you come from he told them I came from Medina and I came from a very very strong Army of fresh Fighters who were so eager to kill you I could see it from their eyes and they came in huge numbers all those who did not come to fight in in the Battle of came out now and the minute they heard this they felt afraid because themselves the policies Army were wounded and they were tired and exhausted of what took place so when they heard this they felt afraid and they decided to go to Makkah but also Abu safian used a similar trick so he sent one of his a group of his allies who were neutral like mabbet and he told them that go to Medina and I will give you so and so he made a bounty for them and told them that all what you have to do is go to the prophet saws and his army and tell them that we've met a huge Army of the disbelievers and reinforcements coming from Mecca and they were all coming to invade you so he tried to do the same and this what took place they went and met the prophet and told them that the people are gathering tribes of the Arabia and so much power and they're coming to invade you and what was the answer of the Muslims it was in the Quran where Allah praises the action of the Muslims where Allah says that the people when the people came to them told them fear those who are coming to fight you because they are in great numbers this Allah tells us did not add anything to their hearts except more faith and belief in Allah increase the faith it did not decrease it or made them feel Afraid on the contrary it filled it with faith and they said then Allah is our supporter and we have our full trust in him and this increased in their level of Iman and in the reward of Allah the almighty and nothing happened bad to them the prophet salallahu said in I said for few days and of course they failed to come and made the prophet salallahu because they themselves were afraid and went back to Makkah on that particular year the third year of Hijra the prophet Allah gave his daughter um to his great companion Usman we know that asman was married before two the daughter of the Prophet who died just at the time of the battle of Bader and the following year the prophet sallam immediately gave his second daughter to uthman IBN Athan which indicates that the love and and and and belief in uthman where the Prophet sallam does this to him that is why Atman is known to be Vino the one with the two lights because he married two of the prophets of the daughters and this shows to us that atman's status is far better than status because Ali had only one and one daughter of the Prophet while uthman had two daughters and also um died at the lifetime of may Allah be pleased with him and the prophet said that if I had a third daughter I would have given it to ibnafan to show that the trust and love he had for Earth and also in this year the prophet saws married the daughter of his best friend um and um had a daughter by the name of hafsa and hafsa may Allah be pleased with him uh was married before but her husband happened to die and his and her husband was he was injured on the Battle of Badr and he died so the prophet sallam married her and her marriage story is is quite strange because when her husband died she was left she was widowed so her father went to his best friends he went to Usman giving a fan and he told him as man your wife died that was you run married you're a bachelor now so how about marrying hafsa my daughter and Asthma was still mourning his wife so he said um I can't I don't want I don't feel like Maddie so he wasn't very pleased with that so he went to his second companion and friend he went to um and said Abu Bakr my my daughter hafsa has been widowed and what about if you marry her so Abu Bakr did not answer him and ignored him and this felt even worse and then to his surprise the prophet sallam proposed to her and of course this was a great honor and Umar immediately accepted and she was wedded to the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam only then Abu Bakr came Jamar his friend and companion and apologizing Umar I hope that he didn't find anything in your heart against me when I did not answer you he said yes I did he told him the truth was that I heard the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam mentioned hafsa's name so I knew that he was going to propose to her and that is why I didn't accept otherwise I would have definitely accepted her to be my wife and the prophet sallam married and she became the mother of the Believers I believe that this is all the time we have for today's program so inshallah until we meet next time mm-hmm foreign"
