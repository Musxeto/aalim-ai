  "title": "Cheating when collaborating with others to Publish Research? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "his second question is about publishing researches now there is a trend if I'm a university student and I have a thesis at the end of my university years to present and I don't have the knowledge or I don't want to or I don't feel like it and I give it to someone and I pay him for it and he writes the whole thesis for me scholar said that this is not permissible this is cheating but if you are an academic and you are joining forces with another academic so both of you are professors and you're writing a research and you put your names written by so-and-so and so-and-so but your only contribution would be in paying the other professor or maybe in publishing the research or the paper this is unethical though there is a collaboration and people see that you've worked together but they don't know the amount of research that you have invested actually in the work but you have participated then your partner is happy with that this is permissible but it is unethical and Allah knows best you"
