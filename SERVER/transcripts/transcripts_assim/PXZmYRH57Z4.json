  "transcript": "salhen from canada uh my question is when we do a worldly acts uh success for example going to work or eating or going playing a sport how do we uh link this for doing uh for the sake of allah so we can get reward for them in the hereafter the issue of intention is not something that you just simply click and move on or a pill that you swallow your intention is always devoted for the sake of allah in the sense that i'm going to work what's my intention number one to earn halal money number two to give a good presentation to the non-muslims seeing me as a muslim coming on time leaving on time doing my duty plus not only that a little bit extra so this intention by itself that makes you excel in whatever you do is transforming your worldly matters into ibadah and this is most of the times difficult to associate yeah and it was narrated by uh the salaf that two of them were walking together and then they saw a funeral passing by so one of them said let's go and follow it so that we earn the reward of a carrot of good deeds uh equivalent to the mount of ahad so the other one said hold on hold on a second and yet let's go so he said what did you do why did you stop and paused the man said because i wanted to rectify my intention when you said let's go i was just rolling on with you but i wanted my intention to be for the sake of allah so i anticipated the reward from allah and now it's for the sake of allah so this is not something that we always do for the sake of allah i get a long list of groceries from the misses and i go do my shopping in an hour i fill a cart or two i pay an arm and a leg and i come back home business as usual if i did not anticipate the reward i wouldn't be rewarded so i have to before doing this have the reward in my head that i'm going to be rewarded by allah for it so that it would be a form of worship which is a bit difficult but with training and with a lot of dua and sincerity allah would make that easy inshallah you"
