  "title": "Ruling on staying with a husband who does not pray or fast - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Ronna says my friend's husband is Muslim but does not pray he just praise Jumma Friday prayers sometimes he doesn't pay zakat he doesn't fast he drinks alcohol every now and then he doesn't allow her to wear the hijab he takes and deals with Reba but his manners are very good he doesn't lie does not cheat does not harm others he's a good father and a caring husband but she cannot leave him as there is no other choice is she sinful for staying with him now the problem lies in the following is a Muslim woman allowed to stay or to get married to a non-muslim man the answer by consensus of scholars is no it is totally prohibited for a Muslim woman to marry a nun Muslim man now this is one part the second part is pertaining to this sister's question is her husband classified and labeled now as a non-muslim or he is still a Muslim it's an issue of dispute among scholars and the cause of the dispute is whether a Muslim not praying is rendered as a kafir or he is still a believer in a Muslim the Prophet said alayhi salatu was-salam between a man and disbelief or shirk is abandoning the salat narrated by imam reported by the muslim in Asahi in the Sunan the Prophet said whoever leaves or abandon salat he has become McCafferty saccade Kivar and also the Prophet said alayhi salat wa sallam the pledge that separates us Muslims from them non-muslims is salat is prayer and whoever abandons it then he is a disbeliever and the number of verses of the Quran that states that if the idol worshipers were to repent to pray to give the cat then they are your Brethren's among other evidences from all of these scholars differed whether to apply the word the label the title of kafir upon a Muslim who abandoned salat or not so we have a theoretical part and we have a practical part the theoretical part is any person who does not pray is a kafir now when it comes to practice when we want to implement this upon individuals this is not easy because there are conditions to be fulfilled this individual assuming his name is Abdullah does not pray I don't jump the gun and say he's a kafir I'm the last kafir no because the conditions have to be fulfilled maybe he doesn't know the ruling so ignorant maybe there is misinterpretation he interprets it as it's not something that takes him out of the fold of Islam because there is a hadith whoever says la ilaha illallah sincerely from his heart will enter Jannah so why should I pray misinterpretation this is not the time to clarify this misinterpretation but you know where I'm coming from he might be forced he might have many many reasons so I cannot label Abdullah this particular individual as a kafir a non-muslim that must be separated from his wife until the conditions are fulfilled and the obstacles are removed there are obstacles that prevent me from giving him takfeer and at the end of the day tech field is for the Muslim ruler for the judge so in a nutshell the sisters question is not easy to answer by saying leave him especially when she says at the end of the question that she doesn't have anywhere to go therefore until she can plan for her life and move on without him until she can have a substitute or another valid alternative for her and for her children I advise her to stay with him try to advise him to remind him when he's in a good mood as long as he is caring and a loving husband and a father try to encourage him every now and then and say come on love I'd like you to lead me in prayer in Maghreb or in Asia every now and then every blue moon reminding him of Allah's favours and our obligations towards Allah because he created us he blessed us with so many things without count maybe sha Allah Allah would guide him through this loving and caring and compassionate way but meanwhile she should work on trying to leave him without telling him so that she would be in a Muslim environment in a Muslim house with a Muslim a proper Muslim spouse"
