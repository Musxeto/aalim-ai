  "transcript": "it seems that we have a problem with Houston and the launching of the Rockets is going to be a little bit delayed so let's see if I have any questions from the emails and I hope I do okay okay Ariba says do angels not enter a house in which a woman is not covering her head Ariba this is one of the misconceptions popularly widely spread in the subcontinent in India in Pakistan in Bangladesh where unfortunately the ignorant imbeciles there inforce upon women in their homes to cover their heads whenever they aan is called whenever they want to eat or when they enter the toilet and all of this is totally bogus baseless maybe it has to do with Hindu religion that these guys adhere to I don't know in Islam there is no such thing as that because that would cause a huge deal of hardship and why would a woman cover up her head when the aan is called or when uh um she's eating when there is no one except her father her brother or her husband that's ridiculous unfortunately the vast majority of Muslims nowadays do not adhere do not listen or follow Quran and Sunnah all the billions of Muslims you see they adhere to culture to what Moana says to the Customs to what the elders say and none of this is related to Islam as a Muslim you are obliged to follow Quran and Sunnah anyone comes up with a silly notion as such you tell them show me evidence that the prophet did thisam or ordered this the companions the the show it to me in the Quran and if they fail to do so then ignore them and pay no attention none whatsoever"
