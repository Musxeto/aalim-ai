  "transcript": "T from the ukam allum alhamdulillah nowadays I'm very careful about what I say when I speak um what it is I I spoke a lie about somebody and then I asked for their forgiveness alhamdulillah they forgave me uh but where but who I lied to the people I lied to I didn't go up to them and and say to them that I actually lied about that person um so I just wanted to ask you if you backbite or slander someone um and you don't go to people that you back bit or slander to and say look I was lying or I was wrong you should make to it is sufficient to for you to seek forgiveness from the person you've wronged it is not necessary to go and clear his reputation though it is recommended if you see them once again that to say good things about him to rectify it indirectly but if you don't then there is no problem the most important thing at the S of Allah is that he forgives you and that he uh um tells you that you you're fine"
