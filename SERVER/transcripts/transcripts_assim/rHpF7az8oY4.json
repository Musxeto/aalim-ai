  "transcript": "hater says what is the concept of temporary marriages in Islam muta marriage mota marriage is agreed upon a loose unnatural Gemara it was in the beginning permitted for a certain period of time when there was a great need among the Muslims to have it then on the seventh year of hijra the year of hiber the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam prohibited it and the ruling of it being permissible was abrogated and it became prohibited and haram and the essence for marriage is stability continuty to have tranquility compassion mercy between the spouses and also to have children and if there were a divorce or a fatality or death then they to have read the waiting period and to inherit one another all of this is not found in temporary marriage known as muta because it's an agreement it's a contract between a man and a woman to have sex for a specific period of time in exchange of a specific amount of money once the contract is over there's no need to divorce once the time lapses and ends there's no need for the divorce there's no need for anything they just split and they move on nowadays this is considered to be another form of fornication or adultery it's Xena the contract is invalid and the marriage is invalid and the children are most likely if there were children because usually the agreement is not to have children are born out of wedlock and a woman in such a marriage is like a prostitute she moves from one man to the other because it's a fixed contract a day - a week - and then it's ended unlike normal marriages where the couple enter in such an institution with the hope that this continues until one of them dies till death do them apart now one may argue then why was it permitted in the beginning this is a ruling from Allah so again we have no right to question why was it allowed and then why was it prohibited later on this is according to Allah's wisdom at the time there was a need for it Allah permitted it the Companions used it but after a while it became prohibited once again and since then till date the prohibition stands and this is the vast majority of the opinion of all companions of the prophet alayhi salatu salam and even those like even Abbas who in the beginning thought it was still valid was taught by I'll even a vitally been other great companions that this was abrogated and you did not know about that and he came back to the opinion of majority so that it was the consensus of all companions the particular time that this was abrogated and Haram now only the Rafaela practiced this and this is again against the belief of a hallucinogen are which is based on the Quran and on the prophetic Sunnah and if you go to their leaders and their Imams and asked them would they give their daughters to such marriages they would fight against that and they would seriously say no this is not permissible for our daughters for our sisters but it is permissible for all other types of women which shows you that this is not an Islamic concept"
