  "title": "Upholding ties of kinship with the opposite gender who are non mahrams - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "a Bella's question from the UK is crystal-clear and a lot of the Muslims have doubts in this he says we have to connect our kinship and to maintain them but what about the opposite gender so this means that we have an instruction to maintain our kinship and we have a prohibition and a restriction in free mixing and socializing with the opposite gender who are not our muharram so this always prevails the scholars say whenever we have something that gives the green light and something that gives the red light we always give preference to the red light which is Al hava a manner restriction and prohibition always comes first rather than the permission so in our case when I have my uncle's wife so my uncle is my relationship he's my blood he's my kinship his wife is not not only that she's not Muharram then I can have no contact with her okay what about my uncle's daughter he's the brother of my father he's my uncle my paternal uncle or my maternal uncle and their daughters are my cousins but they're none muharram so I must not have any communication socializing or mixing with them so how would i connect my kinship you do that remotely in the sense that if they're married if they have children and they are in need of money they're poor you give money to your wife to give it to her or you give money to your mom to give it to her or you give it to your father to give it to her but you don't have none muharram relationship this is not permissible but to go and check on them or to be on a whatsapp group and joke and socialize this is totally prohibited in Islam"
