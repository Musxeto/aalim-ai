  "transcript": "I'm from India this is from a sister and India there are differences in celle for men and women they pray differently I recently saw your video on YouTube and I'm starting to pray the right way as you teach as per the Sunnah my dilemma is that my father when he saw me he stopped me from that and he's saying I'm your father do not do it again so what should I do away my father or do it as you have shared with us in the video pray whenever your father does not see you see what I taught in the video and hey I'm famous Angela was the way that the Prophet prayed through the Quran in this room now there are different schools of thought that believe otherwise but they don't have the backing of the Sunnah and this is what gives what people teach according to the Sunnah credibility this is what gives them credibility that they have the evidence to prove it unlike those of other schools of thought that say well Simon Says yeah but why is it you have to obey so to have a win-win situation most those in India are hanafis there are strategies of course but they don't raise the hands when they give takbir for Recor and rising up from the record this is not mandatory this is not obligatory so if your father is annoyed by it don't do it just say Allah your prayer is valid so you have to be wise you have to be knowledgeable and you have to know what to do and what not to do the best when when situation is that you don't pray in front of your father or when he prays Gemara you pray in congregation you pray with him he's in front of you he doesn't see what you're doing so follow the Sunnah as long as he's not fine with it and he's not seeing you follow it but if he's watching you then try to be diplomatic and win his heart bit by bit don't be going into confrontation with him over things that are not mandatory take your time explained to him through knowledge showing him that you have and possess the knowledge from the Koran the sinner never ever say she has some sense or she has been bad says when you know that they won't accept it no say the Prophet said that is awesome and show them that even the books of hadith people would not argue because Oh sir prophet then I'll accept that but when you say that Tom Dick or Harry no I don't believe in these so-called Wahhabis and so on"
