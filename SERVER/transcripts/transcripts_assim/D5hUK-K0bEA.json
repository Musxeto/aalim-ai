  "transcript": "how to keep money in a bank which gives us interest on what do we do with interest and they're fine enough brother Herman said sadaqa is it allowed to be given us a look well brother harun I think you mixed my answer with another topic the sister was asking about her husband working or investing and this is completely unacceptable to work to aid to assist and to invest in institutions that deal with RIBA with usually this is unacceptable now your question is something completely different and that is what's the ruling on depositing my money in a bank that deals with RIBA now I'm not working with the bank I'm not investing I'm not working for the bank I'm just merely using the facility where I can keep my money safe in a deposit or in their safes in order to protect my money I cannot as you said cannot keep the money in my house now this is acceptable providing as you've stated that there are no Islamic banks in Nigeria and I have my doubts because Egeria is a very big country and I believe that they have lots and lots of good and strong Muslims that would not tolerate not having Islamic facilities in the country but hypothetically presuming that there aren't any such institutions or banks you are allowed to keep your money in such institutions without taking interest now there are two cases one case is that they would enforce you to take so if you deposit 100,000 whether you like it or not at the end of the year they're going to put 7 percent or 10 percent or whatever percentage in your bank account even if you reject that now this is a situation where it's permissible for you because you're forced to take this to take it and put it in Xalapa but not in order to get closer to Allah on the contrary this is to get rid of this forbidden money the second case of situation is that you ask for it you have the option so they tell you you want a current account or a saving account in current account we are not gonna give you any percentage but in saving account we're going to give you 5 or 10% in this case it's forbidden for you to ask for the savings account where interest would be deposited with your money why because in this case you would be agreeing to deal in RIBA and it's different than the first case the first case they enforced it on you the second case you are actually asking for it so you are doing a transaction that deals with River and this is a major sin that lehand just one clarification that's the the money that you'd give away this is so the car that you don't accept a reward for is this other car that you accept to root for no it's not you accept it or not Allah will not reward you for it because Allah Azza WA JAL as stated in the hadith is play hip and it does not accept anything that is not so clean and pure and Halong so you pay this money to the poor to the needy to orphans and so on not to get closer to Allah simply to cleanse your money from this filthy River and interests just"
