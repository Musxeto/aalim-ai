  "transcript": "foreign vikr we are taught to say when we are in distress is allah is my lord i do not associate anything with him this dua was taught by the prophet alaihis salaam to asma been to omas may allah be pleased with her and he told her whenever you are in distress you should say this again and again whenever you are in trouble you don't call a friend you don't seek the assistance of others you first seek allah's help and guidance allah allah rabbi he's my lord and i don't associate others with him this fills your heart with a lot of tranquility the following chapter upon encountering an enemy or those of authority and this is something that happens a lot sometimes we're faced with power authority that are not always truthful and just sometimes we encounter enemies who would want to harm us physically or mentally so what to do we have no other alternative but to turn to allah azzawajal and this is what the prophet assassin used to do invoking allah making dua to allah and among the duas as in hadith number 126 the prophet used to say alahillah we place you before them in arabic it says we throw you in their chests in their necks meaning that we are shielded by you so you protect us from them and we take refuge in you from their evil no one can give you refuge except him yes you have to take your armor you have to take your weapons and defend yourself but before all of that your heart has to be connected with allah azzawajal otherwise you will be defeated in no time whenever your heart is looking elsewhere or depending on your armor or your shields or your weapons and not on allah azza you are a loser this is why all the duas you hear is expressing our total dependence on allah azzawajal like the following dua hadith number 127 the prophet used to say allah is you are my supporter and you are my helper by you i move and by you i attack and by you i battle what is this this is my confession no one can help me no one can come to my aid except allah is sufficient for us and how fine a trustee is he subhanahu wa wha and how fine a trustee he is this exact phrase was said by prophet ibrahim peace be upon him when he destroyed their idols so they made this inferno made this huge fire and would throw him to fall into it just before they threw him he said has to be allah milwaukee my lord is sufficient for me and how fine is trustee he is and when they threw him in this fire allah said to it be peace and coolness upon ibrahim and nothing happened to him likewise on the third year of hijrah when the muslims were just about to be eradicated in that battle where they had the upper hand in the beginning but due to the disobedience of some of the muslims 70 were martyred of the companions among them is his uncle hamza the lion of allah and muslim and a number of companions seventy so as the army of the disbelievers retreated and went back home as the muslims were gathering up the things and trying to care for the wounded and buried the dead there comes a man warning the muslims that the the enemy of the the army of the enemy is coming back to finish the job because they thought to themselves we only killed 70. we did not eradicate and annihilated the muslims all together so let's go back and finish it up so this intimidated the muslims not the prophet allah 3 and allah said by saying these beautiful words allah the almighty threw tranquility in their heart and blessed them and nothing came up to them this is this all shows you the beauty and the power of dua and how it can make you stronger against all odds yet we have a powerful and profound deficiency when it comes to our belief in allah azzawajal when it comes to our connection with allah knowing that he is the cause of victory and the only one who could make us prevail yet we are distracted from invoking him from asking him into depending on materialistic things that would not make us prevail this is all the time we have until we meet next time i leave you for a minute [Music] foreign"
