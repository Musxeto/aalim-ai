  "transcript": "Abdul Qadir from Turkey Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh I love you for the sake of Allah. BarakAllahu Feekum Wa Feekum BarakAllahu Sheikh I've wronged someone so he doesn't know about it and I wanted to tell him in order to forgive me But I fear that if I tell him it might cause more evil than good. So what should I do? You have two courses of action. If you have wronged someone, if this sin was financial, meaning you stole money from him or you scammed him from money, you have to return the money back to him either directly or indirectly in a form of gift anonymously or what's similar to that. If the mistake or the error you did was not financial, rather you back bit him or you said something wrong about him, you slandered him, if you know that it would cause further damage and harm you have two courses of action. Either to go and while being friendly with him you say Wallahi ya Akhi, we make so many mistakes towards people and I took it a habit upon myself that I forgive anyone for whatever mistakes they had done towards me. So I'll let you be my witness. I forgive you in front of Allah for whatever sins you had done to me, that I have done to you, sorry. Would you want to do the same to me? Immediately he would reciprocate and say, yes may Allah forgive you. Khalas, this is one. The other way is to ask Allah for forgiveness, to repent, to show remorse and to make dua for him hoping that Allah would satisfy him on the day of judgement that he may forgive you."
