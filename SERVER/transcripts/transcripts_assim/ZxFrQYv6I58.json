  "transcript": "regarding something comes at the end of Ramadan is a cuttlefish she wants to know this is a cut of it the first we can explain to what it is but do they have to be paid by somebody who has that money or does they have to be paid by everybody even if they don't have work don't have the money and the hadith of about Sharia holiday even at best and even Omar may Allah be pleased with them the prophet alayhi salatu salam instructed his followers to give out on the night of 8 which is the last day of Ramadan you should give out one sar of food to the poor and this saw is an equivalent of 2.2 kilograms of dates so you can give the equivalent of this weight of dates of wheat of whatever rice food that people usually consume and the Prophet stated that this should be on every individual so if it's a male a female a slave a free person a grown-up a child we should give out a saw on each one of them and this is to be given to the poor so that they would not go and ask for food on that particular day which is Eid now having said that scholars did not say that if a person has no income or does not work he should not give out zakah on the contrary they said that any person who has what is enough to feed him on that day whatever surplus he has he has to give if he can find it so if for example if I have enough to point if I have 5 kilograms of rice in my house let's assume that 2.5 is enough for myself there the surplus which is 2.5 I should give it out and give it as a zakah some would say but your already poor yeah you have only this amount well the others will give me in exchange and I'll have much much more but this as a ritual I have to pay myself to the poor"
