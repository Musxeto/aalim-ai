  "transcript": "Oh [Music] [Music] valera hi neva he can build a rebel army sallallahu wasallam of our economy Anna Muhammadan Juana and you know sahbihi ajma'in assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh we often hear a common question why do we have calamities why does allah have people wealthy others healthy while we find nations in poverty nations in hunger famine striking vast areas of the land what do we have earthquakes floods and why do you have volcanoes erupting and destroying lands and people these are all common questions that we often hear but a believer usually does not ask such questions why because simple allah azzawajal holds us accountable for what we do because he is our Creator Allah Azza WA JAL holds us accountable for what we say because he owns the universe yet no one can hold Allah Azza WA JAL accountable for what he does and to look at it from a different angle Allah Azza WA JAL owns us a lot of almighty created us so logically whatever he does to us is his right no one can complain no one can object it's exactly if you do what pleases you with your house or with your car it's nobody's business what you're doing and to add more to this you have to understand that Allah the Almighty is fair and just he had made injustice and oppression he had made aggression forbidden on himself and he made it forbidden among us so if you put this in mind that he's fair and just if he put in mind that he owns everything and if you put in mind that the creator of this perfect universe is wise then you would identify and know that whatever our Maharaja does is justified and legitimate in the sense that a lot almighty is the creator of good and evil it is Allah Subhanahu WA Ta'ala that created everything we see and everything that we do not even see yet we do not attribute evil to allah azzawajal because a large creations Allah decrees are good but there might be some evil in them this this evil is not attributed to Allah yet they are attributed to his actions to his creations and I'll give you an example if someone walks up to me with a knife and he starts cutting my stomach or my chest to anyone looking at this without going deep into it would say that this is pure evil and it's not justifiable but if this man happens to be a doctor he's operating on me to save my life then this evil is justifiable and actually we were not even dared to call it evil we would call it something that is good for my health and for Humanity allah almighty tells us in the holy quran say muhammad sallallahoalyhiwasallam it is allah the creator of good and evil say muhammad o allah the owner of power and might and everything we see you give light and power to whom you wish and deprive it from whom you wish you honor and dignify whom you wish and you deprive that honor and dignity and you humilate whom you wish it is in Allah's hands all the good that we see if we believe in this if we understand this and if we act on such knowledge then our lives would be much much different because we would be satisfied with whatever calamities take place on us not that we would ask for such calamities but once we are in such a position we believe we surrender and we're satisfied that definitely Allah Azza WA JAL did this for our own good and benefit once there was a tyrant an evil man his name was a head judge of a news of photography and this man was politically motivated in the sense that he was serving his masters no matter what devious actions he did we're told once that he attacked mecca the holy shrine of Islam though he was a Muslim he had the Kaaba stoned and he had the companion of the prophet alayhi salatu salam and the son of the companion of the prophet alayhi salatu salam abdullah IBN az-zubair marijuana Allah be pleased with them he had him killed and he had him crucified for days and nights though his mother was a smelly Bakr though his aunt was aisha the wife of the prophet sallallaahu I heard you sellin this evil man sentenced one of the scholars of Islam Satan is obeyed to death and there was a man who cried because of this sentence so say a diminisher bear told him what or why are you crying for Salim I said because of this evil sentence sentencing you to death and you are a scholar of Islam so say it smiled and said don't cry and don't we you have to know that this was essentially decreed by Allah Azza WA JAL and Allah decreed that on us and if you know this then you have to believe that Allah said no calamities ever takes place on earth or on yourself except you will find it that it's in a book with Allah as illusion before it was created and this is something that we have to believe that whatever takes place is written long long time ago before it was created in an authentic hadith the prophets of Allah hiding or Selim tells us that when Allah Azza WA JAL created the pen he instructed the pen right so the pen said oh Allah what should I write a lot all the pen to write everything that is going to happen till the day of judgment and that was fifty thousand years before Allah created the heavens and the earth so whatever happens it has been preordained it was destined by allah azza wajal long time ago and as a believer we believed that would ever take place on us calamities or others all of these are for our own benefit this may sound a little bit strange but our prophet salah salem once wondered and he said strange the believer how allah azzawajal try him and test him no matter what happens to the believer it is to his own benefit so if Allah Azza WA JAL blesses a believer then the believer would be thankful would be grateful and this will be to his benefit and if a believer is been tested and tried by Allah with calamities he will be patient and accepting Allah's decree and that will also be to his benefit so in both cases he's benefiting and that is only to the believers now if you look at the calamities you find that Allah Azza WA JAL tries us with different calamities and in so many cases we are unaware of such calamities we don't pay any attention to them and usually a lot of the origin tries us with calamities and with good things we look at a loss testing only in the bad sense in the negative sense but we never pay attention to the good things that Allah is testing us with and that is why I'm a part of he used to say to be blessed by Allah and to be thankful is far better to me than to be tested and tried with calamities and be tolerant and patient towards them and also our prophet sallallahu alayhi assalam tells us that never hope and wish to meet your enemy on the battlefield but always ask allah azza wajal to bless you and to save you from calamities one would say I'm brave man I want to fight at the side of Allah o Allah let me fight let me kill in your sake or for your sake and let me be killed for your sake Allah the prophet saww son tells us no do not wish to meet the enemy and always ask allah azza wajal to have mercy on you and to bless you and unfortunately one never pays attention to this he doesn't know where goodness lies and that's why we sometimes ask for the wrong things now the Prophet also tells us Salim Behari send them always ask Allah for his forgiveness and always ask allah azzawajal to keep calamities away from you this is what a Muslim should always prepare himself to do and to pray to Allah Azza WA JAL but as in the previous hadith never wish to meet the enemy in another hadith the Prophet says but if you meet the enemy then you have to stay firm don't run away likewise don't ask Allah Azza WA JAL four calamities but once the calamities are there you have to be patient and tolerant we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we will be right back Salam alaikum wa rahamtullah and welcome back now it's not to us to decide whether to get the calamities or to get the blessings of allah azzawajal to be tried and tested by as you know and remember everyone praised Allah that he gets more and more money gets more blood gets more health it's more wives it's more children this is what we look for but no one asks for more calamities and crises and his life unfortunately it's not to us we are not to decide what to get it's not 7-eleven shop you go in and say well I'd like one calamities and six blessings of Allah so John this is something that Allah Azza WA JAL decrees on us without our permission and Allah does this for a reason for a wisdom and we believe in that and if you look at it deeply you'll find that the believers and the non-believers are alike in calamities they are all tested and tried by Allah Azza WA JAL but they are far apart and the result and what happens afterwards Abdullah the meanest owed me Allah be pleased with him he's the companion of the Prophet that I thought was Iran and he once said o people you usually look at a disbeliever and you find them among the most healthy and with dead hearts and you look at the believers and you'll find them sick and ill in their bodies what they have a living heart living with faith and Eman and belief living with the Quran living with the Sunnah it's fresh and bumping strong of the lovely message says by Allah if your bodies were to be healthy and strong and your hearts would be weak ill and dead by allah allah azza wajal would not even bother with you he would not care for you you would be like the insects of Earth in humility and neglect and also salman al-farsi may allah be pleased with him once visited a sick person and in islam it is highly regarded as a good gesture and one of the good deeds to visit sick people to comfort them not to give them the bad tidings of well but lucky gonna die in two days no in islam you're instructed to go and visit the ill and the sick and to give them patience to give them hope to tell them that allah awj L is giving them forgiveness for the sins with this illness so that they would feel satisfied and comfortable with that he visited this sick person and he told him have the glad tidings of Allah the Almighty because this illness you're in Allah will forgive your sins with it it's not your doing but because of your patience and acceptance Allah will forgive this sense for you but the disbeliever when he's tried and tested by Allah with such calamities he's like the camel whom his owners tied him and then they set him loose he doesn't know why he was tired and he doesn't know why he was set loose Allah the Almighty does not glorify for us the pains and calamities the illnesses and the problems what what is praised what is rewarded by Allah to be patient once a calamity strikes mama tells us in the Quran what will Allah do with punishing you with the calamities and torture to you if you're grateful and if you're believing in Allah the Almighty and that is why when a person is struck by a calamity he has to be patient and he has to praise Allah for what had happened to him this what among men does and the prophets of Allah who are hadoo Selim gave us the glad tiding by saying that the magnitude of reward is in accordance to the magnitude of the calamity that hits a person and Allah when he subhana WA Ta'ala loves a group of people he will try them so he who's ever satisfied with what Allah surgeon has tried him with then he will get all the satisfaction and whoever complains then he will get nothing but the displeasure of Allah the Almighty it always comforts us to compare apples to apples in the sense that whenever calamity strikes us we would make it much easier for us to look at other people's calamities and be grateful to Allah that what came up to me was not as big and huge - compared to what came to others or what is a bear he was one of the great scholars of Islam he is the brother of the companion of the Prophet s son of the Lannister baby and he was one of the seven scholars of Medina who came after the Companions of the Prophet so he's considered to be a tabby which means that he saw the companions of a prophet re salatu salam this man it was said that he was very handsome and he had seven of his offspring brave strong men and he was quite wealthy he was quite healthy he visited the Emir the ruler of the Islamic state at the time and it was said that in his court someone gave him an evil eye he looked at him and he did not say may Allah bless you in one night on that visit one of his sons fell from a building and died and other stories say that he went into the stables of the ruler and he was killed by one of the horses and in the same night doctors discovered that he had something wrong in his leg and they have to amputate it or it will kill him from the knee downwards so he said do what you must do so they told him you have to drink this so that it would make the pain easier on you it will make you in a sense out of conscience and he refused it I would never take with my own hands what takes my mind away from remembering Allah for making dhikr it's always very painful we're gonna saw your foot he said do whatever you wish but wait give me some time to engage myself in prayers and remembering Allah and once you see this do whatever you wish so they started doing that and they started sewing there his leg and he did not even utter one sound once it was over then they put his leg in this oil so that the bleeding would stop what do you think what do you expect he would say if any one of us had one calamity that is 10% of this we would start to shout and scream not all of miserable he said o Allah you gave me seven and you took one seven sons oh Allah you gave me four limbs two hands two arms and two legs and you took one and left three for me oh Allah if you have taken from me you have previously given me and if you have tested me and tried me you have made me live in comfort all of this life Allah praise is all due to you so brothers and sisters if you have a calamity be always grateful for Allah that is it not bigger than what it is actually is if you have a calamity in a trade thank Allah it's not in your all wealth and if you have it in your own wealth we lost all of that thank Allah that is not in your family and wives and kids and if you lost your wives and kids and family thank Allah that you did not lose your health and if you lost your health thank Allah that your problems were not in your belief and religion because the Prophet used to say re salat-u-salam do not have the calamities in our religion and belief so we pray to allah the almighty that we are free from calamities and crisis and we pray to allah that if allah decreed that we are to be tested and tried that we stand firm in patience and tolerance and Allah is the most merciful until we meet next time via Manila assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
