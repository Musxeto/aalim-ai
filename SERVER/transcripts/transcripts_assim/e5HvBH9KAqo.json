  "transcript": "Anna from Uganda When I started learning more about Islam, I got to learn that Allah tests you then He loves you So I invoked Allah and I was like, oh Allah test me with the most hardest test and let me pass all of them Did I do something wrong? Yes, indeed. You've done a very grave and serious wrong thing Instead of asking Allah to test you Ask him to grant you al-afiyah The Prophet alayhis salatu wassalam once visited one of his companions and he got so sick that he was like a He lost all of his weight he was like skin over bones So the Prophet said alayhis salatu wassalam Did you make any dua? This is strange what's happening to you, I don't see any symptoms of illness or sickness So why is this happening to you? Did you make any dua? So the man said yes, O Prophet of Allah I used to say O Allah whatever You were storing for me on the Day of Judgment as torment Make it happen now in this life. So I would not have any sins when I meet you And the Prophet was alayhis salatu wassalam Shocked he said subhanAllah Who can tolerate such a thing? Shouldn't you have asked Allah for al-afiyah? And this was a way of the Prophet alayhis salatu wassalam of telling us never ever make dua against yourself Or ask Allah to test you because you will not make it Or ask Allah to test you and make you make the test and pass it. No this is Illogical if you if you know that Allah answers dua and Allah accepts your dua might as well ask him to forgive your sins period. That's it Ask him to love you without testing Mutarraf ibn Abdillah, one of the great scholars used to say To be Given wealth and health and I Show my gratitude to Allah is better from me than to be tested with poverty and illness and Be patient These are two Tests from Allah you could be healthy and wealthy and you could be poor and sick Which one would you choose? It's illogical for people to choose no, no, no, I want Allah to love me more and to make me poor and sick no Because they've been given by Allah himself. So ask for health and wealth and Al-afiyah Which is all good things in life forgiveness health wealth Well-being all of this goes under under the umbrella of al-afiyah Ask Allah for al-afiyah. This is the best thing After certainty you may ask Allah Azza Jal for so do not ever Ask Allah to test you because you will fail Don't ever ask Allah for a test rather ask him for al-afiyah"
