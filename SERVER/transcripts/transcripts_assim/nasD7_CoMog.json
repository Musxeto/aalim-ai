  "title": "Religious with good character but she's not attracted to him, go ahead & marry him? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "the sister is asking a question about a brother who approached her for the purpose of marriage and she's convinced of his religious and good character so but she's not attracted to him and people are trying to convince her that these two qualities are good enough what's your advice as I said the demand is far less than the supply if a man proposes to a sister and the sister finds him checking all the boxes but unfortunately he does not have the physique of Arnold schweger or he doesn't come uh uh he's not the Knight on a shining armor or he doesn't have he's missing something well my sister or my daughter go to the nearest mirror and take a good look at yourself give me a break who do you think you are Miss Universe 2015 come on look at your teeth how many braces do you have you need look at your hair look at this look at that so each and every one of us has their flaws and shortcomings but what counts is the outcome the the the overall if the guy Mah is religious he's burning he is this he's that but you don't have any feeling of resentment you don't have any feeling of hatred meaning when he smiles I feel I'm going to get a heart attack no don't Mar him he comes for the first visit and the guy smiles holy this is not good no this is someone you can't marry but if he's adequate he's okay but yeah he's not Tom Cruz so what go for it because at night and in the dark they're all Alik you cannot tell as long as there is no resentment there is no ill feeling alhamdulillah you'll be good"
