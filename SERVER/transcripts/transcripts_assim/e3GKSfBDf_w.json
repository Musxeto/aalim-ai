  "title": "Is copying a logo that has a watermark (so that I don't have to pay for it), sinful? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I've got a question about graphic designing so there are some websites who sell logo ideas and there are lots of free logos on the internet from such websites they put those logo ideas in a small resolution or with the watermark over them so that way we cannot properly use them unless we buy them and once we buy them they will give us those logos in bigger resolutions and free from watermarks so my question is would it be considered stealing if we retrace these pictures in a graphics software and make them as our logos so that way we don't need to buy them if we are already capable of making them exactly the same by ourselves when someone displays a logo or a certain design and he puts a watermark and means to protect it it's like displaying something and putting a fence around it or a bulletproof glass Shield so that you can see it but not to take it out so as if you're telling me okay if I can crack the lock and open that frame or shield and take that item would that be stealing what do you think the answer is yes and likewise if you use a pirated software or you hack your way to remove the uh uh signature or whatever means they've taken to protect their product from being stolen from being copied definitely you would be stealing an uh trespassing on people's rights"
