  "transcript": "what's the ruling on speaking while performing wudu or russell does this invalidate it no no one has ever said that talking while performing russell or wudo hasn't any impact on them there's no evidence to support this at all so it is totally permissible to speak providing one is not answering the call of nature and providing one is not showering or making wudu at the toilet because this is not recommended due to the place not due to the action the action of performing wudu or performing russell has nothing to do with talking there's no problem in talking at all"
