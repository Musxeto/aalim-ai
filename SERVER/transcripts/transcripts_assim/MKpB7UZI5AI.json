  "transcript": "m alhamdulillah dear brothers and sisters in Islam and welcome to Mercy to Mankind sallallah alai wasam one of the great events that preceded the birth of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was the event of the elephant and this has nothing to do with uh the Chinese calendar where they have the year of the mouse the year of the monkey the year of the elephant though this was named after the event of the elephant and it's a well-known fact to Muslims that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was born in the year of the elephant and this has a story of its own you see people were going to Mecca in pilgrimage and a lot of the people outside Mecca were not happy with this the Christians the Jews uh even the Persians they were not happy of how sacred Mecca was and of the religious power that it had over different tribes scattered in Arabia actually they they were envious they were extremely envious but again they were not happy and it's the same thing nowadays now you have the superpowers not happy of the great and widespread of Islam they are Ina in fact they are worried of the widespread of Islam the minute they say that they see their citizens reverting to Islam being committed to a wearing the Islamic dress the women are covered men are not uh uh drinking in toxicant not fornicating not gambling they're serious they are effective they are uh doing their jobs uh to the uh uh uh to the optimum this we is people when you have serious people productive people people that are enjoying their lives within the limitation of Islam this wears people so it's the same thing happening on and on again and that is why abraa who was the governor of the Yemen region and Yemen region was controlled by so many people the Romans the Persians and at that time the abian uh uh uh Kingdom ruled it and abraha was made the governor of Yemen abraha who was filthy rich thought of doing something to distract people from going to Caba to mecca for pilgrimage so he thought that I'm going to build this huge church with beautiful buildings and ornaments and put lots of nice things to attract the poor peasants of Arabia those who did not see such such huge buildings before I'm going to make it a monument that everybody performs pilgrimage to and he spent so much in doing that he spent a a fortune and he dedicated his time and the time of his people to do this beautiful monument and he did so and he started calling people spreading the news that now you can perform pilgrimage to this beautiful building unfortunately one of the Arabs who did not like people that diverting Pilgrims from Kaaba from mecah to this newly built unknown yeah what is it now the Kaaba goes back to Abraham and you're talking about 2,000 3,000 Allah knows how long years because Abraham is the father of all Messengers and Prophets as we know Abraham had two sons he had Isaac and Isaac and Ishmael of course Ishmael is is the eldest and Isaac is the other uh son from Ishmael came all the prophets and messengers of the Jews the sons of Israel and by the way what do you know what Israel is Jacob it's the name of the messenger the prophet Jacob Jacob and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam our Prophet was asked once who is the most noblest of people so he said Joseph the son of Jacob Jacob the son of Isaac the son of Abraham so they're all four prophets you know one after the other so it's it's a noble Offspring now we had Abrahim as as mentioned earlier had two sons he had Ishmael and he had Isaac and all the Abraham was the father of all prophets so he came two 2,000 3,000 4,000 years ago and he built this house of Allah he built this Kaa that people performed pilgrimage to from all uh uh the other neighboring um places from Arabia this Arab did not like the story of a church coming in and taking the place of Kaa so he went in the middle of the night and he put filth all over the walls of it and he left so the following day once they saw this act abraha was Furious and he knew that an Arab did this so he decided to attack Mecca and Destroy demolish Kaa to the ground now just before we go on it is important important to say that what the Arab did was wrong two wrongs never make a right terrorist attacks harming people doing things without referring to the Quran and Sunnah cause more harm than good and that is why in the Holy Quran Allah tells us do not curse do not swear at the idols that the pagans worship why is that it's to us it sounds like a legitimate thing to do these Idols do not bring us any benefit and do not deter any harm from us so why do we worship them we can curse them we can slander them we can abuse them we can do whatever we want that in turn they may curse Allah yeah this is why that is the the the the the completion of the first Allah tells us do not curse or do not swear at the idols that are are being worshiped other than Allah so that the worshippers would not curse Allah our Lord would not do more harm than good and this is a very very very important uh rule in Islam Islam was made on and based on completing the advantages and gaining it and it was based also on preventing the harm and reducing it as much as possible so whatever before you do anything you have to weigh the pros and cons you have to weigh the advantages and disadvantages so that you know whether I should proceed or not so whatever that Arab did though his intention was pure his action was wrong and unacceptable of course he was a a pagans so this is beside the point he was not a Muslim to begin with but nowadays any Muslim before doing any similar thing you have to think not twice more than that this is unacceptable it is not acceptable for us as Muslims to go and put filth in the Vatican for example as we do not accept others to come into our mosques and put filth in it we do not abuse or insult their Bibles because we do not accept them insulting and abusing our Holy Quran and so on good good intentions are not enough or an excuse to do bad things at all in Islam you have to have two conditions for any action to be accepted by Allah uh the first is you have to be sincere meaning that this action you're doing it for the sake of Allah of so this is an intention the second condition that this action you're doing it has to be in line with the Quran and with the Sunnah but if it's an innovated one then this is unacceptable and I give a simple example for that a person who wants to pray but he's praying for his boss the action is okay it's not inovated but the intention is not accepted because it's not for Allah so the whole action is void a person who prays to the sake for the sake of Allah the intention is well but he is praying an innovated prayer comprised of uh uh 20 raas in in a row with one prostration instead of two in each raak then this is completely unacceptable in its void going back to the story of abaha ab ordered his men to formulate an army for him and they gathered 60,000 Warriors now the number is huge because the people of Mecca would not exceed uh 2 or 3,000 at most give or take couple of thousand give them 5,000 to come with 60,000 soldiers that was really huge 60,000 or 6 th000 uh some books say 60 some books say all of them on elephants no no no no no no no no they were not uh uh riding elephants they were 60,000 in number but they had 13 elephants with them so imagine the people of Arabia the largest animal they they they had encountered was a camel and now you bring them 13 elephants elephants with their armor and with their hu if you see an elephant this thing is Big you know it's huge and with the armor with the shields with everything uh uh uh equipped to kill and he marched to Mecca and whenever he passed a village he conquered it and either demolished it or took from them what he wanted and and looted it until he reached the outskirts of Mecca now through that event the people of Mecca heard about this and they didn't they could not do anything to resist they did not have an army they did not have anyone to defend and the people The Villages and the and the Arabs between Yemen and Mecca they were trying to defend the Kaa they were trying to to protect it by standing in the face of the army of abraha but he annihilated whoever in his way but she you said they are bra they were Brave courageous and and they died doing so because they did not have the power to uhh uh uh protect the Kaa I think that we have a a short break uh so be with us and inshallah we will be right back so we see there is no forcing or compulsion in any part of the de so if you say forc marriage in Islam it doesn't exist Islam is offering what's called Al Misan there's a balance there is a balance between punishment and reward now what's very interesting that the psychiatrist tell us that the human being's makeup in the brain works off of two stimuli there are only two reasons why a human being does anything that's either for a hope of a reward or the fear of a loss Salam alaykum and welcome back the army of abraha was marching and sweeping all that stood in front of him to defend the holy shrines to defend Kaaba and Mecca when abraa was just out the skirts of Mecca they found a heard of camel and they took it as they loot whatever they find so Abdul mutalib who was the owner of that herd went to meet abraha and he asked for permission to meet the king and he was admitted to the king ABA the moment he saw ABD mutb had this fear in him and respect because ABD mutalib was an honorable old man and he looked like a wise and a leader of his tribe so he respected him greatly ABD mutalib sought the permission to speak and he was given that permission so he said oh King I'd like to request from you to give me back what you have taken what your men have taken from me and there are a number so and so of camels that look in this uh fashion and they had uh these special things into them abaha looked down at AB said and told him that the minute you walked in I had great respect for you because I thought that you were a leader of your tribe I am coming to demolish the house of Allah that you've been worshiping or you facing in worship I'm coming to destroy this and all what you care about are a number of of camels of of your own what kind of man are you ABD mutb was clear and blunt he told him I am the owner of the camels and they are my possessions they are the things that I my property that the things that I own and I am in in charge of protecting it the house you're headed to has a a has a lord has an owner and he will protect it so abah did not pay any attention to what ABD mutalib said he ordered his men give him back his camels ABD mutalib and all the people of Mecca went to the top of the mountains surrounding Mecca because they they they abandoned uh uh uh uh Mecca and the Kaa and they started oh Allah oh Allah they started praying oh Allah protect your house protect your house and they left they've abandoned Mecca completely no one was left in Mecca abraha started to March towards Mecca to destroy and demolish this house that people go to perform Hajj too the minute they went to an area near meca which is about 5 or 10 kilomet away the camel sat down on its four feet and refused to move the ele the elephant excuse me uh the elephant that is well I I still think this small camel's too big the camel the again the elephant just sat down on its four legs it refused to move and all the Riders all the the soldiers tried to you know ask this elephant to stand up it would not they start stabbing him with their Spears so that it would feel the pain and stand up the elephant refused to move not even one inch so they redirected him away from Mecca left right and backwards and he went as quick as it can go and move and the minute they directed it to Mecca it just sat down so this by itself was an astonishment they tried and tried and it they could not fa they failed they could not do this and abraha was Furious yet he did not know that this was only the beginning to their surprise they saw the the skies filled with small birds that covered the sky and blocked the Sun the scene was nice but it was scary and to their surprise again they found that these birds had three stones made of clay one in their mouths and one at each claw yes and at each hand or leg or whatever and they flew over them throwing these bombs at ABA and the soldiers and what whomever it touched it ripped and cut a limb of those soldiers and in seconds it was a matter of seconds the whole Army Was Defeated and it was bodies all over the place immediately the remainings of of of the army fled the scene and went back to Yemen defeated the people of Mecca came down from the mountains went to the Kaa praised Allah the almighty and thanked him for what uh uh uh he did by protecting their sacred shrines by prot in these holy shrines of Kaa and the area of meca of course this event by itself boosted the reputation of Mecca and of of Al Haram Thea and and everyone heard about this knew that this was a sacred City that this was the Holy shrines that Allah himself has protected from being attacked this meant that the people knew that something's going to happen and this is inevitable and they knew that it was the time if Allah sent someone then it would be the appropriate time because Allah will not leave the people going astray and this again great event preceded the birth of the prophet Sall wasallam actually the prophet was born in the very year of this uh invasion of Kaaba or The Invasion to be we also have to uh uh bear in mind that the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam though he was born in this particular year people around mecah were eager for a savior for a light at the end of the tunnel people were not satisfied with the way they were living they knew that there was something wrong and this chaos this mayab they have been living in without any government without any leader that leads them without a a specific morals or ethics something to prevent these wars from taking place every now and then scattered everywhere struggling with each other and in indeed many bad habits it's not only bad habits it was Lethal people died because of this there was a lot of Injustice and in the Hadith of abar Abu used to tell us about himself may Allah be pleased with him that he used to do things in the daytime until he was dead time tired and then just sleep as a piece of cloth until the sun came back up again he had no reason to live and the people of the time did not have any reason to live either it was very easy for them to die they could indulge themselves in battle and some people would call this bravery and some people would call this carelessness they would indulge themselves in battle and feuds in a a a contests that they are sure one of them is going to die and they could care less they would call and consider this to be bravery and they're ready to do to do this on and on again without any fear of dying so the time was set for something of importance to happen this was the time when the prophet Sall wasallam was born now you remember that we said that the father of our prophet's name was Abdullah Abdullah Abdullah was one of the favorite sons of ABD mutalib and he chose a fine woman for him he chose am B to be his lawful wife and if you recall we said earlier that fornication was widely spread among the Arabs yet the prophet sallallahu alai wasallam is The Offspring of legitimate marriages no fornication in his ancestors at all he said may Allah uh uh exalt his mention that from the sons of Ishmael Allah has chosen kinana and from canana Allah has chosen qur and from from quray Allah has chosen the sons of Hashim and Allah Almighty has chosen me from all the sons of Hashim and he said sallallahu alhi wasallam also that all his ancestors were married and there is no adultery or fornication in all the way up to Abraham It's All Pure marriage legitimate no fornication and in one instance although uh uh uh fornication was widely spread among the Arabs before Islam hint who was one of the greatest enemies of Islam the wife of Abu sufyan Abu sufyan har she said when she went to uh uh uh make to the prophet Sall wasallam he told her that women must not fornicate and commit adultery so she immediately asked the prophet and does a free woman does an honorable free not slave free woman commit adultery which meant that those who were Noble those who had a noble descent and were were were free would not commit adultery but the others and who were to be the majority committed this without any uh uh restriction I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program so inall until we meet next time oh"
