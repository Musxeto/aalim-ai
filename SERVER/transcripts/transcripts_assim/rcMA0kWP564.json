  "title": "Did the Prophet ï·º Marry Maymunah During Ihram?",
  "transcript": "okay this hadith is an issue of dispute and the mistake is of the narrator first of all we know that one of the prohibitions of ichram is to get married or to propose for marriage while in the state of ahram and the hadith at hand is an issue of dispute between two narrators where one of them said i took the proposal while the prophet islam was in the state of halal and the other says that the prophet married maimuna in the state of maimuna herself cleared this dispute by telling us that the prophet married her when he was not in the state of iran so the confusion was either in the narrator's saying that he was in the state of haram meaning that he was on his umrah or in the process of hajj for example not that he was actually in the state of ahram the person involved maimuna herself clarified this and after her clarification all other disputes are overlooked and ignored because it is a clear mistake or a misunderstanding from the part of the one who narrated that hadith and allah knows best you"
