  "transcript": "how should we keep our hands while making dois should they be kept far apart or clenched together and where to look sometimes we come up with issues that are not of great importance in Islam so when I make du'a should I make dua like this or should I make dua like this should I raise it up like I have seen some people do or should I just keep it next to my belly and being careless the sky's the limit the most natural thing is just to do it like this you don't have to clench it you don't have to keep it apart you don't have to raise it above your head and you definitely don't have to put it next to your navel just keep it normal as you feel close to Allah audience someone wants to do it like this here Allah that's up to you someone feels okay doing it like this it's up to you there's nothing specific no you have to have one hand span between it or whatever one foot half a foot there's nothing like this in the Sunnah do it in a natural way so that it becomes natural where to look now if you start looking at your hand your own hands then this is problematic because you will see that there is some dirt here or maybe I have to cut my nails and wow I'm getting old look at this skin and you will lose everything you want it to make draw for and if you keep out roaming and looking round and round and round you will not have concentration so the essence is not where to look the essence is where your heart is looking so whether you look in between or you look at your own hands or you look at the place of prostration this is all fine insha allah azza wajal"
