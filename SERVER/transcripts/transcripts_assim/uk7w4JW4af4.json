  "title": "Found Residue on hand after Wudu, is this negligible? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Salma from the UK If you had some dew on your hand and you washed it off with dew, but after you found out when you prayed on, there's still some residue, do you have to pray again? Because is it negligible? I don't know. How much is it? It's kind of, I'm not sure. If you're not sure, how can I answer you? What is negligible? Something that is like a dot of a pen is negligible. Oh, okay. So I don't know. And what kind of residue? Is it a barrier that prevents water from reaching the skin? I'm not pretty sure. Okay, once you are sure, give us a call. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
