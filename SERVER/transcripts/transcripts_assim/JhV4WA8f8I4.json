  "transcript": "first of all when you say please help me in getting a divorce I just know I know I'm not asking you again people ask me questions and when I ask a rhetorical question they think that I did not understand I'm old visually I understand but I ask this question to open your eyes sometimes so what he says is Right technically a man is not obliged to give his wife money to go with him for om or Hajj but she is also not obliged to do so many things in the house to take care of you to ask you if you're sick if you she just can throw the food in front of you and iron your THS and your clothes and clean the house and doesn't talk to you doesn't comfort you doesn't show you enough doesn't reciprocate you when you want your rights and intimacy you he can do that would you like that I'd like my rights and she has her rights as well the best of you are the best to their women and I the prophet says about himself as I'm I'm the best to my wives how dare you having the financial means and not take your wife for om and ha very right I don't understand the mechanism that some people work if you say that I do only my obligations it's a two highway it's yeah it takes two to tango she could do the same to you she can make your life miserable and she says I asked he said you have to do this you don't have to do that and I'm doing it by the book but this is not a marriage Allah says in the Quran he made between you and your spouse compassion Mercy love where is this yes I understand you take her once a year because you have the means and you go to or three times alone you want to go with the boys you want to go to the m with the Masjid but you take her at least once or twice a year but not to take her at all and say unless you have money she would do maybe some body and some uh vegetables and she I I I prepared food for you I said no I want Biryani I want this I want that no no no I'm cooking food only this is some bread some cheese Y come on we have to be realistic and when you have a daughter how would you like her husband to treat her in the same fashion no my daughter is different why like father like son this is what you will get yet in the future so I hope those who think they are quote unquote men would change the way they with their wives and treat them as Queens their father-in-law your father-in-law gave you the most precious thing he has in his life his daughter so honor him and honor her if you want J and Allah knows rest"
