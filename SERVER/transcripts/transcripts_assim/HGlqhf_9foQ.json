  "title": "Dealing with friends & people who ask me 2 stop when giving dawah They say they know assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign I had a question regarding again I had a question about anything similar to Darwa I felt like sometimes in Ramadan or when I'm talking to friends I try to give them though and they respond with oh I don't I don't so I feel like I know enough so I don't want you to tell me this should I try to persist and giving them or try to just leave them alone after I tell them once Ahmed when people are accepting what you're giving them this is when you continue to give When someone tells you to please stop and refrain you should not pressure them or shove it down their throats rather move on and look for someone else who would take your dawah and accept your call it is not wise to force people to listen when they don't want to listen you don't have authority over them and usually this would backfire so instead of them getting closer to Allah starting to practice they hate what you're preaching them and they hate the people that look like you thinking that everyone who looks like you would be like you trying to shove it down their throat so no you have to be wise in giving them or uh spoon feeding them according to their acceptance if they are reciprocating and listening give them a bit more the moment you feel that they had enough or they're saturated stop and give it some times and then a little bit give them some small dosages until it pays off insha Allah"
