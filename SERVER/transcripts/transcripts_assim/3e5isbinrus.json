  "transcript": "Ahmed says will we be punished if we did if we died without paying off our debts I have no money or assets the prophet said that each individual is hanged meaning he's responsible for whatever debts he has so he is considered to be accountable for whatever debt he has until it's cleared and this is why whenever a deceased was put forward to the prophet Allah to pray janaza or funeral prayer upon him the first question the prophet would ask would be did he have any debts did he die leaving debts on him if they said yes the prophet says you pray upon your brother I won't and this is to reprimand people from doing this that is taking people's debts and not paying them off and the prophet said the Martyr his sins are all forgiven except that that's which shows you that major and minor sins are all forgiven by Allah for a martyr with the exception of debts however if a person borrowed money with the intention to pay it off but he did not have the means to do so or he was unable to do so and he died we pray to Allah azzawajal that he will not be included in the previously mentioned Hadith and that Allah the almighty would pay off his debts with his grace and mercy the threat is to those or for those who are capable of paying off and don't or for those who intend not to pay off they willingly take people's wealth and money intending not to pay them off these are those who will be punished on the day of judgment"
