  "transcript": "says can a husband or a muslim ruler force women to wear hijab or burko or nikab isn't this shirk if she wears it for them and not for allah azzawajal this question often arises because of the whispers of shaytan whenever there's something good shaytaan tries to block it in our minds in our communities now the things that a husband who is a person of authority over his wife and children whether they like it or not this is islam this is sharia law you cannot fight this you cannot simply say oh we will not implement this anymore this is religion this is part of our conviction and belief you cannot just with a pen scratch it off and say no more this is mentioned in the quran men are guardian and responsible and have authority over women and the muslim ruler has authority over his subjects and allah ordered us to obey allah and to obey the prophet and those of authority among us so now when we come to a man and his husband and a man and his wife if the wife is ordered by her husband to change things that her conviction is mandatory to do or prohibited to do in her conviction she must not obey her husband so it's an issue of dispute if the woman says i believe that it is mandatory upon me to give zakat on my gold and silver jewelries and the husband's conviction is that no as long as you wear it it's not mandatory as a lot of the schools of thought say so he prohibits his wife from giving zakat on her own jewelry in this case we say you must not obey him you must disobey him because you're obeying allah azzawajal and this is none of his rights to intervene in this is your wealth this is your money if you want to invest it he has no right to stop you because it's your wealth so in such cases for example if you believe that you have to put the right over the left on your chest and he says no you have to put them on your side or below your belly button below your navel you are not obliged to obey him because this is not related to his rights so whatever is related to his rights you have to obey him such as he orders you not to go and visit your sick mother it is his god-given right not to leave the house without his permission he's sinful he's wrong allah will punish him but obeying him is mandatory visiting your sick mother is not so try to be kind and nice to him and try to be diplomatic and get him to approve otherwise you must not go likewise if he prohibits you from fasting voluntary mondays and thursdays the prophet told us that this is his right it is related to his rights so you have to obey him and not fast voluntary fasting without his permission likewise if a woman wants to go to make umrah which is voluntary or perform hajj which is voluntary it is prohibited for her to do so without his permission this is related to his rights now when we come to niqab or hijab or it's the same thing even if she doesn't believe that covering the face is mandatory no scholar on earth says that covering it is prohibited they all say it's recommended or permissible the least but no one says it's prohibited so because it is not a prohibited thing or he's not ordering you to do an innovation rather it saves his own honor and reputation because without any doubt when a man's wife goes uncovered he is ashamed of that so it is a must upon a woman to obey her husband if he tells her to cover her face even if she does not believe it's mandatory yet it is obligatory for upon her to to obey him and likewise it's the duty of the muslim ruler to enforce sharia to implement sharia because allah azza will put him in that position to do so to rule with what allah has revealed in the quran and and the prophet taught us to refrain from doing this and allow people to do whatever they want and allow sins to be widely spread he is accountable and sinful for that"
