  "title": "Can we pray any sunnah prayers before Eid Salah? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Ramon says while waiting for Eid Salah to begin can we pray 2 rakaats una salah first of all the timing of eight salah is just after the Sun has risen which means praying anything before it would become under the category of prohibited times of salah secondly the Companions said may Allah be pleased with them that the Prophet or someone he came out to offer their eat prayer he did not pray anything before it nor anything after it which means that there is no sooner before Eid or after it and the Sunnah is to pray they read in an open Plaza in a masala in an open area with no roof on it so it's not a building it's just an open piece of land therefore there is no the hey it will message it you don't pray 2 rakaats to sit down and hence to answer your question Imran there is nothing to be prayed before or after the salat of Eid and it's prohibited to offer voluntary prayers"
