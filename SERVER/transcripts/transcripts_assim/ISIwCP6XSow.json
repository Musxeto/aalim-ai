  "transcript": "Yes, then this is the grace of Allah Azza Wa Jal. The Prophet ﷺ grieved over the betrayals of the disbelievers, the idol worshippers. Anas Ibn Malik says that the tribes of R'il, Dhakwan, and Usayya, they're all from Bani Hudhayl. They asked the Prophet ﷺ to send a convoy with them to teach them about Islam. So the Prophet ﷺ sent 70 of the Ansar, and they were known to be the Qurra, the reciters of the Qur'an. And they used to recite the Qur'an, and at night they used to study it and pray night prayer and learn. And daytime they used to bring water and put it in the masjid and chop for firewood and sell it and buy food and give it to the poor. So they were active in their community. So the Prophet ﷺ sent them to these people in the middle of Arabia. Haram Ibn Malhan, may Allah be pleased with him, was the maternal uncle of Anas Ibn Malik. And they were all killed and assassinated in an act of betrayal. And the Prophet ﷺ was not seen grieving in sorrow over an expedition more than he grieved for them, to the extent that he kept making dua in Qunoot, in the five daily prayers for a whole month, against these tribes. But after one month, the command came from Allah to refrain. This is not to you, leave it as it is."
