  "transcript": "uh she have from bangladesh check if there is a ceremony and there will be a free mixing uh i mean haram gatherings but if i only stay with the boys can i attend this how how do you stay with the boys and you don't see women they don't come in front of you i mean just in a group of boys in a corner okay i will answer inshallah she have from bangladesh he says there is a ceremony and in this ceremony it's mixed so there's free mixing boys and girls women and men so is it permissible for me to take a corner and sit with the boys there's no when you take a corner and sit with the boys you see all the women wearing their beautiful clothes with no hijab going and coming and mixing with other men most likely there are music most likely there are comments from the guys you're sitting with oh look at this ooh and you're sitting there this is a place of sin a true muslim does not participate in such places sure what's the difference between this and sitting in a restaurant you're sitting in a restaurant to eat and you don't know the gatherings and you are lowering your gaze but here you're going with your own feet to a ceremony that you know is filled with sins so you should not attend such a gathering allah knows best"
