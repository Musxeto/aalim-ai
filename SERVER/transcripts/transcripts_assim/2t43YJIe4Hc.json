  "title": "Is it permissible to apply for spouse visa to move to the West (from muslim country) assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "okay so I grew up in the states and I found a good Prospect but he lives back home which is a Muslim country and usually if someone applies from the West sorry if someone marries from the West someone back home they apply for their SP Visa so they can also move to the West so would it be permissible for a woman in the west to marry someone back home and apply for them to come because my family finds it illogical if I were to move back home first of all this ISS is definitely inshallah permissible there's no problem in that your intention is to marry and his intention is to marry and both of your intentions is to get together and you have to apply for a spouse visa and he has to come to live in the states with you for some time the issue is can we live and continue to live in a cafer country for the rest of our lives this is a debatable issue you guys know what I say and think that generally speaking ideally speaking a Muslim must not live in a cafir country there's no dignity or honor in living among the disbelievers who look down upon you and your religion and the prophet encouraged all Muslims to migrate and live among the Muslims so if his intention is to do this and your intent as well maybe in the span of 5 10 15 years depending on how long it would take him to uh gain some wealth in order to go back to a Muslim country and live an honorable life there's no problem in that inshallah"
