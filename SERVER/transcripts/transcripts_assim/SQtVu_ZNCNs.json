  "transcript": "Sumea from France. I just want to share issue with you. U my friend my father passed away a few months ago and she really cannot over the the loss of his father uh her father. So I repeatedly told her like you should doar and make dua for him like um you can pay sodak on his behalf so his soul will benefit from it. But still she cannot overcome this pain. So could you please suggest me something so I could sh I can can share with her and she will be normal in a few days or sooner maybe no one on earth is going to live beyond his time. Our prophetat wasam who's the best man who would ever walked the earth died and he told us whoever is struck by a calamity such as your friend he should remember his calamity in losing me and that would ease his calamity. When I remember that my father died, I feel sad. But when I remember that the prophet is deadam and I did not get the chance to see him or to shake his hand or to embrace him, I'm even more sad. So my father's loss is a little bit less. Secondly, whether you are sad or not, this has nothing to do with the fact that your father is gone. So if you keep on depressing yourself and behaving in such a fashion, you will lose the reward from Allah and nothing is going to change. Your father is not going to come back to life. While if you're content with what Allah has decreed and say, We all belong to Allah and to him we shall return and you are content with Allah's decree and patient then you are highly rewarded and still your father is not going to come back to life. So you have to give her some time because subhan Allah those who cannot get over a calamity and they are depressed and they bang their heads on the wall and they tear their clothes, nothing's going to change. They're just sinful and couple of months down the line everything is going to be forgotten and they're going to go back to their own life and routine."
