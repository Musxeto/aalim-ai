  "transcript": "that I want to introduce he is a national from he he obtained his VA in linguistics from King ABD aiz University in jeda and later graduated with a high diploma in Islamic Studies from University in me the also had close personal contact for several years with the great scholar he is active in delivering Islamic programs for the media in both Arabic and English by participating regularly on both Islamic radio and television programs to spread the authentic teachings of the Quran andah this includes the popular weekly Q&A session that he holds on H TV as well as appearing on peace TV the IM of a in jeda a role which he has held for the past 20 years he delivers the weekly Friday sermons and lectures on various Islamic Sciences please yes and welcome to this warm evening to me it's warm masallah with the heers and and the haters and and and all the likes uh I did not have close private relationship with yes I used to contact him every single day over the period of four to 5 years but and uh now I don't have any affiliation with Huda TV this information was about 20 years ago and as a role as an Imam it's not for the past 20 years it's for the past 37 years which alhamdulillah I retired last year or was forced to retire depending on how you look at it but now I'm Free as a bird with the grace of Allah and this is what enabled me to come and speak to you and join youhd so I was told to speak for 10 to 15 minutes and then we open the floor for uh what the people usually would benefit more from which is Q&A um I selected a Hadith which all of you know inshallah the Hadith was reported in IM Ahmed Abu da mu jabal may Allah be pleased with him one of the great Companions of the Prophet Alam says the prophet once took my hand and said [Music] by Allah I Love You by Allah I love you the prophet swears twice over such an issue it has huge significance then he says I said to The Prophet inating by Allah I love you as well oh prophet of allaham then the prophet said to me oh do not forget at the end of every prayer to say Allah all you all memorize this you all say it at the end of your Salat whether before tah or after tah and we will come to address this if there is time insh so this is what the the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam advised his companions saying oh mu do not forget to say at the end of every prayer oh Allah help me to remember you give thanks to you and worship you in the best way this is a Hadith we all know however by gathering here and discussing this Hadith we know for certain that the angels has this ascended and the mercy we're being surrounded by and Allah and the S the tranquility and Allah mentions us in a congregation better than ours so definitely it's a win-win for us nevertheless we would like to contemplate upon one single Hadith so that we would get closer to Allah increase our knowledge and at the same time understand how ignorant we are because this is is one single Hadith and how many thousands and thousands of hadiths we don't pay attention to that we could benefit hugely from first of all who is this man that the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam took his hand swore twice that he loves him this man is Mu ja he is from the ansar from the Medina and we know that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam used to sell himself every season in Hajj to all the people that come to Mecca so that they would take him in and give him shelter and support him he goes to all the tribes listen I have this message I have I have Quran listen to me and they all like what they hear and see but none of them had the coitos to go ahead for it and they nope I'd rather be safe rather than sorry so the people of Medina in they heard and they liked what they heard so they went to their people they told them that listen we've heard this from this man and W man he has something next season they came with more men among them was mu Jab at the time was how old 16 years of age some say 18 years of age to us in our standards he was a kid in these days or in those days they did not have this description that we tend to have noway we say that oh he's a teenager he'll grow up it's okay yeah he is fornicating he's doing pot he's uh uh watching porn he's skipping Salah it's just okay he's he's a teenage he's 40 years of age it's okay he'll grow up they didn't have this categorization the moment you hit puberty whether it's 15 or 14 years of age or 16 you're a man and you act like a man and you behave like a man so mu at that time was 16 years of age he was described to be tall handsome intellectual a very very smart man to the extent that he was among the handful who used to give fatwa at the time of the Prophet wasam now if you have the prophet and you had a an inquiry you wouldn't go to someone else you would go to the prophet there were a handful of Scholars among the companions that were authorized by the prophet to go and ask and take fatwa what an honor come on give me a break the prophet is there and you coming to me and the prophet approves of that what an honor not only that mu did not miss a single battle with the prophet wasam you're all here how did you come SMS Flyers emails at the time of the Prophet they did not have this Al whenever the call for Jihad was there they immediately went with the prophet some of them could have been in his farm some of them could have been away which tells you that mu was always around the prophet he never missed a single battle not only that look at this highest Purple Heart Medal what is the highest in medals I don't know look at this medal that he received the prophet saidat to the companions take the Quran from four of my companions learn the Quran straight from the mouth of four that's it yes these are the most knowledgeable among the companions of the Quran who are they ABD and Ma may Allah be pleased with him and the prophet acknowledged him to be among the scholars how he said mu jabal will come on the day of judgment way ahead of the scholars which means that this is a endorsement of the Prophet to his knowledge and this is why he also said in an authentic Hadith the most knowledgeable of my companions about Halal andam Is mu and we haven't mentioned Abu Bakr Omar Ali the prophet did not which means that he has something they may have some of but not all so mad was a specimen of his own and he is unfortunately unknown to the most of us you say m nice to know you who's he and this is a problem when it comes to our history to our heritage we have no knowledge of it and I always make this joke may Allah forgive me if if we were to enter Jenna and then they'll introduce us this is Sal who Sal one of the greatest warriors at the time of the prophet and the best Sportsman ever with stamina much bigger and and stronger than marathon runners mashallah don't know him never heard of him this is Abu Talha and this is uh so and so and this is I said guys I don't know any of those I can't recognize those in Jenna can we take a tour to Hell the moment you go to hell I know everybody here homies what's happening I I feel yeah related I know everyone here so this is a problem if you're going to go to Jenna you need to know who your neighbors are so we have to go back to our history books we have to study the S we have to study the companions of the Prophet Those whom he loved so that we would have the honor to accompany them inall on the day of judgment the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam sent mu to Yemen as a judge ruler teacher and a Muti he sent this young boy he he was almost in his mid 20s or less early 20s yet he sent him in this level to a whole country and he was recognized by the great companions Omar may Allah be pleased with him and you know Omar he said whoever wants to learn must come to Mu go to Mu he doesn't say come to me come to Ali come to abdah go to Mu he's got the yes it was trial and error he made mistakes and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam corrected him scorned him and was hard on him you remember when he once LED Isa with his tribe he used to pray Isa with the prophet Alam and then he goes to his tribe and leads them in is again as a Sunnah for him voluntary prayer but fought for them and he used to recite with Al bak and the people they used to work from Before Dawn till sunset they wanted to go get some sleep one of the companions just said this is too much excuse me and he continued his is for himself and left so after half an hour when the prayer was over the Good Samaritans went to M and said this man left you and prayed on his own and and departed the congregation He's a hypocrite the same Good Samaritans went to him said didn't you hear what mu said about you you're a hypocrite so he went to the prophet and complained the prophet was [Music] outraged are you causing people to have F and you are give them trials in their Religion Don't prolong the prayer when you lead when you lead behind you there are those who are old those who have have erand to attain those who um are incapable of standing for a long for a long time so the prophet corrected himat and this is how he learned when he came back from Yemen he was sent by the prophet he came back from the from Yemen what did he do anyone no one okay he prostrated to the Prophet The Prophet said whoa what are you doing stand up stand up what are you doing he said oh prophet of Allah I went to Yemen and I saw them greet their dignitaries and their rulers like this and you're the most worthy of such greetings he said if I were to order someone to prostrate to someone else I would have ordered a wife to prostrate to her husband so again trial and error all of this is adding to his knowledge he's compiling this and this is why he's among the greatest of the companions when it comes to knowledge and F so what do we learn from this uh I think my time is up but any y who cares tomorrow is Saturday instead of going to a night club and and having a good time and partying and getting wasted alhamdulillah we're getting wasted in a Halal way alhamdulillah so the first thing we learn that it is permissible to swear because Allah says in the Quran and protect your Oaths that is do not swear much but if there is a need some of us swear on everything she how is the cof W is good I believe you don't don't swear some of us just use Wah in everything this is not permissible Allah says protect your Oaths because you're using Allah's name in vain yes when someone says you didn't come yesterday I I did said no you didn't now I have to prove this and emphasize it by saying wall I did come yesterday I believe you so in this Hadith we learned that it is permissible to swear to emphasize something that is true by Allah I love you he said it twice not once secondly if you love someone that is from the same gender of course huh and all the brothers are taking their cell phones okay it's Valentine Day you know I'm late but we still we can't catch up no if you love someone of the same gender a brother loves a brother a sister loves a sister in the Islamic sense not in the lgbtq iix YZ sense all the alphabets no I'm talking about pure love Brotherly Love uh uh platonic love I don't know what you call it but I love the brother for the sake of Allah this love is not uh uh something that is weird When We Were Young we you you don't say I love the brother you say I like the brother why so no no no love is a taboo if you say I love the brother then there's this was like 40 years ago 50 years ago they used to teach this this when we used to speak in English nowadays we all got out out of the closet alhamdulillah now we have wardrobes we have cupboards with no closets it's all banned in our Muslim homes so it is part of the Sunnah to express your love to your brother the prophet says in an authentic Hadith when you love someone if you love your brother you must notify him and I make Allah my witness I love you all for the sake of Allah I don't know you and this is a general testimony but I love you because you're Muslims and you are struggling in a cafir country and you striving to observe your Islam cement your Iman and come to have this bond with your brothers why wouldn't I love you I love you for the sake of Allah and I know you love me back and if you don't who cares I don't care so if you love someone reach out this is not AT&T if you love someone reach out and tell them that you love them because this is an Islamic ETI the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam was with his companion and he said oh prophet of Allah you see that man walking by Allah I love him for the sake of Allah so the prophet said to him did you notify him the said no said go ahead and do it so the man went to him and said to him I love you for the sake of Allah and the man said may Allah Loves You For Whom his uh uh you loved me for his sake and this is the Islamic way of sharing your emotions it's sad when we know one another for 10 20 years hi what's happening what's doing how you doing that's that's it and we have this love towards one another show it express it it it's even sadder when you're married for 30 years to your wife and you fail to say this miserably oh Allah help me to remember you number one without Allah helping you it's out of the question you're lost you're a loser you cannot even take a breath you cannot inhale without Allah allowing you to do it this is something who's playing with the volume okay thank you so now I have to speak softly okay so you have to always remember that without Allah's help you cannot do anything this is why what is one of the treasures of Jen there is no power no strength except with Allah it's one of the treasures of Jenna if you say it there's a palm tree that will be planted for you every time you do this you're queuing you're in a traffic jam you're in a problem always say and things would inshallah be facilitated for you and that is what the prophet used to teach his companions when you ask ask Allah and when you seek help seek it from Allah this is what we say oh you alone we worship and you alone we ask for help and this is what the prophet used to begin his speeches [Applause] by H we praise him and we seek his help but we don't contemplate on these words we just say them and most of us they rely and depend on the size of their biceps not on their Allah's helping when you want to carry something heavy deadly what do you say bah come on you can do it I can do it without Allah's help I Didn't Do It attribute everything you do and every success you go through to Allah declaring that I have no power no might no strength without Allah and this is when Allah supports you beyond your imagination if Allah helps you you will always be among those who remember Allah subhah wa ta'ala in the morning and in the evening who Among Us observes thear in the morning and the evening they usually take between 15 to 30 minutes to accomplish who sits in the congregation saying Subhan alhamdulillah a number of times 100 times who says who says who says a long list of if Allah helps you you can do that you can remember him and when you remember him you can do that before you go to bed everyone goes to bed switch off then switch on 9 to5 and in this Vicious Circle they go to bed they forget to say thear at night I know people that would never ever skip thear of night and they would recite Surah mul 30 verses they would recite the whole things they have to say because this is your antivirus everyone has on his computer antivirus or in his mobile but you need antivirus so you'll be protected from evil eye from Envy from black magic and from gin possession I could care less if a sorcerer come now and he says listen I have like 20 gin under my control my on Shante in French I know you guys speak French so who cares aren't you afraid no I'm not afraid I have Allah with me I do myar in the morning the evening before I go to bed after F Salah before I leave my home I could care less do this everybody comes say what's your Dal and I say okay do you know Arabic I said no do you know the Quran said no why you asking me for Del you don't even know the difference between aith and an Ayah this is shocking so Allah says in the Quran inah and if they had and Allah is talking about the Hypocrites listen they did not come and participated in the Expedition with the prophet inab for example why they lag behind so Allah is saying and if they had intended to March out certainly they would have made some preparation for it but Allah was averse to their being sent forth so he made them lag behind and it was said to them sit you among those who sit at home so it was Allah that made them lag behind because they did not have the intention you have the intention to remember Allah Allah will help you if you fail then acknowledge that it was Allah who did not want you to remember him because he does not love you and this is a scary statement so we try our level best and Allah nagging and bickering all the time my daughter is dating a UNM Muslim and my son is selling uh uh cannabis uh uh on the streets I have debts mortgage riba my boss hates my guts he doesn't give me increment he doesn't give me a raise my neighbor always parks in my door uh what do you call it this you know and alhamdulillah everything is fine alhamdulillah what kind of gratitude is this you didn't leave a thing you put everything that Allah is testing you with and complained about and they say but alham no no this is not the way be grateful to what Allah has given you the cup is half empty and some would say it as half full it's the same cup those who are grateful would say it's half full alhamdulillah Allah gave me half full glass I can drink it there are so many people who don't the poor sheh doesn't have a mug he doesn't have a thing Allah gave me half full mug how much blessing would Allah give me those who are ungrateful pessimistic would say why half empty so many people have Starbucks in their homes not coffee mugs they have so much coffee they have six or seven mugs Allah has given them everything Allah gave me only half empty ah this is how you look at things and this is what defines you when you're always content grateful thankful to whatever happens when someone bangs your car what do you do road rage you crazy you come out shouting you want to fight you get your baseball bat oh what is this okay I'm getting my hockey what do you call this hockey stick I don't know anyhow running behind this small thing buy each one of them one andas stop fighting hockey poot you so why are you doing this yeah he banged my car he did this is insured alhamdulillah nobody died alhamdulillah you did not get any injury your children did not go through with a windshield be grateful alhamdulillah so the Believers come out of the car with a smile on their face content and saying alhamdulillah it could have been worse those who are not grateful they would do a lot of bad things and whine and and complain so be grateful to Allah and finally means and worship you in the best way he could have said and to worship you help me to thank to to worship to remember you to thank you and to worship you no doar that was not reported they celebrate events the shabat the 27th of rajab the 15th of Shan we coming they celebrated okay that's good I like your enthusiasm but before you do it did the prophet ever had done such a thing did he ever do such a thing yes or no if yes I would humbly request an authentic Hadith B musl anything give me AI if you fail to do this then this is a what an innovation stay away from it so this is why the prophet saidat and worship you in the best of way now I think we've spent so much time there is there are so many things in this particular Hadith that we could benefit from but the time is not going to help us I conclude when to say this Dua the scholars differed some say before Salam after you do the then the salutation or the as in in U then you say in conclusion before you offer Salam you say and you offer Sal and this is the most authentic opinion according tol and the likes why because they say in Salat before Salam it's the time for Dua after Salam it's the time for unfortunately the vast majority of Muslims after Salam they raise their hands du then they wipe themselves and shower themselves and and do the whole nine yards what are you guys doing said bar Bara blessing okay again let's go back 5 minutes do you have evidence from the prophet he used to do this if yes I'm going to share it with you I'm going to do it from today if not you're innovating so they come to you and say yes we have evidence okay M come please share it with me he said the prophet Sall wasallam before going to bed he used to cup his hands and recite the last three and wipe over his body okay so this is your evidence the this is before going to bed you're in you're in you're in where is this said yeah but he used to wipe himself before going to bed before going to bed he didn't do this during the five daily prayers never ever once it was reported he could it be he lived in Medina for how many years 13 20 10 where is Ronaldo what's his name Cristiano I think where does he play n mallah Saudi Arabia come on guys this is your prophet and you don't know how many years he lived in Mecca and how many years he lived in Medina which year did he die in long time ago right mashallah you know your history give me a year huh 10 close but no cigars H 11 11 on the 11th year the prophet lived 13 years in Mecca 10 years in Medina and he died in r on the 12th of RAB which people now celebrate that's mindblowing all Scholars agree that he died on the 12th of they differed if he was born on the 9th or on the 12th so those who celebrate the mid they're actually celebrating his death isn't this mindblowing and it's an innovation but this is not our topic come on she you've stretched it too much another words we're going to beat the heck out of you okay I respect myself so it's best to give the Dua before the Salam because the prophet told us thisam after you conclude the salutation ask whatever you want then conclude your prayer but he never said to do the same after the Salam you have Dua why do you raise your hands after Salat and make Dua uh because I want Allah to answer me okay the prophet told you you want Allah to answer you make Dua in the closest you are to Allah when you in sujud this is the prophet's Hadith the closest one of you is to Allah when he's in suud so choose whatever Dua you like this is what the prophet said this is what he's recommending you to do said no no no I'm not going to do it in I'm not going to do it before Salam as he requested I'm going to do it after Salam suit yourself that's your problem not mine therefore I conclude with this is one single that we all know of and I myself have benefited a lot from this discussion with you and I hope that you've also benefited from the points that we've mentioned and studied together imagine how many things we don't know about the tens of thousands of other hadiths that we know but we've never comp contemplated upon nor studied m"
