  "transcript": "from Bangladesh there is a Hadith where a sahabi he taught someone a Quran and and that guy gave him a bow if I'm not mistaken and the prophetam prohibit him from taking that now the question is Sheikh um I have seen in one of your videos you said they're taking uh teaching Quran and taking money is permissible and there is a Hadith in bukhari outside thing and he read the opening of the Surah yes saying that this Hadith this Hadith this can be the the contract can be done with the Quran if it is necessary Sabi did that necessary and they are saying the basic thing is they're taking money for reading the teaching the Quran is not permissible and they also say uh it's not permissible even for a diary or a lecturer to contact if he has been invited to give a lecture he cannot give he can contact like how much money he should get or not oh can you please clarify about this there is a Hadith and the Hadith is authentic where the Prophet Allah was approached by a man of the Companions and he said that I used to teach someone from asuffa and a sofa is the poor uh migrants from the companions who has who have zero they're the migrants who live in the Masjid they don't have cupboards they don't have wardrobes they don't have except the set of clothes they're wearing and nothing so they are the poorest of the poor so he said that I used to teach him the Quran and then he gave me a bow as a present the prophet told him not to take that bow so the scholar said that this is an indication that it is totally prohibited to accept anything from the Quran uh for teaching the Quran and this is not true the Hadith in has a number of interpretations go to Islam q a and visit it and you will see these interpretations one of them that this was an agreement between both of them the man doesn't need the money and the the one learning did not give any commitment so it should be for the sake of Allah the prophet is telling him what is best and no one disputes that it is best for you not to charge but at the same time the ample evidences from the Quran and the Sunnah indicate that it is permissible for a person to charge for whatever lecture he is giving whatever Quran verses he's teaching otherwise people would not spread the word of Allah in the sense no imams would lead the prayer then would be giving his full time for Adan no teachers would be teaching in schools and universities this is not a charity when I teach the Quran or I teach Islam and I don't have any other source of income what am I supposed to do beg people no I'm charging not to teach the Quran rather to I'm charging money for my time for my effort in order to devote myself for this I can't go to a brain surgeon and say you should not take money for what you do he said no this is not Islam anything goes Islam no no this is not true the Hadith you've mentioned the prophet approved it and said give me a portion of it the prophet wasn't in need of a portion of it of the 30 heads of of sheep yet he approved that reciting the Quran as form of healing and charging 30 heads of sheep is totally legit and the best thing to charge money for is teaching the Quran as the prophet said in this Hadith"
