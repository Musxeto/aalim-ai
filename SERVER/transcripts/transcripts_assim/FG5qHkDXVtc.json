  "transcript": "um there are a couple that are very similar in theme so I'll just ask the one of them if the parents are against two individuals to get married can they have a secret n no a woman cannot be married without the consent and approval of her father a woman's marriage is dependent on her father if her father gives her the green KN even if her mother fights tooth and nail against it it has no value because the mother's opinion in her daughter's marriage is not of essence she's emotionally motivated and many reasons drive her what counts in Islam is the opinion and the consent of the father if the father agrees let's go to the groom's side the man the man does not need anyone's approval nor neither his father nor his mother nor anyone else so if he's financially dependent he's a real man and the girl checks all the boxes but his parents don't want her because she's not fair she's not white she's dark she's fat she's this she's that her parents are not from the same level as we are we went to their home they don't have security with AK-47 people come to me like this in Pakistan I went to some of the people's houses they have like 10 guards with AK-47 I was scared what is this no no she this is a everyday they come with me in the car scary business so some people say no if they're not from the same level then no you cannot marry her she doesn't have a job she doesn't earn why am I looking for a sugar mummy I don't want her to earn I want her to sit home and and to cook and to take care of my children I'm the man who's supposed to give every single dime needed in the house not her so if you're a financial independent and she checks all the boxes go ahead and don't look behind so sh just to add to that you were um also sharing that one story where um the father kept on denying his daughters were 4 years old to get married what happens in that situation I told them I told them dit your father and go to the uh Islamic court and get married such a father from day one see now I make a long short story long lots of the girls come to me she says she I met this boy in uni and I want to marry him he's religious he's he's got a big beard and mashallah he's practicing and we love one another first of all he's not practicing you can't fall in love and have relationship and being a and long beard come on who you fooling said sh no no this is the norm in here in Canada in America and Europe so I don't know their level of practicing How could a person be practicing when he has elicit Haram relationship with a woman on the phone or in texting and he says I'm a hijab she's a hijabi and I'm a beardy what what is this this is Dr Jackal Mr Hyde but none of my business so she my father rejected him so can we go to the Muslim judge to get married the answer is no she he's rejecting a good man even though it's his rights to reject but if he rejected four or five good suitors without any legitimate reason now you can override and go to the Muslim judge not from the first instance or the second instance because I'm a father I gave birth to this to this girl and I've taken care of her for all of my life now it's a mutual decision I cannot marry her off to someone she doesn't like no you have to marry your cousin dad I don't want like my cousin said no you have to no this marriage is invalid forc marriage is invalid and she cannot marry without my approval as they say it takes two to tangle Hal nid she's your spouse nothing Haram so I hope this answers no"
