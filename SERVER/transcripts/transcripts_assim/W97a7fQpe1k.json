  "transcript": "second question that there is a scholar in america and he says that the vast majority of scholars did not understand the hadiths of riba masha'allah and this einstein did in america i hope he's not from a german descent like einstein what is this nonsense someone random who comes and has social media to spread his views that are corrupt that are pathetic i don't know i don't know the person i swear by allah and i don't know what he said but if her fanbai is saying the truth and he's saying that he claims that only the middleman is the one sinful but if i take the riba or the bank if i'm the bank taking riba or the customer giving the riba they're not sinful wallahi this is the most with all due respect stupid thing i've ever heard in my life the hadith is crystal clear in the sahih allah has cursed the one who consumes riba the bank or financial institution and the one who gives it and feeds it the customer and the two witnesses and the accountant who registers it they are all in the same amount of curse exactly the same no one is more than the other even the witnesses who are not charging anything they're cursed like the one who's giving and taking this isn't the sahih and this imbecile if er fan is quoting him correctly says that no one is sinful except the middle man this is total rubbish as they say in the uk"
