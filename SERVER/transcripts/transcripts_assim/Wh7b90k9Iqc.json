  "title": "How to refuse Friends Family money if I know they won't return #Assim #assimalhakeem assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "sh there are a people around us maybe our close relatives friends or colleagues who have the bad habit of not paying the debt but when they need to borrow money they always promise that they will return it on time even though we know that chances are pretty low since we are not permitted to lie like by saying sorry I don't have money and sometimes it's also not possible to directly refuse them because they are our close ones so still how can we indirectly refuse them well the best way of replying to such people who are blatant liars and deceivers is to use what is known as to come a flage and disguise your answer so it wouldn't be a blatant lie so for example if I have two bank accounts one of them has $50 and the other one has all my wealth so when someone comes and asks money from me I said wall I don't have except $50 in my bank account and I'm not lying or I say w I don't have any money and I mean on me at this moment I have only5 or $10 on me but the rest of the money is in my safe or in my bank account this is not lying and by doing so you judge you dodge lying you do not lie and you dodge it by giving them an ambiguous answer and Allah Knows Best"
