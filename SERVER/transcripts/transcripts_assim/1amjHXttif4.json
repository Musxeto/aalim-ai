  "transcript": "I am aware that it's not recommended to raise one one's hand and make du after obligatory prayer however is it okay to raise hands and make du dur during sunna prayer like the 12 y do you mean that while I am praying uh um DHA prayer if I raise my head from the first suud and I'm sitting between the two sujud and I say do you mean this no I mean after the after the Salam after the after after listen to me making it a habit to raise your hands after F Salah or voluntary Salah is an innovation making it every time is an innovation is a now let me ask you a question um why do you raise your hands and make Dua what do you want I pray for my family or myself I pray for my health want to make Dua for my parents and myself you want Allah to answer you right yes Che okay if you know that Allah pledged upon himself to answer answer you if you're doing your Dua in would you still do it after Salah yes or no yes no she see this is the problem the imbecile brother who said yes it shows that he's not even understanding what I'm saying Allah the almighty told us and the prophet told us in an authentic Hadith the closest you are to Allah is when you are in sujud the prophet goes on to say so make and choose whatever Dua you want in sujud so who in his right head and mind would neglect making Dua and sujud as the prophet directed us and ordered us and says no I want to make Dua after F prayer and wipe his body and washes it and showers it and puts some conditioning on his hair after every single Salah this is pathetic the prophet is telling you make Dua and Allah will answer you and he said no thanks not interested so you want Allah to protect your family to increase your health to do this and that do it in your sujud and stop everything else now shouldn't we raise our hands and make Dua I didn't say that what I said was do not make it a habit that after every F Salah or after every voluntary Salah you raise your hand and make Dua because the prophet never did this however between andan is cold I said myar I did my repetition or I repeated after the MU and I said thear and then between and I can raise my hands and make Dua in the middle of the night I wake up I pray tud and I want to take a break of 10 minutes I raise my hands and make Dua it's raining not men and I make raise my hands and make Dua it is the rooster sound before fer 1 hour and I hear the rooster's voice I make Dua because it saw an angel the prophet said ask Allah from his grace when you whenever you hear a rooster these are the times where I raise my hand and make Dua no problem but not after every F prayer not after every voluntary prayer I hope this answers your question"
