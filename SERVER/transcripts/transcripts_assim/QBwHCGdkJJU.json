  "transcript": "Hamza from Sweden So I was praying behind the Imam in the Zuhr prayer and because for some reason he does a Qunoot and Nazil on every Salah So what happened during the Qunoot? I was doubting whether or not my like my aura was uncovered at the back because my shorts are kind of long But then they're kind of loose so that like maybe the aura been shown so I bent slightly just looking at the behind To see if my aura was uncovered. I'm wondering If that invalidates prayer whether like if you bend a little bit just to like this was in Ruku or in what? in While the Imam was making Qunoot. So while you're in a standing position Yeah, how did you look at your back end are you a giraffe I I Just like kind of like look just behind with me I can't even imagine a key you need to be like Rubber man or something. How is it possible to be able to see your back? I can't even imagine that but if you turned your head 180 degrees and and you looked backwards your prayer is invalid and Allah Azawajal knows best You"
