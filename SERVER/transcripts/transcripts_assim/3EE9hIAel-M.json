  "transcript": "Ibrahim from Guinea Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh May Allah bless you and your team and your family Sheikh And you as well Barakallahu Fik My question today Sheikh is concerning a friend of mine who comes here to take his sahur Basically he's sleeping here since the Ramadan almost started He sleeps here, he eats here, his sahur and everything I wanted to ask, I live with my big brother, it's a two room apartment, my friend is in the living room, no problem I'm just asking if he does things, for example, let's say he's using his phone and he talks to non-Muslim women Or he watches some movies on his phone or stuff like that What is my responsibility based on that? It might seem foolish if he does these things because he's in my house What's the responsibility there Sheikh? These things Akhi Al-Kareem are done privately So this is between him and Allah Azza wa Jal However if you're sitting with him in the living room and he's chit-chatting with an Al-Mahram Or he's watching a movie and you're listening to what he's watching which is Haram This is where you have to step in and say Akhi, don't do this please because this is Haram And I cannot assist you on Haram Whether it's in your home or wherever you are, this is forbidding evil and vice But if he's putting his earphones and watching a movie on his own This is between him and Allah Azza wa Jal It's not my own problem And also if he's chit-chatting with an Al-Mahram without me listening or being aware of it This is between him and Allah and Allah knows best"
