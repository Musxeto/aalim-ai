  "title": "If I do good deeds without intention 4 sake of Allah (due to nature Will I be rewarded Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "actually i am from pakistan i have heard a lecture or a talk on dawa which you have given some time ago now you said there are small things small matters which even if you apply those you are is it like you're giving dawah like you said if you talk in a good manner to somebody and if you can be good in manners so my question is each and every matter depends upon intention even if you are doing such x small x and the intention is not of java so still it would count as java or not thank you can you give example uh farooq yeah qasim can you give me an example because your question is very generic yes sir actually i mean uh i mean talking to somebody it can be because of my uh my grooming which i might have got for my parents or for my society now if i talk to somebody in a good way and the intention is not of broward so will it count as java or not okay now this is an issue of dispute doing good deeds without the intention of pleasing allah azzawajal is it a form of worship or not so by nature i am kind and when people come to my house i give them hospitality i welcome them i feed them i try to be the best host possible am i doing it for the sake of allah or not if i am if i'm anticipating that this represents islam that the prophet said whoever believes in allah on the day of judgment must honor his guest and i'm doing it for this purpose definitely i'm rewarded but if i'm not i'm just doing it because i want people to say good things about me this is my nature i'm definitely not considering it as a good deed or thinking that allah would reward me for that i will not be rewarded likewise dawa now if i am kind to people and i'm kind against my nature usually i'm aggressive i want to win an argument i'd like to impose my opinion upon people but because i know this repels people away from islam so i take a softer approach and i try my level best to be kind and to be courteous and whenever they say something i disagree with i say i see your point and yeah but i think so this gets them closer to islam if i'm doing it for the sake of allah this is dawa but if i'm doing it because this is my nature this is giving dawa indirectly will i be rewarded for that or not this is the issue of dispute and if you're not intending to please allah azzawajal or at least to call people to be impressed and like islam and the character of muslims i believe that this is not something to be rewarded for and it's a permissible thing people do and allah knows best"
