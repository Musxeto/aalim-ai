  "transcript": "uh I am 25 years old and I'm nearing the age of marriage and I would very much like to fulfill that part of my theme however I do struggle with my mental health and mood instabilities and various other uh other challenges I have been uh into therapy for the past two years and I have a bit few diagnosis however it's not to say that I can't get married I can but yet I am worried that how it will affect my married life or my partner on the larger scale so I don't don't really know how to approach this and I would really appreciate your input Ahmed have you had your therapy with a Muslim therapist who's practicing Islam or with a normal therapist or a psychiatrist who just listens to you and takes notes and said M yes okay tell me about your childhood M our time is up then second SE session uh tell me about uh your abuse at school is this the type of when I when I was looking for my therapist I made it a point that it should be a Muslim one because the spiritual aspect is very important to me so it was indeed a Muslim therapist from the UK and uh they really did emphasize on uh working on my religion and practicing spirituality and uh bring staying close to my religion as in Islam which would have an direct impact on my mental health as well then what regardless it has helped me to a certain extent yet I'm still not confident in uh how it would affect my life after marriage I I would highly advise you to get one session only with me if you can afford it and inshallah I'll do do my level best to eradicate any doubts that you have with the grace of Allah subhana wa taala because this is what we do we talk to people we see their weak points we give them positivity with the grace of Allah Asel and teach them and show them how to hold and abide by positivity and trusting Allah and everything goes well inshallah"
