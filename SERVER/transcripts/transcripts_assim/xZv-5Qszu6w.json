  "transcript": "okay i've got a question from a sister here sister mary she says i'm a single mother before i embraced islam i had a child this child of course i became muslim automatically this child becomes muslim but when she reached his a certain age for example the age of uh when she goes to puberty does she have to retake a shahada or anything like this or does she automatically become a muslim nothing to say nothing to do in islam a child follows the most honorable religion of the parents for example if we have a jew father and a christian mother the child would be christian and if we have a muslim father and a christian mother the child by default is a muslim in the sisters case because this child was born before she reverted to islam and the child grew up as a muslim and in the custody of a muslim mother then the child is a muslim by default and she does not have to take shahada or to embrace your islam because she is a born muslim"
