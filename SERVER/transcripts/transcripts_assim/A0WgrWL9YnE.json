  "title": "Made wudu 5 hours ago, forgot if I still have wudu, can I make Tayammum instead",
  "transcript": "Akbar from india he says i made wudu four or \nfive hours ago and now it's time to pray and i   totally forgot and i can't recall whether i passed \nwind or i went to the toilet or i broke my wudu   so is it possible just for \nthe benefit of the doubt   to perform Tayammum and wipe my face and hands? \nThe answer is no this is totally prohibited   and it's sinful. For the following reasons: \nreason number 1. if you've definitely   broke your Wudu you cannot perform \nTayammum, you have to go and perform wudu   2. because there is water in number two if \nyou're doubtful then the Certainity which was,   I performed Wudu five hours ago \nthat's for sure that's certain   cannot be affected by a doubt \nthat came four or five hours later   because the doubt has no impact on certainty, so \nin order for me to make wudu, i have to remember   100% without any shred of doubt that i broke \nmy wudu in this case i must perform Wudu.   Number three: what if shaykh i \ncan't remember breaking my wudu   but just to be safe i want to perform \nanother wudo this is okay no problem in that.   What? if you are certain that you have \nwudu, why make another wudu? why not?   you just said that certainty is not affected \nby doubt so why are you making another Wudu?   wouldn't that be wasting water and walking in \nthe playground of shaytan into his trap? Um   no. why? well simply because in the authentic \nhadith in sahi imam muslim the prophet ﷺ was asked   if we eat mutton meat, if we eat the meat of \nsheep, do we have to, uh shall we perform wudu   meaning that we are in the state of wudhu and we \nconsume mutton's meat the prophet said if you wish   though they are in the state of wudu renewing your \nwudu again without breaking it is permissible and   recommended because it's a sunnah when he was \nasked about renewing wudu after eating camel's   meat, he said yes you must, which means that \neating camel's meat or liver of a camel would   uh invalidate your would you break it and \nyou have to perform it and Allah knows best."
