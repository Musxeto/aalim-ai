  "title": "Is worshipping Allah ONLY because He Deserves to be Worshipped correct fear, love, hope",
  "transcript": "Munib from the US. A person with the attitude like thinking that he is worshipping Allah because he deserves to be worshipped and he doesn't fear Him and he doesn't anticipate reward from Him. Is this kind of approach correct? Okay. So, Brother Munib is talking about a probably some Sufi mystic beliefs where they think that they worship Allah out of sheer love. Not that they are afraid of His wrath and hellfire. Not that they are looking to be admitted to paradise and gain Allah's mercy. No, they think that this is not pure worship of Allah Azza Wa Jal. And the scholars of the Salaf used to say, whoever worships Allah Azza Wa Jal out of fear alone, he is a Haruri, he is Khawarij. And whoever worships Allah out of hope alone, he is a Murji. And whoever worships Allah Azza Wa Jal out of love alone, he is a Zindiq, he is a Heretic. And those who worship Allah out of fear, hope and love are true believers. Allah Azza Wa Jal described His own messengers, peace be upon him, them all, and the righteous worshippers to call upon Allah Azza Wa Jal in hope and out of fear. So who you are to come and say and claim that I don't fear Allah, I don't hope what Allah has, I just love Allah and this is why I worship Him. This is not the way of the Prophet Alayhi Salatu Wa Salaam, who used to say I am most knowledgeable among you of Allah and the most fearful of Him. So you tend to tell me that you are better than the Prophet Alayhi Salatu Wa Salaam? That you don't fear Allah like the Prophet used to fear Allah Azza Wa Jal? This means that you are a Heretic, you are not a real Muslim. So be careful of what you say and what you believe because the only path to survive and for your salvation is the path of the Prophet Alayhi Salatu Wa Salaam. And"
