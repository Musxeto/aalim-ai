  "transcript": "hamdan says what to do if you pass wind or uh if you answer the call of nature while doing rusul does this require someone to redo the wudu after finishing the hustle the russell is either to uplift an a a major impurity or it's just to clean if it is to uplift a ritual major impurity by default your wudu is included by default your water is included even if you did not intend it however if you happen to answer the call of nature or you pass wind in this case your wudu is invalid your hustle is totally legit keep on doing it but in order for you to pray you need to uh make a new wudu whether during russell or afterwards so that it would uplift the minor impurity which was caused by what had happened during rasulallah knows best so"
