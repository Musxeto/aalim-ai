  "transcript": "uh flat from bangladesh  my question is can we use the money donated by non-muslims to build masjids barakallahu haiyatik hayatikum yes it is permissible to accept donations from non-muslims and use these donations to build a masjid because this money regardless of its source once handed to a muslim as a gift it can be used and that non-muslim will not be rewarded for it but as muslims we can utilize it without any problem inshaallah you"
