  "transcript": "in the u.s a mom who's not practicing who's not abiding by the hijab has a daughter that is very asking a lot about islam interested in hijab wanting to become a better person the mom is stuck between a rock and a hard place what should i do if i encourage her to do hijab she's going to backfire on me and say why don't you wear the hijab why aren't you practicing so the mom is confused well mom don't be confused one of the greatest blessings of allah is when allah grants you someone of your offspring to guide you to jannah when you die don't you wish that your daughter supplicates day and night that allah expands your grave fills it with light opens a window from paradise to it of course yes you want your daughter you want your son to be always supplicating for you making umrah for you giving charity on your behalf which benefits you while you're in your grave so if you don't prepare them from now they won't do anything for you after your death you have to start from today and by the way each one of us is ordered to do four things we are ordered to enjoy virtue and righteousness and we're ordered to do it so i'll tell people guys you have to pray it's time for maghrib that's good number one but i also have to do it and i have to forbid evil and vice guys don't smoke number four i myself must not smoke now if i am weak and i smoke so this is one down three to go does it exempt me from forbidden others from smoking so because i smoke i see my son my daughter my friends smoking i do not advise them i say i can't advise him i smoke myself no then i would have committed two sins rather i continue to smoke which is a sin by its own but i have to advise them and tell them this is haram what you're doing is sinful so that i would not compile two sins all together so now you should try your level best to advise your daughter to abide by the hijab to practice deen to inquire about islam while confessing to her that i'm a bad person i'm a bad muslim what you're doing is the right thing what i'm doing is totally wrong but pray for me and inshaallah you will be doing well you"
