  "transcript": "question this is an issue of dispute whether the excuse of ignorance can include issues of or not some Scholars say that if a person commits koforoshirk out of ignorance this is not justifiable and they will be thrown in hell for eternity Scholars like I mean say that no this is not true otherwise what was the reason for sending the Messengers so that they would uplift this ignorance and put the proof against the people because if they could not receive the proper knowledge they can't be held accountable elsewhere the famous Hadith where a person on his dying bed called his wives and children and said what kind of a man was I and they said you were the best of husbands and the best of fathers and he said that that was a bad person so if I were to die cremate me and spread my ashes on the top of mountains and the bottom of valleys and over the oceans scattered me all over the place for if Allah was able to gather me back he would torment me severely after they did what he had asked them to do Allah ordered the top of the mountains and the bottom of the valleys and the oceans to gather his remains and he was standing in front of Allah and Allah asked him my servant why did you do what you had done and the man says because I was afraid of you o Allah now the concept and the doubt that this man had that if Allah were to gather me he would have tormented me severely this notion this idea by itself is yet due to his ignorance due to his extreme fear that made him do such a thing Allah forgave his sins and admitted him to Jannah therefore whether it's a major sin or a minor Center if a person does it out of ignorance and Allah Only Knows whether he's ignorant or not then he's not accountable and Allah Knows Best"
