  "transcript": "Rehan from the Emirates. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. Sheikh I get thoughts saying that if I move and looking at a person that I might be worshipping them of course I think that's not the case like how do we differentiate between what is Shirk and what is Tawheed in this? Ya Rehan, Ya Rehan, when you look at me and you get these thoughts that you're worshipping Sheikh Asim, are you worshipping me yes or no? Rehan, why is the control room disconnecting the calls? Rehan, are you with us? So the most likely not. Please do not disconnect the call until I'm yani answering the full question That's why you're getting these thoughts of worshipping these images. He's your enemy. What do you mean if it's halal I'm going to drink it? He's your enemy. So let me ask you again, will you drink it? No Sheikh. Then this is what you should do with these images."
