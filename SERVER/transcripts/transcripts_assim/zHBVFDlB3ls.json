  "title": "Mercy Killing or Euthanasia - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "ameesha says my question is if a human is unable to bear the pain and suffering and if he asks for mercy killing is it allowed should we accept it same is for animals if it is suffering so much can we put it to rest first of all I beg to differ because humans are unlike animals a human soul has great weight at the sight of allah azzawajal unlike animals so we cannot compare both to each or to one another now mercy killing or known as euthanasia is prohibited in Islam regardless of the amount of pain and suffering an individual goes through this is his test and calamity from allah azzawajal he must endure it because this is his test if he fails he goes to hell if he succeeds he goes to paradise in the highest level eternally forever the Prophet tells us alehissalaam Salam and the hadith is in the Sahay when there was a battle between the Muslims and the disbelievers and there was this Muslim man who kept hitting right left and center killing the disbelievers and the idol worshippers and doing really well in battle so the Muslims were pointing at him and say and saying that whoa nobody did well today like so and so the Prophet heard this had a sawed-off son he looked at him and he said he is in hell all of the companions were shocked now we're battling we are fighting in the cause of Allah and this guy is doing the best among us and the Prophet says he's going to go to hell then what are we fighting for one of the Companions said I will accompany him I'll follow him and I'll bring you the news so during the battle this guy kept on fighting behind him and watching him until he saw this brave man getting wounded in battle and it seemed that he was in real pain and suffering from his wounds he could not tolerate such pain so he took the tip of his sword he placed it between his breasts and put the other end on the ground and he leaned forward until it penetrated his chest came coming out from his back and he killed himself and the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam while resting the man came and he said I believe that there is no God worthy of being worshipped except Allah and that you are the Messenger of Allah so the Prophet said what's up what is it he said o prophet of Allah the man you talked about earlier and said he's in hell he did this and this and this and then he killed himself so the Prophet erased a lot o Sam said by Allah a man performs well for 60 years until there is only one foot between him and entering paradise and then he ends up doing something wrong and he dies while doing it and then he goes to hell and a man does bad since 60 years of his life until there is only one foot between him and Hellfire yet then the preserved tablet states that he makes something good at the end of his life and he dies while doing it and he ends up going to Jannah to paradise therefore what the Skoll as mercy killing is totally prohibited this is murder if I assist someone over this and I helped him to euthanize him by euthanizing him I am the murderer and if he does this to himself because there are doctors who would tell him do this do that add this stop taking that until he dies if he does it to himself this is called suicide and this is a major sin now coming back to the issue of animals with animals is different if a cat is in real pain if a dog is in real pain in his suffering and the doctors say there is no cure for that pain there's nothing wrong in killing that animal and putting it to rest putting it to sleep as they say there's nothing wrong in that because it's an animal I'm not killing it for the sake of fun or enjoying it or transgressing against it animals are not tested like humans so they can be killed when there is a need to kill them and a large one knows best"
