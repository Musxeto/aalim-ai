  "transcript": "Abdul Rahman from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh The scholars say that in order for the Dua to be answered, your Ameen should be said to a Dua that is being said live. So a pre-recorded Dua would not help, would not be beneficial. And I say the Dua, this is valid. It has to be live and I hope this answers your question."
