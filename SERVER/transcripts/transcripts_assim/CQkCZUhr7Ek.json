  "transcript": "the first question is from sister sumayya from the ukia so my question is kind it's quite similar to the last one I told you about my period but then a different case so this time um I saw a little bit of Vlog and um it was continuous actually I'm not sure it shows blood I didn't check it but then I'm sure this was New Jersey so I prayed the whole day and then the night actual blood came I was sure then and then it was it came slowly but then it was consistent like it was coming and then it kind of stopped around like 11 at night and then in the morning I was confused to pray for Joe or not and then a huge like a large quantity of blood similar to my it was actually blood yeah it came at once and it was really large and then I was like okay this is the fourth night so I kind of stopped praying from that point and I went back to sleep I woke up in the morning I did my usual routine and I don't remember like at the time I said oh my God it's talked and like I'm clean and it was in my period I just remember that it's like it went it continued like I remember seeing it was as if it was my period but I stopped checking um it's like it was it added up to be in my period so I wanted to ask if that large quantity of blood was it enough to make me feel like this the flow of blood or I needed more evidence no this is sufficient once you see a flow of the blood and it's coming in large quantities this is your period and what you have done was correct the first day the spottings or what were you what you were not sure of this is not your period so you have to clean yourself and perform mudu for every Salat but once the flow of blood started and the amount was a lot and it's blood that is your period and Allah and what you have done was right inshallah foreign"
