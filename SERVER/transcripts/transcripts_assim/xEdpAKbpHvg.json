  "title": "Want to get married but cannot afford it financially, what to do? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "says what can a person who's not financially capable do when he has the urge to get married he's physically fit but he doesn't have the means to afford it well this was answered by the prophet islam himself when he addressed the youth and said yamasha all young men or youth whoever is capable physically and financially to get married he should get married and who's ever ever not financially capable then he should fast because fasting curbs his sexual desires it reduces it so the prophet salaam instructed those who cannot financially get married to do something that would reduce and lessen their hardship due to the the desires they have which is fasting and the best is to fast every alternate day skip one day fast one day but if someone is capable of curbing his sexual desires by fasting mondays and thursdays only so be it it depends on what curbs your sexual desire if someone says every alternate day does not work for me then there's no problem in fasting every single day though it is against the sunnah in the surface but it is permissible due to necessity as the person is not doing it to get closer to allah 100 because we know that this is not a sunnah he's doing it as a form of healing and treatment to stop such desires and allah knows best you"
