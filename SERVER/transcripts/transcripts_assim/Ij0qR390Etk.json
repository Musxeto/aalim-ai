  "transcript": "Sylla handle him al-hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik island my Barozzi rahmatan lil hard I mean nabina muhammad in wa ala aalihi wa sahbihi ajma'in am back dear brothers and sisters in islam assalamu alaykum warahmatullahi wa barakato one of our mothers the mothers of the believers one of the prophet's wives sallallahu alayhi wa wa seldom was a woman who underwent a lot of tribulations calamities trouble and problems in her life and she was the daughter of the leader of Quraysh at his time her name was Ramla but she's most famous among the Muslims with her nickname which is um habiba she's Ramla bint ABI Sufyan Obinna sacrebleu help her mother is Sophia bent AB alas evening Omega she was born 17 years before the first revelation came to the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam this means that when the Prophet migrated to Medina she was thirty years of age in the beginning she accepted Islam and she got married to Roubaix de la even you Josh evanora Bob they both accepted Islam and she was pregnant when they decided to flee Mecca and migrate to Abyssinia there she gave birth to her daughter habiba which she is nicknamed by now she was the daughter of Abu Sufyan and whenever the name is spoken people acknowledge him as the head of Quraysh especially after the Battle of Badr where all the dignitaries in the top idol worshipers who led the aggression against Islam were killed so when Abu jahil atre Sheba the sons of Rabia Omega M no halluf obey even no halluf Yacouba even know Ava Marie all these people were killed in the Battle of Badr the name of Abu Sufyan resonated all over the place and he was the one who led the Army on the Battle of Earth and he was the one to lead all other battles and aggressions against Islam the Muslims so to imagine that his own flesh and blood his own beloved daughter accepts Islam when he is one of the greatest enemies of it it shows how strong her a man was she fled Mecca and her father's oppression to go to a new land to go to people that don't speak her language don't share her traditions and customs while pregnant in a sea journey that was full of danger just to be able to worship allah azza wajal alone she disobeyed her father despite knowing that it is mandatory to obey the father and this is the fork of the road a lot of the Muslims face when they are given the choice between obeying their parents or obeying Allah Almighty any Muslim who submitted his will to Allah knows that there is no obedience to any of the creation and disobeying Allah Almighty Allah comes first without a second you must obey allah azza wajal no matter what the consequences are so she migrated when they settled in Abyssinia she tells us that she saw a vision and she saw her own husband obeyed Allah in a very bad situation and status he looked awful so she was scared and when she woke up she said to herself by Allah he's not like he used to be but what can go wrong they both were Muslims and they both migrated for the sake of Allah so she saw him soon afterwards after she woke up and he started the conversation by saying uma Habiba I contemplated upon upon the religion I did not see any religion better than Christianity and you as you know I was a Christian before then I accepted Islam and now I'm telling you that I have gone back to Christianity and as you know that the Abyssinians were all Christians so this may raise the flag on the ruling of migrating to a Christian country or a non Muslim country and the impact that it would have on those who have weak Eman as we see in the second generation of Muslim families that travel and migrate and settle in such non-muslim countries so she told her husband of the dream she saw and how awful and bad he was in it which would be a sign to anyone with intellect that what you're doing is wrong but he did not pay her any attention and he kept on drinking wine getting wasted for the rest of us of his life until he died in Abyssinia as a kafir and an apostate now she left to Abyssinia pregnant defying her father's orders defying her own people fled with her religion trying to worship allah azza wa jal and now she's stranded in a country that she does not speak the language of a foreign country her father opposes her her husband has become an apostate and a Christian and she is or her own yet she was like a mountain that the winds cannot shake she remained steadfast on Islam and she didn't know what Allah had in store for her but Allah definitely wanted to her the best of this dunya and the rest of the era as well in Medina hundreds of and thousands of miles away the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam was not in the dark of what was happening to his companions wherever they were he was the supreme leader and he knew what was happening to his companions and he was following their news and affairs and keeping in touch with them and this shows you that the Prophet Ali Salim was not any normal person or any normal leader he was the perfect man the perfect human sallallahu alayhi wa sallam though he was illiterate he could not read and write but if you study his life story and biography you will be shocked of such perfection in terms of human nature the prophet alayhi salatu salam while in Mecca knew every country around him and who was the leader in such countries and how he treated the people and those who came as visitors and this is why when the oppression reached the max the Prophet told the companions to migrate to Abyssinia why not to Egypt why not to the east part of Arabia because the prophet nooh alehissalaam and he told them that that in Abyssinia there is a just a just king people would not be wronged in his presence he's fair and just so the profit I Suzanne knew what was going on he is a responsible official checking on his citizens so when he was told that on habiba a woman of honour and reputation the daughter of abu sufian the head of chorus when he heard about the things that she had faced there and how she was patient steadfast and firm on her beliefs the prophets hadith salatu salam help came to her as soon as it was possible o habiba says may allah be pleased with her i saw another vision and I saw in the vision someone calling me yeah o man meaning o mother of the believers so I woke up frightened and I interpreted it that the Prophet will marry me RA his salat wa sallam though it was quite far fetched due to the distance and lack of communication and not before long after her idea was over a messenger from the Abyssinian leader and Najah she came to her she was the concubine of Anna Joshi who was in charge of his clothes and his perfume and she said to her my master had sent me to tell you that the prophet alayhi al-salam had send had sent to him to propose for you in marriage so Anna Josh she says what do you say and she said of course I accept that may Allah give you the glad tie things as well so the nagashi the king said then appoint someone to be your guardian and she appointed her a little necessary the Menil ass to be her guardian the stories say that she was among the prophets wives most to receive the dowry where Anna Joshi gave her four hundred dinars and lots of perfumes and lust of jewelry in lots of clothes and this was from Anna Joshi himself but it was considered to be the dowry of the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam and no other woman the Prophet had married Alice Oh Sam was over so long distance she got married and came back to Medina on the seventh year of hijra the year of Heiberg which means that she remained with the Prophet as his wife are a solace of Salaam for four years only when she came to Medina she was one of the prophets honoured wives there is a report or a story that circulates around where her father abu sufian came to visit the Prophet Azam and tried to extend the truce period and then he visited his daughter's house and when he wanted to sit on the mattress she folded it and he was shocked do you want me to sit on the ground I don't know my daughter whether you think that the mattress does not fit me because it's dirty or you think that I'm not worthy of sitting on such a mattress and she said that you are a disbeliever and this is the mattress of the Prophet as a son and you must not make it impure by sitting on it this story is quite famous but it is not authentic and therefore we just mentioned it to remind the people to be aware of stories that are not that authentic especially when it comes with dealing with non-muslims which is part of the rulings of Islam so I don't want a son or a daughter to treat his father in a similar way depending on such a story which is not authentic in the first place mother o Habiba may Allah be pleased with her had many stories but one of them that impacted the life of the Prophet as a Ceram and also gave us a ruling in Islam was when she proposed to the prophet alayhi salatu salam to marry her sister as the daughter of a b sofyan and this was whoa we know that she is a jealous woman but how can she do that so the Prophet a Salaam looked at her and said to her would you like me to marry her and she said o prophet of Allah it's not that I don't love you or I would like you to go somewhere else but I heard that you were going to marry someone else so the best one in my view to share with me my love would be my sister rather than a stranger so the Prophet sallallaahu Selim said to her this is not lawful for me meaning that a man cannot combine between two sisters and the same marriage this is totally prohibited and the marriage is void so she said to him in this case people are circulating among themselves that you are going to marry dora the daughter of abu Salama and he asked to enquire dora the daughter of umm Salama who's my wife and she said yes and he again said by Allah if she wasn't my stepdaughter she would still not be halal for me because abou Salama and myself are brothers through a BIA the slave woman suckled us when we were infants so she is my niece because her father is my brother do not offer me your daughters all your sisters so that was the end of it now umm Habiba was a woman who followed the teachings of the Prophet Allah saw some to the letter and she conveyed that to us and taught the whole Ummah such things when her father died it is normal for people to mourn their loved ones and her father by the way Abu Sufyan accepted Islam on the 8th year of hijra the year of the conquest of Mecca and he became a good companion of the Prophet s Sam and fought battles in the cause of Allah so when he died his daughter mourned him only to order on the third day of his death some perfume which she applied on her sideburns and on on her hands and arms and she explained to those who were around her so that they could convey this knowledge to the Muslims she said by Allah I don't have any interest in getting perfumed but had I not heard the Prophet Alyce of Salaam say it is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah in the day of judgement to mourn over a dead person over three days except if he were her husband then she must mourn for four months and ten days so being my father I had only three days to warn him according to the hadith and instruction of the prophet aerosol salam and hence this is why I asked for the perfume to be applied and if you look all around you you will find the Muslims always abiding by the emphatic sunnah prayers and we all know that twelve Rakas in the day and the night would build you a house in Jannah this hadith came to us through who it came to us through ohm Habiba may Allah be pleased with her well the Prophet our SSM said whoever prays during the day in the night twelve Rekha's allah will build him a house in paradise for before lahore - after it and - after Maghrib and - after isha and - before fetcher so she was the one who conveyed this hadith to us may Allah be pleased with her and even though she was in good relationships with the other co-wives the other mothers of the believers she was in good relationships with them however when it was time for her to leave this world she sent to Aisha - umm Salama to all the other wives of the Prophet Isis I'm telling them aisha says o Habiba called me while she was on her deathbed so I came and she said to me you know aisha as co-wives there must have been something between us and anything that was done I pray to Allah that he forgives me and who gives you whatever we had done so she is telling her ish I may Allah be pleased with her that she is setting her free from any liability on the day of judgment as she has forgiven her anything wrong that she had done or said to her I assure me Allah be pleased with her he supplicated on the spot and she said may Allah forgive you all of this and may allah azzawajal overlook all of your sins I have made you free from any wrongdoing that came to me through you and she said may allah azzawajal pleased you as you have made me happy and pleased and she sent to all the mothers of the believers the same thing I'm happy by may Allah be pleased with her died in medina in the year 44 and she was 80 she was 68 years of age and she died in the reign of her brother mahalia even ABI Sufyan the Caliph at that era may Allah be pleased with her our mother our mother and the wife of the prophet alayhi salatu salam had our lahu eylem when especially in merely Aslam was allah llahu wa sallim wa barik ala nabina muhammad wa ala aalihi wa sahbihi ajmain a cinema money come warahmatullahi wabarakatu today we're gonna talk about the book interactions of the greatest leader anas bin malik may allah be pleased with him said out of old on saw in medina abu talha had the most date palm trees and the most beloved of his land was varaha a piece of land that faces the mosque the messenger of allah sallallahu aleyhi wa synonym used to enter it and drink from some water therein when the verse which means never will you attain good reward until you spend in the way of Allah from that which you loved was revealed Abu Talha stood and said to the messenger of allah sallallahu itu a synonym Oh Messenger of Allah the Almighty says never will you attain good reward until you spend in the way of Allah from that which you love and the most beloved part of my wealth is baraha therefore it is a charity for the sake of Allah and I hope that Allah accepts it and stores it for me in my record for good deeds so use it in any way Allah shows you so the messenger of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam said this is such a good action this is profitable wealth I have heard what you have said but I see that you should give it to your relative about Allah may Allah be pleased with him said I shall do so o messenger of allah so abu talha divided it between his relatives and cousins and among them were hassan and ope eben kereb that is how the prophet of allah sallallahu aleyhi wa salem used to advise them about which places are more suitable for charity reported by Al Bukhari and Muslim Salam alaikum wa rahmatullahi and welcome back liber says is it permissible to make the vicar of the Shahada la ilaha illallah muhammadur rasulullah I've seen it circulating among the social media saying that this is a Buddha and what one should only say ashhadu an la illaha illallah WA ash hadu ana muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluh and I don't know why where these people get such things and they're so happy to circulate it anything that is weird they're happy to circulate without authentication and this is wrong when it comes to the religion of allah azzawajal la ilaha illa llah by itself is a vicar without any doubt and anyone who denies this is not a person that can be attributed to knowledge because la ilaha illa llah by itself is a victim you don't have to say a shadow a la ilaha illa Allah and the Prophet on his deathbed used to say in our inland law in a little motocycle art this is what the Prophet used to sell something he is the one who said that ilaha ilallah is the best of supplication and he is the one who sets of hand alhamdulillah allah akbar la ilaha il-allah is the best vicar it doesn't matter which one you begin with so to say that this is an innovation this is nonsense now mohammed ur rasoolallah is not a vicar this is a statement this is why when you testify you say well ash hadu ana muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluh this is a testimony but when you say muhammad rasool allah this is a statement this is not a dhikr so i cannot repeat mohammad rasool allah mohammed ur rasoolallah this is nothing if you want to make the kira say muhammad sallallahu alayhi wa sallam this is a dhikr to offer salutation upon the prophet and he a salatu was-salam ibrahim says during this tie of pandemic we sanitize our hands very often which contains alcohol in it so is it allowed to read the Koran and offer Salah after sanitizing our hands with alcohol-based sanitizers the answer is yes alcohol is not neji's alcohol is not impure which means that if I apply perfumes that are alcohol-based I cannot pray no there's nothing wrong in that at all when alcohol is found in a drink or food that if consumed a lot would intoxicate this becomes haram an intoxicant but still it is pure not neji's like the blood of a swine for example this is not just one drop of it prevents you from praying and prevent you from being able to maintain your purity we have rayon from the USA rayon well mute your television please and listen to me from your plant mute your television raions I think we we have to ask our viewers when you contact us either through Skype or a landline mute your television so that I won't hear the echo of my own voice and then wait for the relay to bring your own question afterwards okay then we have rakia saying if someone says such and such person has said Salam to you what should be our response when someone conveys his Salam through a third party and the third party comes to you and says mister that gives you salaam my response would be may the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him and you so I would say in Arabic alayka why alayhi as-salam and this would suffice insha Allah who as budget sumin says okay we are we have Yusuf from from Algeria Yusuf is something what's gonna do for you ask you you know about the major event I can make my prior in home you know in this in this pandemic with all almost are closed know when I make my prior I should make other NASA after like my prior okay any more questions Thank You Baraka laughing so Yousef is asking at times of pandemic when we are all praying home should we make a van when we want to pray the answer is it is accepted and permissible is it mandatory the answer is no because you live in Algiers and it's a Muslim country and the message it's there call a Dan so there are than would suffice for you if you are in a kafir country and there is there are no messages calling the event or if you're in the desert then you should do that but while in a Muslim country while in a country where there are messages that had already called again this is not mandatory for you plus and this is a bonus for free a karma is highly recommended whether for men or for women but it is not mandatory so if I just go Allah Akbar the prayer is valid but it is highly recommended to call for the F comma before praying even if you are praying so man says should we say bismillah when we start reciting Quran in between a surah if not then how should we start reciting from the middle of the surah scholars differed on this point and the most authentic opinion is that alves Mela saying bismillah alrahman alraheem this is a separate area and this ayah is recited in the beginning of every surah of the Quran with the exception of surah - Toma chapter 9 and it is a verse in Surat enamelware now min sulayman wa innahu bismillahirrahmanirrahim so if you're going to begin a surah from the beginning then you have to say bismillah ar-rahman ar-rahim and it's highly recommended not mandatory but if you're going to recite a surah from the middle then you should not say bismillah r-rahman r-rahim it is sufficient only to say audhu billahi min ash-shaytani r-rajim Hannah says if we wear undergarments that have images or cartoons on them is it so prohibited or is it only for clothes that are seen so Hannah is asking about something that is concealed some people wear a t-shirt underneath their shirt and that t-shirt has a Mickey Mouse face on it a cartoon or some people wear underwear that has pictures or cartoon characters on it on them so they are concealed no one can see them so am i sinful for doing that is it prohibited the answer is yes it is prohibited because you're wearing it and you're wearing it intentionally willingly not forcefully no one forced you to buy these things or to wear them you could have and you still can wear something that has no such drawings or pictures but being concealed is definitely lesser in sin than exposing it and wearing it on your t-shirt for example this is more sinful what is says during fasting is it permissible to inhale before or steam inhaling of hot water for blocked nose this is an issue of dispute some scholars say that this is not permissible according to the Hanafy school of thought the Maliki school of thought and they say that because the before the thing that you burn to get incense to get a beautiful smell this has a mass and when you inhale it directly it goes down your lungs and they consider that to be sort of eating and drinking other scholars say this is not eating nor drinking and it doesn't make sense so for this dispute among scholars just for the benefit of the doubt and to be safe rather than sorry do not inhale directly such incense and it would harm you and it's medically bad for you but if it's burnt in the room and you find the smell in the room there's no problem that because this is not directly done and allah azzawajal knows best a brother says what is the expiation for fornication the question is not clear if the brother is asking about fornicating during the daytime of Ramadan while fasting the expiration for that sin which is breaking your fast with intercourse is to free F a slave and this is not possible nowadays so you go to option two which is too fast 60 days can set it consecutively so fasting is two months consecutively is an expiration for breaking the fast of the day of Ramadan with intercourse if this is not possible due to illness or old age in this case you must feed 60 poor persons and this is only for the breaking of the fast fornication itself there is no expiration for that that is one of the major sins in Islam and the prescribed punishment for it in this life if a person fornicates and he was not previously married is to be flogged a hundred lashes and if he or she were previously married or currently married or were widowed then the punishment would be stoning to death execution so it is one of the heinous sins of Islam there is no expression for it there is nothing you can do except to repent express sincere and deep remorse ask Allah for forgiveness and do a lot of good deeds hoping that Allah would transform these sins into good deeds and Allah knows best Zohar says minimum of how many ayahs should we recite in Salah after fatiha in Surat al muslimin Allah says pakora Amata Sora mean recite whatever possible for you from the Quran and we know that salat is divided in two pillars mandatory acts and voluntary acts and reciting verses of the Quran after the fatiha he is a recommended soon act which means that if I were to pray the floor which is a fort for lock eyes only reciting Fatiha in all four records my prayer is valid there is no problem in that but we know that the Sunnah of the Prophet is more worthy of being followed which means that I pray the fateha' and surah afterwards a fatiha and a surah afterwards the third and fourth raka I thought I would do so how many ayahs should I recite after the fat high in the first and second records as minimum as one if you wish and the sky's the limit so there is no minimum if you recite one I such as ayatul kursi that would suffice you and if you recite a cluster of ayahs that's good if you recite a whole surah even a short one that is even better and Allah knows best Shaheen says in the subcontinent people say that it is prohibited to touch or pluck flowers or fruits after Maghrib or at night is this true definitely this is baseless and not true anyone who brings forward such a claim we tell them be my guest provide me with an ayah from the Quran or a verse or hadith from the prophet alayhi salatu salam and if he fails to do that you know it's baseless riddled huck from England Rida rather I'll hop from England I can't tell you so I think yes well he's just spoken you guys hung up maybe you should give him a call Halima says can we participate or play games that have the top three places receive prizes but we don't know what we will get until we win it and games where you pick a random box out of a few boxes and you get whatever is in it the gifts in the boxes can vary from very expensive to rare or rare to cheap from one box to the other but no money or any sort of giving is involved you get you keep free and nothing more I don't know of such a game but it seems to me that this game is done within the family because it's not logical to have a public game as such and giving gifts away for no reason if this is on telly on the TV then this must include women music and many other Haram things so participating and it is totally prohibited end of story but if it's something between friends and I'm a rich man and I'm I'm spending my time and money to make my friends happy and I do this for them and they choose one gets a Rolex and another one gets a bottle top or an empty bottle or whatever this is okay providing there's no harm involved providing the participants did not invest or pay a single dime nor to participate as a subscription nor as a payment for the app be downloaded in this case this seems to be okay in sha allah azza wajal abdul a team from malaysia so now i'm to LA yes I've been okay without eyes yeah okay any more questions no thank you Piko dreama kasi so abdel halim is saying what is the ruling on drawing animals that have no eyes on a piece of paper well Abdel Halim we have to go to the hadith of the Prophet Elisha lot Salam to learn from them so we have a hadith from the Prophet s on which is very authentic when he said to mother Aisha the most severely punished people on the day of judgment and Hellfire are those who draw pictures of living creatures and he told her didn't you know that the owners of these pictures are the most severe on the day of judgment allah azza wajal says in the hood see hadith who is more sinful than those who create like my creation let them create a piece of barley let them create an ant and we were told that those who draw such pictures will be told on the day of judgment to give life to them and they won't so drawing such pictures of living animals of birds of fish of insects of humans is totally prohibited and having the face only without eyes would still make it prohibited if you don't have the head and you just draw the body there's no difference of opinion that this is okay so the body without the head is permissible some scholars say that even if you have the head but no features that give it life no eyes no nose no mouth nothing just the head itself empty then this is also permissible and allah azzawajal knows best rather hug from the UK little huck it seems that the relay relay is very long it takes like five to ten seconds till it reaches them Reda okay hello yes what's your question I think if I go to Jimmy yeah I can hear you if I go to you okay physically I might have reached there earlier yes yes what is your question I'm waiting for Cher yeah I'm listening to you read or result Huck I want to ask a question yes I'm listening to you what's your question well I think we got to to callers talking and communicating to themselves so I hope that you guys sort this out Abdul Malik says does the leather that one wears belts purses shoes does this leather have to be slaughtered in order to be halal do the same conditions of slaughtering as for meat that is eaten have to be fulfilled and if so what about if somebody does not know whether the animal was slaughtered in a halal way or not keeping in mind that nowadays in non-muslim countries this is mostly not the case well first of all in terms of leather that we buy on the market the Haram things for us to wear if it's swine or pig skin or of animals that are not permissible for us to eat such as lions tigers snakes all of this is totally Haram this is beside the point and we have a category which is camels cows which is the majority beef or cow and sheep now these we can eat if we slaughter and by default when we slaughter them in Holloway the skin the leather is Helen the difference of opinion among scholars is if there were a cow dead by itself it got a heart attack or even worse a corona covered 19 may Allah protect us and it died can we use the skin the leather or because it's dead meat we have to throw it all in the garbage the answer is the most authentic opinion is that the meat of animals that we are allowed to eat we are entitled to use the skin the leather of a dead animal only if canned in tanning is a process where you put special herbs and implants and ingredients to remove the fat and the smelly part of it so the vast majority of leathers on the market has been tanned so if it's made from cow camel or sheep skin then you can wear it and the default is that it is permissible to wear until proven otherwise and Allah knows best Faison from India preys on I think we might have gotten the evil eye because we received a number of good quality Skype calls so somebody must have given us an evil eye we will shall recite they needed rakia later on Romana says is it allowed in Islam to use cannabis that is marijuana oil CBD for backaches as a massage oil not taken orally the answer is yes there's nothing wrong in that as long as it does not intoxicated and applying it externally does not impact your sanity it does not intoxicate you therefore there is nothing wrong in that insha'Allah Suha says can we use paper cheats instead of dice in games since using dice is haram the scholars differed over this issue and I am inclined to say that this is cheating Allah soldier so if Allah made playing with dice Haram because of the selection of numbers which is random for this reason for the any other reason using pieces of paper or using an electronic dice generator number generator would be the same thing and it would be like tricking allah azza wajal na knows best anwar says if a woman is wearing a sari or a man wearing a long ghee in this case is it mandatory to wear underwear when praying what counts in prayer is what appears from you so what I'm wearing underneath my clothes this doesn't impact the validity of my prayer as long as my clothes are not see-through so whether you're wearing a dress you're wearing abaya and you're not wearing anything underneath or someone's wearing trousers and is not wedding in underwears underneath or wearing something that is like a lung gay or something there's nothing wrong in that insha'Allah and the prayer is valid Sadia says is it better for a woman to pray in congregation with her son who recites small sewers in taraweeh as he will get reward of congregation or should she pray alone and recite longer sewers from the most half sadly it is not mandatory for you to pray in JAMA and if there is no other man with your son then he can pray alone so at the end of the day I would highly recommend that you pray on your own prolonged your salat because this what would count for you on the day of judgment rather than praying with him in five or ten minutes and getting it all over with and allah azzawajal knows best this is all the time we have until we meet next time on Saturday insha'Allah I'll leave you fear Manila was Salaam o aleikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
