  "transcript": "afzal says if a person has wronged other people and realized after years but now it is difficult to find them and apologize what should he do in this situation first of all the Prophet told us Allah his salat wa sallam that there are three books if you see if you may say and these books on the day of judgment one of them Allah does not ever forgive which deals with blasphemy with share with atheism anything that does anything that deals with disbelief this is Unforgiven immediately taken to hell the second book or record book Allah does not pay attention to and this is related to sins other than shirk so what's between you and Allah Azza WA JAL Allah Azza WA JAL does not pay attention to that he would forgive because Allah is most forgiving and these are sins between you and Allah Azza WA JAL the third record book is the one that Allah does not leave until he make things even and this is what's between the servants then themselves and this is what this question of afzal is related to the prophet alayhi salat wa salam said in an authentic hadith whoever transgresses against his Muslim brother he must get even and seek his forgiveness or compensation before the day of judgment because on the day of judgment there are no Derham or dinar it is only good deeds and bad deeds now this hadith clearly explains to us what will happen on the day of judgment a third hadith the Prophet says as a solid Salam to his companions do you know who is a person who's broke al mouthless the one who's bankrupt who's he so the Companions defined it according to their worldly knowledge so they said a bankrupt person is a person who does not have dirham or dinner he doesn't have any money so the prophet alayhi salatu salam clarified this to them and he said that a bankrupt person is a person that comes on the day of judgment with good deeds of prayer fasting and charity whoa so this guy is a righteous person well this is what some people think of him then the Prophet says is awesome but he hit or beat this person he cursed this person he slandered this person he backbut this person so on the day of judgment he'll start giving away his good deeds to them according to his transgression and if his good deeds run out then he will start to take from their sins and pilot on himself and then he will be thrown into hell I would have Allah so this shows you that whatever you do even if it is an ant's weight whatever you do against your brother it we'll reflect on you on the day of judgment by him taking from your good deeds one of the sisters called me and said that my in-laws abused me mentally that is whenever I visit them in holidays and I travel to them and they start to say bad things about me in front of me good intention by unintentional ah nose but it hurts so bad that I don't want to see them and I tell her why are you so angry go let them say whatever you want this is all expiation to your sins Allah is elevating your level iliza raising your sins so whatever they do you should be grateful to them just do not let it get under your skin do not let it settle in your heart so it's very important to know that on the day of judgement it's good deeds and bad deeds now if you wronged people then you have a problem you have to go to these people and ask them for forgiveness this is the ultimate so you back bit me you cursed me you said something that was slanderous about me and then you felt remorse and you're sad and you say Halas let it go on the day of judgment we'll meet and I'll take what's mine even if I did not know about it Allah records every single thing so what to do Sheikh you have a course one of two either you come to me and you tell me share I've wronged you I've said bad things about you please forgive me and in this situation there are two possibilities or maybe free one I would say to you I would never forgive you for saying what you had said - I would say may Allah forgive you and may Allah forgive anyone who said bad things about me and this is genuine huh I'm saying this now to you all may Allah forgive anyone who said anything bad about me thirdly I would investigate and say what did you say I want to know exactly what you had said so that I would forgive you now this is problematic because if you tell me this may cause more damage than good so now you're coming to me I know you we meet we socialize I have nothing against you when you came to seek my forgiveness and I inquired about the things you had said about me if you tell me this may add fuel to the fire I didn't think you would dare and say such a thing and I would become more furious and maybe not speak to you to the rest of my life and this is more harm than good so this is the first scenario the second scenario is that you do not tell me fearing that the consequences the repercussions of telling me would cause more evil than good and in this case because of such a genuine fear you have no other alternative but to whenever my name is mentioned in similar places where you had slandered me or cursed me or said bad things about me you praise me and you say no no no the share is a good one the share it has this and that you say the good things about that individual that you had wronged and you make dua for him oh Allah forgive him or Allah pardon him and erase his sins etc hoping that by your repentance remorse and seeking Allah's forgiveness that on the day of judgment you will come and Allah when it's time for being accountable and when I come and say o Allah this guy said so but many bad things about me give me from his good deeds Allah would say he had repented I accepted his repentance and I will compensate you from deeds and good deeds from me so Allah would not consume his good deeds - it is my sins rather he would please me and I will go please with the grace of Allah soldier so I hope this answers the question but be careful from wronging others this will haunt you for the rest of your life so many people tend to misinterpret and come up with excuses so that they go to bed and sleep without any worries not knowing that even if they don't remember or they try not to remember it is all recorded with allah azza wajal"
