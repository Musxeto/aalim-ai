  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] can ald dear brothers and sisters in Islam and welcome to this new episode that deals with the hadiths the 40 hadiths that the prophet sallallahu alaihi alhi wasam highlighted the importance of the hearts in them the Hadith at hand is narrated by zabit may Allah be pleased with him he says the prophet sallallahu alaihi alhi wasallam said whoever is focused on the Hereafter Allah will make him feel content with his lot and Grant him peace of mind and his provision and worldly gains will come to him regardless of circumstances obstacles or people but whoever is focused only on this world Allah will make him fear poverty constantly and confound his Affairs mix his Affairs and he will not get any anything of this world except that which has been decreed for him this beautiful Hadith focuses or encourages us to focus about the Affairs of the Hereafter in it all our Affairs would be aligned and the content of the heart would be attained but those who occupy themselves with the Affairs of this world and they strive in it then their Affairs would be scattered and their hearts would be filled with poverty even T may Allah have mercy on his soul says giving away whatever is more than what you need of money and wealth and be happy with what suffices you is more safer and secure for your Affairs and this would empty your heart and make all your Affairs unified and it's best for your dun for this world and for the Hereafter once the heart is emptied of SE seeking worthy Affairs and striving for it it will have no place in it except for Allah and this is why the prophet says whoever is focused on the Hereafter meaning that he's working hard for the pleasure of Allah as if he does not care about this duny as if he is striving to do whatever is necessary to make ends meet but not to go beyond that because he knows whatever Allah Asel has divinely decreed for him will happen so he does not go out of his way all of his concerns revolve around the the Hereafter all of his worldly Affairs revolve around what pleases Allah not the opposite what we see from our brothers and sisters nowadays quite the opposite I talk to a lot of people during my counseling sessions I meet people that are so fixated on this world as if they're not going to die they're trying to bend if not break the rules of Shar so that it fits their whims and desires it fits their worldly matters a CEO having 1200 employees under her doesn't abide by the hijab doesn't care about free mixing doesn't care about gender segregation and she says this is not logical what's mentioned in Islam how would I run my company Subhan Allah Allah wants you to run your life according to his Shar not to run his Shar according to your job to your whims and to your desires this is the meaning of submission when you submit your will to Allah Allah then if you do this will make him feel content with his lot everything that's scattered in this world would come align and Allah would Grant him peace of mind so he doesn't have to be worried he'll never be depressed he'll never pre be preoccupied of what will I do tomorrow how will I pay the rent what will I feed my children no he knows that he's doing his level best and that whatever Allah has destined for him will happen so he goes to bed and sleeps like a baby unlike that billionaire or millionaire or Rich Man or someone who's influential or someone of authority and power he is in vain he's in pain he's in agony i t says the heart always seeks something and this is part of living when you live you need to seek and pursue so a human being by nature would always seek what's beneficial for him and try to protect himself from whatever is harmful and this is what the soul is all about seeking and to find tranquility and peace the soul and the heart have to have something that they can relate to and the hearts cannot relate and find its comfort and Tranquility except in Allah yes some folks would say I find my peace of mind and Tranquility in a GL glass of scotch another one says well I find it in having my shot of drugs another says I find my peace of mind when I watch a beautiful movie or listen to a nice song all of these are tranquilizers they are things that are not permanent and that's why the moment this particular thing you found your peace of mind in is cut off you're depressed again you have anxiety attacks and you are worried so you go over and over and over again to where you think you will find the comfort of your soul and heart in where actually this is where all the pain and Agony is the souls and the hearts cannot find its Tranquility except when they worship Allah alone and whenever the hearts are filled with something other than the worship of Allah that thing would be your source of Torment pain and Agony whether it's a spouse whether it's your job whether it's your son or daughter whether it's your wealth whether it's your uh um Power and Kingdom that will be your torment but you're so oblivious you're so blinded you can't see that is why if the hearts do not worship Allah alone if the hearts are not filled to the rim with the love of Allah and the worship of Allah they will seek to worship other gods those who are satisfied with finding things other than Allah Asel and that is when a person would be the most miserable in his own entire in whole entire life says whoever seeks Allah truthfully will find him and whoever finds Allah Allah will suffice him from anything else in this universe so he will be free he will be rich he will be someone respected you will see the lights Illuminating from his face he will glow because Allah has filled him with wealth and richness with with richness because he knows who Allah is but if you miss Allah if your heart is shallow and whole Hollow from Allah's existence and you're scattered all over the world then you will be scattered all over the world you will not be able to focus you will not be able to concentrate when you have Allah in your heart your provision and worldly gains will come to you regardless of circumstances obstacles or people it will come without any effort from you though it was distant but it will come without you going out of your way to collect it while the opposite is true whoever is focused on this world so he only focuses on how to achieve his worldly goals how to SEC secure projects how to make more money how to get more influence how to be more uh with authority and the likes then you have a problem because Allah will make him fear poverty constantly such a PE such a person would always have his eye on the ball what happens if I lose my job what happens if they sack me what happens if I lose my contract or lose my project and all my money is gone down the drain so it's always worried he goes to bed thinking he prays if he prays think thinking of this worldly he loses the sweetness of Salat of Prayer of worship of reading the Quran what Quran I haven't read the Quran in like 3 four years I don't even know what Allah wants of me I just work 9 to5 every single day and relentlessly try to make it 9 to9 instead n to of 9 to5 what will happen Allah will make his poverty between his eyes because he's always afraid of it and he's always hoping and Wishful that nothing would be depleted rather it would all increase and increase and it's like a mirage the more you get closer to it the further it is and it will continue to do so until he dies he will not get anything of this world except that which has has been decreed for him a Cindi may Allah have mercy on his soul said both men the one who focuses on the Hereafter and the one who focuses on these uh worldly matters have been already destined and their provision has already been written but the difference is the first one who focuses on the Hereafter would get it effortlessly he would not preoccupy his mind he would not be worried what will I do tomorrow what will I do next month what will happen to me why because he trusts Allah he focuses on Salat on reading the Quran on worshiping Allah on on doing good in his life in connecting his kinship in being kind to people he's focusing on abiding by the Shar whatever Allah tells him to do he complies no questions asked no strings attached others don't like this they it doesn't go down their throat well so they say no this is not logical how can I run my business how can I run my family how can I not be free mixing with non mahs this is what Allah said said no no no doesn't make any sense so they bent if not break the rules and such people will get what was divinely decreed for them but it would be very difficult and it would be mixed with so much work and hardship because they did not submit their will to Allah says no one in this life is more tired than the person whose concern and focus is on worldly matters why he's so tired because he keeps on trying and trying and his heart is working all the time instead of that person who has surrendered himself to Allah submitted his will to Allah knows that nothing would happen except what Allah has pre ordained he does his due diligence but expecting Allah to take care of him may Allah have mercy on his soul he said a happy man or a person so it can be a man or a woman a happy person is the one who chooses the Everlasting when the blessings and favors of Allah are never ending over the one that is inevitably going to end but the torment of it is for eternity the happy person is the one who chooses the Hereafter and the Jenna over this D that has consequences that are punishable in Hell Fire may Allah protect us this is equivalent to the other Hadith the beautiful Hadith Abu H tells us that the Prophet saidat wasam The Prophet said sallallahu alaihi wasallam Allah the almighty says oh son of Adam devote yourself to my worship and I'll fill your heart with contentment and provide for your needs but if you do not do so I will fill your hands with worldly distractions and your poverty will not be be relieved this beautiful Hadith is exactly the same oh son of Adam this is a generic call no difference between an Arab or an an Arab a white or black this is for all Humanity whoever responds will be rewarded and whoever does not will be sinful because people they vary according to the piety in their hearts not according to the color of their skin oh son of Adam devote yourself to My Worship this is to the Layman and those who do not understand what Islam is is illogical Allah tells us to devote ourselves to his worship does this mean we have to be monks and sit in the Masjid in the mosque worshiping him not working not marrying not doing whatever we have to do in life of course not to devote yourself to worship is not to abandon this world and to let go of it completely rather to give priority to the worship of Allah and as a consequence everything would follow and come accordingly so when I pray in the Masjid I'm worshiping Allah when I'm getting married I'm worshiping Allah when I'm working night to5 or I'm work in Commerce and trade to earn money to suffice to survive suffice myself and my family and my children and to be able to give charity and zakat and to be able to perform Hajj with this wealth that Allah has granted me I am worshiping Allah but all of these things revolve around worshiping Allah alone not the other way around so when there is a contradiction between what worshiping Allah is and gaining worldly matters always give priority to worshiping I want to make money and there's a project if I lend someone with interest I'll gain more money if I bribe someone I'll win the contract if I do this if I do that what should I do priority to worshiping Allah Allah says these things are Haram end of story I don't have to justify I don't have to bend the rules or cut Corners I have need to worship Allah Asel what happens if I do devote myself to the worshiping of Allah Allah will fill your heart with contentment so because your heart is preoccupied with the love of Allah with the worship of Allah in this case you will find that your self-sufficient you don't need people you don't need to beg them rather you found the sweetness of submitting your will to Allah and doing what Allah wants trusting that Allah will do to you what you want this is total richness the ultimate of all you don't need anyone but the warning comes afterwards if you don't devote yourself to My Worship if you don't turn your back to this dun and do what I command you to do and stay away from Haram which would benefit you in this life and in the Hereafter the consequence would be I'll fill your hands with worldly distractions Subhan Allah I know so many rich people on the surface of course I don't get involved with them I don't hang out with them with the grace of Allah and I see how distracted they are I see how Allah is punishing them through their spouses through their children through their partners in business I see how much suffering they're going through despite the glamour that you can can see despite their hundreds of thousands of dollars of watches cars Mansions their trips to world uh Resorts every couple of weeks and the the the lifestyle they run you can see the pain and Agony behind the veil that they pretend to have why because Allah filled their hands with distress worldly worldly distractions and Allah subhah wa ta'ala warned them that your poverty will not be relieved because you're always in pursuit of worldly matters neglecting what Allah wants from you day after day day in day out until the inevitable happens and you die where is your wealth down the drain where's your mansions where are your vehicles where are where is the power and authority you have nothing remains except your grave what did you fill your grave with nothing so what do you expect it to be a pit of Hellfire that's why this poverty is divided into two types poverty to worldly matters this comes and goes wealth comes and goes goes and when you are poor to the worldly matters and you're in pursue of it without having your wealth and richness in your heart you're the most miserable person on Earth but when you have your poverty solely to Allah that is a noble position only the selected Servants of Allah are granted such a position when your heart is in poverty to Allah begging Allah expressing its poverty to Allah asking and begging and and and and humiliating oneself only to Allah this is the most noble stage and position of your life and it is the soul of every step and Stage of this life that you live in and indeed it is the richness of the heart that is filled with the love of Allah and the worship of Allah we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back"
