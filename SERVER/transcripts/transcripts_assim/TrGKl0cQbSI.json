  "transcript": "[Music] lisa says can you help me with this question one of my friends said it is allowed in other schools of thought for a woman okay who married who got married previously and wants to remarry she does not need a guardian because according to the prophet salaam it's not valid without a guardian please help so his question isa is basically about some schools of thought that state that a divorced woman does not require the consent and approval of her guardian because she's not a virgin anymore and she's entitled for her own opinion and life and this is not true the hadith this is what the prophet says there is no guardian there is no marriage valid without a guardian and he did not mention whether she is a teenager or over 70. the prophet did not mention whether she is a virgin or been married multiple times or a widow etc so what these schools of thought or school of thoughts thoughts say is not true"
