  "transcript": "[Music] um so my question was if i want to find someone eligible for zakah can i go to a masjid and just ask um the imam of the masjid or to some organization and ask them if they know anyone but the problem is like i wouldn't know them personally how trustworthy they are and i wouldn't know the person i'm giving to so they have to investigate and if so like how would i do that would i have to ask the person like um their situation and stuff like that okay so you're asking me this question correct yeah how do you know that i'm trustworthy to answer you that's it i mean yeah i wouldn't know them i'll answer i was asking you a rhetorical question which means that by default muslims are to be trusted so if i see someone coming to me saying i am poor i am this i am in need i have rent to pay my my wife is on dialysis and i have diabetes i don't have money for a medication and i have no reason to doubt him he doesn't look like a professional beggar and he looks like a muslim i see him in the masjid it's enough allah says in the quran fear allah to the best of your ability i'm in a country i don't know any poor people i have no one poor in my contact list that i can give them there is a cat what to do my alternative my choice that i have is number one to go to the imam of the masjid i pray there and i trust him i don't know him but his imam and he looks okay how more you need to trust a person than the imam or i go to a an official organization that is for charity and they follow the quran the sunnah i know that they have good apida and that they will place my money at the trusted places and i should go there and i just give them this the cat and i tell them this is for the zakat it should be given to the eight categories mentioned in ayah 60 in surat tawba don't give it to non-muslims don't give it to people who you don't know whether they're poor and they say yeah we know we we know the criteria to be given to you've done your due diligence this is the best of your ability and this is sufficient and enough for you azzawajal you"
