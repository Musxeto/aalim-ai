  "transcript": "I want to ask you about some programs whether apps or on desktop that basically they are Halal for instance a programming program but every like in certain parts they might have certain phrases like if it crashes it might say oh our gurus are meditating or it might have pictures of unicorns dragons or I don't know Buddha for instance not just a picture of there not saying anything with it is that Haram or what no problem inshallah because you don't have any belief or conviction and it's part of the program that you have no control over"
