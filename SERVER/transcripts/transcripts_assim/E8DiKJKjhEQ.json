  "title": "Forgiven for bad thoughts, so why aren't we rewarded for good thoughts?",
  "transcript": "uh alhan from India my question is since we are not held accountable for what goes in our mind would we not be rewarded for having good thoughts of Allah deliberately and making thicker in our mind while we are amidst uh kuffa or Muslims with the intention of getting closer to Allah and cleanser cleansing our heart by remembering him okay I will answer inshallah al-hand says we know that intrusive thoughts that are negative as long as we don't speak about them or act upon them Allah has forgiven them so why isn't it the opposite when we think positive of Allah and we make vicar and we make Dua but without moving our lips or without acting upon it why wouldn't that be rewarded the answer is simple the first case it's a gift from Allah it's a concession from Allah azzawajal who forgave us for any such intrusive thoughts because Allah knows our nature and how difficult it is for us to control such and truths of intrusive thoughts the opposite is not the same because you're the one who's lazy to move your lips and tongue with making thicker or making Dua or reciting the Quran therefore you won't be rewarded for any of that [Music] and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and the evening I will uh try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah"
