  "title": "Watching food videos all day long while fasting - Sheikh Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "meh wish says what is the ruling on those who are fasting and watching food videos all day long in two circumstances one to learn how to make something for iftar two out of pure enjoyment now this doesn't affect your fasting per se because if you know the things that nullify your fasting then anything else does not so watching videos of preparing food or even of people eating doesn't have an impact on your fasting however these programs that are preparing food usually are accompanied by a lot of music there is a lot of free mixing the chef is usually a woman and she is accompanied by a man or a number of men guests chit chatting laughing the and the likes joking and this is haram so for you whether you're fasting or not this is not permissible for you to watch and the Prophet used to seek sallallahu alayhi wasallam he used to seek refuge in Allah from knowledge that is not beneficial this knowledge your watching while fasting where you're supposed to be lowering your gaze and not engaging in something that is wasting your time this knowledge is not essential it's not medicine it's not engineering it's not something that would give you money and with the mentioned circumstances it is not something essential for you to learn such recipes any food would do we do not live to eat we eat to live so one has to draw the line if you're a woman and she's a woman and you mute the music if there there is any and there's no mixing and you watch there's no impact on that on your CRM insha'Allah on your fast"
