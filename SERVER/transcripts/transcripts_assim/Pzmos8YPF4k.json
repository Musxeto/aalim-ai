  "transcript": "for she's asking if I enter the Masjid one minute before the aan should I pray it sister if you enter the Masjid any time of the day or of the night you must not sit down unless you pray the two raas so even if you enter while the aan is being uh uh called you stand up until it finishes and you recite and repeat what after the M says and then you sit you pray two R and you sit down or you start praying the two ra while is being called and then you sit down you cannot sit without praying these two Ras and any time of the day or the night you are requested and required to pray these two rakas before you sit down so there is no time that it is forbidden for you to pray these two raat except if the is called so if now they're going to pray there is a difference between aan which is the general call for prayer and the which is the call for the actual prayer to be prayed in seconds so if the is done you cannot start the or uh the greeting the two of greeting the Masid because the prophet told us that whenever theama is being called then there is no prayer accepted except this prayer which is the F that is being called for"
