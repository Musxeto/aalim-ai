  "transcript": "Shaker I I suffer a lot of mocking here from the people and they save me some even some Scholars save me that blindly following one of the Imam is must and they claim that even Imam bukhari and uh imams of Haram are also blind followers and it is must for all of us to blindly follow and uh salafismis are not right and we should be humbly happy Etc so what should be our answer for them don't answer the machine why do you have to answer everything that people say to you this is insane don't answer you know that their allegation is baseless and they you know that they are blatant Liars Imam buhari was never a blind follower he was a mustahid he was an Imam of himself and their claim is refuted by throwing it back into their faces when we say to them okay was Abu hanifa a blind follower who did he follow foreign were they blind followers if they say yes then they are blatant Liars because they have to bring us whom they followed and why do we follow them and not the imams they followed and if they say no they are Allah likewise and all the Companions and the scholars till date so don't engage yourself in fruitless discussions and arguments with such ignorant imbeciles just give them a smile and move on let them sue you well what are they gonna do when you insist on shoving your opinion down their throat this is what you'll get and yes they will accuse you with all things and they will make fun of you you deserve this you brought this to yourself shrug your shoulders and move on who said that you have to reply to each and every statement someone says to you"
