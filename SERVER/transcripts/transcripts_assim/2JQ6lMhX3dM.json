  "title": "Bought a car for 9k but wrote 5k to avoid taxes, did I do something wrong? #Assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um she my car company forces me to pay taxes on my car if I bought it for more than 5,000 if I bought a car for 9,000 but me and the seller we both agreed like I don't have to disclose that amount and I put down 5K so I don't pay these taxes did I do something wrong and like in this case is my money Haram the money the listen Mooney now evading taxes without lying or cheating is permissible why because the taxes governments take from the likes of you and me is totally Haram because they are extorting these this wealth and these money from us without our will and without accepting it so this is Haram money for the government to take but as a Muslim we cannot lie and we cannot cheat so if you can avoid taxations in a loophole or a legal um way then this is permissible without cheating and lying now if you collaborate with the seller to say something else which is not true and you write it and you sign papers this is a lie and you would be sinful for that also it would impact most likely your insurance so if you were involved in an accident and the insurance company wanted to compensate you they will compensate you on the account of these $5,000 among other factors and Allah Knows Best"
