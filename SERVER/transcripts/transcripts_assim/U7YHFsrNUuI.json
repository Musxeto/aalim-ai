  "title": "Men or Women praying Ishraq at home, is the reward same as praying in Masjid? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "as can we pray ashram at home because the masjids are not open as for the reward that the Prophet alehissalaam placed upon a certain task which is one hatch one Omaha this is only limited to the conditions set by the Prophet a little optional which is a person who prays fetcher in congregation remains in the Masjid until the Sun rises and then prays to raka so scholars say that this reward of one hatch one Omar perfect perfect perfect is conditional and the conditions are to be prayed in congregation in the Masjid nevertheless the reward of praying fetcher remaining in your position in your home making vicar until the Sun rises and you pray two rakahs is also really reward I don't know of any of the companions may allah be pleased with them that would not follow this in the hadith the Prophet Isis em once left home to prefetcher while his wife was in a position of Prayer and came back after sunrise and she was still in the same position making vicar so the Prophet said Ali is awesome I said four words meaning four statements that would equal all the time that you had spent from fajar till now subhanAllah Hamdi either the Hulk worried enough was in attache when we'd had a calamity that's it so it indicated that the mother the mothers of the believers used to prefetcher and stay where they are making Vicker until the Sun rises so this is highly recommended but it does not have the same reward as doing it in the Masjid and offering the Torah cos after sunrise so would a schrock be prayed at home similarly to the saya to the message it and get the same reward answer is No"
