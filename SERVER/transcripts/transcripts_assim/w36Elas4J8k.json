  "transcript": "Dear brothers and sisters in Islam, Peace be upon you. And part of being a human being \nis that you have emotions. And the more emotions you have, \nthe more of a human being you are. The Prophet, peace be upon him, was \nnot someone who was emotionless. Rather, he used to be happy \nand sad, pleased and angry. And he used to grieve and \nfeel sorrow, as we all do. Unlike what some of us may think that, Brother, how can you grieve? How can you cry? How can you not trust Allah, Azza wa Jal? Subhanallah. As if feeling sorry over \nsomething defies your trust and dependence on Allah. This is not true. These are human emotions that, \nas humans, we have to go through. But, when we are in Paradise, all of these negative feelings \nwill disappear by default. Allah says about the people of Paradise, and they will say, praise be to Allah, who has removed from us all sorrow. Indeed, our Lord is forgiving and appreciative. And if you look at the main \ncause of grief and sorrow in the life of the Prophet, peace be upon him, you will find it towards Allah, Azza wa Jal. In the sense that, whatever is not \npositive at the sight of Allah, the Prophet, peace be upon him, \nused to feel sorry for that. Above all, when he gives da'wah, when he calls people to Islam, and they are defiant, they resist and reject his efforts to get them out of darkness into the light. We usually could care less. I give da'wah to someone, he doesn't respond. He insists on being an atheist \nor agnostic or a Christian. I did my due diligence, I move \non, I have no problem, no worries. Not our Prophet, peace be upon him. And this shows you that our da'wah \nis not sincere and perfect as his. This is why we are failing in getting the \nsame results as he did, peace be upon him. Listen to what Allah had mentioned \nin many, many verses of the Quran. Allah says, We know that you, O Muhammad, peace be upon him, are saddened by what they say. And indeed, they do not call you untruthful, but it is the verses of Allah \nthat the wrongdoers reject. So, he's saddened by the rejection. Allah also says, Then, perhaps, you would kill yourself \nthrough grief over them, O Muhammad, if they do not believe in this \nmessage and out of sorrow, which Allah Azza wa Jal is telling \nhis Prophet, peace be upon him, take it easy on yourself. Don't be depressed. Don't grieve so much over \nthem, so that it may kill you. And this is an indication that grief \nand sorrow may cause a person to die. And we see this, anxiety, panic attacks, people who grieve over something and \nthey get a heart attack and they die. Allah says to his Messenger, peace be upon him, And whoever has disbelieved, let \nnot his disbelief grieve you. Because you've done your due diligence. You've done all what is in your effort to \nget them out of the darkness to the light. They don't want to. It shows you how much love the Prophet, \npeace be upon him, had for people, that he wanted them to share the \ngoodness that Allah has given him. And finally, the Prophet, peace be upon him, \nwas addressed by Allah in this beautiful ayah, So do not let yourself perish over them in regret. Take it easy on yourself, \nMuhammad, peace be upon him. It shows you the huge responsibility that the \nProphet, peace be upon him, had on his shoulders to the extent that it could have killed \nhim out of grief and sadness and sorrow that they did not accept Islam. Imagine a battle which took \nplace on the third year of Hijrah   between the Muslims and the idol worshippers. The idol worshippers were three or \nfour times the size of the Muslim army. And one third of the Muslim army defected, \nled by the head of the hypocrites. And they left the Prophet, \npeace be upon him, on his own. In this battle, 70 of the Prophet's, peace \nbe upon him, companions were martyred. And the Prophet, peace be upon \nhim, was injured and was bleeding. So one would suspect that this was   the most horrific day the Prophet, \npeace be upon him, had ever witnessed. This is what Mother Aisha asked \nthe Prophet, peace be upon him, Was there any day harder on \nyou than the day of Uhud? The Prophet said, peace be upon him, Yes, I encountered a day where I suffered a lot. When at the end of my period in Mecca, your people \nhad harassed me to the extent I had to flee Mecca and walk all the way to Taif, which is \napproximately an hour drive on top of a mountain. It's a resort for the people of Mecca \nand the people of Jeddah like us. In summer we go there because \nthe weather is finer and colder. So the Prophet walked all \nthe way, peace be upon him, and he displayed himself to Ibn \nAbd Al-Yalil, Ibn Abd Qulal, and they were the dignitaries of Taif, of Thaqif. He displayed himself in the \nsense that he made his pitch. This is who I am, I am the messenger of Allah, \nlisten to the Quran, listen to my presentation. And when they did not accept him, not only \nthat, they accused him of lying, not only that, they ordered their slaves and young boys \nto stone the Prophet, alayhis salaam,   with pebbles that made his feet bleed. He said, I went down the mountain and I was \nabsent-minded, I could not recollect anything. I was so depressed and sad because \nof the way they had treated me. I came back to my conscience and \nI was awakened at Qarn Al-Fa'alib. Imagine walking down for three, \nfour hours not remembering anything, totally blinded because of this grief. And Jibreel came to me and said to me, O \nMuhammad, this is the angel of the mountains, first time to descend by the instruction of \nAllah, and the angel of the mountains said to him, O Muhammad, Allah Azza wa Jal had heard what \nyour people said to you and had done to you, and I am the angel of the \nmountains, so I'm at your command. If you wish, I could collapse the two big \nmountains on their heads and annihilate them all. The Prophet, Sallallahu alayhi wa \nsallam, in this crucial moment,   in the midst of this \ndepression and grief and sorrow over how they treated him, \nsaid, No, do not do that. I am hopeful and wishful that Allah Azza \nwa Jal would extract from their offspring   children and men who would testify that there is no God \nworthy of being worshipped other than Him. Look at this optimism, look at this positivity, \neven in the darkest moments of his life, his grief would not make him do irrational \ndecisions or take irrational decisions. He always thought of the welfare \nand the goodness of his people. He wanted goodness for all of humanity. Yet, Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, he would still \nhave this human emotion of sorrow and grief. Imagine his beloved uncle, Abu Talib, \nwho took care of him for over 40 years, shielded him, protected him, gave him a safe haven   and prevented the idol \nworshippers from attacking him. The Prophet, relentlessly, Sallallahu alayhi wa \nsallam, tried his level best that he accept Islam, but it was Allah's will. When he died, he was grieved by it. Allah \nthe Almighty comforted him by saying, Indeed, O Muhammad, you do not guide whom \nyou like, but Allah guides whom He wills. Full stop. End of sorrow and grief. Yes, I love my uncle, but if this is the \nwill of Allah, there is nothing I could do. And this is an ayah we should all ponder upon. You watching me, you're Muslim \nwith the grace of Allah. The majority of you are Muslims by \nbirth, and there are those whom Allah   guided them to revert to Islam. You are the chosen one. Allah has given you this beautiful \nreligion on a plate of gold or silver. You should be grateful and show your \ngratitude and remain steadfast on Islam. When you look at those whom \nAllah did not will to guide, the poor atheists, agnostics, Jews and Christians,   idol worshippers, Hindus, Sikhs \nand the likes, the Buddhists, Allah did not will to guide them, \nand they will end up in hellfire. They chose, they had everything in front of them. They had the evidences to prove to them \nthat Islam is the religion of Allah. They turned their back, they shrugged their \nshoulders, said, not interested, not convinced, and they will pay dearly with depression in \nthis life and with hellfire in the hereafter. As for you, what did you do to \nshow your gratitude to Allah? Have you prayed Fajr this morning in the Masjid? Are you observing your fast \nas Allah wanted you to? Are you giving in charity? Are you reciting \nthe Quran? Are you doing your Adhkar? Are you committed to Islam as Allah wants you to? If yes, then this is the \ngrace of Allah Azza wa Jal. The Prophet, Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, grieved   over the betrayals of the \ndisbelievers, the idol worshippers. Anas ibn Malik says that the tribes   of R'il, Dhakwan, and Usayya, they're \nall from Bani Lihyan, from Hudhail. They asked the Prophet, \nSallallahu alayhi wa sallam,   to send a convoy with them \nto teach them about Islam. So the Prophet sent 70 of the Ansar, and they were \nknown to be the Qurra, the reciters of the Quran. And they used to recite the Quran,   and at night they used to study it \nand pray night prayer and learn. And daytime they used to bring water \nand put it in the Masjid and chop for   firewood and sell it and buy \nfood and give it to the poor. So they were active in their community. So the Prophet sent them, Sallallahu alayhi wa \nsallam, to these people in the middle of Arabia. Haram ibn Malhan, may Allah be pleased with \nhim, was the maternal uncle of Anas ibn Malik. And they were all killed and \nassassinated in an act of betrayal. And the Prophet, Sallallahu \nalayhi wa sallam, was not seen   grieving in sorrow over an expedition \nmore than he grieved for them. To the extent that he kept making dua in Qunoot, \nin the five daily prayers, for a whole month   against these tribes. But after one month, the command came \nfrom Allah, Azza wa Jal, to refrain. This is not to you. Leave it as it is. He grieved over the martyrdom of \nthree of his beloved companions. In the battle of Mu'tah, where three thousand   Muslims went to fight over a hundred \nthousand troops of the Byzantines. Three thousand against a hundred \nthousand, and some say more than that. So the three leaders of the army, \nin succession, were martyred. Zayd ibn Harithah,   the son of the Prophet, Sallallahu alayhi wa \nsallam, in adoption before it was abolished. He was martyred. His cousin,   appointed after him to be the leader, if anything \nwould happen to Zayd, Ja'far ibn Abi Talib. He's the Prophet's cousin and the brother of Ali. And he was martyred after two of his \narms were amputated during battle. And this is why he's seen in paradise having two \nwings, flying wherever he wants, as a martyr. After that, the third in \nsuccession was Abdullah ibn Rawaha,   the poet of the Prophet, \nSallallahu alayhi wa sallam. They were all martyred. And the companions felt that they will be defeated   until Khalid ibn al-Walid, \nmay Allah be pleased with him, took the flag, led the army,   and managed to retreat by defeating the army of \nthe enemy, thinking that they had reinforcement. The Prophet was with his companions \nwhen all of a sudden his face changed. And mother Aisha   said, I could see from the crack of the door, \nwhen the Prophet was with his companions, signs of grief and sorrow over his face, over \nthe demise of his three beloved companions. And this hadith shows that showing and expressing \nyour grief, if a calamity befalls upon you, does not take you out   of those who trust and rely on Allah, as \nlong as there is content in your heart. And finally, the Prophet also grieved immensely \nwhen his uncle Hamza ibn Abdul Muttalib, the master and leader of martyrs, \nwas martyred in the Battle of Uhud. When the Prophet, Sallallahu alayhi wa \nsallam, on the day of Uhud, passed by   women from the tribe of Bani Abdul Ash'hal, weeping and mourning their martyrs in Uhud, the \nProphet looked at them with sorrow and said, Hamza has no one to weep over him. Meaning these women are weeping their death, \nbut my uncle Hamza has no one to weep over him. So the women of the Ansar heard this \nand they started weeping over Hamza, as a sign of condolence,   as a sign of sharing the grief with the \nProphet, Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam. When the Prophet learned about this, \nhe told them, stop and refrain. It is not permissible to mourn and wail, \nrather, it is not permissible to wail   and weep with a sound over \nsomeone who has died after today. There are many incidents where the   Prophet, Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, \nexpressed his grief and sorrow. If we know that seven of his own \noffspring, Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, three of his sons and three of his \ndaughters died in his lifetime. And the seventh daughter, Fatima, \nhe gave her the glad tiding on his   deathbed that she will catch \nup with him after six months. What kind of grief you could \nimagine be in this huge big heart   of someone like the Prophet, \nSallallahu alayhi wa sallam, with all these calamities, with all these \nproblems around him and the challenges. If any one of us would have had one \npercent of what he had suffered,   Wallahi, we would have died years and years ago. But not the Prophet, Sallallahu \nalayhi wa sallam, who was content   with Allah's decree and who only relied, \ntrusted and depended upon Allah alone."
