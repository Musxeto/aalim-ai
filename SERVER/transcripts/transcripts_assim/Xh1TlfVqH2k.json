  "title": "What is better, memorize Quran or Understand Tafsir? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "i've started and this is uh psycha i've started learning quran with tajweed since last year what should i give more priority to memorizing the quran or reading and understanding the tafsir you have to balance memorizing the quran has a great reward at the side of allah because your level in jannah will depend on the last ayah you've memorized if you memorize the full quran you'll be in the highest level half of the quran you'll be in the middle level etc but at the same time the quran was revealed to be understood and to be implemented and you cannot do that without tafsir allah azzawajal criticized the jews being like camels carrying books on their backs the camels don't know what's in the books though they are valuable books with knowledge in them so when you memorize the quran without knowing the meaning you have gained a lot of reward but knowing the meaning is the essence so that you can implement that in your life so you have to have a balance in order to have a win-win situation"
