  "transcript": "is a controversial person nowadays while if you ask the scholars they would say qadir al-jilani was an imam of sunnah jamaa he was upon the tawheed he was upon the right manhat he was upon the right akida and he was so knowledgeable that at his time people considered him to be one of the most knowledgeable people so he was a follower of sunnah and he was a great imam and benefited the ummah with his knowledge however this doesn't mean that there aren't any short comings here or there he's not infallible he's a human being like us so like all scholars he must have had some weak narrations of false opinions and maybe some innovations but if compared to the vast knowledge he had and the tawheed and the good things he had done this is negligible and i think there is a thesis for or a book for uh allah preserve him on uh and it's advisable for you to go and check it out however when we praise sheikh abdul qader we definitely do not praise his followers at the moment those who follow the kadiria tariqa among the super sufis are definitely on the wrong and they are going against his teachings and they've exaggerated and went into extremism thinking of him to be uh one of the awliya that we can pray to can seek refuge in the with the things they do at his grave the fabrications they say that he did this and did that this is definitely not related to the sheikh may allah have mercy on him and he would not have approved it at all so what you hear today from people praising him or claiming to be following him these are super sufis that you should be aware of from"
