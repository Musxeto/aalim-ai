  "transcript": "Rayyan from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Barakatu Sheikh, first of all I want to thank you Sheikh because I was in too much bid'ah So I watched your videos and I get out of it So I'm very thankful of you. Alhamdulillah All thanks and praise are due to Allah the Almighty Azza Wa Jal. How can I help you my friend? Sheikh my question is that I saw a video on the YouTube the Sheikh asked Bin Baz he was with him in the masjid and the azan was going on so he told him to sit and the Sheikh gave the fatwa that if we don't have time to pray Tahiyyatul Masjid we can sit So what's your opinion on that? My opinion is first of all, I don't know whether this story is true or not I know that in the authentic hadith The Prophet said alayhis salatu wasalam, and he's the one I follow As you do definitely Rayyan The Prophet said when someone enters the masjid He must not sit down until he prays two rak'ah This is the Prophet's command He did not say if there is enough time or not a second hadith While the Prophet was given Khutbatul Jumu'ah a man came And sat down And if I'm not wrong, his name is Salik al-Ghattafani So the Prophet interrupted his Friday sermon and said Salik Did you pray two rak'ahs And the man said no The Prophet said stand up and pray two rak'ahs which means If it was permissible to sit And listen to the khutbah that would have been more Important than praying two rak'ahs Yet the Prophet interrupted alayhis salatu wasalam his khutbah. So I don't know about the story Whether it's authentic or not Whether it was the Sheikh Mimbaz who said this or someone reported it And if someone reported it I may doubt The narration of that person or that individual whether he heard it correctly whether he understood it correctly or whether he was lying Or not. I don't know but I Respect Sheikh Mimbaz. He's my Sheikh I follow him. I learn from his teachings But he's the one who taught me that No matter who says what Ask this important question Is he a messenger? So when someone says to him Imam Ahmad says so and so so Sheikh Mimbaz says is Imam Ahmad a messenger? Imam Shafi'i says so and so he says is Imam Shafi'i a prophet and the answer would be no said then Whatever they say must be filtered Through Quran and Sunnah if it complies with them We take them if not We disregard them with all due respect to the Imams But we only follow the Quran and Sunnah. I hope this clarifies things a bit"
