  "transcript": "while watching the new moon sighting it felt like a good lighting this day is all right as the first start we here tonight with family around the night meal we're making do I I feel how nice it is to be so near to those I love oh dear brothers and sisters in Islam and welcome to this new episode of Virtues of fasting Hadith number 23 is narrated by jab may Allah be pleased with him he said that the prophet of Allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam left for meca during the year of the conquest of Mecca in Ramadan and he and the people with him fasted until he reached the valley of he then called for a cup of water which he elevated so that the people could see it and then he drank afterwards he was told that some people had continued to fast and he then said those are the disobedient those are the disobedient ones and the following Hadith Hadith number 24 in another narration he was told that people are finding it difficult to fast during the journey and they are waiting to see what the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam will do so he called for a cup of water after the ass prayer and drank it and this was related by Imam Muslim without the verb and drank it and finally the following Hadith number 25 Hamza bin Alami may Allah be pleased with him said I said to the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam oh messenger of Allah I find within me the strength to fast while traveling would there be any blame upon me if I were to do so the prophet of Allah sallallahu alaih wasallam said to him it is a concession from Allah whoever takes it has done well Whoever likes to fast there is no blame upon him and this Hadith was related by Imam Muslim in the sah now if we look at these hadiths we know that they revolve around the issue of fasting during traveling so what is the ruling on that Allah gave us the concession not to fast Ramadan when we are ill or we or or we are traveling so this is permission from Allah Asel to skip fasting and this is a manifestation of Allah's mercy upon us if you look at these hadiths that we've just recited and please have the Liber the Liberty to go and check them in your own copy of BU and I advise every Muslim and muslima to obtain such a book and to have a small library of the needed important books that they can refer every now and then don't take my word for granted don't take anybody word for granted always check up these things and verify them and cross-examine ask questions but because this is the only way you're going to add knowledge to yourself and get closer to Allah by increasing the knowledge they are not alike those who know and those who do not know so the Hadith of Ja abdah may Allah be pleased with him and uh uh in it we find that the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam traveled and during the month of Ramadan because the conquest of Mecca was on the eighth year of Hijra and it was on the month of Ramadan so we learn from this it is permissible to travel during the month of Ramadan there's no problem in that and we also know from this that it is permissible to break your fast while during the month of Ramadan when you're traveling but this is providing that your travel is halal by itself someone who's going to do something Haram in his journey and this is his plan to go to drink alcohol outside or to fornicate or to make a riba transaction this journey of his is a sin by itself and Scholars say that he cannot take the Allah's concessions except in permissible traveling permissible traveling what about if someone plays a trick so he finds that the days are too long if he's living in uh uh Sweden for example or somewhere else so he decides to travel on holiday so that he would not fast this is not permissible and he's sinful and he's obliged to fast because tricks in Islam are far greater than actual sins in sinning you disobey Allah when you make a trick like this it's a sin plus you are taking Allah for a fool may Allah be exalted what are you doing you're fooling Allah that is why it is not permissible for example to trick Allah in so many things such as in the case of a woman who was divorced three times she cannot go back to her husband until she remarries so they hire someone to marry her for one night and then divorces her and she goes back to her first husband this is totally prohibited and unacceptable and the prophet described thisat as a surrogate goat Sate goat because they borrow him for a one night stand and that is it and this is totally prohibited tricky trickery is completely unacceptable in Islam now what do we understand from the two hadiths Hadith of jab and Hadi of Hamza Hadith of jabir tells us that the prophet and the companions were all fasting at the beginning after prayer which means that there are only few hours left one or two hours at top three hours for Sunset the prophet was informed that there are people the majority of the Muslims are uffing because of fasting you know traveling was not in air conditioned airplanes at the time they were used to travel on Horseback on camels back or on foot and imagine traveling the whole day Under the Sun with no shade so it was difficult for them so the prophet alai when he heard about this difficulty he ordered for a cup of water and he drank it in front of all while he was on his camel so that every everybody would see him and this means that the prophet took the concession and this means that it is permissible to break your fast even if it's few minutes before Sunset if you are legible for breaking the fast such as a sick person or someone who is traveling and it's becoming really hard for him and we learn as well from this that the prophet Alat wasam is a leader he's an Imam and an Imam who is being followed by his disciples and hence every Imam every leader should not measure the people to his own standards but rather he should lower his standards lower his bar so that he would not make life difficult for those who follow him and Obey him and that is why the prophet could have easily finished the day fasting without any problem and he could have ordered the people not to fast as in the issue of w if you remember continuing fasting day and after day yet the prophet did not do thatat he gave a general order by displaying it himself and he drank in front of them so that they would not feel any remorse that they broke the fasting well the prophet is the one who broke his fasting so we follow suit and that is why in the second Hadith in the second narration the people told him that they are waiting to see what you will do oh prophet of Allah Alat and that is why he took the initiative and the prophet led by example and this is the best means of being a role model to lead by example if I keep on preaching you guys and girls that we should be honest and we should be sincere and we should never tell a lie and I keep on lying and people know that nobody will buy what I what I'm selling if I say that you have to be kind to your wife you have to be kind to your children and the following day on uh uh front page newspapers stating that I've battered my wife and she was admitted to hospital with uh broken bones and bruises definitely nobody would believe whatever I say yet the prophet Alat and those who are following his his footsteps never do such a thing they always walk the talk they lead by example so our Prophet is a role model and the people are waiting and anticipating what is he going to do because we follow whatever he does so the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam ordered a glass of water and he drank it in front of them and this shows us that a leader has to be compassionate he has to be careful in looking at the feelings of those and the needs of those behind him and that is why the prophet said when anyone prays for his own you may prolong your prayer as long as you wish no problem but if you're leading the prayer you should take the weakest the oldest the one who has things to do as your example so shorten your prayer make it concise and quick so that those behind you would not find any hardship though you want to prolong the prayer but when you pray on your own prolong it for hours Without End no problem yet when you lead others no you have to lower the bar and try your level best not to make life difficult for them and a leader a true leader a true Imam does not sit in his Palace eating cakes and and brownies and and cookies unaware that his people are starving to death or are dying out of thirst a real Imam goes down and feels the people and asks about their need and try to complete what is missing in their lives and this is what the prophet did he wasn't in his tent unaware of what's Happening no he used to ask he used to check his people are they well are are they doing uhh okay okay is our journey sufficient or is it too difficult for them and that is when he got the message that they are too tired and too thirsty it is exactly like when the prophet Alat told Mother AA he said had it not been that your people are so recent in Jah and in either worshiping had it not been for this I would have demolished the Kaaba and I would have built it back on the foundations of ibraim peace be upon him and I would have made two doors to it one where people enter from and the other where people exit from why didn't the prophet do this because he was concerned that though his companions were Muslim though his people in Mecca accepted Islam after the conquest of Mecca he was afraid that this would be too much for them to see such an act and some of them may commit the act of apostasy and reject Islam when he sees this though it's legitimate though it is exactly what the prophet wanted to do as we know the Kaa as it stands now there's an arc next to it with space this Ark and the space is called Alim some call it and this is part of the Kaa but early before the prophet's message alham there came a flood and demolished part of it so when they rebuilt it they didn't have the cash to rebuild the whole thing so they only rebuilt that area that we see and go around but that area as well is part of the Kaa and that's why if someone goes in ta inside that area his ta is not valid because he penetrated the Kaa and he should keep the Kaa on his left and not go through it of course leading by example is what every parent needs to to do in our houses when we tell our people when I tell our families not to do this or to do that we should be the the first to refrain from things not to be done the first to do the things that should be done with from this Hadith we also learn that it is permissible to break your fast even if it's at the end of the day so someone gets sick really sick and the doctor says take this medication and it's an hour to Sunset and he says no I'm going to tolerate though it's painful it's hard and it's life-threatening and he refuses he's sinful and that is why in theith of jab when the prophet drank water some of the companions came and said listen everybody else broke their fast like you did oh prophet of Allah but there are few people who are still continuing to fast the prophet Alam did not give them the benefit of the doubt because we all know that they continued to fast because they wanted the a so their intention was 100% intact but but their intention does not do them any good when it goes against the actions and the instructions of the Prophet Alat wasam and I give this as a golden rule to every innovator if you a are doing something the prophet did not do you are an innovator you claim that my intention is good I say your intention has nothing to do with this if you're going against the Sunnah of the Prophet Alat wasam and that is where the Prophet when he heard this he said those are the disobedient ones those are the disobedient ones and he kep he kept repeating it why their intention was good they just wanted the reward of fasting but because they thought that they knew better than the prophet Alam by going against his Sunnah and his action they become became disobedient so every deviant look into your religion look into your practices whatever you do before Salah after Salah whatever you do in your life the rituals that are fabricated going to dgas going to the graves calling the prophet himself to uh uh do this or that for you to prevent this from or that from you all of this is innovation even if your intention is the most purest and Allah knows that but because your actions are not in accordance to the Sunnah of the Prophet Alam it's all rejected and you are the disobedient one now Hadith of Hamza the prophet told him that this is Allah's concession you want to fast go ahead there's no blame on you so how can we reconcile between the two the scholars say that fasting is one of three either it's prohibited or disliked or per ible recommended permissible so one of these when is it prohibited when it is harmful for you and there's a lot of tension stress and pain and Agony so someone the doctor tells him you have to break your fast you must not fast otherwise you may face the danger of dying or your recovery would be much longer than anticipated or you will suffer a lot and I mean a lot and the guy says no I'm not going to break my fasting I'm I and he insists in this case fasting for him is prohibited imagine a pilot flying a tri 7 or a 747 Boeing I don't like uh um air bus but anyhow so he insists he's traveling for about 17 hours from jeda to Los Angeles or less and the fight is double crw but still it is going to the Sun so probably he will only pray prayer throughout the whole 17 hours so the long the day is too long and he insists on fasting and he's dehydrated he can not see easily his vision is impaired and he insists on fasting he's endangering his life in the passengers behind it is mandatory upon him to break his fast if this is the case so this is Haram prohibited it becomes disliked it becomes M if it is not life-threatening if it's not going to delay his recovery but it's going to be really hard on him so the guy is barely standing or he has to sit he's so tired he's unable to walk or communicate in this case no this is Mak Allah gave you the concession why are you killing yourself the third case when it has no difference whether you fast or Break It Fast so someone traveling by airplane for an hour or two this is nothing someone traveling from jeda to Medina 4 hours in the car it's air conditioned and it's it's a nice ride nobody finds it difficult to continue fasting so what should we do do this is up to you but it is recommended that you fast if there is no difficulty why would you say it is recommended when Allah gave us gave us the concession for a number of reasons one of them when you skip fasting this means that your conscience is occupied you have one day to make up and if you fast during the month of Ramadan because it's not difficult for you you eliminate this debt on you secondly fasting in Ramadan is easier because everyone else is fasting so when you fast with the congregation when everybody's hungry and thirsty you don't feel to suffer as much as when you're fasting on your own and everybody is eating and drinking and having fun that would be mentally more uh uh difficult on you and when you fast it's easier for you to do it rather than keep it on later so whenever you take this burden off your back this is much easier in addition to the fact that when you fast during the month of Ramadan you are facing the blessing of Allah of the month because definitely fasting during Ramadan is unlike making it up on other days the bless month of Ramadan has more valuee now the usual question what is the distance of the travel that allows me to break my fast and what is the duration how long can I be considered to be a traveler well the distance Scholars say that whatever the people in that Village in that City considered to be a a traveling distance then so be it and I'll give you an example I live in jida where I'm broadcasting this program from and about 80 kilometers away from here give or take few kilometers lies Mecca now the distance is about 80 85 depending on the neighborhood you're living in in the district you're living in and to travel from jida to meca the people of Mecca and jida do not consider this to be a traveling distance and that is why we have people living in Mecca commuting every day to come and work in jeda and leave at the end of the day so actually they're commuting daily and sometimes twice a day because in the evening they are invited for a wedding so they go in the once again to Mecca and come back and that is why when I travel to Mecca I never shorten my prayer I never skip fasting because we don't consider this to be a traveling distance so that there isn't anything as 85 kilomet or more this is traveling less than that it's not traveling no this is not correct whatever is considered to be a traveling distance then this is it and when do I start to break my fast the minute I leave the borders of my city so if I'm traveling for 90 kilometers for example the minute I travel out of the borders of the city then I'm entitled to shorten my prayers combine my prayers and to break my fasting what is the duration of a traveler or a journey that entitles me to break my fast or to shorten my prayers see a lot of the folks think that if I'm going from jeda to London and I'm traveling for two or three weeks they say uh you're allowed to break your fast while you are on the plane once you reach London you have to fast and you have to uh uh pray uh complete prayers and this is wrong some say oh if you want to stay four days or more then you cannot shorten prayer where did they get this from nowhere and this is totally baseless this is unfounded and those evidences that they bring forward they don't indicate or show that there is an intention of 4 days or more more so this is unacceptable the prophet Alam stayed for over 19 days or 20 days in tabuk and he used to shorten and he used to combine sallallahu alaihi wasallam when he traveled to Mecca he stayed there for 19 days in the uh uh conquest of Mecca he shortened and he didn't fast so what is the ground rules here how would we know a lot of dispute a lot of talk I'll give you the summary I'll give you the juice and the juice is that when you travel you are considered to be a traveler until you settle down so if I go to mumbay for example and I have work to do and I stay there for three to four maybe five weeks I live in a hotel room and I'm sometimes change hotels in this case my whole stay there I shorten my prayers because I'm a traveler and if I want to skip the whole of Ramadan I can do that because I'm a traveler but if I get an assignment to work in mumbay for a year and I go and I purchase or rent uh an apartment and furnish it and after two or three weeks I feel that I'm settled down I go to the Masjid I know the timings of the prayers I'm accustomed I have a car I don't advise you to drive there but maybe get a show faroh or something so now I complete my prayers and I pray for and I fast like the people why because I am a resident there not necessarily a permanent resident but because now I am situated there I'm residing there then I take the rulings of the people of that country and whenever I travel back home only in the journey that I shorten and I get the permissions the concessions of traveling once I reach jeda Saudi Arabia then all of this stops and if I go back again after a couple of weeks to the same place where I was residing in mumbay or if I'm studying in Ooa Canada or in in whatever then the same thing happens so a person could have two or three places where he permanently stays throughout the year couple of months here couple of months here couple of months here and he does not shorten in all the three of them and he does not uh skip fasting Ramadan unlike if a person for example has a summer uh uh Chalet uh or or or a beach house and he goes there like 3 weeks or four weeks a year though he owns it but when he travels there he's not traveling to reside rather to a vacation in this case he does not uh have any problem with shortening and with the concessions of the traveler so I hope this y sums up the whole issue we have a short break stay tuned and we'll be right back inshallah their lives again for them happiness let us bring Allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala commanded Us in the Quran saying hasten to the for foress of your lord and to Paradise the width of which is the heavens and the Earth prepared for the righteous and Pious brothers and sisters in Islam especially in the month of Ramadan the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam tells us that when the first night of the month of Ramadan is here the devils are chained and a caller will call upon you oh Seekers of goodness come forth haste into goodness is our show in

assalamu alaikum and welcome back I believe we have the first caller Asma from Kuwait okay as well I have a question it's very difficult question for me um almost 25 years ago my husband uh he went for Haj and uh at that time obviously he performed um as well and he was young and at that time he doesn't know uh that uh uh he performed I think the from Haim he thought maybe he'll get more reward and uh but obviously we now we know that it's not right and uh after that he did many um and HJ as well and I don't know what he's very you know in you can say he's not comfortable and what to do now uh okay he did many umras and as well after that HJ he did another hjj and UMAS we did okay I will answer the question inshallah okay thank youd from saalam alikum uh she my question is I have to give 3 lakhs to my father and I was thinking from this last one year that I will sell some of my gold and I will give him uh can I sell now because after 2 months I'm going to India inshallah so I thought of selling my gold when rate is high so I thought that I will sell the gold now and on the rest of gold I will give zaka so please advise me can I sell my gold now or after giving complete zaka on the gold then only I can sell okay I will answer you inshallah okay okay okay uh Asma from Kuwait says that her husband 25 years ago when doing om or maybe Hajj he instead of going around the Kaa he went through theim or what we know as they call now as hij so afterwards he did a lot of Omas and Haj but now he is worried about that what he had done Hajj is a number of things and there are mandatory things there are Sunnah things and there are uh uh pillars so for someone who is performing or the first thing ta he does on the eth this is Sunnah if he did this through the on that day then his H is intact which is the last ta he does before leaving if he did it through the Kaaba then he left something that is mandatory and is sinful and he has to slaughter a sheep if he did this going through the or in which is a pillar his Hajj is not accepted now I believe he doesn't remember so by default if he just Slaughters a sheep in mekah and gives it to the F of theam inshallah the following Haj and om that he had done would expediate that and Allah knows best aan from Nigeria aan sir I have two questions sir yes one of my question you know in Nigeria we here we actually observe our prayer okay hello sir yes yes I'm listening yes we observe our the first day we saw our Ramadan we happened that after the we slept off and it was after F now we had that they SP the moon okay so in this situation there some scholar were saying that there's an had of the Prophet that said you that if you did not see the moon before going to bed there's no how in the morning you can take intention this is my first question and my second question ising to Zak yes when somebody has a property and you want to give you want to give out a Zak is it only the physical cas of what you have at that time of the when your zaka is due or you're going to include some of the property maybe you have a landed property of maybe 3 million 3 million in different places are you going to calculate those part of those lands and Cate part of your Z or how this is my question sir I will answer you inshallah Ahmed from Saudi Arabia my question is uh regard to prayer in har MH uh they said is all makah Isam okay so with the present situation that is happening in Haram one is not uh able to enter into Haram most of the time is there any difference between somebody praying outside Haram maybe in a mon before any more questions Ahmed no that's no question I will answer you inshallah om IM from Saudi Alum my question is about the C prayer that you just told about that for example if I'm traveling to uh from J to rad and I'm staying with my parents for a month or so so am I supposed to shorten my prayer or I as I'm living with my parents so I I'm relaxed what should I do okay and one more question is about um some people in Pakistan they say that they are called Sayad just because their lineage goes back to uh Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam and they say that they are not eligible for getting the zaka so so is it true or not okay I will answer your questions inshallah you're welcome ABD rman says that her father needs money from her and she only has gold so she has to sell some of the gold but due to the fact that the gold now is the rate is high and she's traveling in two months time when her zakat is due she would like to sell some of the gold now so that she would benefit from the high rate so is this uh uh permissible or she has to give the zakat first no inshallah as long as your intention is not to evade not to escape zakat inshallah you can sell it now and and benefit from that uh Sarah from South Africa hello yes listen to me from the phone please and mute your television yeah so I wanted to ask yes okay so I was Wonder you pregnant what is pregnant Sarah listen to me from the phone please mute your TV all right when you're pregnant when you have a babies okay e first first okay I will answer your question inshallah and we have AA from Saudi I have three questions okay can you fast obligatory fast on only Saturday and on can we fast obligatory fast on Saturday on Saturday on Saturday after after Ramadan okay okay and my second question is if you fast six days of shaal with the intention of make up the M days of Ramadan so can we get theab of six days of sha also okay and my third question is um sometime while cutting the chili and onion iess of ches onion go in the throat and and opening the tank s like this thing weap of these things go in the throat also so these things nullified our fasting or not okay I will answer you inshallah thank you you're welcome uh Hera from Saudi Alum Ramadan Kim to you and Ramadan to you as well um I have two questions sir yes uh can we ask to pray for non-muslims and another question is if we will read the Quran for the dead people it will reach the it will reach them okay you when you say that uh uh making Dua for non-muslims in what sense forgiveness and mercy and Jenna um this one for uh for anybody will be sick okay suffering from anything so for my friends non-muslims so can I ask them uh please pray for me generally we used to ask the people oh kafir praying for you yeah yeah this okay okay I will I will inshah answer your question only one more question sir yes um and uh is it allowed in Islam to get the Dy from woman okay I will answer inshallah Nadia from Saudi hello Alum she I have a question that like in this program you told that fasting if the traveling is not hard it's recommended to fast so does it rule on the prayers also that if we are traveling and the traveling is uh not on the way but if we reach for example to the other city in our relatives home and we stay there for one day so is it uh uh recommended to uh pray the full prayer or we must shorten it okay that's a very good question I will answer you inshallah okay thank you very much you're welcome so we will answer whatever we can uh Amin from Nigeria says that what's the ruling if people go to bed and when they wake up after fjer someone tells them that whoa the people cited the Moon last night so today is the first of Ramadan is there fasting correct if they went to bed unaware that there is a possibility of tomorrow being Ramadan their fasting is not valid but if they go to bed and saying W it's too late we don't know whether they're going to site the moon or not if they site the Moon tonight and I wake up tomorrow then I will consider this to be uh uh from my Ramadan then their fasting is valid as it is the most authentic opinion of Scholars and this is the opinion ofam t uh jco from Gambia J how are you doing yes jamu listen to me from the phone please mute your television yes how are youkam I have this question to in a journey regarding what when traveling when traveling okay what's your question uh when you are alone I understand when you are alone you Canen your prayer but when you're in congregation will you be able prayer okay so you're asking about the shortening praying in congregation yes I will answer you insh Allah thank you very much Iman from Saudi and maybe this is the last last question before we answer inshallah yes amen yes so my question was that if we don't pray five times daily then will we stay in Islam or not how many do you pray a day uh like I miss one to uh uh prayers every day like fer I'll miss okay I will answer you inshallah okay thank you you're welcome so uh a me from Nigeria says that if someone has property does he have to give part of that property for zakat or he uh uh is sufficient to give cash no you must give cash first of all uh on on cash on gold on silver on property on things displayed for selling you have to give cash but the issue is not here now if you have property and it's not for sale you're keeping it for the future for your children you're keeping it to build a house on it you're keeping it because you're leasing it or renting it in this case there is no zakat on it Ahmed from Saab says that Haram is completely full house so isn't it that the whole of mecah considered to be Haram meaning if I pray in a Masid in or I pray in a Masid inali for example would this be considered 100,000 times better than any other place the answer is that there is a difference of opinion among Scholars some Scholars say that it is s such as abaz and and other Scholars and some say no it isn't because in Muslim the prophet indicated that it is the Masid of this is where the multiplication take place so this is the most authentic opinion that only in the Masjid of of Al Haram where you get this uh reward inshallah om IM she's saying that when she travels to her parents in Riyad she's from jeda and when she travels to her parents in Riyad and stays there for a month or so so is she obliged to uh complete the answer is no because she's not residing is visiting so she may shorten her prayers until she feels that she's settled then she can continue in Pakistan India and elsewhere they those who are the offsprings of the Prophet Alam the sons of Al Hassan Hussein they call themselves a s or a Sharif and they say that we are not allowed to take zakat yes this is correct they are not allowed to take the zakat because it's the filth of uh uh the wealth of the people however Scholars say that if they are poor and they don't have their share that Allah has given them in the treasury of the Muslims in Baal Mal then it would be only logical that they would be permitted to take from zakat it is the best scenario to be given zakat from another s but if this is not applicable then they can take zakat if they are poor Sarah from South Africa she says that a pregnant woman does she yes she does unless she she is fearful for her safety her own safety or the safety of her uh uh pregnancy in this case she is Exempted and she may skip fasting AA says what's the ruling on making up for M days of Ramadan on a Saturday nothing at all there is no problem and we will get to this inshallah later on even if a Saturday coincides witha and you fast only one day which is a Saturday no problem in the at all can we she says fast the six days of sha make up the M days of Ramadan in shaad and consider this to be uh uh two birds with one stone the answer is no the prophet said whoever fasts the month of Ramadan the whole of it then follows that with six days of shaah a woman who fasted 20 days and she has 10 days missed and she makes up for these 10 days during the month of shaal and says Ah four days are for Ramadan six days are for Ramadan but at the same time for the Sha so that I can get the reward this is uh not permissible um AA says that when we cut when we cook and we slice onions and and and garlic and something that has a very heavy smell and we feel the taste in our throats this is nothing this is just a smell you did not actually eat the stuff stuff it did not go to your stomach finding the taste does not mean anything at all from Saudi she says what's the ruling on me going to a cafir a non-muslim and ask him to pray for me this is not permissible we know that their prayers are not accepted and they are not Muslims how dare you go and ask them to pray for you and they will pray for their false gods that they are worshiping no this is not permissible for us to pray for them this is permissible and worldly matters so if I say may Allah guide you to an un Muslim this is okay if he's sick may Allah cure your illness may Allah uh uh cure your sick child this is okay but I may not say may Allah forgive your sins may Allah have mercy on you may Allah enter you uh uh to Jenna this is not permissible uh we can take calls now because I'm almost done what's the ruling on reciting Quran and giving it to the debt the reward the answer is this is is an innovation so many people died at the time of the Prophet never ever once he told us to recite the Quran and give them the reward he allowed us for Hajj he allowed us for om he allowed us for uh uh supplicating and invoking Allah for them but never ever the prophet Alat wasam allowed us to recite the Quran and to give it for uh the deceased she her third question was what's the ruling on women giving dowy to men and this is happens only I believe in India and wow that's that's cool getting married and getting paid for that wow this is totally prohibited in Islam a real man does not accept such a thing if there are real men because it is totally prohibited for a woman to support or to provide or to give let alone for a man to demand and I've heard so many awful stories of men wanting to get married and they demand that the Father of the Bride he says listen I need a Corolla 2014 and uh preferably uh air conditioned and with automatic gear I need this big uh um refrigerator I need this I need that in the house and he gives a list of his requests and if they don't do this he turns his back and go this is not permissible at all from Saudi I have a question since I live in Canada um sometimes you say it's prohibited to mix around with people of different faiths but how do we um I mean we see them they work with us we have Christians we have Hindus we have all sects working together and we see them on a daily basis and like my children have friends also and we tell them not to bring them to our house but sometimes I feel bad Islam is a very um I think lovable religion and I our Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam even I remember reading some Hades he would always greet non-muslims and okay I I got your question M I will answer you inshallah thank you very much you're quite welcome uh Nadia says uh if fasting is permissible while traveling because you can do that so can we use the same uh analogy and say that I can pray four rakas instead of two that's a very good question but in the issue of fasting we have our role model fasting and recommending and giving the permission but in shortening prayers the prophet had never done this so it is advis advisable for you not to do this and to continue to uh uh shorten your prayers muham Mahmud from oranda my question is yes mm I called my brother musim then I told him Ramadan okay he said I shouldn't say that so I want to know am I correct I will answer your question inshallah thank you jco from Gambia says that if I'm traveling and I shorten prayer but I go into a Masjid and the Imam is completing what should I do you must follow the Imam so if you're a traveler you should pray two raat but if you're praying behind the residing person who completes then you have to pray four raas even if you pray only with him the last last fourth raak he offers Salam you cannot go up and pray your second raak and conclude it no you have to complete three and that is why even Abbas may Allah be pleased with him was asked why does a traveler when praying behind a residing person completes he said that this is the Sunnah my nephew this is the Sunnah so this is what you must do Iman from Saudi Arabia she says that what's the ruling on a person who does not pray five times a day regularly and she says that she skips F sometimes you are in great danger you are uh uh in a great danger and you're committing a major sin and there is a big possibility that you are a hypocrite because the Hypocrites were described in the Quran that whenever they go to prayer they go in laziness but they pray the five daily prayers they pray in the Masjid but they are lazy when they do so you are skipping a prayer that's a very very big and major sin some Scholars said that if someone intentionally misses a prayer until the following prayer is due he becomes a cfer he nullifies his Islam but this is not the most authentic opinion the most authentic opinion that you are a Muslim that you are extremely sinful and you are in great danger so imagine that if you die in the interval where you did not pray that particular prayer and you'll meet Allah Asel not as a worshipper not as a person who used to observe his prayer but rather than a person who skipped praying so this is a uh a serious thing that you should be careful of Mali from Saudi she says what's the ruling on uh um giving Salam to kufar because she lives in Canada and she says that this is uh um not the Toler to an Islam that we know and a lot of things well first of all the issue of tolerant Islam is not as we think of it in the sense that it is not tailor made so for example if I go to Spain I'm I've Been to Spain a couple of times and the Customs there is when you meet someone that you kiss them on the cheek so if a woman comes to me and says oh she I love your shows and she wants to kiss me on the cheek and say hm it I have to be tolerant what what what do you want me to do Islam is a religion of Tolerance no we have boundaries we have rules and regulations to be followed it is not just a vague word that Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance and everything comes a a smooth afterwards no we have to follow the Quran and the Sunnah and being in Canada or in the states or in Europe doesn't mean that you have to be rude or aggressive or offensive for how do we treat non-muslims Say howdy hello good morning what's happening but never sayam alayum because you cannot say peace be upon you except to a Muslim and even if a non-muslim comes and says to youum you sayum but don't complete it because this is the Sunnah some Scholars may say that yes if they said it clearly then you may sayum I personally feel that does the job and this is the norm that the prophet used to say sallallahu alai wasam so you can greet them by saying good morning uh good evening good day whatever mm and this is our last question from aanda he says Ramadan Kim and someone said to him that you should not say that and if you've noticed a lot of the callers say Ramadan Kim and I return and say to them Ramadan Mubarak mean is the one who said that Ramadan Kim is not appropriate because Kim means generous so Ramadan is not generous by itself the generosity comes from Allah Ramadan is blessed because Allah has blessed it due to all the good deeds in it in a sense this is logical but again to say Ramadan Kim in the sense that in this month Allah's generosity is displayed by lots of Good Deeds by ter by fasting by Charities by so it's not the month itself that is giving but rather that we are giving and Allah is making it easy for us to give uh to give due to to due to the manifestation of Allah's uh generosity then this would probably be acceptable and Allah knows best this is all the time we have until we meet next time the felt this day is all right as the first start we here tonight with family around a nice meal we're making do I night feel how nice it is to be so near to those I love whenever we think of Ramadan all the good things that we need to do and plan it's not always easy but we'll do the best we can"
