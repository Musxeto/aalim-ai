  "transcript": "Ubayy from Tunisia Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Is it sunnah to wear a watch on the right hand? Jazakallahu Khair Well first of all we have to acknowledge that at the time of the Prophet ﷺ they had no watches So when we say is it sunnah that would be a bit controversial As for wearing your watch in your right or on your left this is up to your preference Some say that we like to wear it on the right because of the hadith of Mother Aisha may Allah be pleased with her Where she says that the Prophet ﷺ used to love to begin with his right side Whenever he was combing his hair or putting on clothes or performing wudu and the likes So whenever something is of honor the Prophet ﷺ used to love giving precedence to the right side, to the right hand And if someone says no I'm going to wear it on my left because it's more convenient I use my left less than the right so my chances of hitting objects is less and my watch would be intact Besides 95% of the population of earth wear it on the left hand side That's fine it's up to your preference there is no sunnah in it and Allah knows best"
