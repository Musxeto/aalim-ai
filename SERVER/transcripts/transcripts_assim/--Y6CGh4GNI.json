  "transcript": "bilal's uh question is what's the ruling on applying perfume to the deceased this is a highly recommended sunnah from the prophet whether it's a male or a female the deceased is to be perfumed and some say that you apply the perfume on the places of sujud so on the forehead on the nose on the hands knees and on the feet so that whenever the funeral passes by people they would not find a foul smell out of it because sometimes the deceased keep on discharging feces or after cleansing and washing his body or her body things may come out and odor may come out so in order to avoid this we put and apply it on the body of the disease and also on the shrouds the three pieces or five pieces depending uh on how the disease is is shrouded and we apply perfume to that so this is a highly recommended sunnah may allah perfume our days while we are still on this earth and perfume our days when we are underneath this earth and with this we come to the conclusion of today's or tonight's"
