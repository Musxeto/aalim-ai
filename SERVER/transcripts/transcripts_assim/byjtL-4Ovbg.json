  "transcript": "a sister says i have a passion to buy branded stuff alhamdulillah i have enough money to buy them is there anything wrong in this as long as it's not extravagance there's nothing wrong in that so people like to buy prada or louis vuitton if you have the money and there is no extravagance a handbag costing three thousand dollars come on give me a break what are you gonna carry in it a wallet with 150 dollars only so it doesn't make any sense why because it's a brand name and it's for showing off this is extravagance but if you want to buy something that has a value and has a benefit to you and it's a brand name within reason among the people yes this is permissible and there's nothing wrong in branded uh items"
