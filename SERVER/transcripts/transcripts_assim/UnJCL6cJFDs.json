  "title": "Salatul Tawbah for each sin or once for all sins",
  "transcript": "my question is and also there are many things that I did which I'm not happy of and I'm remorseful for it so I want to uh I know that when Salat October which is of tour and can I do it like for example today night uh the third last of the night like puraka for kissing my first year and also to rapper for something else and do that for something and so on like that or do I have to wait another day to do the other two workouts first of all when a person sins it is recommended for them to pray to raka asking Allah for repentance normal turakas nothing special to be said not a special format to be offered just random to rakaz with the intention of seeking Allah's forgiveness and repenting do I have to offer these two rakas for every single sin the answer is no so if you had committed many sins and now you want to repent from them all these two rakas suffice for all of your previous sins you don't have to go into specifying everything with a specific prayer for repentance and I hope this answers your question inshallah"
