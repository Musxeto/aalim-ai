  "transcript": "salanio him hamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa ABD here or Azula he nabina muhammad alayhi wa sahbihi ajma'in the prophet salallahu alayhi wasalam said o people seek Allah's forgiveness and repent to him for I seek Allah's forgiveness and repent to him more than a hundred times a day even Omar may Allah be pleased with him and with his father said we used to count the prophet alayhi salatu salam repeating seeking Allah's forgiveness in one setting more than 70 times now if the Prophet Allah saw serums previous and upcoming sins were already forgiven why does he do this first of all to show his gratitude to Allah second of all for us to follow suit asking Allah for forgiveness he's one of the great deeds that opens closed doors beyond our wildest imagination allah azza wajal tells us in surah noor that prophet noah sallallahu alayhi wasallam is addressing his people by saying for all to stall of yoruba KO in the hookah Nava Farah and I said to them seek Allah's forgiveness because Allah is most forgiving so one of Allah's beautiful names that he is a father that he is a fool that he is fear Allah forgives the sins but the beautiful thing is that when you seek Allah's forgiveness listen what happens afterwards profit nor said peace be upon him you're silly seminar a commoner ARA allah would send rain over you where the earth would grow its crops and life would be everywhere around you your silly sama alaykum Madera William did come be my R in woburn in allah azza wajal would grant you wealth would grant you offspring would grant you gardens without end and rivers overflowing and all of this as a result of seeking Allah's forgiveness we're not talking about what Allah has prepared for those who seek his forgiveness in the Hereafter this goes beyond our imagination we're talking about worldly matters when a servant of Allah expresses his submissiveness his need his humility to Allah and asks for forgiveness this means that he acknowledges that Allah forgives the sins Allah the Almighty says in the hadith of when the Prophet tells us when a servant of Allah sins and says o Allah I have sinned and no one forgives the sins except you oh Allah forgive me Allah Jojo says my servant had sinned and he acknowledged that I only forgive the sins and he's seeking my forgiveness I forgive him allah azzawajal descends to the lowest heaven every single night and he addresses his servants is there anyone seeking my forgiveness so that I would forgive him Allah encourages us to seek his forgiveness and therefore each and every Muslim must keep this as a daily reminder that he always asks Allah for forgiveness and that he always repents to Allah the all-mighty assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
