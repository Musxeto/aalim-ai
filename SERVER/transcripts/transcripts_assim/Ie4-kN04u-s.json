  "transcript": "Sana' from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu So, I have made certain promises to Allah in the past, committing to abstain from a particular action no matter what. However, I ended up doing that action later on. Does this fall under the category of breaking an khasam or oath in Islam? And should the kafara for this be the same like the oath or not? How did you do the oath? For example, I was saying like, Ya Allah, I promise with you that I will not do this action no matter what. A promise? You just break a promise. You did not take the name of Allah Azza Wa Jal and said, Wallahi, I will not do this. Oh Allah, I will not do this by taking Allah's name. So, it's an issue of dispute whether saying, I promise you I won't do this is considered an oath or not. Most likely to me, I would be on the safe side and expiate it just to be on the safe side. But technically speaking, I don't believe that this is an oath. Nevertheless, if you go through the ayahs of Surah At-Tawbah, for example, Chapter 9, وَمِنْهُمَّنْ عَاهَدَ اللَّهَ لَئِنْ أَتَانَ مِنْ فَضْلِهِ لَنَا الصَّدَّقَنَ Those who promise Allah Azza Wa Jal that if He were to grace us with His favours and give us money, we would give charity. But they broke that and Allah Azza Wa Jal sealed their hearts with hypocrisy. This is frightening. Nevertheless, if you did not take the name of Allah and said, Wallahi, or I swear that I will not do this sin again. It seems to me that this is not an oath that needs expiation. But as I said, better safe than sorry and Allah knows best."
