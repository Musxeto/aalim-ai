  "transcript": "[Music] foreign [Music] [Music] and welcome to this new uh segment i think it's number eight class number eight pertaining to the islamic faith and last time we stopped at what the sheikh said and let me one second please the sheikh said that no one is considered a disbeliever or a believer no one is considered to is to be considered an unbeliever except those whom allah and his messenger pronounced as such for example and he started giving examples to that but before we go to these examples we need to know that the vast majority of scholars they segregate or they classify different types of things that nullify islam so they say that kufr is divided into types major and minor and we spoke about that earlier and we said that hypocrisy cover and shirk they all have major and minor sides to them the major takes a person out of the fold of islam no intercession can't can help and the major can be through conviction can be through what you say can be how you act it can be through different ways so we will speak today as a holistic way of looking into the classifications of cover that the scholars had made then inshallah later on we will go to the book of the sheikh the islamic faith because he broke these five into many different categories so that people would understand and relate to so what are the five main categories of kuffer number one kuffur of disbelief and this is to disbelieve whatever the messengers came with whether internally or externally so hypocrisy can be part of it because they disbelief internally but externally can also be disbelief or can be what is known as juhood to pretend not to believe but actually inside you believe and this is found in allah in the in the book of allah in many places where you find people say that what the prophet brought is a lie resurrection is a lie there is no day of judgment there are no angels there are no jinn there is no torment of the grave there is no seraph there is no hell in heaven there is no resurrection because once we die that's it it's over so all of this is part of the coffer of disbelief and there are other categories of it but we will take it as it is allah says in the quran and who does more wrong than those who fabricate lies against allah or reject the truth after it has reached them is hell not a fitting home for the disbelievers so this is obvious that their disbelief is the cause for them to go to hell for eternity and there is another type which is to be in denial but this is what appears on the individual that he's a kafir this is this believer inside he's a believer but he doesn't want to show it and this is mentioned in the quran that don't let it sadden you oh muhammad ali for they do not say that you're a liar but they deny the verses of allah azzawajal meaning they believe in it but they deny it externally and how they show it to the people and this doesn't matter whether a person disbelieved in everything that the prophet came with like the jews and christians they say that no muhammad is not a messenger his religion is a false religion this is an entire disbelief but it also can be something that is limited so is a muslim says yeah i believe in allah in the quran in islam but i don't believe in toxicants is haram so this partial disbelief takes a person out of the fold of islam as well the vast majority of people disbelieve in allah azzawajal one way or the other but this does not mean that this is the only thing that takes them out of the fold of islam or prevents them from accepting islam they may have other types as well such as type number two arrogance this belief of arrogance and rejection and this is defined as to believe the truth but reject and refuse to submit due to stubbornness due to arrogance so here we don't have disbelief but we have rejection and pride that prevents a person from prostrating to allah for example he knows that islam is right prayer is mandatory but he says i will not prostrate this is unmanly for example and this is exactly what happened to satan satan was elevated to the level of the angels though he was from the jinn and he was allowed to witness with them what they had witnessed but when allah azzawajal told him to prostrate to adam he refused did he not believe in allah of course not he believed in allah he believed in everything and his knowledge was supreme in a lot and and it was a lot of knowledge that he possessed but it wasn't the knowledge that benefits a person the real knowledge is feeding allah and submitting your will to allah it is not memorizing books and reading encyclopedias knowledge in islam is not having a phd or a degree knowledge in islam is not memorizing the quran in the term or the books of of sunnah which is a good thing but it is not the real knowledge the real knowledge is to fear allah the almighty and to submit your will to him alone only those among the scholars who truly fear allah azza the real scholars are those who fear allah so what happened to shaytan what happened to iblees allah says in the quran and mention when we said to the angels prostrate before adam so they prostrated except for iblis satan he refused and was arrogant so this is the type of disbelief of satan he refused and was arrogant and became of the disbelievers so his cover is not in disbelief rather in arrogance and the refusal to submit likewise scholars say that the uncle of the prophet his kuffar was part of this arrogance and stubbornness because he clearly stated in his poetry that i believe that muhammad ali is a messenger of allah and that he is saying the truth and that this and he said everything was legit yet he could not submit his will to allah on his dying bed when the prophet continued to ask him my uncle say this one word that allows me to intercede for you on the day of judgment and he looked at abu jahl and he looked at the people of quraysh and he said no i can't do that and he died believing in the religion of abdul muttalib which is idol worshiping religion so this is number two which is pride arrogance and stubbornness the third part of the types of kuffer is the kuffer or the disbelief of doubt hesitation uncertainty that the messengers were telling the truth and this is this doubt this goes against being certain and being convinced you remember if you attended the three fundamental principles course that the course is about the questions of the angels to you when you are in their grave so the hypocrite would be asked and the disbeliever who is your lord what is your religion and who's this man who was sent to you those who do not know or those who are doomed to hell fire say ha ha i don't know i heard people saying i said what they say so they did not have the certainty they did not have the firmness in their belief and hence allah does not accept this allah says in the quran in surat and he entered his garden while he was unjust to himself he said i do not think that this will perish ever and i do not think the hour will occur and even if i should be brought back to my lord i'll surely find better than this as a return so all of this is uncertain to him his companion said to him while he was con versing with him have you disbelieved in he who created you from dust and then from sperm drop and then uh proportioned you as a man have you disbelieved this hesitation is a disbelief now i know this might be shocking to most of you because most likely a lot of you would say i have this hesitation i have this in in me don't confuse things you pray and you fast and you give charity you reject it when you are invited to haram and you refuse to contribute or participate why because you are a believer and this belief of yours is what's preventing you from falling into kuffar the random thoughts that people get these are from shaytan as long as you do not act upon them as long as you do not speak about them then they have no impact on your iman unlike those who sit and say i don't know the jews might be right they have a point in their religion even the christians maybe jesus is the son of god i don't know now this is blasphemous talking about such a thing having a conviction that i i don't believe the day of their resurrection it's too difficult how can that be someone believing that the quran is not 100 percent preserved or that the religion is not preserved he doubts the rulings of islam he has hesitation about our prophet muhammad or he thinks evil things about him and he's convinced that this might be true might be not such hesitation takes a person out of the fold of islam because trinity is a must in islam those who are uncertain on in their graves when they're asked about their religion about their lord about their messenger they won't be able to answer because they'll be able to answer only what they had believed in this life and this is truly scary but you have to amend things before it is too late by learning your religion and fixing your beliefs submitting your will to allah azza number four it is the disbelief of i wouldn't say rejection i would say turning your back to it the disbelief of negligence and this we mean by it that you totally neglect and turn your back to islam not partially so you don't want to listen to it you don't want to see anything you don't want to contemplate upon anything related to islam allah says in the quran but those who disbelieve from that of which they are warned are turning away so anyone who turns away from the truth due to wanting not to listen or to hear or to watch or to understand and not part partially but rather holistically doesn't want to do anything with islam this is a kafir now if i were a muslim who prays fast doesn't do anything that nullifies islam but i don't want to learn about islam meaning that come attend sheikh asam's classes i don't want to i don't i hate this guy this guy is so pushy and i don't want to do this i pray i read the quran but i don't want to learn is this part of the disbelief the answer is no this is not disbelief this is simply not wanting to increase in good deeds and hence a person is not going to be blamed for that yeah he might lose some reward but he's not going to be blamed on the day of judgment because he did not turn his back to islam holistically but those atheists for example when you come and give them da'wah and they said not interested this is kufur of neglect those grave worshipers when you come and show them the verses from the quran and the authentic hadith that states that they're committing shirk and disbelieving in allah azzawajal and they said they give you their back it is like what the people of noor did when he gave them dawah and they inserted their fingers and their ears and allah told us about this this is something similar to it and this is what we do not want the muslims to fall into never neglect or turn your back to quran and sunnah some people when they are engaged in conversation and you're arguing or debating or whatever and you say allah the almighty says he said oh ho [Music] this gesture by itself can nullify your your islam because it exemplifies your ignorance and how you're turning away from allah's words instead of saying we hear and we adhere rather you make fun of it this is problematic and the last and final [Music] fifth category of the types of kuffar is the kuffer of hypocrisy and this is showing iman and at the same time expressing or or intending and disbelief and we spoke about that so we will not insha allah uh have to repeat it again so we would like to go and investigate the types that the sheikh had mentioned in his book so in the beginning he says no one is to be considered a disbeliever except those whom allah and his messenger allah pronounce as such is that okay of course so now when you get these whispers sheikh i have these intrusive thoughts i'm a kafir so i say every five minutes to enter islam and i get these thoughts that are destroying my life we say to him no one is rendered labeled as a kafir except whom allah and the prophet tells us about tell us about them that they are disbelievers and the golden rule for all those who suffer from osd from for all those who suffer from ocd obsessive-compulsive disorder the golden rule is certainty is not affected by doubt what is certain here you are muslim what is the doubt have i exited the fold of islam or not so this doubt has no impact on what is certain which is your islam unless proven otherwise so we go and we look at the examples that the sheikh has given number one a person who denies allah or his messenger this is crystal clear anyone who says that allah is not telling us the truth or the prophet has lied or this is not true immediately by default you don't have to even consider anything else this is a blatant disbelief and the face value of it is this belief now in order to prove that it is not disbelief this person has to come up with real legitimate excuses such as i don't know the language i was just talking what i've heard i didn't know that it meant this i had a rage fit i was temporarily insane yeah maybe but other than that no this is total disbelief number two a person who ridicules either allah or his messenger so making fun of or of anything related to the quran or to the sunni or to the religion anything that indicates mockery making fun humiliating ridiculing all of these are immediately acts of kufur allah says in the quran should you question them they will say we have only been indulging in idol talk and jesting say to them was it then at allah his revelations and his messenger that you have been mocking make no excuse you have disbelieved after you have professed to be believers though we may pardon some of you we shall punish others on account of their being guilty surah chapter 9 the surah that deals with the hypocrites that expose them to the public by describing them like that the origin of this and why it was revealed that on the battle of tabuk it was a long journey it was summertime so three were sitting after risha and they were chit-chatting so one of them said to the other and they're all chit-chatting in a group we have never seen anyone like the companions of the prophet israel quote unquote those known as to be the reciters of the quran they memorize the quran we've never seen like them they have big bellies and they lie a lot and they are cowards when it comes to fighting now this is outrageous throughout time muslim communities had a segment of people who would find joy in ridiculing practicing muslims and some claim that we are self-criticizing i think in the west america europe they have tv dramas that are supposed to be comic or uh comedian where they talk about islam from the point view of muslims as if they are muslims and they make fun of hijab they make fun of our rituals our beliefs everything and unfortunately some muslims may watch it and laugh thinking that this is fun not knowing that they're falling under this category of verses of the quran verse 65 and 66 in surat tawba wala in so as these people were making fun of the companions as if they are just chit chatting and by the way even here in my country the land of islam we find people making fun of us so they say things that are irresponsible just to make people laugh not knowing that this angers allah and may take them out of the fold of islam so again they were making fun of the companions that they have big bellies meaning that they love food and that they lie whatever comes out of their mouth is cheap talk and that they are cowards when it's fighting time they run away at war and all of these are lies one of the companions heard them but he was young so he swore by allah to tell the prophet hassam and the moment he reached the prophet salaam revelation has already reached him so allah told him and these ayahs were revealed to expose these three and to to announce them as hypocrites and disbelievers they tried to apologize and one of them came to the prophet and tried to justify and he said oh prophet of allah we were just playing around we were fooling around and the prophet would only repeat the verses of the verse of the quran you say was it then at allah his revelations and his messenger that you have been mocking make no excuse you have disbelieved now this ayah and this kind or type of kufur unfortunately is widely spread among the muslims you may get extremely offensive jokes on whatsapp and people just delete it no harm done and a lot of harm was done if you go back and study the hadith the men did not mention allah nor the revelations nor the messenger they were making fun of the companions but due to the fact that making fun of the companions is actually making fun of allah and their revelations and the prophet that was made an act of apostasy and kufr and it is important that we point out for those who always ask am i a kafir or not there is a difference between mocking the religion and mocking the individual these three were mocking the religion that the companions were following while if someone comes and makes mockery out of me and says awesome your beard is so long it reminds me of a disney character such a person is either mocking me personally for how ugly i look or he's mocking the belief that made me look the way i look if it was the latter then this is an act of apostasy making fun of hijabi woman or nikabi woman in general means that he's not mocking an individual rather he's mocking a ritual but when someone mocks me as awesome for having a long beard and he doesn't say anything else about other people's beards this is a major sin because he's mocking me but he's not doing this to mock islam he's mocking me as individual how i look how i act or behave and this is not blasphemy so it is extremely important because i get wallahi i get tens of questions every day you know that i answered on my website only 150 questions per day i wouldn't be exaggerating if i say like 10 to fifteen percent of these questions sheikh somebody said so and so and i smiled am i a kafir why would smiling be a kufr he said because this is acting upon an intrusive thought yeah but what the man said was not cover it was a general remark a figure of speech i hope this doesn't turn into the flooding of news for one of the questions said in the garden there was water and the man was joking i hope this doesn't turn into the flood of luh said i smiled and then i thought of praying tawba and saying allah and having also and renew my wife's contract whoa whoa hold your horses what are you doing these thoughts are killing me because you're allowing them to do so when you learn your religion and you know that this was not an act of kufa and smiling was not an act of kuffar you then can stop such intrusive thoughts with the grace of allah as a virgin so i think we may stop here or we may take the third one uh we would take a third uh example a person who in all arrogance refuses to submit to allah and to his messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam so this is cover of submission refuse of of stubbornness of rejection he doesn't want to submit his will to allah and here we have to also clarify few things such as there is a difference between sinning and being stubborn and rejecting the whole thing so i know drinking intoxicants is hara i know wine is haram i believe in that but i'm so weak and i fall into this sin while admitting it am i considered to be a kafir the answer is not definitely not i'm a sinful person this is different than someone who is stubborn who insists on something that might be vital or fatal even and i'll give you an example few years ago i was blessed and honored to go on a friendly debate in green lane massachusetts with dr bilal phillips dr abu amina and the topic was is abandoning salat kuffar or not so he adopted the opinion that is not kufur i adopted the opinion that it was kufur and it was a beautiful exchange of knowledge on the public any uh uh upon the public with the public whatever so the final ruling on this because there are hadiths that state that whoever abandons salat is a kafir and we have different evidences that to enter islam you say so how would that be and what to do the most authentic opinion and i explained that there and i always explain that theoretically whoever abandons elijah kafir footstop according to the verses of the quran to the sunnah this is theoretically practically when we come to wanting to label a specific individual this is not as easy as theoretically because we have to fulfill the conditions and we have to ensure that there are no obstacles so as long as the person was considered to be a muslim and he was not interrogated by the muslim ruler or a judge he never openly confessed that he doesn't believe in the obligation of salat and that is a pillar of islam etc then he's almost until proven otherwise where does this bring us when we come to uh the topic of a person who is or who in all arrogance refuses to submit to allah and his messenger i'll give you an example someone doesn't pray so we complain to the muslim judge and the muslim judge takes him in assigns a panel of judges to speak to him and to try to bring him back to islam they say to him pray this is what allah said about the mandate the obligation of prayer it's afar this is the hadith etc and he says yes i know i know i believe in all of this they said alhamdulillah okay let's pray he said no i'm not gonna pray but this is not logical you are in prison and you have three days on the third day if you still don't pray we're going to chop your head off we're going to execute you because you're a kafir he says no i say allah i believe in prayer i believe in the pillars of islam i believe in the quran but i'm not going to pray on the third day we bring the swordsman or the executioner and he has a sword in his hand and they prepare him to be headed are you willing to pray he says no i'm not gonna pray i believe in salah but no you're not gonna force me to pray we chop his head off we kill this this person we execute him not we the muslim ruler and the judges because he has committed the cover of stubbornness a person who in all arrogance refuses to submit to allah and his messenger this person deserves what he gets because he did not comply with the submission to allah azza he's being told we're going to kill you he says no out of stubbornness then this person dies as a disbeliever he's not washed shrouded he's not preyed upon and he's thrown in one of the empty places in the desert and buried his inheritance cannot he his wealth cannot be divided by his heirs because he's a kafir so this is the type of ignorance or the type of stubbornness or the type of things that nullify islam and allah azzawajal knows best so we have a few minutes to take some of your questions and aamir says what is the concept of wala well the prophet said alaihis was said in an authentic hadith the tightest or the strongest knots of islam so islam is made of knots and not after a knot the strongest knot of islam is to love for the sake of allah and to hate for the sake of allah and to have allies for the sake of allah and to have any needs for the sake of allah is to have allegiance and barack is to announce your enmity and separation and division from others and every muslim has to have this his wallet his allegiance is to those who are muslims and righteous whether they're from his country of or from an adjacent country whether they are near or far whether they're black or white whether they are arabs or non-arabs my allegiance is not to my countrymen if they're not practicing muslims no my allegiance is to the muslims wherever they are who are righteous and practicing this goes against being patriotic some say or being a nationalist who cares what value is being a nationalist or patriotic when the people you're aligning with are enemies of islam or opposing islam or opposing other muslims would you join hands with them definitely not muslims join hands with muslims who are righteous and practicing according to the quran to announce your disallegiance your abandonment from those who go against islam so even if there is a countryman of mine same nationalities same language same uh country or town or tribe but he's someone who's evil someone who is sinful who sins openly my responsibility as a muslim is to denounce that and to announce to the people that have nothing to do with that individual while someone from bangladesh from the rohingya from china from indonesia from somalia who is righteous practicing memorizing the quran praying on time avoids haram he is my true real brother and i would join hands with him against that of my country this is because unfortunately this beautiful concept has been diluted and so many muslims unfortunately even some practicing muslims would give priority to their countrymen to their own country to their nationality over islam and this is a very dangerous concept and wrong concept indeed and allah azza knows best general says how about if we help non-muslims friend but his reason is his daughter is sick and he said he will pay back but i don't agree with him paying me back because my purpose is to help for his daughter is it permissible to answer is yes giving charity for non-muslims is permissible there's no doubt so if you have a non-muslim neighbor and he needs money for an operation for anything that is important he's poor or needy no problem in helping him the prophet said ali saw some about a man who went down a well to fill his shoe with water and put the water in his mouth and climbed up to give that water to a dog that was thirsty the prophet said assalam allah was grateful for that man and he forgave his sins and the companion said whoa o prophet of allah if we do good to animals we are rewarded the prophet said in every moist liver meaning a living creature there is salah so if we are given charity when we're kind to animals what do you think when you are kind to human beings who are disbelievers definitely you'll be rewarded however we always say that a carpenter can't fix people's doors when his own door is broken so you shouldn't logically feed your neighbors when your own son is starving or when your own brother is struggling you should begin with those closest to you and likewise we say we should begin with the muslims first but again janeir there is no problem none whatsoever in giving your neighbor money if he's in need this is from jannah or and among the deviant 72 sects in our subcontinent most of the people believe in ashari or maturity creed what our stand should be about them this is a long topic see when we say that this has two meanings either it means sunnis versus shia and by this definition more all those sufis etc they were all considered to be alison al-jamal because they're not shia but if we mean by arasunna those who have the same creed of the prophet ali the companions the tabernin and the tabi tabiri the favorite three generations in this case the maturity and the ashari are definitely not part of allah because the late ashari's who are contemporary now see the origin of ashariyah is from abu hassan al-ashari who was a martezili for 40 years then followed the opinions of allah abdullah and then some scholars say that he repented and rejected all of his previous innovations and bad creeds as he had written in his book ibana and he announced that he's going back to the arpeda of alison and specifically the arpeda of imam others say that he repented true but he could not get rid of every small thing that was cleansing to him and attached to him so he still had some remains of ibn kelab in him now having said that the contemporary ashari's they are jabria and qatar in pre-destiny they have their belief of jabra and in iman they have the akhida of and in the allah's attributes they have a tatril and they clearly say that we do not approve of any of allah's beautiful attributes except seven so they deny that allah is upon his throne they deny that allah is above his creation and they say things that are baseless when they say that allah is not above he's not uh in this world he's not out of this world and many other things which clearly state that they are not from jamaa per se now having said that we have to make it clear that not everyone who says something of what the ashari say is considered to be a full-fledged ashari because sometimes you may find a scholar like even hajar or a newey who may say something that was said by the ashari's but they don't adopt all of their opinions not even the majority of their opinions but this was a single error or a mistake we do not take such great scholars out of jamaa and this is what shaykh means clarified in his book when he said that just because even hajjar or anawi said something that might coincide with what the ashar is saying this doesn't make them a charis similarly if we were hamburies and we adopted one of the views of imam shafiri would that make us chat is definitely not so i hope this answers your question says i feel i may have committed shirk or kufor should i do russell to enter islam newly well if you today's lesson i hope you have learned to answer just to reiterate your islam is certain and the feeling that you've committed chico for is doubtful so doubt has no impact on certainty so you must not commit or you're not performed you must not perform russell nor enter islam newly because you're still a muslim sajid hassan says can we learn the quran from amitaridi or can a person marry one of them learning the quran from them is okay if just memorizing if they're going to go to tafsir definitely not stay away anyone who gives tafsir and he does not follow the methodology of sunnah or jamaa and of herself keep your distance away from them because no matter how articulate they are how beautiful they present their case you know that their hakida is corrupt and that this would infiltrate your defense system it will keep on into your mind and corrupt your head as well and there's nothing more important than apida so anyone who's doubtful in his akhida trying to do something in tafsir or nakhida you have to shelve them and get rid of their material marrying from them is the same thing now what is the difference between marrying from an ashari or a maturity or a martesili or a murji or they all have corruptaquida and the only thing that binds us is our akita claiming that allah is not above his throne where in the quran in the sunnah a blind man can see that and the prophet himself told us about that so how can you marry someone like that and why would you marry someone who would bring up your children i know a lot of arasuno jamaa my daughters my wife my in-laws when they teach the children at an early age of a year or so before they start to speak they play with the children and say where is allah and the child says this above allah is above us allah is in the height and this is the question that the prophet hasn't asked the slave girl where is allah she pointed up and she said in the height who am i she said you're the messenger of allah he said to her owner set her free she's a believer so this is part of your belief if you don't believe that allah is in the height you're not a muslim or at least you're not from allah for sure so why would you mind marry someone like that definitely that's bad news even if she was miss universe uh yusha muhammad says here in the subcontinent the hanafis think that allah does not have any hands or did not create the four things which hit with his hands and also other differences with saudi scholars well then it's not i hope i wish it was a difference with saudi scholars it's the difference with jamaa it's a difference with the favorite three generations of the companions and the tavern and tavern taberin so he goes on to say does it really matter i mean will none of their deeds be accepted because of their apida nobody said that nobody said that the murji or not the murjidim ashari's or the mataroodis mataridis will go to hell forever they're muslims but are they part of the saved sect or are they part of the 72 sects if they are believers of what the ashraes and matarinis believe today which we had just mentioned of being jabria gibriya in different aspects of the answer is yes they are part of the 72 without any doubt but not all the 72 will go to hell for eternity meaning that they did not void their islam they did not nullify their islam some of them have so are the baha'is the kadyanes [Music] part of the 72 sects some scholars say yes will they ever have a chance to go to jannah never because they've committed major kufur and exited the fall of islam but when we come to maturities ashari's even they're muslims it's up to allah the norm is to spend time to do their time in hell and then inevit eventually will be taken out and admitted to jannah maybe allah forgives him from the first instance without going to hell this is in allah's hands it's not in ours so we don't go and discuss these things says could you name some scholars who are still alive whom we can take from there are many scholars among them is sheikh uh i've been messing about there is and many many others so many of them you can't limit them to five or ten or they're not like what it used to be twenty or thirty years ago when we used to say sheikh bin bas bin as i mean there are many other scholars but they're not as holistic and full of knowledge from all sides and wisdom like the mashiach the freemasha even now you find some sheikh who is superb in one science or another but not in the whole nine yards like bin baz the rest may allah have mercy on them um katz says ya sheikh is depression a punishment from allah or is it a kafara or being a trial to the muslim who's been affected by this so we've answered this so many times before and said that we cannot tell whether this calamity is a punishment or a test to elevate your level in paradise either way you have no other choice but to be patient and to rectify whatever wrong things you are doing allah knows best says is it permissible to pray to allah against those who insult you yes this is permissible to pray to allah according to the grievance according to the insult according to the transgression you do not kill a mosquito with a cannon this is an overkill so someone slaps you on the face that's a transgression you don't say may allah execute all of your children and make your wife a widow and make all of your wealth down the drain for what this is haram this is transgression from your side but if someone wrongs you or insults you and you pray to allah azza that he deals with them in the same fashion that they dealt with you this is totally permissible mahboob says well we've gone through muhammad and finally muhammad na der khan says can i ask you what is the best dua there isn't any such thing as best dua the best of all do is but if you want something which will be useful at all time there isn't any such thing if you sin you ask allah for forgiveness this is the best and if you were blessed with with something you praise allah and thank him this is better than asking allah for forgiveness so each location a situation has its own specific thing and allah azzawajal knows best and with this we come to the end of today's class until we meet you next thursday was you"
