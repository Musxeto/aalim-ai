  "transcript": "um i asked you in the past that about um reciting silently inside if we should recite with some voice or without voice and you said we can um recite without voice is it only in the congregation or can also recite without voice alone you are entitled to recite silently without a voice providing you are moving your lips and tongue with the recitation whether you're praying as an imam in silent prayers or you are praying alone or you are a follower in congregation so if i were to recite the fatiha i would do this the following motion you will not hear a sound so there's nothing wrong with your television set this is silently or i can say where i can only hear that without annoying those next to me and allah azza knows best we you"
