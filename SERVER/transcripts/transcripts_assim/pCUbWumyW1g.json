  "transcript": "Al-Hajji from India Assalamu Alaikum Sir. Salam to Allah. Sir, yes, my neighbors they are Hindus and they were living in town and asked if I could. I didn't get your first statement. Your name is Hindu? My name is here, they are Hindus. Your neighbors? Your neighbors? Yes, they were living in town and they asked if I could water their plants for them and I've seen them worshipping these plants and they've told me that some of them are goddesses or something like that. So when they asked me to water their plants, I told them I cannot do it because I was afraid of helping in their sake. Is this right? Of course it's right. You have done the right thing. If they worship these plants and ask you to water it, this is like glorifying and venerating such plants for them and this is totally prohibited."
