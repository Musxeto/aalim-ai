  "title": "How many people are doing Hajj with sincerity advice",
  "transcript": "The Salaf used to say, so many riders and few \nare performing pilgrimage, so many of them   this year, a million, maybe a million point \nfive pilgrims will perform hajj, and we pray   to Allah that he accepts his their hajj but \nhow many of them are going with sincerity,   how many of them are fulfilling the conditions, \nthis is why when you look at pilgrimage as a   pillar of Islam, once in a lifetime you will \nfind that some forms of worship are physical   like fasting, like prayers, and some forms \nof worship are financial, like Zakat,   in charity, Hajj is both physical and financial, \nso you have to do this once in a lifetime,   so if you do it, do it with utmost \nsincerity only seek Allah's face by it,   and do your level not to brag and not \nto show off and not to boast about it."
