  "transcript": "Muhammad from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Walaikumussalam The Prophet ï·º said and I quote, Whoever catches up with a rakkah of Fajr prayer before the sun rises has khalaq with Fajr. And whoever catches up with a rakkah of Asr prayer before the sun sets has khalaq with Asr. End quote. Sheikh what I wanted to ask you today was, Would this same principle apply to other prayers? For example, if someone prays one rakkah of Dhuhr before the time for Dhuhr expires, or if someone manages to pray one rakkah of Maghrib before the time for Maghrib expires, or finally if someone prays one rakkah of Isha before the time for Isha expires, would each and any of these prayers count? Jazakallah Khairan. Wa Jazakum. The answer is yes. If you manage to pray one full unit, one full rakkah of a prayer before the time expires, then you have prayed the prayer on time. So if you manage to pray a full rakkah with one ruku' and two sujood and you stand up, this is a full-fledged rakkah, then your prayer has been offered at the time, even if the time expires when you are at the second rakkah. And this is cascaded to all five prayers. And Allah knows best."
