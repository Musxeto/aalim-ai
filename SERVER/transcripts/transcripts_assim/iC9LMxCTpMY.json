  "title": "🆕 Send Salam to the Prophet ﷺ in Congregation After Prayer? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Sheikh Odedi from the Netherlands? Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam Baba. Sheikh Odedi. Okay, how are you Sheikh Odedi? Alhamdulillah, I'm from Gambia, originally West Africa. Mashallah, Hayyakallahi, what can I do for you? Okay, Sheikh, I have three questions for you. I want to know the ruling of them. Okay. The first one is that a lot of places in our place, when they finish the prayer in the masjid, they will gather together and say they want to send salam to the Prophet. Allahumma salli ala Muhammad wa ala Muhammad and everyone have to do this together at once. As for your questions, before I answer them, Mother Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, as in Sahih Muslim and elsewhere, said that the Prophet salallahu alayhi wa alayhi wasalam clearly said, whoever innovates in our religion, what's not part of it, it is rejected, it is void, it is unaccepted. And this is one of the pillars of our religion that Islam revolves around. Number one, innama al-a'malu bi'nniyat, deeds are judged by intention. Number two, these deeds have to be in compliance to the sunnah of the Prophet alayhi salatu wasalam. So these are pillars of Islam, which means that when I judge something, it has to be in accordance to the parameters of the Quran and the sunnah, with the understanding of the three favourite generations of the Sahaba, Companions, Tabi'een and Tabi'ut Tabi'een. Otherwise, it's an innovation, it's something that is fabricated. Our Lord, Allah azza wa jal, in the Quran said, اليوم أكملت لكم دينكم Today, I have completed your religion and completed my favour upon you and accepted Islam to be your religion. خلاص, it's over. Whatever was completed, you can't add anything to it. You cannot take anything out of it. If this is crystal clear to you and to all Muslims, because this is basics, logical things, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure it out. If this is clear to you and to the Muslims, let's go to your questions, where it says, these guys, after the congregational prayer, they offer salutation upon the Prophet alayhi salatu wasalam. Very good, very nice. Salutation upon the Prophet salallahu alayhi wa sallam is highly recommended and desirable. Anytime? Nope. What do you mean, nope? If I'm coming out of the toilet, or if I'm entering the toilet, I want to answer the call of nature. I say, بسم الله أعوذ بالله من الخبث والخبائث. This is a dua, we all know this. Can I say, اللهم صلي وسلم على محمد? Or when I come out, I say, غفرانك اللهم صلي وسلم على محمد? He says, no, this is inappropriate. I said, why? He said, this is not something that the Prophet taught us to say. Excellent, جزاك الله خير. Did the Prophet teach you alayhi salatu wasalam to offer salutation upon the Prophet after concluding the Salat? No. But it's a good thing. A good thing in your head, not in the religion of Islam. And this is an innovation because you've come up with something that the Prophet did not come up with. So question number one, did the Prophet ever offer salutation upon himself after Salat? No. Did the companions, Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, Ali, the four rightly guided khalifas, was it ever reported that they performed congregational salutation upon the Prophet after the Salat alayhi salatu wasalam? No. So with all due respect, do you know more than them? No, but it's a good thing. SubhanAllah. A good thing and the Prophet did not do it? You're coming to me and saying that, oh, now I'm doing something the Prophet didn't do. He didn't know that it was a good thing. That's why he didn't do it. But I'm doing it. This is kufr. Okay, Sheikh, but the imam in the Netherlands or in Germany or in the UK or the US, they're doing this. Akhi, most of these imams are ignorant people. They don't know. Or they are following deviant sects and cults. These are immigrants who came running and fleeing their country for a good social security. They're coming for money. If you check a lot of them, not all of course, there are righteous and practicing Muslims among them. But so many people that I get similar questions from are gold diggers. They are buying homes in riba, in mortgage. They're free mixing. I get sisters from Denmark and from Norway and from Sweden talking to me about imams telling them to come with them in the car, travel to different cities alone. A'udhu billah. What is this? And she says, Sheikh, I don't know. The imam says it's okay. These are not imams. They're just there for the money. Yeah, maybe they're Arabs, maybe they're Turks, maybe they're from here or there. They know a few verses of the Quran and mashallah, they grew a beard and they became mawlana and they became shu'a. These are deviant people. Stay away from them. And have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. And I'm going to give you a free session. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days. And bi'ithnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's blessings. And I will give you a free session. And I will give you a free session. And I will give you a free session. And I will give you a free session. And I will give you a free session. And I will give you a free session. And I will give you a free session. And I will give you a free session. I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi'ithnillah."
