  "title": "A Daee says 'No man is alone with a woman except the 3rd with them is Shaytan', this means he cannot",
  "transcript": "no man is alone with a woman except the the shaytan satan is the third person with them so this quote unquote says this means that it's not permissible for a man to be with his own sibling his own sister because the hadith fits them as a glove this is stupid with all due respect because by his definition a man cannot be alone with his mom because she's a woman and he's a man not only that he cannot be alone with his own wife because shaytan would be the third one they should bring a a a catalyst or someone to be in the room if he wants to do any hanky-panky what kind of stupidity is this this guy should be banned from speaking to people if this is his understanding and it is haram upon you to listen to such people look for people who know the quran the sunnah who follow the way of the righteous predecessors look for someone who's not controversial look for someone who doesn't swim against the tide just to make a name for himself just to be famous so many of these guys and and scholars who they're not people of knowledge and even if there are people of knowledge they come up with ideas and opinions that were not said before just simply to get more followers on twitter on instagram just to be famous just to be acknowledged and this is not the way of the salaf and this is very dangerous so don't take your knowledge about islam from such people and allah knows best"
