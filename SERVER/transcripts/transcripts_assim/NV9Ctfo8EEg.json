  "title": "Is it permissible to send the girl's photo to potential suitor for getting married - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "oh my Matt says exchanging photos with a potential suitor is not permissible what can be done if the potential suitor lives far away coming all the way down to India from the UK is difficult just to see if there's physical attraction if there isn't any then it's a total waste of money and effort 10 the photo of the girl be sent to one of his women mahomes so they can show him without having to send it to him please advise a measurement we've started this show by stating the ruling on photography for women and that it is prohibited secondly you know that there are people who they say they are photogenic meaning that they are not as beautiful or attractive in real life as in a photograph and this is why unfortunately some many models supermodels when you see them in real life they are not that attractive if not ugly but when you see them in photograph and photoshopped with the makeup etc there is a difference so a Muslim woman in India can be beautiful and attractive but if you take her photo and send it to someone he may think that she is not that attractive the thing that you see even on film or in photography it does not represent the real thing last week I was in Dubai a brother met me and he said sure I thought that you were fat and short and I'm almost six-foot so I said I'm the less good it's good that people think of you differently and then they discovered that they were wrong sending a photo is not permissable besides this guy is in the UK and he is contacting 2030 100 families and collecting their photos and taking a look as if he is choosing from a catalog this is degrading for our sister she has to also be part of it just because she's in India and he's in the UK doesn't mean that it's an advantage to get married to someone who's British and then get a chance to move into the UK they have difficult and almost impossible laws of getting married from someone abroad and it's a long hassle and it might not be the best idea but it's hella so what's the way out well he's not the last man on earth there are so many men in India there's so many men elsewhere who if they were convinced of you they would think that you are worth wasting so as he says money but a guy who sits in his home in the UK not even willing to make an effort he just wants to look at photographs before leaving this is not the right thing to do yes if he's a righteous person practicing from a good family and things seem to be a good match there's no problem in the presence of her father to conduct a Skype meeting in Skype it's not like photography you can see her gestures were talking smiling frowning from different angles not like a still picture so this can be accepted in sha Allah as a last resort and Allah knows best"
