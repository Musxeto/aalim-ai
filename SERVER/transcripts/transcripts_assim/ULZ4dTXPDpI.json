  "title": "Using linguistic tricks to justify innovations bidah, 'every innovation takes you astray'",
  "transcript": "rashad he's indulging his question in arabic that's why most people did not understand what he said because all it was was arabic and involving linguistics and it involved a terminology in a solar is it or not so when i say every innovation takes you astray so does it mean that every single innovation just because the word kul is there and he gave an ayah where allah says about the torment that went to the people of uh and it destroyed everything in the following verse allah says and you can see nothing except their homes so one would say okay everything should include their homes if it is not included then everything is not lil um but it is for the vast majority going into linguistic tricks like this is trying to undermine islam especially nowadays now when i say every muslim will enter jannah and someone says oh there are exceptions every kafir will enter hell there are exceptions every bid so there are exceptions then what is the benefit of the hadith of the prophet sallam what what are the benefits of the verses of the quran when you come and with a cross of a pen you delete it this is not how we understand the quran the sunnah this is not how the companions understood the quran the sunnah yes we give attribute to linguistics grammar arabic sciences but not to over rule on the verdicts and the rules of islam when the prophet assam reiterates not everything that takes you astray is in fire okay so is it you who's wrong or the prophet hassan when he said every innovation is dalala ah no no i i'm it's not this i didn't mean that okay what did what do you mean what do you want you want to justify biddah not you of course uh rashad those people claiming this want to start to justify bidah and whatever they're doing like the brothers in mauritania writing these drawings or lines the prophet yes in one hadith sat down and he wrote lines and he said that this is a straight path and this is the the other path since okay so we're doing this so it's not an innovation subhanallah why not pray sunnah fajr when you come to the masjid in jamaa because the prophet said allah that the prayer of an individual in congregation is 25 or 27 times better than him praying alone so before fajr starts we come to the masjid and pray to sunnah in jamaa good no it's not good the prophet didn't do it islam and he warned us from any innovation so to come and try to destroy and demolish the structure where you follow the sunnah and avoid buddha by a linguistic gimmick saying that oh not every kul means general there are exceptions blah blah blah this is unacceptable and allah knows best you"
