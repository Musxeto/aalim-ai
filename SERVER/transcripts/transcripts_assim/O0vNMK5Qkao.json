  "title": "Sharing Hajj & Umrah Videos on Social Media? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "I noticed inside the Facebook when people go to Umrah, they always post it in the social media. So can you comment on that? I did. Posting a picture, video when they perform Umrah. It's not haram, but it is something that may and may not affect your sincerity. Now maybe, maybe, if I go back, will I fall? Okay. Maybe if the Sheikh or the brother who's posting it, using it as a tutorial, and I've seen some of those. A Sheikh goes to Umrah, from step one to the end, he's showing you how to make tawaf, what to say. This is a tutorial. This is excellent. What I don't like is when I see brothers and sisters snapping shots with the Kaaba behind them and posting it to everyone as if they're saying, look at me, I am in Umrah. It's exactly like someone who used to, a brother, may Allah forgive him. He used to come every Monday to my office when I used to work in a company. And he used to sit there at 10, 10.15, yawning and tired. And I know, I'm a little bit wicked, a little bit, not much, but I pretend to be a nice guy. So I don't ask. And the guy is saying, SubhanAllah, today is very hot. And I don't speak. And he goes round and round and round. Until I say, would you like me to get you something to drink? He says, no, Alhamdulillah, I'm fasting. Every Monday he does this. So why is he doing this? To show off. Ibn al-Jawzi, may Allah have mercy on him. He says, I entered a masjid with a friend at 3am. So it's in the middle of the night in Baghdad. And we found someone praying in the middle of the night tahajjud, night prayer. And his prayer was so beautiful. You know khushu, nobody's in the masjid. So I said to my friend, wow, this man's prayer is extremely nice and perfect. And he happens to hear us. He concluded his prayer very quickly. And he came to us and said, Assalamu alaikum. What would you say if you were to know that I have been fasting for the past 20 years? What is he doing? Ibn al-Jawzi said, look at this fool. 20 years of ibadah down the drain. He wasted it just to get compliment and praise of people. So when you do ibadah, conceal it. And I'm talking about voluntary ibadah. If you're going to fajr and your neighbor sees you and says, Assalamu alaikum, where are you going? I have some errand to do. No, no. You say I'm going to fajr. This is fard. This is no showing off. But when you're doing night prayer and you post that alhamdulillah now it's time for tahajjud or the likes, this is totally unacceptable."
