  "title": "Can she sell, give, or throw Mangas (comics & graphic novels)? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Medina from Germany my friend has more or less 100 mangas and she wants to know if she should sell them and use the money for charity or if she should give the mangas with Halal content to kids or she should throw them away burn them or shred them if thanks assuming that there are Halal mangas which I doubt because it's written by disbelievers and it is based on love blood sometimes sexual content so hypothetically if there is halal pure Halal manga without any Haram in it at all yes she can utilize this by uh giving it to children but anything else she has to shred them or burn them so that no one would be harmed by the content in such uh material and knows best"
