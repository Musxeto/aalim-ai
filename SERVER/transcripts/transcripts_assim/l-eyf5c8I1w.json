  "title": "Surah Rad ayah 39: nothing can be removed or added to Lawh al Mahfuz (Destiny can be changed?) assim",
  "transcript": "um she my question is I was reading Sur um in in which there was the verse I was reading the in which said that is the like the preserved tablet and but nothing can be removed or added to the preserved tablet so how do we understand this verse the preserved tablet has all what events going to take place till the end of time in the authentic Hadith when Allah created the pen Allah said to it write the pen said oh my Lord what shall I write and Allah ordered it saying write everything that's going to happen till the end of time the prophet saysat and this was 50,000 years before Allah created the creation the whole universe it was before that by 50,000 years so the preserved tablet has everything that Allah Asel decreed that would happen till the end of time nothing is going to be erased from it and nothing can be added to it because this is Allah's knowledge Allah's ability subhanahu wa'ta'ala having said that the verse you recited and quoted Allah has the ability and the power to erase whatever he wishes and confirms whatever he wishes but whatever is in the preserved tablet this is fixed so some Scholars refer to the fact that at the beginning of the year there is predestiny at the conception the conceiving of the mother when she conceives her child in her womb when the child is 120 days there's there is predestiny or the Divine decree that is written at that moment this may be erased or may be changed but what's in the preserved tablet is fixed how is this changed Allah Asel informs the angels that this person's lifespan is 65 years of age so they write it's 65 and they know that he's going to die when he's 65 while in the preserved tablet it is 70 but no one knows what's in the preserved tablet other than Allah so the Angels Go business as usual that he's going to live for 65 however it is written down in the preserved tablet that this indiv idual will call his kinship and connect to them and be kind to them and that would be rewarded by prolonging his lifespan to 70 years of age so all of a sudden because of his actions the angels are ordered to change it from 65 to 70 and then they know that because of his kinship activities and relationship Allah has blessed his age to be 70 so they change it into 70 but this was also mentioned and pre divinely decreed 50,000 years before Allah created the universe in the preserved tablet and I hope this answers your question"
