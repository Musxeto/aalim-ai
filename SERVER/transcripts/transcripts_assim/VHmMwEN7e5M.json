  "transcript": "it's an issue of difference among Scholars and the most authentic opinion is that she is obliged to cook and to take care of the house what is the evidence the evidence is that asak may Allah be pleased with her and with with her father used to cook and take care of the house and she also used to feed and take care of horse and the Hadith is in the a very welln Hadith and Scholars say that this is part of obeying the husband in righteousness or in in um something that is good and if the marriage it was based on dos and don'ts and the rights of the husband and the rights of the wife without looking into the love and care we have a problem because imagine I have a wife and she says listen I'm not obliged by law by Islam to cook for you to iron your soes or to take care of the house this is not my obligation I can do the same I say okay Islam does not oblig me to give you a monthly salary or to take you down to a restaurant every now and then or to make you go and shop for clothes to fill your uh uh cover uh your cabinets or wardrobes or whatever I'm not obliged by by by Islam and it is my right to prevent you from going out the whole year why should you go out stay in the home I don't give you any permission to leave so I'm not your prisoner I'm not this I know you're not my prisoner but this is the right that I have okay all what I have to do is to feed you and and to provide you with clothes to wear and one dress two dresses a year is more than enough I'm not obliged to every time you have a wedding to buy your address every time you want to go to visit your family to give you money to buy them a gift someone had a baby someone just got married someone did this some did that it's not my duty so stay home don't cook don't clean but do not do anything except with my permission as Islam told you is this life is this marriage this is a prison so one would not look at it from one side look look at it from all the sides and then you would have a happy marriage you have to have communication you have to work work if you cook for your husband then you have the right to tell your husband listen I have to go uh I'd like you to take us to in a ride the kids and I let's go and have a picnic outside if you clean the house you have all the right to request your husband to allow you to spend the weekend at your parents house for example something like this depends on how you know how to communicate with your husband and Allah Knows Best"
