  "title": "The women of the Quraysh speaking disrespectfully to the Prophet ﷺ assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "or act hysterically. Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas, may Allah be pleased with him, said once the Prophet ﷺ was addressing women of Quraysh. They were talking to him, they were bombarding him with questions and complaints of their husbands, of their lifestyle, and they were raising their voices in his presence. And the Prophet, as we all know him, was the kind, tolerant, patient individual who would not hush them down or complain or say anything that would be rude. Though they should have respected the Prophet ﷺ more, but they felt of him as a father figure. So they spoke in such a fashion until Umar knocked the door and asked for permission to enter. When he did that, they immediately hushed down, tucked themselves up, covered themselves properly, and took a side. So when Umar was allowed to enter, he came in and found the Prophet ﷺ laughing. So Umar said, O Prophet of Allah, may Allah Azza wa Jal, all you make you always in this cheerful mood. What is it that's making you laugh? So the Prophet ﷺ said in reply to his question, I am amazed of these women who were at my presence with their voices loud and talking until they heard your voice asking for permission, how they all of a sudden turned 180 degrees, hushed down, and went to wear their hijab. And when Umar scolded them, how dare you speak like this in the presence of the Prophet ﷺ and do what you have done when I came in? They said to him, the Prophet is not as rude as you are. The Prophet is not as harsh as you are."
