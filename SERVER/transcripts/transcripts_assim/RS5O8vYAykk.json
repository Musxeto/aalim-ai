  "transcript": "a sister says I've failed as a mother I tried to raise my children to be religious I had hope that reached the sky but they are not showing interest in applying the correct Islam they waste their time with silly things do not want to pray at a Masjid and this drives me crazy I keep shouting because they don't listen I feel I hate them so as a mother how can we let them love the Deen they are teenagers first of all this requires a lecture you have to weigh the consequences of your actions being crazy doesn't fix things shouting at them does not fix things forcing them it depends there are red lines we cannot cross if their father is a righteous practicing Muslim he must take them with him by force to the Masjid to pray because this is an obligation this is not human rights this is not child abuse all this crap all this this is nonsense for Muslims we have a religion to follow who gives whatever about their laws and regulations so the father is obliged to accompany him these are red lines now if they don't want to memorize the Quran it's not mandatory don't focus on something that they don't want so that you don't lose the whole package deal if they spend their times in trivial things and waste the times on silly things it's silly to you to them it might be a breather so if they are doing halal things playing vid hell are video games every now and then give them some time give them incentives change your strategy your tactics if you always tell them directly do this do this and they don't do it try to change try to give them incentives try to tell them if you do this I will do that for you if you manage to pray a whole week five times a day in the Masjid I'll increase your of videogames into half an hour for example a day etc you have to work it out but you cannot simply raise the white flag and give up"
