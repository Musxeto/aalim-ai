  "transcript": "[Questioner]   from Germany so my question is if I visit \nmy relatives and they are not maharam who   don't cover and we eat at one table would this be \npermissible for me if I be there if I'm there and   I don't look at them and I don't talk to them \nand does it make a difference if they cover   okay first of all free mixing is not \npermissible in Islam and your relatives   who are Nan mahram such as your female cousins or \nyour uncle's aunts or your sister-in-law all of   these are Non mahram to you so mixing with them is \nmore harmful than mixing with strangers you don't   know of because these Non maharams are closer \nto you and usually there are no boundaries set   people joke people vent to one another and they \nknow their background they know their history so   they feel more attached and closer to than total \nstrangers therefore it's not permissible to mix   with them due to the harm the potential Haram that \na person may fall into sitting with them on the   same table if they're not covered and eating with \nthem and talking with them is totally prohibited   if they are covered with hijab proper hijab and \nthere is no mixing in the sense that there's no   socializing there's no chit chatting there's no \ntalking in this case this is Allah because the   fitna is not there when they're properly covered \nand there's no uh chit chatting or socializing and have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford it \nthat's good for you if you cannot you're entitled   for one free session and this is for everybody \nif they can affirm by Allah that they cannot   afford it because they're poor I'll give them \none free session without a problem a full half   an hour so come to me and let's speak about \nit inshallah within the following two days   or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for All"
