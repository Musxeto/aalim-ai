  "transcript": "Khamees from the Emirates. Sheikh I have a question. So basically if a person eats food and then he doesn't say Bismillah, this helps the shayateen. So if one person is too lazy to say this, does this take him out of the fold of Islam? No, no, no, no. It does not at all take you out of the fold of Islam because saying Bismillah is an issue of dispute whether it is mandatory, which we believe it is, or highly recommended, which a lot of the scholars also believe it is. So if you fail to say it out of laziness, whether in the beginning or in the middle by saying Bismillahi awwaluhu wa akhiruh, this doesn't take you out of the fold of Islam. And to a lot of the scholars it is not even sinful. So inshaAllah this answers your question. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
