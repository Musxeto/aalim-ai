  "transcript": "Hallel healer no mover Sheeran bee lady or New Roman who up I love Arab ID Sneiderman over him al-hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa muhammad al al-amin nabina muhammad in Wadi he was happy he remain I'm a bad dear brothers sisters in Islam assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh read on mubarak a blessed and happy read for all the muslims whom allah azzawajal blessed them to fast this blessed month of Ramadan Ramadan is over with the grace of Allah the first is gone the feelings of hunger are gone and nothing of the hardship that we had faced in Ramadan remains all what remains is the reward with Allah the Almighty so it is a time to rejoice it is a time to be happy that Allah has blessed us to complete the full month of Ramadan the day of read it is a day of jubilation it's a day where we are supposed to make our families happy to be happy despite all what is happening around the world despite the calamities the pandemic the problems the tribulations this day is a day of happiness of joy so we have to celebrate this day now there are different forms of celebrations and we will ensure I get to talk to some of our great brothers in Islam great Diaries to have their insight over this issue how to remain steadfast after Ramadan how to change after Ramadan and how to celebrate with our families with our children with our relatives and loved ones especially in this time of lockdown but before we go and meet our brothers show al which is the month that follows Ramadan is a blessed month it is a month of good deeds shawol inaugurates the first month of the months of Hajj so we have show while the Qaeda and the Rieger ensure while a great form of worship is conducted and that is the fasting of the six days of Showa which we will come to discuss insha'Allah in it those who missed fasting days of Ramadan should start making it up insha while those who missed don't get a calf for one reason or the other they can make it up in so while it is a month of marriage engagement as a lot of the Companions used to conduct their marriages in SH a while due to the Prophet Isis I'm doing that in this blessed month mother she says all her families used to get them married in the month of Shawwal so the most prominent ritual that people do in show al is fasting the six days of Showa why the Prophet said Alice o son whoever fasts Ramadan the whole month and follows that with six days of shawol Allah would reward him as if he had prayed as if he had fasted the whole year and another hadith because one did is multiplied to ten so fasting six days of Shawwal is as if you had fasted sixty days to months and fasting Ramadan before that is as if you have fasted ten months and this is a full year now one of the benefits of fasting the six days of Showa is that it compensates whatever shortcomings you had done during fasting Ramadan and this is something well known in Sharia whatever things you miss in a form whatever voluntary you perform would compensate for that which was missing now there is an issue of dispute among scholars in regards to whether the fasting of the full Ramadan must be done before the six days of Shawwal or not and the most authentic opinion is that you cannot fast 23 days of Ramadan skipping six or seven days due to a legitimate reason such as travelling falling sick or having menses for women and after Ramadan you fast the six days of sherwin the most authentic opinion is that this is not permissible you have to make up for the missed days of Ramadan so that you would have fulfilled fasting the whole month of Ramadan and after that you must if you wish fast the six days off shall well in order to fall under the category and under the reward of the Prophet Allah so Salaam that afterwards meaning after fasting Ramadan you follow that with six days of Shabbat which means if you fasted twenty eight twenty five days you you can you did not do that and this is the factor of the permanent committee that you cannot fast a missed Ramadan follow that by six jawad and the reward you have to fulfill and complete it so a frequently asked question can we combine between making up of the missed days of Ramadan with the six days of shewhart with one intention so like for example I missed one day of Ramadan due to traveling so in sha Wan I fast one day with the intention of making up for the missed day of Ramadan plus it's a day from the six days of sha while the answer is no you cannot combine such intentions you have to fulfill fasting of Ramadan entirely without a combination of intentions then you fast the six days alone and separately do I have to fast the six days of sure what in a row that says no you can break them one day here one day there one day in the middle one day at the end which means that you have the option even to combine the intention of six days of sha well with voluntary fasts so if I select too fast Mondays and Thursdays with the intention of the six days of Showa you get two birds with one stone if I intend to fast the white days 13th 14th and 15th of Shaban with the intention of the six days of Showa this is no problem what about if I happen to fast on a Saturday alone this is an issue of dispute those authentic opinion is that you should fast a day before or a day after just to be safe though the hadith of the prohibition of isolating Saturday in fasting this is disputed upon and the most authentic opinion that it is not authentic but just to be safe rather than sorry add to it a day before or a day after a lot of the sisters complain and say that we have so many days to make up of Ramadan and we have our own excuses in show 1 and we won't have enough time so the answer would be as Jacob NIV means said may Allah have mercy on his soul let us assume that a woman gave birth in the month of Ramadan or let us assume that she had 14 days of menses in Ramadan so she fasted 16 days sure while was over first day of read she started from the second day of sha1 and fasted making up the 14 days on the 15th of Shaban when she finished making up for Ramadan she got her menses again for 10 12 13 days and now after she's pure she has only two days to fast from sure while remaining we say fast these two days and in Valletta you can fast the other four days and this would make up for the six days of Showa because you had a legitimate reason and this is the photo of women as a mean and it's also the factor of share about man even Nasser a Sarah D because you had a legitimate reason those who are lazy and don't fast during the month of Ramadhan don't do not fast during the month of Shawwal and they're late and they want to make it up in the car that without a legitimate reason there is not an excuse for them and this would not be legitimate this is in a nutshell an introduction of the rulings of fasting in the month of Shawwal and how great it is especially that we've been fasting for the past 30 days so adding six days now our bodies are adapted to fasting we're ready with the lockdown we are confined to our homes so we have no excuse not to make it up and this gives you the reward of fasting a whole year so we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back with Lonnie o Matina be a woman lady assalamu alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatu today I'm gonna talk about the book interactions of the greatest leader even masud may allah be pleased with him said the noble man of coure h passed by a lost messenger sallallahu alayhi wa sallam and with him worship Bilal amar and hubbub and other weak Muslims they said to him o Muhammad are you pleased with these people as being your people are those the ones that out of all of us Allah has blessed are we going to follow those people send them away from you perhaps if you do so we will follow you so Allah sent his verse which means and do not send away those who call upon their Lord morning and afternoon seeking his countenance tuffsy robbery Bassanio Matina be you milady assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh and welcome back as you know this is not your typical asks at so this is a day of jubilation and a day of happiness a day of celebration and as part of celebrating this beautiful event we have with us online and hamdulillah due to social distancing as you know our brother Abu Musab chair wash d al akkari who is joining us on zoom' Salaam aleikum Salaam in come apart well it is a joy just to see you on that TV and hamdulillah healthy and well and you look as usual younger and younger as I'm getting older and older hamdulillah Allah Allah my body don't say that I gave you the evil I'm I'm putting all what I have insha'Allah just to give you the antivirus the anti put the protection you need each other like a locket I appreciate it how are you Sheikh watched e and how are you family and shall are you all doing well I'm did Allah we're trying to reap the benefits of what what seems to be a negative situation that has actually brought out a lot of good yeah I know I know a lot of Muslims are coming to the realization as well so we're trying to learn with patience to appreciate everything now we appreciate things that were available to us and we just took him for granted so there's a lesson and everything even this lockdown that we're going through right now masha'Allah sabbatical Allah I pray to Allah soldier that he makes what we go through an increase in our Eman in our good deeds and to realize a Las beautiful favors and blessings that we as you have mentioned earlier took for granted so that when it comes back again we inshallah appreciated share was deep to my recollection you have a blessed family of three boys and a girl and being a parent being someone in your calibers Aquila here who is a professional manager in the corporate world but at the same time a well-known dairy whose prints are well noticed and appreciated his Aquila hair your clips your material that shows a lot of great research and objectivity to them while I was a kicker Allah Azza WA JAL wallah has a book and may Allah make you and I among those who are steadfast on the Quran the Sunnah with the understanding of the favorite three generations so being who you are being young of course above all and being Masha Allah Yanni who you are how do you invest this pandemic this lockdown the events of aid especially that we are unable to go out as we used to so can you give us a hint of guidelines that we can utilize in our fatwood with our families and in our homes yes of course I can look here for for the good things you mentioned and may Allah forgive me for my shortcomings and all the Muslims I mean Europe we praise the lost cattle abundantly asked a lot exalted mentioning grant peeps their prophet muhammad's allah o allah as you mentioned your chef this aid has been unlike unlike all the aids in the past i cannot find any resemblance actually to an event of this magnitude but as we mentioned allah spanner to Allah decrees certain matters for the for mankind so that they may reflect and for the believer there's a certain type of reflection for the person who's working on their belief they have more reasons to appreciate Eman and believe with Allah appreciation for the last day and so there would every way you look at it there's a lot of good that is happening due to that and I want to highlight that the beauty of Islam subhanAllah if you if you just make a quick comparison where will you find a religion that has laid down such foundational principles that irrespective of what we're going through we have rules and regulations and guidelines through which we can deduce rulings relevant to our times it's actually my blowing if you think about it that no matter what goes no matter what humanity goes through the Muslims you will find have strong references as to how we are to conduct ourselves and then you will find also that the way we behave the way we are told to function in this world is usually for the most part in line with whatever science observes and guides us that this is the right thing to do and so you will see it through them through the scope in nineteen all of the guidelines that they were given are actually part of Muslim lifestyle whether males or females and so that's from a worldly perspective and universal perspective from a legislative perspective aid now is going to be prayed for the most part for a lot of us at home and the scholars say that added actually like like narrated from some of the cells from Sahaba I believe it was honest if he had missed the salat afraid he would then pray Allah to the aid at home so it is recommended for the brother to for the household the male in the household to lead stellata aid at home following the same guidelines of seven takbir art in the first five that we wrought in the second raka no food wash to be delivered because hota the place of the Hopa is either Masjid or masala it is not to be done at home and then we try to bring the same joy that we otherwise would have outside into our homes and this is where we can be creative so the parents should think from them because for the children is gonna be it's gonna be sad be there used to going out maybe going to the car going to a fun doing something that that necessitates being outdoors and so if we are forced to be indoors for a good reason then we need to try to replicate whatever activities that the children like and appreciate so that the joy of read will remain so we don't miss out on the joy of eight and that is an obligation that the parents have so you have to be a bit innovative in the sense that in the presence you give it's not like it used to be before in an envelope or cash money but rather you have to give something that is innovative something that is more and not standard not usual yes and what would would we introduce any activities because usually we here in Saudi as long as well as many of the Arab and Muslim world we exchange a lot of visitations to our parents grandparents siblings uncles and we enjoy it which we thought in the past that it was a burden just to go around and visiting people into a so tiring and difficult now we wish we can pay people money to allow us to go but this is bribery and they've put us in in trouble so let us stick with the rules or hamdullah so how would we explain to our children that this is a calamity is it wise to make a comparison between what we are suffering at the moment and the real suffering of Muslims worldwide whether it's through Wars or refugee camps or crossing the military on a foot to put on the table absolutely that's that's one of the messages that I've been trying to convey to my children to the best of my ability with my shortcomings but I have been trying whenever the occasion arises I do make it a point to highlight that what you are complaining about right now partially is actually how a lot of Muslims live on regular daily basis for a lifetime not for a couple of months for a couple of years a lifetime of restrictions a lifetime of deprivation a lifetime of suffering a lifetime of that being able to choose what they want to eat and be so selective about the options and the availability of the options a lot of a lot of things which we you know we just consider that these ours are given right are actually things that fellow Muslims who are our brothers and sisters in the ultimate sense more so than our blood brothers sisters don't have those things for for many years if not an entire lifetime of all that is one of the byproducts and benefits of this is that the children also in spite of their young age they can relate and they can understand and to Panama they become less demanding they have become less demanding that you don't have to get the same we can't get toys if we get an order they might not get delivered on time so we're settling down for what we can get from a supermarket you know that's it could be some candy it could get something at a and it's a lesson it's a lesson that this aid was unlike other aids and so it's a means for us to bond with other people that are less privileged there are less fortunate in the sense and subhanAllah if if things ever go back to normal then you would get that sense of appreciation and you'll be more thankful to Allah then you had been in the past of course Seussical ahead Sheikh Abu Musab Osdol I carry for this beautiful reminder but to conclude and I'll leave you the last word of course while doing this with our children we must not forget that this is a day of celebration a day of eight so we are not intending of course to depress them rather than to give them a hint of the blessings and favours of Allah so gel which would increase and boost their happiness when they compare themselves to the underprivileged Muslims all around the world and it would be by plus if you can't afford that if you can have them donate some of their idea there the money that we give them on eight occasion some of it like five 10% to a refugee camp or to our Muslim brothers in their hinder or in any underprivileged places where it would show their contribution as children to that what do you think that would be a fine idea questioning you cannot put it I cannot put it better than you did I was just gonna say that I hope no one understood and maybe that's why you made this important clarification I didn't you know you will depress them on the day of those lessons actually are the ones that we try to insert in portions throughout Ramadan what did they evade remains to be a day of of enjoyment and entertainment and the remembrance of Allah and eating and drinking so they will enjoy their aid within the capacity that we have and ultimately sharing some of their some of their wealth with those who are that are less privileged is also of utmost importance and but we want them to enjoy their aid knowing that this rate is gonna be unlike the other ones and Ramadan is when we had already established the reality that we're living in it is when we get to celebrate and the point is that the children will not feel you know that feeling of man because I'm not doing what I'm used to doing they would have already prepared themselves mentally and psychologically for that day to be satisfied with whatever gifts our money or chocolates you were able to collect you know for for that particular beautiful day Allah Sheikh Abu Musab al akkari and for this beautiful reminder and it is always a pleasure and a joy to see you well and sound at hamdulillah be even Allah after the lockdown is over I will invite you to a cup of cappuccino my treat vanilla and to try to recap what we have missed all these years is a cola here for your kind words and for your presence and may allah azzawajal make this aid a blessed rate for you for your wife and your children and for your entire family and for the whole Ummah may Allah shall make this the best aid that have ever passed upon the Muslim Ummah barakallahu do Salaam aleikum wa rahmatullah dear brothers and sisters as usual we have a short break stay tuned inshallah we'll be right back with Lonnie o matina be a woman ID assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakaatuh today we're gonna talk about the book interactions of the greatest leader the prophets of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam divided the poor people among the Companions so that they were fed even Syrian may Allah have mercy upon him said in the evening the messenger of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam would divide some poor people between some of his companions so it would be that a man would go with one man another with two men another with three and so for up until ten Al Hassan may Allah have mercy upon him said and the messenger of allah sallallahu alayhi wasallam would take any of them that remained into his home and would feed them whatever he had this hadith is reported by ahmed al albani ruled it as authentic in his book Asahi huh also reported by eben abu sheba in his book and moose enough whoosh Lonnie Oh Mattie Nibiru m'lady [Music] assalamualaikum warahmatullah wabarakatuh and welcome back may allah azzawajal accept our fastings and our prayers and all our good deeds in this past ramadan and make us better stronger and more steadfast on this beautiful deal with us is a great indeed friend to my heart I'd known him for so many years which shows you how old I am and how young he is masha'Allah our honorable doctor a share Mohamed Salah one of the pillars of Hooda TV and one of the prominent international dairies around the world share from Hamid Salah assalamu aleikum wa rahmatullah but it's very nice I'm happy and blessed a barakallahu fig and may allah azza wajal make this read one of the best reads that the ummah has ever witnessed and may allah azzawajal grant your mother fast and quick recovery and restore her health may allah so she'll make all the Muslims make door and share me in dua for her good health and insha'Allah a happy Eid for her and for your spouse and for your children as well chef a logic ahead dr. Mohamed Salah now with this pandemic with this Ramadan that was the first ever to be witnessed by any of us no one ever anticipated or thought in a million years that we would undergo such circumstances Janna for example with the grace of allah i am the imam of the masjid for the past two years this is the first time in my life that I missed like seven or eight Fridays in a row I used to call some of my friends and tell them he remind me is the hot bar Friday before the salat or after the salat it's been so long so now we have under we only gone this Ramadan which was a blessing by itself we've discovered so many things that were not apparent to us but we discovered that we have families alhamdulillah for a change but what should we do now to maintain this fruit to maintain the sweetness of Iman that Allah has blessed us in this Ramadan yes awesome not only be honey what movies similar incidents like that where people start in just fiction but in reality we as Muslims we have been ha ever since the Prophet sallallaahu nemesis discuss the science whether the manga were the major signs of the Day of Judgment lot of things similar to that or even greater would take place and I'm sure you remember how many companions as the Prophet SAW Allah sent a day which will be as long as well complete years of our time this is when a false messiah will emerge and the in part of what was the environment salaam to prophet of allah la we're gonna do when the day would last for 360 plus days one single sunrise and one single sunset so what we're gonna do and that means attention the inner circumstances my dear viewers under any circumstances of annuities to fulfill the purpose for which we would be able we chose in my genes would be under in circumstances we need to look for a lot of items and help to be fulfilled so The Messenger of Allah so we want to assess the situation based on you know not a single sunrise and single sunset this is towards the end of 500 for suicide will be emerged but what good to still pray 5 times keep into its Mac there is a mind but a single day in a single mic which would last for a Whovian for us as Muslims would cope in nineteen with whatever circumstances we know he my dear beloved brother and Chile The Messenger of Allah says in a beautiful Hadees Leah Leah I may be in movement Allah and Allah the Almighty Allah does not agree for his believing servant anything he but it is definitely more certainly good for him see the goodness in it but he will evolve and as a matter of fact you're right now it's eight weeks but we have seen lot of goodness if there is nothing out of that but every charity having a Masjid and an open door to go whenever you desire that is sufficient appreciate in the fact that it was a cold and an invitation that would not do in Allah civil he's inviting us to do us a favor so that we can live with them so that we can pull up on him then he answers our pose the massages are closed with the future of the machete believers are going out of the mind you know nothing is effect on us as much as missing the father we have to have to in the middle hamdulillah still we did it at home with Patara we read that I have it at home and for the first time my mom was confined to bed or sometimes on the wheelchair is listening if she can operations I'm not sure she's enjoying that I'm sure everyone in their small circle with their family they have discovered a lot of positives of the 19 we don't curse we don't sighs who say Allah knows best this there must be a reason it's a wake-up call with that was celebrated and Muslims are advised to make the best of any and every circumstances even if they appear terror and so we're going to make our children boys and girls and our spouses make them feel the hosts on the morning of really put a number this blow the new clothes for the kids it gets completely each other to make sure that they are not missing anything then what is next that is a question through every year Ramadan is over to the vast majority of Muslims it seemed like Islam supremacy is not the case and it should be be the case it shouldn't be the case Ramadan was beautiful and still we have a beautiful remaining of Ramadan we should meet the list outfit but after amigami sharma does that beautiful chinese phone that was a key provision the beautiful provision that we have earned and we have ironed up during ramadan less of the next year insha allah i surgeon so it doesn't mean that we're not gonna carry my prayer anymore as a matter of fact were so determined to give a portion every night for the night prayer we're so determined that sure well will not pass without fasting the city's daddies which the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam and it for us an estate whoever observes fasting during Ramadan and follow set by six days of fasting during shower and it doesn't have any persistent by the way the old mighty allowing it in the world of fasting for an entire analysis of activity then soon after Mondays and Thursdays and mousse oh awesome ordinary people have been calling me and they say other bags I'm embarrassed for myself that our students have finished a forensic spying seven times and some we finished it more than that masha'allah more than that national does it mean that when Ramadan is over we are going to connect with the Quran only next year No Name la nada insha Allah our subject boontem indeed this relationship check muhammad yeah in Subhan Allah you brought this up a brother who was not that regular in night prayer Subhan Allah how Allah drives blessings and favours to us through calamities he called and he said sure Hossam I was negligent regarding night prayer I used to pray like three records five records that's it this Ramadan I noticed due to the lockdown that I am able to pray every night with four Zuzu holding the most half in my hand and I'm not tired I know I can go for seven or for ten and I'm thinking to myself Subhan Allah nothing has changed I'm in the comfort of my home my wife is asleep and I'm all alone praying through them the Quran standing in prayer not just reading it sitting down standing and I finish for juicer every night so insha'Allah he's telling me insha'Allah from now on I will never leave this beautiful a better because I tasted how good it is Subhan Allah now now it takes but once you are connected once it clicks that's it we take it from there so never let go chef Hansen I don't think much of you fine but I just want to laugh with you and with the viewers with a beautiful diverse section of verses of surah fussilat in which Allah Almighty sees in Poona [Music] [Music] before moon versus as well as beautiful but for this verse for the signify that the Almighty Allah and he's representative Prophet Muhammad SAW Allah send his messengers us to remain steadfast not only during Ramadan not only during the first 10 days of dhul Hijjah not only during the Hajj season but throughout our entire life to remain asleep faster offer our prayers to umpire to be attentive to our duty suppose Allah or relatives list of people our employees or our employer our neighbors everyone so we say I will move this Allah we declare the wood of the heat and we remain steadfast domestic ammo on the straight path so when it happens and then the angels of death are coming to take their souls they assure them you shouldn't be afraid you should be be why you shouldn't feel sad you're not missing much as a matter of fact what you'd be eating is the greatest and we're approaching that great displeasure so should we be a say while a decimal the mom be afraid or should you be rather than actual rejoice with Paradise which we have been promised we asked Allah Sanatana to give us hope stick test on the defense after Ramadan inshallah and to make us among those whom the angels of this would assure them at this very crucial time and I mean Jacques allahu khairan about the right man and may Allah Azza WA JAL grant you and your family a blessed and a happy Eid and may Allah so she'll make you and I and all our viewers among those who are steadfast we are noticing a lot of the people falling off the bridge of esta palma and they are retreating may Allah's will protect this so may Allah so she'll make us steadfast on the straight path until we meet

and inshallah we'll be right back with Ronnie o mattina be a woman lady [Music] assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatu today I'm going to talk about the book interactions of the greatest leader today's topic is poverty poverty in Islamic legislation refers to lacking or falling short of basic necessities so anyone who does not have a quantity that satisfies him and his family is considered in poverty and among the destitute Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alayhi wasallam fed the trial of riches for his nation more than he fed for poverty he sallallahu alayhi wasallam said by Allah it is not poverty about which I fear for you but I fear in your case that riches may be given to you as were given to those who had gone before you and that you begin to vie for them as they vied for them and that they may destroy you as they destroyed them this hadith was reported by Albahari and also in much more Al Fatah WA you Bassanio mattina be you milady assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh and welcome back we have a third and last guest with us in today's episode and I pray to Allah so tell that he accepts our fastings and prayers and to make this aid a blessed and happy 8th our next guest is a staff a great teacher and an old old friend of mine for the past like 35 years and his name is awesome right and he is gifted students specialists so he is specialized in giving all what he has to gifted students and he is a motivational speaker and he is a trained trainer and a certified trainer so I would like to welcome brother Qasim arrived Muhammad Salaam aleikum wa rahmatullah may Allah make this a happy read for you and your blessed family brother awesome I know that masha'Allah you have a blessed big family and with the circumstances of this lockdown when people are worldwide complaining of depression anxiety and in some countries of course at home to learn non-muslim countries they are complaining of being suicidal the Muslims on the other hand are coping quite well with the grace of Allah and we know that this is due to their trust reliance and dependence upon Allah Azza WA JAL so they believe whatever happens to them is from Allah so they are content they are patient they're tolerant and they're not whining and complaining over it however this read is unprecedented no one thought in a million years that we could undergo such circumstances this Ramadan if someone told us that there's a Bollywood or Hollywood or even Nollywood movie about it we would not have believed it but we've seen it being deprived of salat at Allah we in the Masjid the Friday khutba all of these new things may have changed our perceptions of things so I'd like you to give us your experience and your vast knowledge Jacque Allah here in how to deal in an optimistic way especially with the children how to make them feel that this is a read that we should be joyful jubilant happy in where all of the things are in lock lock down they can't go and see their grandparents their uncle's or aunts or cousins or relatives they can't go to the fun fairs they can't go to the malls they're actually locked down in their homes so I appreciate it if you would kindly give us a reminder on how to deal with this situation it's like Allah who falen first the word that you said is really precious when you said belief and if we believe in Allah believe it or not there is no way for pessimism to go into our odds by any means a Muslim by all means with all kinds of destinies he has to believe that it is all written on us upon our heads or whatever foreheads we have to believe that it is also a mercy for us all with whatever results or consequences or things that we see that seem to be disastrous for some people who are not believers actually I've lived in many different circumstances abroad outside the country and we have seen Wars and circumstances that are very difficult no food no peace nothing at all and ham did a lot of blood I mean if we see and we compare ourselves to other countries at what they suffer now with the things that mass mass numbers of that everyday and governments who do not adopt the the victims hospitals are locked we don't want to mention some some names of some countries and ham do you know our country did not leave any anything for for the citizens it didn't do it so hospitals are there shops are there markets are there all kinds of care we are receiving so this kind of we can call crisis if when it comes prices I hate to go to college crisis in a way or another because we have to be able feel all the time optimistic it's a circumstance it's circumstance that in a way or another it's going to disappear so we have to have all the time a white look with pleasure and with the strong belief especially in these days in the month of Mercy which is Ramadan now we're closed that side and in the days of Eid we have to celebrate nothing can prevent us and by the way we used to do let's say some kinds of plays please me and my MA let's say my family my wife my daughters my sons might nonsense my granddaughter's playing Rose so even if we are not visiting our grandfathers or grandmothers and not seeing their aunts and uncles we can take the rules they can play the role of an uncle or an aunt and we can fill the whole house with pleasure and joy the rules are let's say are available toys are there let's say especially the smiles the smile shouldn't disappear from our faces we have to be all the time smiling we have to congratulate ourselves let's say you come great light we congratulate your wife she congrat I congratulate you and also the children the daughters and the sons believe it or not now with the social media and the cans and the cameras you can see your daughter even if she's in Canada unwritten muscle we can meet we can meet even if he's with the social distancing we can meet we can see each other so no need at all for any gap of pessimism please please please forget about prism SMP all the time optimistic if you believe that all that is from Allah nothing is going to enter to your mind or heart your psychology is all the time to be is going to be stable you will feel all the time happy so belief real belief in allies number one okay said awesome brother gaseum while you were talking something just crossed my mind usually on normal circumstances on the day of 8:00 we go to the masala we offer Eid prayer and we come back home and we like sleep till 4:00 time then we wake up and to exchange the gifts to do our visitations maybe go to our parents house and have the grand lunch with all the relatives now with all of this don't you think that we have to have a change of Dale schedule instead of having the day of Eid like every other day sleeping after fajar until the her and waking up lazy and not optimistic and not celebrating the mood of Eid should we put a shift into that for sure the whole schedule is going to be changed let's say if we accept if we don't accept it but when you mentioned the masala what prevents us from having a masala inside the house believe it or not each and every house in our country let's say has in it three or four rooms sometimes four rooms or five rooms for guests and now they are vacant they are empty so we can have one masala two masala one room for for the kids to play in and also the laziness that we used to do we used to have we used to live in the past has to disappear now we can celebrate the whole day especially we are not driving so we are saving let's say for me we have relatives in so many let's say citizen in the country now we're saving a lot of time a lot of money line of guys so we can save this time and save this money to celebrate in the house so what prevents us not doing this I'll have

grandsons of my granddaughter's they hate watching movies they want fairy tales they want to sit with the caretaker and grandfathers and let's say grandmothers they want to listen to stories they love
