  "title": "Is saying Astaghfirullah 3 times & Allahumma antas salam...after Sunnah prayers an innovation? Assim",
  "transcript": "says three times a stir for allah is a thicker after fart prayer is it also zikr after sunnah prayer means that if we say astaghfirullah three times after sunnah prayer two will it be an innovation the answer is yes after voluntary prayers after ratiba after nafl we were not commanded by the prophet isaiah to say anything and he never said anything that was reported to us so the default is that the religion has been completed meaning that he used to only say astagfirullah only after the prayers any of these none for prayers you do not say this at all"
