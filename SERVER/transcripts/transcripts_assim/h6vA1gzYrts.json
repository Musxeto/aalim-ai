  "title": "Should Muslims live minimalistic life to avoid arrogance & disobedience (Quran 46:20 assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Allah the almighty says in chapter 46 verse 20 of the Quran and the day those who disbelieved are exposed to the Hellfire it will be said to them you received your good things and Bounties in the life of this world and you had your fun in enjoyment so this day you will be awarded the punishment of extreme humiliation because you were arrogant upon the Earth without any right and because you were definely disobedient Shake based on the contents of this verse is it encouraged to live a minimalist lifestyle as a Muslim as opposed to living a materialistic lifestyle like the disbelievers do so we could avoid becoming arrogant and disobedient like them God forbid no of course this is not what the Ayah is telling us about because there are various Ayah in the Quran as well that states say who is it who made Halal things Haram for the Believers and the prophet used to enjoy Halal things he used to love to eat a good meat from the shoulder of a sheep and he used to enjoy Sweet Water as the water in Medina was a bit salty so sometimes people would go a journey of a day or two to bring him Sweet Water for him to drink so enjoying good good things is permissible in Islam what is not permissible is to be extravagant or to do that things that are Haram as for the disbelievers who Allah is telling them that we have given you a good life this is to indicate when they come and complain on the day of judgment that we have done good deeds we fed the hungry and we helped the poor and we sheltered the orphans and the homeless so these are good deeds Allah Asel is telling them that yes but through these Good Deeds we have given you food drink Health a good life a good salary a good house a good spouse a healthy uh children and the likes all of these were in compensation for the good deeds that you have given now on the day of judgment because of your disbelief you have nothing to show up for you have no credit and this is why they'll be humilated and admitted to Hell Fire and Allah Knows Best"
