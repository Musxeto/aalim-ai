  "title": "Listening to music is Haram, BUT what about listening to Nasheeds that have them?",
  "transcript": "Nazli from Azerbaijan Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh, some brothers and sisters haven't given up music, listen to songs they used to listen before, but without any melody, like vocals only. My question is, can we listen to songs without music if they think about love there and something Can you listen to what? Can you listen to what? Can we listen to songs without music if they think about something which can be haram, for example, about love? Musical instruments are totally prohibited in Islam to listen to, and this is mentioned in the Quran, it's mentioned in the Sunnah, and it's the consensus of the four schools of thought who say that listening to musical instruments is haram. So whether the content is haram, such as love songs and the likes, or even if the content is what they call quote-unquote Islamic nasheed, and I have seen so many of them celebrities coming with orchestras and they're singing songs praising Allah. Who are you fooling? This is not praising Allah, this is praising money, this is praising fame, this is wanting to be recognized and acknowledged. If you had the fear of Allah Azza wa Jal, you would have followed the way of the Prophet alayhi salatu wa salam and his companions. But you don't, you want to be known. Okay, you have a beautiful voice, oh the song is beautiful, but why have it with musical instruments and another version without? Oh so I can entertain for the needs of these religious people who don't listen to music. So in this case you're not doing it for the sake of Allah, and you have to fear Allah Azza wa Jal, and I do feel sorry for these brothers who are famous and they keep on compromising their religion. Some of them had beautiful songs, Islamic songs, no musical instruments, then they went down spiral, downhill, and they declined in their religious commitment. They went down to the extent that now they have musical instruments and the orchestras they're appearing in has women not wearing the veil and they're sitting there next to them. What kind of Islam is this? I don't know. This is not the Islam that I know that Allah has revealed to Prophet Muhammad alayhi salatu wa salam and was practiced by the companions. So any type of musical instruments is not permissible in such songs, whether the content is praising Allah or praising Satan. It's all the like and the same and Allah knows best. May Allah protect us all."
