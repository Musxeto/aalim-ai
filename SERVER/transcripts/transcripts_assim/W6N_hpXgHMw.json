  "title": "Is using mubarak or 'blessed' for the Prophet ﷺ appropriate",
  "transcript": "Shahid from India. Sheikh my question was like many scholars use this word whenever they refer to any attribute or anything related to the Prophet ﷺ. So they use the word Mubarak, blessed. So they say his blessed beard would soak in his tear when he used to pray or he used his blessed spit to cure the eyes of Ali ﷺ in the Battle of Khaybar. So they attach this word blessed. So is this appropriate? Is it allowed? Do you have any doubt Shahid that the Prophet ﷺ is a blessing all in all? Yes or no? No. Okay Alhamdulillah. So there's nothing wrong. Yes it is not from the Sunnah but we all agree that there is no human being that we can seek Allah's blessing through him physically other than the Prophet ﷺ. So his garment is a blessing we can take it and we can seek Allah's blessing from it. His hair, his sweat, his touch, how many times he blessed the food, blessed the water in the well until it came abundantly and sufficed people's needs. So he's a blessing wherever he goes ﷺ in his lifetime and hence there's no problem in using such terminology and Allah knows best."
