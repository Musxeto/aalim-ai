  "title": "Labeling others as disbelievers (kaafir)  and those who pray on and off | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Abdulla says is fasting of a person valid if he only preys on and off now the question is important what I don't like in this question is that I receive a lot of similar questions of people going out of their way to label and render others as kafir just this morning a brother sent a question saying that my father only prays Fridays and he prays in Ramadan on and off and I told my mother that her marriage to him is invalid but she refuses to leave him or to seek divorce what do you advise what do you advise so I told the brother why are you so anxious to jump the gun and label your father as a kafir people ask similar questions if my father were to die do I have to wash him shroud him pray funeral prayer and bury him with the Muslims or should I just leave him like any kafir and let him rot I would be laugh what kind of mentality these people have and the funny thing is if the father is wealthy they would recommend the mother to separate from him because he doesn't pray he's a kafir they recommend that he's not washed or prayed upon or buried with the Muslims because he's a kafir but when it comes to inheritance don't forget my share do not forget my share you know that you cannot inherit at this believer or a kafir yet when you want you take him out of the fold of Islam and when you do not want you take your share of the inheritance this is wrong coming back to the question of our doula technically speaking a person who does not pray is not a Muslim now practically speaking you cannot implement this rule this theory on a specific individual until the conditions are fulfilled and the obstacles are gone so yes sure what he doesn't pray and you said that whoever does not pray at all not a single prayer is a kafir yes this is true however you cannot put this on that specific individual you're not with him 24/7 you don't see him every single second of the day he might pray when you enter the HAMP that the toilet he might pray when you go to the Masjid and pray he might pray at his home and he tells you he doesn't pray so so pardon me to jump to conclusions and to claim that a person is a kafir just out of the blue this is not permissible if a person prays on and off he's a Muslim he's in great danger he's committing a major sin and some scholar said that by abandoning one prayer until the time runs out this takes a person out of the fold of Islam but this is not authentic this is an opinion of scholars the most of authentic opinion is that if a person prays on and off he is committing a major sin he's in great danger but he is still a Muslim therefore why discourage people sinful people from fasting why do you come to them and say listen I hear you pray once a day you should not fast fasting draws them closer to Allah even if they're sinful even if they're committing a major sin you should not deter them from worshipping Allah you never know maybe by doing this by fasting they get closer to Allah so al to start praying and and observing their prayer on time"
