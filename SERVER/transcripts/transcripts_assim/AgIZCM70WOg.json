  "transcript": "abdelkader says i have a relative who is old age basically this woman has a savings of $20,000 in a fixed deposit account and she takes Reba out of it and she defends herself by saying that Allah is forgiving and Allah would forgive me so is there any logic in what she says and is she correct this is something that a deviant sect in Islam used to believe and they are called alum orgia and alum or gia a lot of those Muslims we know who fall into sin and who are defiant in making these things follow the same at either without knowing so they say as long as we say la ilaha illallah we're Muslims we can do anything and Allah will forgive our sins and this is total ignorance of a large division because if you knew Allah you would acknowledge that he is most forgiving most merciful but at the same time he is severe in punishment look at the Quran look at the authentic Sunna the Prophet tells us at a solution that Allah admitted a woman into hell because she locked up a kitten a cat neither she fed the cat nor let the cat go out and eat so the cat starved to death so because of a cat Allah admitted a woman to hell and there are so many examples of Allah's wrath and punishment as well as Allah forgiveness and merci so a logical person would never play Russian roulette because you never know when there would be a bullet in the chamber this is what you're actually doing you know that a la social has cursed those who deal in RIBA and you put your money in the fixed deposit account them a new consume it and you do not even show any type of remorse rather you defiant and saying that no no Allah will forgive me how do you know if Allah would forgive you the matters well I would come and steal your money and beat the heck out of you and claim that Allah will forgive me and others will kill others and claim Allah would forgive them and people would lie and people would backbite and people would cheat and people would do heinous things and claim Allah would forgive them this is not Islam this is not religion and this would not allow life to go on definitely this is a defect in people's thinking and whoever does that this thing is in great danger"
