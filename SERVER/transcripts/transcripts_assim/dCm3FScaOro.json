  "title": "Microblading Eyebrows - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "a lot of the women asked about micro bleeding and they say that this is something they do for the eyebrows this is tattooing because they slash the skin until it bleeds in the clean it and they open small places in the skins layer where they inject ink so they draw a nicely formed eyebrow with this ink and it shows with the remaining hairs of the eyebrows that it looks real and it looks fancy and it's fixed for six months for a year maybe two years this process is cursed by Allah so as well because this is totally tattooing you"
