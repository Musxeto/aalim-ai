  "title": "Affiliate marketing Writing reviews of products on websites that lead to haram sites assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "thank you first question you've asked which is what's the ruling on affiliate marketing what you're doing is advertising for these websites so if you're writing reviews of for example xyz.com for products of children and you say that the products are good the baby oil is fine the formula milk is healthy these are the reviews of the doctors this is halal however if you give reference to a particular website and the people visit it because you wrote a review of it and on their website there are many Haram things this is not permissible because you're endorsing them if you're just writing an article and you're not being paid for it you're just saying that this XYZ product is good and it's best value for your money without endorsing it without making or steering the public to their website and to watch Haram things there is nothing wrong in that insha Allah"
