  "title": "Is Exposing Others on Social Media the same as protesting? & Speaking ill about Muslim Rulers Assim",
  "transcript": "his third question was about protesting he says i know protesting is haram but what about if we expose people on social media and mention them them by name is this similar to protesting the answer is no however doing so on social media we have to look at the consequences of such an act exposing people if they're muslims you're backbiting them you're slandering them you are exposing what allah has ordered us to conceal but if there is a reason behind that so someone who's deviant someone who's calling others to innovation and you expose him so that he would not corrupt the akida of the muslims yeah this is understandable but again you have to refer to scholars and see whether the prose outweigh the khans or the other way around if what you're doing is about muslim rulers now this is a bigger issue because the muslim rulers control a muslim country and they have their own subjects and doing such acts and exposing them and speaking ill about them even if they're bad even if they're corrupt even if they're tyrants what you're doing would only add fuel to the fire and it's not part of the way of the salaf if you have something good to say go and speak to them directly sure they will take my head off i know but salafi you cannot do anything about this so the prophets hadiths all state that remain uh uh in your home keep the unity tight give your obedience to the muslim ruler and not to expose because whatever you do is gonna backfire against the muslims and this is why writing and protesting is not permissible"
