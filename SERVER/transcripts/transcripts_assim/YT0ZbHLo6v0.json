  "transcript": "Nazar from India I came to know from your past references about leaving the prayer in jamama by keeping hand to our nose and pretending to be get bleeded after breaking ablution but I am frightened to evade from the road due to being confronted by some ignorance about this and thereby I could be prevented from doing such things is there any other alternative Solutions against such scenario this is the Sunnah whenever you break your wo you just put your hand over your nose as if there is bleeding and leave the rose and go to perform wo if you're afraid of something even worse then just sit everybody would know that you're not praying and that you've broken your woodo but that would be disgraceful for you but if you fear that this is better than leaving the rose so be it"
