  "title": "Four types of fear #assimalhakeem #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "fear that is genuine and praised is what prevents you from doing sin this is what is Allah wanting from you to have this fear that stops you why don't you pray F in Masid the Masid is next door ah she it's the bed is cozy air condition is cold and I feel good sleeping you don't have fear then you are you have problems your fear takes you out of your bed to go and pray in the Masjid your fear makes you turn off the music when it's playing in the car your fear makes you cancel your Netflix and Showtime subscription and all the Haram because I fear Allah I don't want to go to hell this is the true genuine fear and when you say genuine fear does this mean that there are types of fears yes there are types of fears there is the mandatory fear what is that this is the fear that obligates you to do man mandatory things and prevents you from falling in Haram you have this fear you go to Jenna that's cool yeah this is the minim the bare minimum fear bare minimum it prevents me from going to hell yes but it is bare minimum because a better form of fear is the recommended fear and what is that it is the fear that makes you do more yes you did the obligations did you pray the Sunnah 12 ra no Allah made five prayers mandatory per day yeah but the Sunnah is a higher level hm I never know that it builds you a house in Jenna 12 rat a day that's easy I'll do it do you fast Mondays and Thursdays why would I do that I fast every Ramadan yeah but if you fast last Mondays and Thursdays Allah Asel would look at your Deeds every Monday and Thursday and approve it and the prophet Alam said about Monday it's a day I was born in and it's a day I was revealed to in so I love to fast it huh okay so this fear gives you an edge okay this is number two number three the fear of the incompetent the fear of the lazy ones this is your fear in mine what fear is that this is the fear we get when we listen to reminders reminders are like a whip when someone flogs you you feel the pain and you're hurting after a day or two the pain is gone and you forget so you need another Whip and a third and a tenth these reminders these gatherings with we come to attend to soften our hearts and to know our religion more these are whips in them we have this incompetent fear where we fear Allah we feel remorseful and we may cry and we try our level best and as soon as we go light a cigarette and enjoy life this fear is good because it's temporary and it might work it might extend a little bit maybe sometimes it extends for a whole week is a beautiful occasion to attend every week some of us benefit the whole week so it's like recharging so you are fully charged the full week and once the battery goes down before the red you attend the following jum and you recharge again the fourth type of fear is the prohibited fear o there is a prohibited fear yes when you go overboard this is the fear of Al when you feel that Allah is not going to forgive me when you feel no matter what I do Allah will put me in hell this causes and I do this in my counseling sessions so they come to me sheh I have this fear of Allah and they speak and they vent what is the problem look how shatan Works Shan comes to you from a very good door the door of the fear of Allah who hates fearing Allah it's a good door but then he opens it to an extent you cannot close it and what happens he says to you there is no hope for you but I'm afraid of Allah I say sh 50 times a day why I I someone said something I smiled so I committed shik someone said something and I thought of the prophet in a negative way so I committed kufur so he says Shada 50 times a day he takes a shower five times 10 times a day to embrace Islam after two three weeks he gets despaired of Allah's Mercy Allah is not going to forgive me Shan says yes Allah is not going to forgive you what to do Salah W they come to me in the hundreds they don't pray they don't fast they don't believe in Islam but they cry like babies in in the session I don't want to go to don't cry you are in hell this is called shock therapy you smash them on the face and then smash them again in the face they wake up they need this by the way so I said you're in I don't I said you don't pray said yes I'm afraid of no no no you're not afraid of Allah you afraid of Allah you pray today some of them are afraid of of death this is another negative fear I had a brother from the Gulf he came to me in a session and we have time H before lunch no problem so he came to me and he was terrified he looked like a pale chicken I don't know how a pale chicken looks but you understand so what's the problem he said I have this fear of death three years I've been Restless my wife divorced me because of it I lost my job I lost half of my weight sheh and for the past four weeks I cannot take a shower I do not pray and I said how long you've had this he said 3 years and I said did you die the GU of course not said you stupid  why said if you did not die in 3 years what will happen in 15 years and you don't die the GU said you going to live like this for 15 years is and this is a sign of weak AA come on what what does have to do with this if you know the six pillars of IM which the vast majority of Muslims you meet on the street you talk to them and you say to them what is the six pillars of Z no you stupid it's five I'm talking about the six oh new version 2.1 said no no no this is Iman and this is Islam so you say to them until you come to the do you believe in predestiny he said yes do you believe that you will die on a specific day he said yes can you be 1 minute early or 1 minute late he said no said why are you afraid look at you 3 years you've lost everything if you had Iman you would go and work so this kind of Iman the fourth type sorry this type of fear the fourth type of fear is the prohibited fear some people are so scared of things that move a tree that moves I can't go there why there is Jin there's come on this fear is very negative it shows that you don't have IM I don't want to get married why I don't want to become pregnant not not you of course the men this the guys yeah some of other men are pregnant M they're four months pregnant anyhow let's go back to the topic excuse me so they say I I get sisters like this I don't want to get married why because of I'm afraid of what of becoming pregnant so everybody's been becoming pregnant since haah peace be upon her said yeah yeah but I'm afraid that my child will grow in this environment and he cannot live and then there are lgbtq and there are car accident Subhan Allah if they had Iman and trust and on Allah all of these would not be around them"
