  "transcript": "the third question was that if the time is so tight that I could either pray the fault or the sooner what should I do definitely you should always prioritize praying the fund on time of course you were wrong in delaying and postponing that's a lot until the end of its time but probably had a legitimate reason for that maybe you woke up and it was already too late to pray both so you pray the fault prayer the obligatory mandatory prayer and afterwards even if the time was over and then of the second prayer was do you may pray the soon afterwards and make it up insha'Allah"
