  "transcript": "azim from India how are you and how is your first going on alhamdulillah shikh what is the ruling on wishing someone or Ramadan Mubarak when the ramzan starts and can we use the ramazan Karim this phrase please clarify it is part of the Customs among the Muslims to wish one another over these Seasons by saying Ramadan Mubarak I wish you a good Ramadan may Allah makes this Ramadan a blessed Ramadan and there is nothing wrong in that insha'allahu as for Ramadan Kareem some Scholars say that this is inappropriate because Ramadan is not generous in the sense that it has blessings and and good things to give for us it's Allah who is the one who gives these blessings and favors uh to us so it's inappropriate it's best to avoid it [Music] oh my God and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah foreign thank you"
