  "transcript": "whoever told you this most likely he is not a proper Muslim by believing this a pro a person would probably commit a an act of shik by feeding the Jin in this fashion it is ridiculous and it is nonsense that if a person recites the Quran which is his shield from the Jin and from the devils if he finishes it once a month or once every seven days or even once every 3 days that the Jin will capture him or would harm him this is nonsense the more you recite the Quran the further the Jin are away from you because it burns them those who are not Muslim and those who are Muslim would listen to it and would appreciate you for reting it because they either can't read or they're listening to the Quran they're musl and no one can harm you if you fear the Jin they will take control of you we have a saying in Arabic and that whoever fears a jinny then the jinny would come up to him and and terrifies him so if one of my daughters uh uh wants to go to the kitchen and she says I'm afraid it's dark I'm afraid of the Gin I tell her my daughter if the Jin you fear them they would intimidate imidate you and make you fear fearful of them but if you ignore them they will be afraid of you this this is mentioned in Surah Jin in the Quran that there were a group of men seeking and fearing the a group of the Jin so the Jin increase in intimidating them and making them afraid of them therefore ignore these ignorant people who say such nonsense don't fear anyone except Allah the more you recite the Quran the stronger you are as a Believer and the Jin would never ever come close to you and Allah Knows Best"
