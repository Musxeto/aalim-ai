  "transcript": "foreign [Music] but you will lose a lot everyone and I've seen like actually there are much other opinion of people seeing that footbed is actually mandatory so I was one for the people who actually have the argument that it's not mandatory for the what is the evidence what is the what the evidence evidence behind the evidence is mentioned in Surah where Allah azzawajal blamed the companions for leaving the prophet sallam to attend a caravan that came from Syria and sell and and buy and left him giving the khutba and Allah would not blame him for that if it was not mandatory the evidence is that it is prohibited and the transaction is void when a person buys and sells after the adhan which inaugurates the khutbah the last Adam the second event were the Imam after which star stands and gives the khutbah anyone who deals in selling and buying at that particular time the transaction is void and the sale is Haram the um consensus of Scholars to my knowledge is that the khutbah is part of the Friday speech Friday prayers if a person just stands up and prays to raqqa of jummah his prayer is invalid and the prayer of those behind him is also invalid because it was not preceded by so don't listen to people who keep on questioning the fundamentals of Islam and that those of things that the Muslims have been doing all of their lives worldwide it's not logical to someone saying Okay what is the evidence uh that and not three and not five who's questioning these questions you don't waste your time with such ignorant imbeciles leave them alone let them be and focus on learning your religion and practicing your religion in peace rather than speak with such people [Music] and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah"
