  "transcript": "a brother sent us an email saying if someone is scared of fornication and at the same time does not want responsibility of children but he has a good feeling that he will treat his wife with love and care can he get married and not have kids is this marriage Haram halal or makrooh first of all this is not normal but assuming that there is a particular individual who feels this way it's one of two either he does not want children forever or he wants children but after a month or a year or a period of time if it's the latter he wants to postpone and delay marriage for a year or two this is permissible if he does not want children at all this goes against the purpose of Martin of marriage and hence scholars different some say that the contract is invalid at all and others say the contract is valid but the condition is void meaning that the woman is not obliged to listen to him she can get pregnant and conceive and Allah knows best"
