  "transcript": "the for [Music] today with the grace of Allah we will unfold another page of the history of Islam we will talk about about one of the greatest CVS of Islam we will talk about the third calf of Islam Those whom Allah asael had blessed us with those whom the prophet Alat wasam died while he was well pleased with them Those whom Allah granted them the GL Tidings that they are in Paradise while they were walking the Earth we will talk about IB afan may Allah be pleased with him who was from the tribe of bani umayyah who was one of the dignitaries of qur who was one among the first to accept Islam some say that he was the sixth or the seventh to accept Islam in the early days of Islam and Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him gets the trophy for inviting him and for being the cause ofman to accept Islam may Allah be pleased with them all he is one of the 10 whom Allah gave the Glad Tidings that they are in paradise and he is known to be the one with the two light and what lights are they well he is the only one who got the honor to marry not one of the prophet's daughters to marry two of The Prophet's daughters may Allah be pleased with them all he married R and then after she died he married um Kum the prophet sallallahu alaihi alhi wasallam loved a lot and he gave him his daughter R in marriage and they say that no one had set eyes on a couple better thanan and Ray they were the happiest couple in Medina they were the happiest man and wife ever a person had seen may Allah be pleased with them all this is what you would expect from who was among those given the Glad Tidings of paradise and from R who is the daughter of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam but Ray was married before man and so was umum both of them were married to the cousins of the Prophet Alat wasam and the sons of ab who is the uncle of the Prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam who was cursed by Allah in who was damned and cursed by Allah and this chapter is one of the miracles of Islam why was that well it was simple this Surah was revealed in meccah when at the very early stages of Islam when the prophet Alam on the third year or the fourth year when he was instructed by Allah to announce publicly his message because he worshiped Allah three years in secrecy he would not publicly declare it and call people to Islam and that is why only a handful reverted and accepted Islam at the time but after 3 years were over Allah instructed him to to call all to Islam and this is what the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam did he went over the Mount of Safa and he called the people and they came and he told them if I were to tell you that beyond that mountain there's a fierce Army coming to attack you and to attack Mecca would you believe me they said yes we would we have never practiced any form of lie or deceit from your side you are the truthful and you are the trustworthy so he said if this is the case then I am warning you from Allah's wrath and from Allah's punishment believe in Allah the one and only subhanahu waala and they did not say a thing it was only Abu lahab his uncle who stood up and said damn you Muhammad is this why you have gathered us now and Allah revealed and at the time his two sons were married were engaged to andum but they were not husband and wife yet only it's an engagement and immediately ABAB went to his kids and said by Allah I will not talk to any one of you until you separate and divorce Muhammad's daughters and they immediately divorced their wives because they were the daughters of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and said something evil about our Prophet Alat wasam and out of disrespect so the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam supplicated to Allah and he prayed to Allah that he would make one of his dogs attack him and they traveled The Story Goes On they traveled with Abu lahab and his son to buy something from the north of Arabia on their route of trade and when they camped in an area they heard the sounds of wolves and lions so remembering this application of the Prophet Alam ABAB told his companions to make circles and he had his son sleeping in the circle so all of these circles were protecting and defending him and as they slept out of nowhere came this big great lion that made everyone terrified and he started jumping these circles until he reached and grabbed his head and left so they knew that this was the supplication of the Prophet Alat wasam this what made may Allah be pleased with him proposed to the prophet and marry and we know that the prophet Alat wasam had only four daughters who were these daughters this is inshallah what we will know after the break so stay tuned alayum and welcome back the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam had four daughters Zab may Allah be pleased with her and she was wedded to her cousin Abul before Islam because ab's mother was halah bid may Allah be pleased with her the sister of Khadijah bid may Allah be pleased with her and halah lived longer than her sister Khadijah and that is why the prophet Alat whenever he heard her voice coming to visit he would change and his face would be lit with happiness and joy s wasam it was reported thata may Allah be pleased with her said that once I heard the voice of halah asking for permission to enter and visit the prophet and then the minute the prophet heard the voice he said oh God this is Hal Anda being who she was a teenager a young girl the Beloved wife of the Prophet Alat wasam the most favorite among his wives felt a bit jealous felt a bit jealous from an old woman who died over 10 years ago imagine so she said oh prophet of Allah how many times do you remember this old dead corpse she's referring to Khadijah and she said this out of jealousy not out of disrespect how many times you remember this old corpse who had no teeth and her mouth and Allah had substituted you with someone who's better than her she's referring to herself being the only virgin that the prophet Alam had ever married the prophet had many wives none of them were a virgin except AA may Allah be pleased with her which indicates that he was not after lust he was not after desire he was not a womanizer as they the enemies of Islam portray or claim he to be sallallahu alai wasallam he did not marry a second wife until he was about 52 years old from the beginning of his life when he was 25 years old he married a 40 years old woman who was Khadijah and he loved her and he cherished her he did not think of marrying anyone else Sall alhi wasallam so when she said this to the prophet Alam the prophet was angered by it and he said alai wasallam by Allah Allah did not substitute me better than Khadijah she believed in me when people said you're a liar she comforted me with her wealth and with herself when people did not she gave me children where Allah Asel deprived me from children from other women and wives by Allah she was the love of his life and by Allah Allah did not substitute me one who was better than her and immediately AA fell on her knees and said I seek Allah's forgiveness by Allah I will not say anything bad about Khadijah this is Khadijah may Allah be pleased with her her sister was halah and her son was and that is why when he proposed to the prophet's daughters Zab Khadijah accepted and the prophet Alat wasam accepted him and this was before Islam of course he accepted Islam years later because in the beginning they used to live together until Zab accepted Islam and they departed because a Muslim woman cannot live with a non-muslim man even if he was her husband before Islam once she's a Muslim she has to separate from him if she lives with him she is an adulteress so she left him but still attached to him and he's attached to her they love each other and on the Battle of bad he was taken captive and he was a prisoner of war and the prophet Alam demanded ransom for them to be freed and he did not fight with the pagans he just went there just to be there but he did not fight and he did not kill anyone and he did not engage in fighting that was is why he was captivated and when Zab may Allah be pleased with her heard that her husband was among the captive she took off a necklace that was given to her on the day of her marriage by her mother and she sent it to the prophet Prophet sallallahu alaih Al wasallam as a ransom to be paid for her husband whom she has not seen for years but she was not divorced and the prophet when he saw this necklace he remembered his wife Khadijah and he addressed the people saying to them would you leave for me would you set him free without demanding money for him and they said to the prophet yes we would do that oh prophet of Allah and the prophet set AB free without demanding any Ransom from him or from his family simply for the sake of his daughter Zab Abul went to meca gave back all the things that were deposited with him gave back the merchandise gave back the money that the people asked him to trade with and then migrated to Medina and accepted Islam and the prophet wasam gave him back his wife zanab without a new contract because the old contract was not nullified because neither of them because zanab did not marry so the contract Ra was still as it is and from this we learn a lesson that is if two if a couple one of them Embraces Islam especially the woman and she remains unmarried for three or four years without having a divorce and then the man accepts Islam they are man and wife again they don't have to renew the contract because this is the case that took place with zanab so this was the first daughter of the prophet r as we've learned she was married to she was divorced and thenb afan may Allah be pleased with him who is the topic of today's program married her and they were happily married and she migrated withman to abisinia man was the first to migrate to abisinia he was wealthy and he wanted to worship Allah freely and he got the permission from the prophet Alat and he migrated there he stayed few years and we all know about the story of the envoys of the pagans from qur coming to talk to anashi the ruler of ABIA trying to talk him to send the Muslims back to their people where jab AB Talib the cousin of the Prophet Alam said his eloquent speech convincing the ruler of ABIA of their just cause aan was present but he did not talk why was that simply because he was not an articulate person he was not a man of speeches and long talks or orations it was not his field and that was why he remained silent and gave gave the floor to ja Talib they stayed in ABIA for a while and then they got the permission to migrate to Medina and they stayed there until the prophet Alam came and they were reunited again but sadly on the second year while they were in Medina she fell sick she was extremely ill to the extent thatman had to nurse her 24/7 and every day she got sicker on that year as we know the prophet alhat wasam went out of Medina to fight the pagans in what was known to be the Battle of Badr and he permitted Usman to remain with his wife R the daughter of the Prophet Alat wasam and after the battle was over and the Muslims were victorious the prophet Alat gave the Warriors who were part of that battle their bounties of war and he also gave a man's share to him though he did not participate yet he said that he is among you and one of you and that is why I'm giving him his portion I am the one who permitted him to stay or instructed him to stay and nurse my daughter unfortunately she died soon afterwards and after she died the prophet Alat wasam immediately asked him to marry his second daughter umum and he gave her to him in marriage and and they lived happily ever after until Subhan Allah Allah decreed that also Kum to fall ill and die so he was married to two of The Prophet's daughters and this is an honor Beyond any other honor people who prefer Ali may Allah be pleased with him Ali was married only to Fatima which was the fourth daughter of the prophet Alam he was only married to Fatima but was married to two of The Prophet's daughters may Allah be pleased with them all and when umum died did the prophet Alat wasam feel negatively about Usman never he said by Allah if I had a third daughter I would given it to him but I do not therefore people of Medina give man a wife let him marry from you because this man is worthy of being trusted is is worthy of being loved because he is a good husband he is a good man this wasman may Allah be pleased with himman was close to the prophet Alat and so many times we hear that the prophet Sall was with Abu Bakr and Omar andman came while with the prophet sallam and his companions was close to the prophet and why was that not because of his lineage but because of his character he was not an articulate person who would give eloquent speeches to the prophet Alam and amazes him by that he was not someone who would stand out in the crowd and you can distinguish him from everybody else but he had this characteristic in him that everyone loved him for that is he was a tolerant person he was a kind person he was not tough and rough he was a kind and tolerant person and above all he was a bashful person and this is something something that not only the prophet loved him for but also the angels of Allah loved for this beautiful characteristic this is all the time we have for today's program so until we meet next time [Music] the Cs of Islam may Allah be pleased with them all were all different people there were not clones from from each other each one had his own individual personality yes each one of them followed to the letter the Quran and the Sunnah each one of them was given the Glad Tiding to be in Paradise but they were different from one another Abu Bakr was the most merciful and the kindest of all as described by the prophet Alam in the Hadith Omar was the toughest in the religion of Allah as also described by the prophet and was the most bashful that he would not do things that would affect his reputation and this is what is known as Al where your reputation counts and you would not do do anything that tarnishes it and you would not abandon doing lawful and legal things and that is why the prophet Alat loved tremendously may Allah be pleased with him was not only that he was not like Abu Bakr an excellent orator he was not like aliali be pleased with them an excellent Warrior and judge he was in a category of his own yes he worshiped Allah asael a lot and he was known to pray night prayer a lot it was known thatman may Allah be pleased with him had studied the Quran extensively he had his own copy that he wrote himself and he memorized the Quran completely himself it was known that he sometimes recited and read the Quran in night prayer in one night this wasman may Allah be pleased with him he was so much engaged in documenting and noticing the prophet Alat wasam he was a great worshipper of Allah the almighty and that is why whenever we perform w we always remember because it was him who reported to us who narrated to us the Hadith of the Prophet Alat wasam everyone knows that may Allah be pleased with him once called for water to be brought to him then he performed wo in an excellent form with an excellent description and then he said said I have seen our Prophet Alam perform Wu in the same fashion and manner as you have seen me and then the prophet said to us sallallahu alaih wasallam whoever performs Wu like I have performed it and then praise two R without talking to himself without wandering with his thoughts Allah will forgive all of his previous sins this Hadith everyone knows and everyone knows that a is the one who narrated it everyone knows the great Hadith where the Prophet saysat the best among you are those who learn the Quran and teach it and that is why it wasman may Allah be pleased with him who recited the Quran who taught the Quran who had his disciples and students to learn the Quran from him and finally who had all the copies of the Quran gathered and compiled to one copy which was known to be the copy ofman may Allah be pleased with him and we will come to explain more on that inshallah later on as I've said earlier thatman was not like the other khalifas he was not like the other Cals of Islam why because he was different since was a multi-millionaire by the standards of Arabia at the time he was the richest well if you don't want to say that he was one of the richest if not the richest of the Arabs and of the companions of the Prophet alai that is why he was not like Omar Omar may Allah be pleased with him would eat only bread and some oil if there was oil and in the year of rad as known R which was a year of great drought and famine in Medina Omar may Allah be pleased with him refrained from eating anything that was extra no meat no beautiful food at all and he tied a stone to his stomach to prevent it from feeling the anguish of hunger and whenever his stomach made sounds he said say whatever you want to say by Allah you will not eat properly until all the Muslims eat properly this was omaran was not like thatman came from a very rich family and he himself was rich so he used to eat whatever money could buy not that he ate a lot he was not a fat person he used to fast a lot of days during the year he used to fast and pray night prayer but when the food was served he would not go for the bad qualities of food no he used to go for the best qualities of food because this was something that he could afford he would refrain from Haram he would not engage himself in sin or consume something that had sin into it so no interests no embezzlements no bribes nothing that could be classified as forbidden man would not engage in that at all he was among the most knowledgeable Companions of the Prophet Alam when it came to rituals of Haj of pilgrimage he was the one to be asked and he used used to perform Hajj regularly may Allah be pleased with him and as stated before being rich did not mean that he would stand out in a crowd no he was one of the richest if not the richest companion of the Prophet Alam but he looked like them he lived like them and he behaved like them and this indicates to us that if Allah Asel blesses you with money and wealth this should be apparent upon you but not so that you can stand out in the crowd you should be like anyone else wear modest modern and beautiful clothes ride nice and affordable cars live in nice nice places but do not exaggerate do not live in mansions with 100 rooms while there's only you and your wife do not ride a car that is in the millions while this would break the hearts of the people and would consider it to be spending money not in its lawful means we have a short break so stay tuned alayum and welcome backb aan may Allah be pleased with him he was a close companion to the prophet Alat wasam but the thing that most people remember about aan is his generosity is his spending the money in the cause of Allah Asel without looking back at all he may Allah be pleased with him heard the prophet Alat am once encouraging the people to spend in the cause of Allah and this was at a time where people were thirsty because the sources of water were almost dried out in Medina and there was only this big well The Well of Ruma they used to call Wells Gardens even animals with names so that they would relate and know these things this was the customs of the Arabs at the time so the Muslims would go to this wicked Jew to drink from the well and he would deprive them from doing that soan may Allah be pleased with him when he saw that the Muslims were thirsty he went to the Jew and said I'll buy the weal from you name your price so the Jew named a very high price andman Paid It All upfront the wicked Jew said toan well I'll sell it to you on one condition that one day is yours and the other day is mine so we split the whole week into two one for you and one for mean accepted me Allah be pleased with him and when it was the day ofman he made the well open to all Muslims so all Muslims came and they took the water from the well so that the following day the Jew came and did not find in water in his share and the other day it was Forman andman again left it for the Muslims and only then the Jew this wicked Jew realized that he did not benefit from it so he bargained again withman andman bought his share and he gave the whole well entirely to the Muslims once the prophet alisat wasam was encouraging people to spend in the cause of Allah so that he would go with the Army to the battlefield and to fight the disbelievers the enemies of Islam so the prophet is encouraging the people Amman stood up remember there were scores of Muslims who could not find a camel to ride there were Muslims who were willing to walk but could not find armor to take and carry with them to that extent the prophet encouraged the people to give Aran stood up and said prophet of Allah I will give 100 camels for the cause of Allah with all its armor food and Saddles and the prophet Alam smiled and then he encouraged the people to give again andman stood up again and said oh prophet of Allah a second hundred I'll give and the prophet encouraged the people andman stood up and said oh prophet of Allah the thir hundred is on me and then the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam smiled and said masallah he praised and said it would not harm whatever he does after today anything this is what they call card blanch anything thatman does it would not affect him it would not harm him may Allah be pleased with him he used to spend generously for the cause of Allah the almighty when the prophet wanted to go and fight the Romans in what is known as he did not have money so he encouraged people and this was a very difficult Journey it was about 800 kilomet about 600 miles to the north of Arabia and it was hot it was summer and they did not have a ride and some of them went to the prophet Alam to ask him for assistance in providing them with a ride to go and travel with him to fight and he turned them down saying that I have nothing to offer you and they went back we weeping and crying because they wanted to fight in the cause of Allah and they do not have the means to do so this was described in Surah atba chapter n the prophet Alam encouraged the people to spend and in comes may Allah be pleased with him with a thousand dinar not a Dirham a dinar is composed of 10 Dirham a th000 dinar which is probably equivalent to $100,000 or so and he came and he poured it in the prophet's lap sallallahu alai wasallam and the prophet's face was lit with joy and he saidman nothing would harm him after what he had done may Allah be pleased with him there are hadiths which state that the prophet Alam treated him differently than the others Abu Bakr would ask for permission to enter the prophet's house and the prophet allows him Omar asks for the permission the prophet allows himman asks for the permission the prophet stops and sits down and prepares his clothings and the way he sits and then he allows him Ina says to him why did you do the same with Abu Bakr and om he said shouldn't I be bashful from a man whom the angels are bashful of him I was afraid that if I was at ease thatan would come and feel bashful or shameful from asking me for things he want and then he would not ask me for what he wants so that's why I sat properly and met him in a manner that would make him ask me whatever he wanted to asked without any doubt is in Paradise but the prophet gave him this glad Tiding with a Calamity that would strike him the prophet Alam was once in a garden and Abu musar was his doorman Abu Bakr came asked for permission to enter Abu Musa went to the prophet Alam the prophet approved of it and said let him in and give him the Glad Tidings that he'll be in Paradise so he did and then Omar came and asked for permission the prophet allowed him and told Abu Musa to tell him that he is in Jenna he's in Paradise whenman came the prophet told Abu Musa tell him that he will be in J with a Calamity that would strike him and said he sought The Refuge in Allah Asel from This calamity what was This calamity thisal it was his assassination which was one of the darkest pages in the history of Islam six years have passed from his Calamity and prosperity was everywhere in the Muslim World on the sixth year One Man by the name of Abdullah the Jew who was black and wicked claiming to be a Muslim he's the founder of a deviant sect among the Muslim world one of the largest sects in Islam the founder is a Jew his name is Abdullah Sabah started spreading rumors calling people to back up alib Talib as the legitimate ruler of Islam instead ofman and spreading the rumors all over thatan was corrupt and was calling favors to his relatives and there were Hypocrites and there were people with no knowledge ignorant people who believed him so they started causing problems they even went into Medina and surrounded the house ofan the CIF the ruler of the Muslims the companion of the Prophet they did this with their army and the companions could not tolerate this alali put on the turban of the Prophet alai took his sword went out of his house to the house ofman who was besieged who was surrounded by these terrorists and he took with him Al Hassan Al Hussein his sons Abdullah Omar and also Abu Hur great warriors of Islam they went into his house nobody could stop them and they saidan let us defend you let us kill these people and turn them away from you you are the ruler of Islam man may Allah be pleased with him said I will not meet Allah with a drop of blood of a Muslim in my neck in my responsibility if I have any right among you please go home I will be patient and I will accept whatever Allah is to bestow upon me and they surrounded man they asked Ali to lead the prayer in the Masjid and he said you want me to lead the prayer while our IM and ruler is surrounded by these holigans by Allah I will not pray and he prayed alone it was times of calamities and of fitna they surrounded him they deprived him from drinking and if they left him he would have died out of thirst he was the son of an 80 years old he was 80 years old and that is why he did not want anyone to fight for his sake and they surrounded him tightened it up and then came the night that they decided to barge in his house that night he was praying he was reciting the Quran he was thirsty they would not let water in they would not let food in they would not let anyone end except his wife and he was 80 years old the Third kif the best companion of the Prophet Alam he told them and reminded them didn't you hear the prophet Alat wasam shake hands with himself and say that this is on behalf ofman when I went to quray in the Treaty of hudia didn't you hear the prophet alhat wasam give me portion of the shares of the bounties of bad because I was nursing his daughter didn't you hear the prophet sayat nothing would harm after today when I gave him the money for the Battle of tabuk and when I bought The Well of Ruma didn't you hear all of this and they say yes we heard but still they insisted on killing him because they were led by this Jew Abdullah may Allah curse him so they barged into his house and they stabbed him and killed him may Allah be pleased with him and he himself on that day he said I have seen the prophet wasam when his wife managed to smuggle some food and water to him after the break of dawn and she told him eat and drink he said the prophet alham came to me and told me thatman today you will break your fast with us in Paradise so I know that today is my last day and I'm fasting Subhan Allah in his age in such a Calamity in such stress and pressure he's fasting he's relaxed he knows that they will kill him but he hopes in the reward that he will find at the side of Allah he knows the prophecy of the Prophet Alam that he will be in Paradise but after Suffering From This calamity and he's seeing it he believes and have his great belief in the vision he saw and he knows that this is the last day for him on Earth and that was the case they assassinated afan they killed this martyr may Allah be pleased with him and we believe that he is with our prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam in Paradise this is all the time we have for today's program until we meet next time Al"
