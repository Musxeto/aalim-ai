  "title": "Can we draw characters with a disconnected or floating head? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Hamza from Morocco. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. Sheikh I have a question regarding developing a video game. Is it permissible to draw characters with floating limbs and head and just not to imitate the creation of Allah? It is to draw what? To draw characters with disconnected head like without a neck so it doesn't look alive. No, no this is not permissible. The head being present, whether you leave a gap or a line between the head and the body to insinuate that it's not connected so it's not alive, this doesn't work. The picture is the head. Yes if you put a body with limbs but no head, that's totally fine. If you put a body with a head but no facial features, again this is fine when it's 2D, when it's drawing, not an actual statue and Allah knows best."
