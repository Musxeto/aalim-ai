  "transcript": "Hamza from Sweden. Assalamu Alaikum. Walaikumussalam. I have a question regarding that was it called like is a masjid considered like a masjid if they for example they there's a place where it's normally like an apartment and then they're just renting out like a room like they're like a small part of the building is it considered like a masjid? No this is called a prayer it is called a prayer hall and when you enter it it is not mandatory for you to pray two rakah tahiyyat al-masjid because this is not a masjid and it can also be admitted by women who are in their menses this is just a prayer hall it doesn't have the sanctuary of a full-fledged masjid that was a waqf endowment that was devoted totally for Allah Azza wa Jal. It can't be sold, it can't be rented, it can't be gifted or inherited."
