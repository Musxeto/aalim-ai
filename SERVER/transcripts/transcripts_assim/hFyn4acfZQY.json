  "transcript": "Qadir from Turkey, from Turkey, Qadir. Assalamu Alaikum. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi. BarakAllah Wafeekum Sheikh. Wafeekum BarakAllah. I wanted to ask if someone made zina in Ramadan and he repented to Allah for his expiation. He didn't want to fast for 60 days and he paid an amount that can feed for 60 people to a man who was collecting money for the poor people and he said to him that I want you to feed this amount of money for 60 people. Sheikh, for that expiation is it valid or not? Any intercourse during the daytime of Ramadan, whether it is halal such as in the case of marriage or haram such as in the case of fornication or adultery or zina, this is a major sin and it has to be expiated in the same order that the Prophet alayhis salatu was salam indicated. Number one, free a slave. We don't have slaves nowadays. Then you go to number two, you have to fast 60 consecutive days, two consecutive months. If a person is sick or has a legitimate reason that is valid with Allah, not just because oh what would I say to the people, I have work, I have this. No, this is not valid. You've done a major sin and you have to pay for that and paying for that is by fasting two consecutive months. If a person is unable to do this, then we go to option number three, which is to feed 60 poor Muslims and you must ensure that they're being fed and not given the money in cash. And this is the order it has to be in. If a person can fast but he went to the third option and fed 600 people, not 60, it doesn't work and Allah knows best."
