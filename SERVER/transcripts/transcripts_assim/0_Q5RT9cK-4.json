  "title": "I'm certain that Imam mispronounces the word Allathina though he can say it correctly, what to do?",
  "transcript": "IM of the mid says with a hard D sound so it is La no like la like more like D sound in it and he does not do it every single time but sometimes like 50% of the times and I am 100% sure of it and I also know that he knows how to say it correctly so what should I do in this situation ask the other congregation ask the other worshippers and if they agree with you then yes you repeat the prayer and pray on your own but most likely from several cases that I've encountered people like you may have a problem with OCD they think that they're 100% certain that the Imam made a mistake but when they ask everyone else said no it was fine so give it the benefit of the doubt and ask other worshippers not one or to other worshippers and if they confirm then you have to do something about it and repeat the prayer"
