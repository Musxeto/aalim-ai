  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Saudi Arabia yes I want to know when to use Ma Shaa Allah   and baraak Allah what are the \ndifference between these two okay first of all to ward off to stop \nand prevent an evil eye from happening   from you against others the Sunnah is to \nsay Allahuma baarik or Baarak Allah lak   and some would say tabarak Allah but this is not \nvery strong so when you make a Dua with Baraka   from Allah blesses it this blocks your evil eye \nyou won't inflict evil eye on that individual   others say that in Suratul Kahf when one \nof the guys was telling his friend that   had you said this statement when you saw your \ngarden and how beautiful it is Ma shaa Allah   to stop and prevent yourself from giving an evil \neye to your own possessions a lot of the scholars   say that this also prevents an evil \neye specifically to your own stuff   not to others but a lot of the scholars \nsay that it does the job mentioning the   name of Allah by saying Ma shaa Allah when \nyou see a beautiful car or nice children   playing around and and their uh hyper \nthis blocks your evil eye as well but   definitely saying Allahuma Baarik is the \nstrongest and the most authentic of all"
