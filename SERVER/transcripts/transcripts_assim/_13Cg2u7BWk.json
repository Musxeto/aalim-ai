  "transcript": "do not mention anybody on live television how would you feel if someone asks me about your father on live television and i answer by any answer this is disrespectful i don't know who this person is i've never heard his name but it is inappropriate to come on live television asking about scholars or dahis or sheikh and to make this as a personal vendetta if you have an ill intention allah will not leave you believe me and take this for granted and if you're sincerely asking to learn you can do that privately not on public platforms or social media because this is tarnishing the person's name yes if this person is a well-known deviant innovator he's exposed by the way he don't need me to say anything about him everybody knows that about him so there is no need to mention the name"
