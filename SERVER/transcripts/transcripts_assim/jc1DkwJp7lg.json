  "transcript": "I'm a web designer and my question is can I work with uh hair salons and use pictures of woman whose only hair is uncovered for their website like what do you think uh I don't know like to display the inside inside what do you think I'm 5050 honestly okay so the rule is as mentioned in chapter five in the beginning Allah says collaborate upon virtue and righteousness and do not collaborate upon evil or sin and transgression so it is not permissible for me to Market someone who uses Haram because this means that I end the Haram if I design a website for a hair saloon of women and I put the pictures of women hair even if it's from the backside and the face of the woman is not appearing isn't this hair isn't it tempting so it is not permissible for me to endorse them or to Market their products let alone that I know in hair saloons they have Haram activities as well such as plucking the eyebrows such as whitening the skin such as maybe full body uh manicure and and body cure and and and the likes so this is not permissible and Allah Knows Best"
