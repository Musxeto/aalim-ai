  "title": "Can those who work on a Ship Shorten & Combine Prayers & what about Jummah",
  "transcript": "workers must go to the ceiling for certain period of month within this period they need to move from to one platform to another is it they considered it they consider residing or traveling in the same they can combine their player because they have their own accommodation they stay on the vessel you do are you talking about sailors sellers and offshore workers okay so this is a an issue of dispute among scholars the vast majority consider these sailors to be travelers and there are some scholars who consider them to be residing because they're 24 7 for months without end on their vessels traveling from one place to the other but they have their accommodation they have their cabins they know their times of prayer the morning and evening i am inclined to follow the opinion that says that they are travelers so they can combine they can shorten their prayers they don't have any jummah because they're not residing in a village or a town they are travelers like nomads so there is no juma upon them none whatsoever even if they travel for six months which is a little bit far-fetched you know usually it is four to five weeks and then they'll have time off so yes they are exempted from completing the prayers they can shorten and they can combine if needed then we have muhammad from the u.s you"
