  "transcript": "sh I have a question around SP uh my older sister um she's quite old and she prays on a chair uh I guess because her knees are bad so I noticed um many times whenever it's time for her to pray she always walks around to get like a like a prayer match to put in front of her chair and jokingly I said like why do you do this because you're you're not going to really be going on the floor what's the reason for this and we we then started to discuss the idea of you know if she doesn't use it does this count as b or not so I wanted to get your opinion on it sh if she does this thinking that her prayer is invalid or that it is more rewarding and better for her prayer to have it in front of her yes this is a without any doubt because the concept of prayer mats do not exist in Islam the prophet saidat in an authentic Hadith the Earth has been made for me a place of prayer and a means of purification which means that wherever the prayer is due just simply pray whether you're in an airport or in a mall the the ground is in front of you oh she maybe someone walked with soiled feet or shoes maybe there's an NASA maybe does not is not applicable in Islam the default is everything is pure until proven otherwise the ground is pure let me pray oh don't you like a prayer mat I don't need one so the concept of no I have to pray on a Prayer mat when there is no impurity on the ground is baseless nevertheless people find comfort in doing it as part of the ritual which makes it an innovation now if she says no I don't believe that it has anything to do with my prayer or and it doesn't increase my reward and it's not mandatory but I feel good when I see it in front of me there's nothing wrong in that it's just a feeling and that's totally fine"
