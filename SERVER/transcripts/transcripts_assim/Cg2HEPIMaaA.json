  "transcript": "and her third question that another hadith whoever performs a good do a good Woodill and walks to the message Allah writes for him one good deed with every step he makes and he raises a bad deed and allah elevates him one degree so she's saying what kind of degree is this this degree is in general because we know that the jannah is made of degrees of levels and the highest of them all is paradise and the sealing of paradise is the throne of Allah the Almighty so the more you walk to the Masjid for men the more steps they make and the more levels they are elevated in Jannah and a large region knows best"
