  "transcript": "brother sends us a question saying how to get rid of with wasps of Satan about cover I always have this with wasps that I have left the folds of Islam with wasps is an Arabic terminology which refers to what lingers in your mind the whispering of Satan of the Devils of your evil soul so this is a wish wasps the last chapter of the Quran chapter 114 Allah mentions this and describes Satan of being an ass with wasps us.we sophiadoran ass he whispers in people's chests and minds and tried to infest it with things that would make them doubtful depressed tange stressed etc so brother is asking how do we fight this Satan huge uses a lot of different means in trying to infiltrate your defense mechanism so he either comes to you through desires and whims and lusts so he takes you away from the straight path or he comes to you through doubts about religion about Allah about the and about the Sunnah doubts can be easily fought through knowledge I get tens of people calling me every week complaining of OCD obsessive-compulsive disorder having thoughts of this having thoughts of that and there's there there's always a problem for them and I keep telling them if you learn Islam properly if you read the Quran read the AFC read the sunnah of the prophet Isaiah read the commentary on the sinner know your religion know fib then all of these doubts would be vaporized it would disappear into thin air because Satan has no breeding grounds his breeding grounds is your ignorance when you don't know your religion so when you know your religion you know you're a kid that you know your Lord and you have full confidence in your religion whenever these doubts come they are usually blocked there is no way that it can infiltrate or penetrate your defense mechanism because you're holding on to the Rope of knowledge and Islam of the Quran etc so how do we fight these whispers first of all you have to acknowledge that blocking these thoughts fighting them refusing to contemplate upon them refusing to author a single word to anyone about them or acting about them acting upon them in this case Allah would forgive you so whatever goes into my mind if I don't speak about it if I do not act upon it and if I do not contemplate and I say hmm that sounds to myself that is logical no I keep on fighting it and trying to block it Allah would not hold me accountable for it and may Allah make it easy for you"
