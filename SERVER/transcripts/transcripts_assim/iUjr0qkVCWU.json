  "transcript": "imran says can parents gift their children or one of them a property but with the condition that it should be theirs after the parents death this is something that a lot of the muslims unfortunately do nowadays in order to reduce the amount allocated to their siblings so usually if i have daughters and no sons as in my case two-thirds of my wealth will go to my daughters one-eighth would go to my wife if she's still alive may i give her a long life and the rest will be allocated to my siblings a lot of the muslims don't feel good about this and say why should i work and then my brothers and sisters get the rest of my wealth so what they do they look at their property and they say okay daughter number one you get this daughter number two you get this no dora number ten you get this and they distribute everything but they don't want to give it to them while they're alive so that the daughters won't sell it and enjoy and waste the money or give it to their kids or their husbands etc so they met make a condition so they say okay this property is yours only after i die this is not a valid gift and if i were to die every allocation of such gifts that were to be effective after my death would be void and the will would be torn out and thrown away why because if i give you a gift it is not a valid gift until you have possession of it so if i say to you okay next year is your marriage masha allah i will give you five air conditioners split units 24 000 whatever and you say you're happy masha'allah next year comes i've got the units in my house and you get married and you say okay give me my gift i said i changed my mind you have no authority on forcing me to give you something because i just promised you this gift is not valid until they have possession over it so the gift that parents give to their children effective after their death is invalid it's void has no value none whatsoever and i hope this answers your question you"
