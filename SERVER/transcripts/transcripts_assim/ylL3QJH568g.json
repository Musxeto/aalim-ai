  "transcript": "and evidence of course is there for you to read number 12 exceptions now we must not use comfort Orca for when washing I'm a person who died in the state of Iran we mentioned this yesterday and we mentioned it today why tell via no because he's in the state of the from and a person in the state of harm can he poops can he put perfume at all he can put perfume before before aha so if I'm going for ambra I go and take a full shower I put my deodorant I put musk or perfume in my beard and my hair in my body nothing on the clothes overcome and then I wear the clothes over ha and then I say libecki Lahoma ombres once I say it and intended Hollis I'm not allowed to put anything but before that I am allowed to put whatever I want on the body not on the clothes number 13 we came to mention this which is the exception and Men washing women it is permitted in the case of a man washing his wife or a woman washing her husband and the evidence is that the prophet alayhi salatu salam once came in to the house and aisha had a headache and she said oh my head i have a headache what did the prophets that is awesome in your books it's the second hadith not the first one in number 13 all my head and then okay because there are some translations throughout the book which states that all my head because of your pain as if the property is Addison saying that no it's not your headache it is that my headache that I'm having before you when this is an advocate it's commonly used when a child says to his father and father would not say it when a child says to his mother or my mother my stomach hurts very bad she says out of compassion and love I wish it was mean at you the father would not say that they go take a pass Brennan sleep do something take five times and going by candy but the mother is more any a compassionate and loving and caring in the hadith here the actual translation is is a complaint from her headache may Allah be pleased with her the Prophet said no I have a headache seriously so the Prophet also was suffering from a headache himself not feeling compassionate to I shall know he himself and this is the most authentic translation and then he went on to say I this awesome what would harm you if you were to die before me I would wash you shroud you pray for you and bury you and this is a clear indication that a man can wash his wife isn't it profit is saying this I salaam what did I should say she said masha'Allah I bet that if this happens immediately we go to what one of your wives she didn't care about health dying and being buried in alas no she's still thinking out of jealousy but ok what will you do after it you wrote your wives no no no I don't want this now one don't want to die to be washed by you I want it to be as it is so that you don't go to your wives and this is human nature jealousy is natural in women don't ever think that you can marry again without having your wife jealous brothers come to me and said yeah he my wife masha'Allah she says if you want to get married get married she's so supportive she's looking for another wife for me poor thing well I will she will tear you into small parts and bury you this is against human nature there isn't any woman would do this maybe because of your pressure because of your nagging because of your comparison every time you say you see food or if my second wife so this inshallah how Allah will grant me a wife that cooks better that iron the clothes better that looks better that than men stupid with all due respect were stupid men who do this yeah you're having a wife and you're happy with her why do you torture her like this sadashiv how is joking it's a bad joke imagine if she comes you say well lie if I can marry a man who 64 and his muscles like Arnold Schwarzenegger and he drives like Michael Schumacher and he looks like Tom Cruise not like you what would you say but you are home you're divorced she can't say that unfortunately so be realistic don't torture your wife if you must marry Mary this is a las right to you but don't torture her with a dull knife you have to sharpen your knife and you have to be kind to the big question mark to tie a tie how much do we have ok ok where were we as long so it is permissible for a man to wash his wife a wife to wash her husband this was done in the Sunnah as Matt Ben Thomas you remember as much amazed the wife of the three great companions jaffna vitaly abu bakr and adeeb novita lib she herself washed abu bakr nella be pleased with her on his will because he wrote in his will that asthma would wash me and a lot of the wives would like their husbands to wash them why because they're the closest people to them a lot of the woman says say that I don't want other women coming and washing me my husband knows everything out may have seen me and any I would not he would not be exposing anything now with the husband do that brothers who are married if your wife tells you you should wash me would you do that raise your hands please masha'Allah they all eager to watch their wives yeah hey good for you ok number 14 who should wash at that person priority logically speaking those who are more knowledgeable but according to the Sharia it should be the person appointed by the deceased so when I die I say brother Mohammed will wash me after I die someone else comes my son comes my brother comes say no no I want to wash him we say it's not up to you it's up to the will so if I wrote this I I instructed this this is how what should be communicated Secutor if I didn't then by logic the first one to wash not the relatives those who are knowledgeable what good would it do for me if my son or my brother wash me and they don't know how to treat a dead person I'd rather have Tom Dick or Jerry of course Muslims they didn't change the names come and wash me because they are knowledgeable and taking care of the body and taking care of the proceedings the hadith of Ali's is there for you to read now is there any reward for those who wash the deceased yes great reward providing two conditions are fulfilled one that he does this and does not reveal what he sees so many times people after the washing of the Dead the people come out said you are here I saw something I've never seen in my life so much filth coming out of him you're a law as if we were in the sewer and his face was black and his eyes popped out and then came back again what are you doing I'm just saying I'm just telling what happened now this is haram it is forbidden for you to see to say anything bad that you saw now the good things you had seen it is not mandatory for you to review its okay its permissible but it's not mandatory but if it's bad it is forbidden for you to reveal at all the prophecies and in salatu salam whoever washes a muslim and hides of him any dislike thing Allah will forgive him 40 times but once a las once it forgives my sins allow it forgive you 39 times more which means that this would erase inshallah all of your sins and whoever shrouds him Allah will call him in silk engine etc okay number two the second condition that when you wash the disease you do this for the sake of Allah and sincerity and everything sins before be any backing it up it's on loan to you and sharla and it's in the book all forms of worship all deeds must be for the sake of allah azzawajal right is it the cherry to have a total bath after a wash the deceased there was a hadith before and was obligated that whoever washes that that person must take a lotion and whoever carries a dead person must make me do but this was abrogated and it was left to be recommended if you do it and have the life you don't then there is nothing wrong in that now an issue of washing the martyred it's an issue of dispute it's not an issue of this with the dog the washing a person who was martyred in battle by the consensus of scholars that you do not wash him and you shot him in his own clothes providing it covers his body and you bury him the difference is whether should we pray funeral prayer or not but as I explained yesterday I think that if the person dies in the battlefield affected by his wounds then he is a Shaheed ok how would I know that he died affected by his wounds immediately they say if he eats then he's not affected by his wounds what do you mean if someone is wounded in the battle field and he's bleeding and he said he'd bring me a hamburger I'm very hungry and he eats a hamburger and five minutes later he dies they say that this is not a Shaheed in the battlefield he is to be washed as a normal person why because this pause means that he was not directly dead or affected by the wounds on the spot if he died on the spot and Allah okay what about if he asks from for water and he drinks water the scholars say no no water is different because you can drink water while you are dying but you cannot eat while you're dying someone is dying you cannot see okey I need this rice and brioni of looking spicy please he's dying haha he would not go and ask about food water yes all dying people ask for water and when you give dying people water don't give them a lot give them only drops because what would the dying person need with water it's to water his throat make sure that he can speak his mouth is dry don't give him access amount of water but food no so there is the hadith of first hadith of Jabbar when the Prophet Isom said buried them in their blood his father his uncle was brought to Medina from ahad they were marching in a herd and then the prophet sent to them no send them back to be buried where they died and they were sent back and they were buried in their clothes and with their bleeding the second hadith of abu Barzeh of july beba july beep was an ugly companion very ugly very pool yet the Prophet club Tamara salsa and in so many cases he would come from behind him when one incident he came from behind him and he embraced him and he said who would buy this slave Femi he was in the market and they buy in sell slaves so July babe is trying to look who's doing this to me and when he found out that it was the Prophet he let go and he started trying to be any touch his body more and more to the prophet alayhi salatu salam because of his love and he said o prophet of Allah we're trying to sell me the prof is not lying who will buy this slave he is a slave to all were the perfect jokes but he never lies is awesome soja let me be saying o prophet of Allah if you're trying to sell me but Allah nobody would buy me because I'm a bad merchandise I'm ugly and by me he said to him Alice awesome by Allah at the side of Allah here too expensive this ugly man and he asked in the process am did you marry he said no who would give me in marriage so the Prophet did not elaborate then he went to one of the unsung house the man the companion came and said to him the Prophet as I'm said to him give me your daughter in marriage who how would be more honored than us to give you our daughter prophet of Allah is it not for me for july BB i let me check with with the missus so he goes to the missus and says the profit today proposed to our daughter said masha'Allah masha'Allah of course we have all yeah the pleasure and the pride and the honor of accepting it said not for himself for jalebi it what jillybean he's the ugliest one and the woman was inside the girl and the one I said by allah i will never marry him to marry her to july july beep and the woman she was a real righteous woman she said father by Allah he asked you was it the prophet who proposed to me for july beep he said yes so she said by allah i will take him because the Prophet would not ever choose anything except the best for me and he married her and two or three days after the marriage and one narration in the same night of the marriage he went to the battlefield and this hadith you find in your notes after the battlefield was over the Prophet said who died in the battle field so they gave a checklist this man this person this person who else no one prophet of Allah why are you missing someone he said yes I'm missing someone I cannot see him where is your ID be so they look in the dead and defined you like deep with seven of the mushrikun killed around him he killed seven then he died and the Prophet carried him with his own hands and put him in the grave and said oh by Allah he is from me and I'm from him it is ugly companion because the beauty is not the beauty of the shell it's the beauty of the inside of the a man kickit seven then he died the woman afterwards did not marry after him and no woman in Medina was blessed more than her because a prophet has some which he heard that she accepted he said may Allah bless her and grant her and she was a blasphemer whenever you are in accordance to the Quran and the Sunnah o Allah he will be blessed in your body in your health in your work in your family you will be blessed like the Alison in the Quran wijaya lani mubarak an enema cookie wherever I am I am blessed this is a true practicing Muslim if he's in the airplane he's blessed and he blesses everyone around him if he is in the gym if he's in school if he's in the market it was in the street if he is in the mosque he is blessed he is a blessing this is a true practicing Muslim he spreads blessings all over the place and hamdallah handle of course is is well known hamba is the one humble of namur even at the armor he was a companion but in the Battle of a hood the Prophet said i'm watching Hahnville are being washed by the angels what is this of course handle I was dead but who's being washed his soul so they went to his wife and they found out that he was newly Wed and the minute he heard the call for jihad he left like us after 13 years of marriage when we healed the call of Jax's am still newlywed these guys did not have anything holding them back we have everything in the world holding us back knocks em jihad from even saying the word of truth why don't you advise your manager a brother called me yesterday said my manager is very very nice he's very kind him he is trying his best to make me advance and go places in my job but he doesn't pray what should I do advise him yeah but I'm afraid if I advise him he would not support me like he used to this is now you're afraid for your provisions for your promotion and you don't have true love for your manager who is kind to you the least you do express your love and guiding him he ought he to Allah he's Muslim it always asks me about the Quran ask me is Muslim but this isn't bring and you are afraid to talk to him this is this shows you how sincere you are and with this we conclude and a lot soldierknowsbest solo salon ball Academy no family I feel constantly before we break out for the session the first question shake if someone is having trouble in life health wise and otherwise can he wish for debt no we've mentioned this yesterday clearly the Prophet said that is awesome do not wish for death for a calamity or a tribulation that has been afflicted upon you if you must the prophecies if you must then say oh allah make me alive as long as life is better for me and make me die as long as death is better for me you never know what is best for you do you you never know the more you live more the more closer you are to Allah so you'll how many times you sit upon Allah Allah Allah Allah and Allah how many times you frustrated how many times you supplicated how many times you fasted drama days of Ramadan if you wish for death now you never know and that is why those who commit suicide they are punished in hell people commit suicide why are he before you jump from Virgil Adam why do you want to jump he said yeah I have that I have problems okay junk do you think your problems will be over what is worse having debts being thrown into prison having a sadness and depression because your loved one is suffering or dying or whatever or being tortured with a match a flame of a lighter for an hour what do you prefer one hour yeah hey five minutes let's put your hand and put a lighter underneath and mark it for five minutes can you tolerate this for ten seconds you say it hurts okay what do you want to do shall we do it for another 10 seconds or you tolerate the sufferings and tribulations and the calamities are on your head no I'll take the calamities every day this happens every single day to all of us at three o'clock it is pitch dark a.m. will darkness continue two hours maximum fee hours and the Sun is up all our calamities are like this all our problems are like this but we are impatient I have a problem Yahoo it seek allah's forgiveness raise your hands and supplicate to Allah one day one week one month one year ten years it will go but if you despair if you kill yourself if you wish for death this would not resolve it and all what remains is the bad deeds that you have committed just continuing that as he said suicide is haram but if a person is coming to Seaside can deaf parents and the family asked for forgiveness and and to Allah and oscar grant her gender whoever commits suicide is he a catheter or Muslim kafir Muslim who says cafe raise your hands please okay who says Muslim raise your hands please okay the caffres are overwhelming and the kafir are drunk a person who kills himself is a Muslim sinful one but is a Muslim I thing you do not know if I someone's this lab just because he's in Hell their notifications of Islam are a number of conditions they are like the notifications of woodle so many times people ask me ah hey is this something nullifies my would do and I say why do you trouble yourself by mentioning so many things learn the move the things that nullify your google and hollis you become knowledgeable what are they shake anything that comes out of the private part went urine defecating sleeping eating camels meat that's it i'm gonna anything more maybe i forgot any more smoking people come smoke notifies willow know it's a sin but has nothing to do with woodle Oh share can I go to the message with cigarettes in my pocket yeah you shouldn't smoke but yeah one says okay shake I was in Moodle going to the message it and I stepped on dung so do i have to wake wiggle again what do you think you stepped on deification human a dunk in crap does he commits widow a performer though it's not just right so does he prefer moodle no because they're things that know if I would have just mentioned to you she wishes measures yes once you wash it colors it's gone so if you know the thing that known if I would do you know and you don't have to ask now when Islam I can seek forgiveness for anyone who's Muslim I can pray for anyone who is Muslim and that is why if someone brings a funeral to me and says okay this is Muhammad Aben ahem it let's pray funeral a Muslim place a nun was a Muslim who has deviation in his head who is not following the sooner you say how would I know that he was a Muslim his name is Mohammed bin Hamad yeah but he may not have great maybe he wasn't playing you don't know he was praying there are witnesses say seeing him pray yeah but maybe he believed in other than Allah Subhan Allah and these are known as i looked at feel those who go and they label you if you're not with me you're against me let George Bush so they say that if you're not following my feet following my after the following my school of thought with a kafir I know some of them in Saudi in Judah they come to a message it and I say okay let's go and pray he said no no I can trade behind this amount why say I don't know him so I don't know his hockey that he might be a shááty he might be Sufi he might be opening he might be Hawaii he might be doubly he might be where Livvy you might be the one de Mike and its allies OHL ask us before you pray behind an imam make a Q&A multiple choice first of all piece is chef can you answer these 50 questions it would take you five minutes please what's the reason of this questionnaire I just so I can pray behind you this is pathetic this is ridiculous by default all of you here are Muslim for me I don't know nothing about you when you come and say Salam aleikum Sheikh I said Molly come what do you think of the attributes of Allah and the beautiful names of Allah where is Allah and what do you think of those who say that it is permitted to wage holy war what is your profession anyone who comes to me looks like a Muslim sister i might mention alikum sir so coming back to this question do we pray or offer funeral prayer on the person who committed suicide dance it is yes now the only thing that may disturb you is but the Prophet did not it is lotsa yes the Prophet did not offer prayer on a person who committed suicide but he didn't prevent the people he told them to go on and pray he didn't pray why because the imam the highest level of the ruler should give an indication to the masses that because of his sin whether he's a committed suicide or he was a professional robber or an adulterer or whatever I as an imam do not pray for a funeral prayer for him because I have to give the indication that he committed a major sin but all of you you have to pray so I hope this answers your question when we remember that the the love of this world goes away from our hearts how can this continue in our day-to-day life if it continues to in your day-to-day life you're not going to live it is one of a las greatest blessings over us that we bury the dead and that we forget because if you do not forget you're not going to live I black mat have been how from allah be pleased with him one of the great companions of the prophet of sam one of the ten heaven bound this story is is is magnificent and he is a great one of the greatest businessman he started from scratch from scratch to be the wealthiest man in medina he came to you know your history i think i did a program on peace TV on his life and sat in the lobby and how they shared the money and he told him I don't want your money I don't want your wife sat in the lobby i told him i am the wealthiest man in medina half of my wealth is yours and why do you sell him that you're the wealthiest if someone the profit made me I brother with a brother with brother Mohammed or brother Idol or whatever we told us your two brothers now I would go to him and say listen okay I have money this is 10,000 done for you to start your life I don't have to tell him I'm a milk multi-billionaire then here is 500 million and not only that he told him I have two wives and you are a migrant from Makkah you have nothing so look at both of them and whomever you like most I will divorce her after her egg day is over you can marry her complete shearing off everything if I were a good man shoes I would say Zack Allah hair like a la here is something freebies something free at the man now what did he say may Allah bless your wealth and your wives show me the soup this direct me to the market and he went to the market food"
