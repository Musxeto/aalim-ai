  "transcript": "beautiful way of calling her. And he would also show his kindness even when she is the wrongdoer. It was reported in an authentic hadith by Nu'man Ibn Bashir, may Allah be pleased with him and with his father, that once the Prophet ﷺ was with Aisha in their home and they were in a heated argument, like any couple, when Abu Bakr, Aisha's father, sought permission to enter. So he was given the permission and he entered his daughter's home. And he found Aisha shouting at the Prophet ﷺ, in a sense raising her voice when talking to him. And he charged on her, wanting to beat her and scold her, saying to her, do you raise your voice over the Prophet ﷺ? And when the Prophet saw this, of course if he is the husband and his wife was treating him like this and it's her father who wants to reprimand her and scold her or beat her up, I didn't do anything, I didn't ask for it, I don't mind, be my guest. No, the Prophet ﷺ immediately intervened and stood in Abu Bakr's face. And he prevented him of course from doing anything because he was in his face, in his way. So Abu Bakr left the house angrily with his daughter. So the Prophet ﷺ went to terrified Aisha and said to her, don't you see? I prevented him from beating you up. Don't you see? I saved you from the man. You should be appreciative. Look how kind I am to you. So he's showing her what he did to her. And few minutes later, she started laughing with him and the Prophet was laughing with her back and they were happy again. Abu Bakr came to the house again, wanted to see what things are happening there. And when he entered and found them laughing and giggling, he said, O Prophet of Allah, as you have engaged me in your war moments ago, engage me in your peace and tell me what you're laughing about. No harm's done. And the case was resolved. This is how kind the Prophet was ﷺ."
