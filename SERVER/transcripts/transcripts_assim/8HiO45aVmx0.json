  "title": "Why did Muslims pray towards Kabah knowing there were Idols still there? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "but didn't the Prophet SAW salon when they turned to the Qibla having knowing that 360 gods was still in there didn't he still feel like you know he should really be praying there until the club was empty of all its idols well he was not present there and even when he was present there the prophet sallallaahu lamp used to go and face the direction of the Qibla of the Kaaba though there were the idols surrounding it because he was praying to Allah and not to the idols and here we have to look at the intention the intention has a very important role first of all your hand are cuffed your hands are tied you cannot do anything else you have to pray and because they have done these wrong things this does not prevent you from praying for example one of the Companions of the Prophet aerosol salaam once came to the prophet and said o prophet of allah i have took a vow of myself I made another that I would slaughter a camel in an area close to Medina called Bou Anna and this hadith was reported by even Muslim in the side so the Prophet asked him two questions salah salem is there any celebration for the non-muslims he said no is there an idol that people slaughter for he said no so the Prophet told him fulfill your oath or fulfill your vows you do this so the intention is extremely important and the prophet alayhi salatu salam himself had this objective in mind and that is why the minute he conquered Mecca the first thing he ordered was to demolish and destroy these idols and in Islam we are very very sensitive to associating any with Allah Almighty it is um it nullifies Islam to associate anyone with Allah Azza WA Jalla to the extent that we cannot even associate people with Allah verbally so I cannot say whatever Allah and you wish because and means that you and Allah are equal in wishing noon so if you tell me can you stay for lunch I said well whatever Allah and you wish no this is considered to be associating others with Allah we're very sensitive in unifying Allah the Almighty and in worshipping him alone"
