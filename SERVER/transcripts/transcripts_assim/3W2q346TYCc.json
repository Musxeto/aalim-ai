  "title": "Permissible to post halal content on my company's Facebook page that also has haram? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh say if one has a Halal job and the company asks him to post his work on their Facebook page and the work is halal from this person but the page has some Haram stuff from other admins would it be permissible for this person to become one of the admins and only post his Halal Works without ever sharing this page or telling people to visit it unfortunately this is very common nowadays in many companies that are involved in halal activities yet they insist on including some of the Haram activities as well so if a person has a Halal task in a Halal company and he's instructed to share his products or his line of work on a Facebook book page which may include other Haram stuff but the material he's posting is his and it's Halal I pray to Allah that this is halal as well and Allah Knows Best"
