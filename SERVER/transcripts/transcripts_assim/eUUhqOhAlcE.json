  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Australia So Sheikh I've heard some Da'ees say that \nif you are living in a Kaafir country it   is very difficult to find a 100% Halal \njob as you will almost always find some   Haram elements here and there so they \nsay that if a job is mostly Halal and   there are only small elements of Haram then \nit is negligible and the income is Halal. And they give an example such as a person,   he stocks up shelves with food and \nat times he may have to put some haram food such as pork, but \nmostly he's placing halal food. So this group of sheikhs, they say that the \nharam is negligible and hence the income is halal. But then another group of sheikhs, they say \nthat we should put our Tawakkul on Allah that he will provide us 100 percent \nhalal job even in this Kaafir country. So Sheikh, what is the correct \napproach in this specific situation? Akhi the general trend is that we Muslims \nhave a red line that we cannot cross. So these group of Da'ees who say and claim that \nlittle elements of Haram are permissible, this is too generic. And it has to be judged case by case \nto evaluate the amount of Haram. when they say that it's permissible to put \nharam items on the shelf and to handle them, what would I do with the hadith of \nthe Prophet ﷺ  when he cursed ten in \nintoxicants, wine, whiskey, etc. And among them, those who \ncarry it, those who hold it. So when I'm placing them and \nstocking them on the shelves,   wouldn't I be cursed by Allah? Definitely I would. So there is no compromise in such issues.   When I sell it, when I'm working as a cashier, \nand 95% of what I sell is halal, 5% is haram. lottery tickets, pork, intoxicants, \nbeer, wine, whiskey, etc. So these group of scholars say that it's okay. It doesn't make your income haram. No, definitely this is unacceptable and not true."
