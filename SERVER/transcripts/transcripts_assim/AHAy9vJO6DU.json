  "transcript": "family alhamdulillah what can I do for you I'm the last state um please we in that we don't have the clear picture of our Dean but alhamdulillah we have the basic sometimes determined across some issues that are so confusing and sometimes we don't know how to stand in between especially when you do have a scholar to call and then have any confirmation from what you had recently I landed on aesthetically basically when I'm asking such question I don't want to mention sex because these are the problems uh recently a Sheikh was asked that why mother Aisha uh is not for their for their sex they don't accept her as the um he mentioned so many hadiths that they are from authentic shows that is buhari diplomadia and so many authentic sources now my problem is after I watch the clip I said something to my head that okay if what they are saying is true then no woman will be perfect than a woman that married by a prophet but in the same way I said something to myself that Prophet know and Prophet uh Lord uh yeah what disobey them do they are prophet of God but their wife is to pay them Joseph did you read bukhari I didn't read buhari but how do you dare accept people slandering mother Aisha and speaking belittling her from different sources when you did not verify what did you not read the original sources so if someone comes to you and says I have so many evidences to prove that your father is not your biological father would you accept this yes or no not really so how dare you relay what these blatant Liars disbelievers said about our mother Aisha and you're getting confusion about this fear Allah if you have little Iman you would brush it off and don't even ask about it so come on be realistic someone says something to you about Islam go and check it the four books of the sunnan then if it's there go ask the scholars they said this Hadith number this Hadith number I verified it what's or how to remove this confusion and then you can have a conviction but to shoot from the hip without even asking questions and assume that what these Hypocrites or disbelievers are slandering and lying is true there's something wrong and Allah Knows Best"
