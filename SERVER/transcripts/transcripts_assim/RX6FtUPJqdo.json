  "transcript": "Farha says who or what are the shayateen from mankind any evil person who encourages others to sin is a shape on is a devil but he's from the human side so he's not a pure kafir someone who makes it easy for you to skip salat he says don't pray we'll pray later on we pray at the end of the night who makes it easy for you to eat during the daytime of Ramadan who gossips to you so that you hate another Muslim brother and he causes enmity between you two this is a Shaitaan without any doubt a person who openly sins so if you see someone kissing a nun muharram girl in the middle of the day in a park in a supermarket like what happens in kafir countries disbelieving country's non-muslim countries then this is a Shaitaan definitely and anyone who does this openly who sins openly who calls people to sin he is a Shaitaan"
