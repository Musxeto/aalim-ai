  "transcript": "please Han is asking about the rule on downloading the Quran and ask our and religious items on the phone smartphone although I I considered them to be stupid phones because you see people nowadays just using them reading stuff that does not get them closer to Allah does not benefiting them in this dunya simply waste of time and makes people stupid when you spend like four or five hours just looking at this device if you spent the same time on reading the Quran Allah will be in a better place nevertheless so he's asking what's the ruling the ruling is it's permissible no one of the scholars I know had ever said that it is Haram or not recommended now the catch is brother jealous most likely is asking for two reasons or one of them he's doubtful because how would I enter the toilets with my phone in my pocket with the Quran in it or an app there's no problem in that none whatsoever because the Quran itself is not physically there until you turn it on and you click on the app and it's only zeros and ones so it's program it's like it's not even written until you turn it on so there's no problem in doing that and entering the toilet but don't turn on the app in the toilet his second concern probably would be that though I have an app of Quran yet I do have shortcomings so I may have downloaded few music clips videos inappropriate material I sometimes watch videos I sometime listen to music so he's confused now how can I have this beautiful app that allows me to read the Quran and a the same time in the same device I have this filthy material okay this is sinful but does not mean that you have to remove the good which is the Koran app it's like asking someone who memorizes the Quran but fell short and started committing sins - okay this is not permissible you have to forget the Quran don't go to the message and pray and might as well don't fast Ramadan because you're a disgrace to the half of the Quran this is not true this is a sin and this is a good deed so I would advise such people if this is related to jealous hunt to fear allah azza wajal if you have the Quran in your app you should not use the phone for something that is haram such as music which is the consensus of the four schools of thought that is Haram I am shocked when people come and say it's an issue of dispute are you serious yeah even if we do not take the ayat of the Quran in three locations and we overlook the hadith which is in sahih al-bukhari and certainly be there would and elsewhere with authentic narrations and chain of narrators even if we overlook that the consensus of the four schools of thought that is Haram and you come as a yeah yeah but even has him whose urban hasn't said I don't know I heard someone say but hasn't said it's okay and they don't know anything about even has it so music is Haram watching video clips movies is totally prohibited no Muslim in his right mind would come and say Oh watching movies is permissible going to the cinema is halal this is pathetic such material is totally prohibited in the I don't know very scholar proper real scholar of Islam would allow this unless I don't know but if you fear Allah you should take this out if you're unable if you're weak and you have it there's no problem in reciting the Quran as much as you you can do a lot of good deeds because good deeds it is bad deeds with the grace of allah azza wajal [Music]"
