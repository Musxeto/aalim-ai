  "transcript": "okay yusef from canada yes my question is is it permissible for me as a male to drive and drop off my sister and her friend somewhere which is why are you asking such a question joseph because like my sister would like me to drop her off and her friend to an event so they don't have somebody else to drive so they want me to go so what what what is the confusion why are you asking is your sister not wearing the hijab is she going to do something haram no it's just that her friend you know her friend being in the car she's also okay so i i get your question yes there is no problem none whatsoever in having nan mahram with you in the car as long as you have a mahram with you so if i'm dropping my sister and three of her friends female friends at the back of the car to xyz location there's nothing wrong what's wrong is that i chit chat with them and crack jokes and talk casually and this is haram this is free mixing but dropping them and driving them and and and giving them a lift with maintaining the sharia limits there's nothing wrong in that inshallah you"
