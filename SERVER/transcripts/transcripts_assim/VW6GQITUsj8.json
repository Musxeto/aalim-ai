  "title": "Is it permissible to learn Maqamat to beautify my Quran recitation? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question is um I'm trying to beautify my recitation of the Quran and so I go to the Quran classes um and over there I was told that to make my recitation more beautiful and to make it more better I have to learn through makat um so they told me to First hear the makat and Implement that on the verses of the Quran I'm not sure if this is permissible or should I go to this classes so I wanted your opinion on this and your advice M are sort of patterns that people learn so that they would recite or they would sing according to these patterns they have n they have uh Sika they have different I don't know them personally alhamdulillah but I hear people learning them if learning these makat does not include anything Haram such as listening to music or to Haram songs if it's just a pattern that you follow which makes your recitation sad or enthusiastic or motivational in this case there's no problem as long as your recitation fits under the recitation of the Quran and not singing But if your recitation is going to simulate and sound like a song following the pattern of currently followed by singers and song writers in this case this is not permissible because this is uh uh disrespecting the Quran so I hope this answers your question"
