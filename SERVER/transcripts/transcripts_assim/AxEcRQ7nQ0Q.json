  "transcript": "unties most and many Islamic centers across the GL Alim was in Saudi back in 1962 but it doesn't look that old he looks like 42 or something years he a that in 1987 he got his special degree from from King University in then in 1998 he his master isic studies and University is highly respected SCH for his Islam teach [Music] isimportant understanding are alhamdulillah I have to see I have to look at you before so your pres ESP comes through for thousands of your friends and supporters nightmare nightmare rather than yeah but you know I the thousands of thousand of people who like following your uh and I think of here be exp life with so [Music] have okay how do you feel hungry a little bit tired but the feeling of seeing Muslims willing to waste their time to come and listen to someone like me is very nice they could have been playing badminton or going to the movies or spending time with their friends but they instead wanted Allah to be pleased with them so they came to the Masjid and this this is where true happiness is so wherever I go I am blessed to see these faces that are clean through wo sorry what you meant to close Okay Okay their faces are white bright shining with IM with wo with Purity so whenever you look at them you feel alhamdulillah overwhelmed that there is in this a lot of so you have like fathers from yes so the first how that it's it's okay the feeling was normal because I haven't met any of my family members since I was born and raised in Saudi so they don't come to Saudi and I this is my first visit but alhamdulillah I managed to meet some of them in Jakarta and J Jakarta and to day after tomorrow I'm meeting a lot of them in midan so this is and this is to reconnect with one roots and with one's blood and family alhamd so happiness brother sister families likees of being spread so tonight's uh topic tonight's them uh in this will about the definition of Happiness so we have like 30 45 minutes for to uh discuss to deliver his sess of Happiness minut before I start my talk I don't understand Bahasa very well I don't understand Bahasa at all but did I hear it correctly that you read the fa yes and then Surah after fat Surah yes yes and then why do you recite the f I don't want to come on the day of judgment and Allah would say why they make this Innovation and you did not speak ever in the books of had the prophet recited the fat like this yes or no no never you know more than him no I don't so this is why I have to clear my conscience so that on the day of judgment I told them I go so it is not Sunnah in Arabia when we have marriage contract or engagement and nobody knows they're reading the fat and they wipe their face and they wipe their bodies and they scrub their backs go take a shower what are you doing and also because marriage is like death when someone is dead he said oh Abdullah is dead read the fa and they read the faat is not from Islam fa is recited in the Salat the greatest Surah fa is recited in as in of this is I have illness in my throat every time I drink water and I drink but not in a gathering so excuse me I'm supposed to speak about how to be happy but I will make you unhappy first but inshah so happiness who doesn't want to be happy raise your hands alhamdulillah so we don't have one two three don't know English very well who does not want to be happy everybody wants to be happy sometimes we spend so much money just to be happy happiness is Paradise on Earth because if you're happy on Earth you are in paradise and not Muslims only look for happiness even kafir even atheists Buddhists Hindus Christians they all look for happiness the rich and the poor the educated and the illiterate everybody works hard to reach happiness nobody wants to be unhappy willingly but the problem is the vast majority of people have missed the road to happiness on the day of judgment how many people are there how many types only two on the day of judgment only two types of people Allah says in the Quran the day it comes no soul will speak except by his permission and among them will be the richest and the prosperous so on the day of judgment there are two types either you are happy or you are wretched you're doomed there is no third party which one are you inshallah among the happy okay in the Hadith that bukari and Muslim reported the angel comes when the pregnancy is 4 months old to blow the soul and to ask Allah oh Allah a male or a female a happy or wretched so all of this is written and if you ask people on the day of judgment what is the ultimate goal of course is to enter Jenna Allah says in the Quran so he who is thrown away from the fire and admitted to Paradise has one may Allah make us among the winners this is the ultimate call why are you here in the Masjid Jenna if one says to you w there is a million dollars here there is this big house there is this beautiful woman but no Jenna said I don't want it I want Jenna so all what we're doing in our life is revolving around Jenna we want to reach Jenna so how can we be happy now happiness is relative what does it mean it means that what makes you happy may may not make him happy usually so for those who have money and wealth and big houses for a poor man like me I think he's happy because he has Mah big house big car and a heedless nerd youngsters when you ask them who's happy they say especially those who are not married said oh a play a Playboy is happy because he goes to night clubs every night he's with another woman and he parties and he drinks he's very happy I am an introvert I can't speak with women I'm always shy to someone who is sick who is happy a healthy person so when someone is sick like me and I see people drinking pepsicola with ice I wish I can do that I can't I have a sore throat so everyone has a definition of happiness in where I come from if you want something to be done in the government if you want a paper to be signed you have to spend one week two weeks every time you go with a big file said oh there is a one paper missing come tomorrow you bring it tomorrow oh where's your photo come tomorrow you bring the photo and say oh you need a stamp so one week every day you go you take permission from work what is happiness to someone like like this to have influence to have power to know people in the government one phone call pass everything is finished so each one of them has a definition of Happiness likewise in Islam this type of Happiness a house a Playboy health is limited not forever it goes and comes and this is why the prophet saidat in an authentic Hadith four things are from happiness what are they a good woman a righteous practicing woman and a big spacious house and a good neighbor and a comfortable ride so these things the prophet says is these things are happiness but are they forever they're limited but when you have them inshallah you will be happy now happiness is always changing unfortunately on this life and this life never stays on one platform it changes if you go to the hospital you think everybody's sick if you go to the streets you think everybody's healthy what happened yesterday is not going to happen today and what's happening today is not going to happen tomorrow life goes up and down and we come and go so this definition of happiness is wrongly sought after by Sinners I'm a sinful person where will I find my happiness maybe in drugs maybe in alcohol maybe in women maybe in listening to music watching movies maybe in cheating I'll be happy but this happiness is limited and immediately after the sin is gone what will happen you become depressed listen what to Allah says and whoever turns away from my remembrance indeed he will have a depressed life all Sinners are depressed even the most famous the richest the most beautiful they take drugs and some of them even commit suicide because they cannot find happiness and they try but they fail because they have turned their back to Allah's remembrance now this is not the same in Islam who was the happiest man on Earth mhammad our Prophet was there anyone happier how was his [Music] house this was a very small room the companions say if we stand straight our head will hit the ceiling so it was very short small tiny room but the prophet was a happy man new peace be upon him and L peace be upon him had a cafir wives they both their wives were cafir but they were happy because they were messengers of Allah Prophet a how many years he was afflicted by illness approximately 18 years he's a prophet he makes Dua I get illness in my throat and I said yeah Allah 3 days I'm making Dua why I'm not covered 18 years and he's a prophet he had no problem if you are not angry with me I'm happy so this is what real happiness is not in wealth not in power not in health rather it is in being content real happiness is something that you cannot see with your eyes you cannot contain in vaults you cannot buy this is something that you feel within you it is the purity of your soul it is the Tranquility of your heart it is the expansion of your chest and it is your conscience being relaxed this is true happiness I wonder how many people of us when they go to bed they make thear and then they sleep like a baby and how many of us think oh he took my money oh I took his money oh I should beat him up I should do this I should do that and they're fighting in themselves how many of us has this true feeling of happiness you want to taste happiness listen to The Prophet authentic he said he has tasted the sweetness of Iman who who's ever pleased with Allah to be his Lord with Islam to be his religion with Muhammad to be his messenger if you're happy and satisfied you will find the taste of Ean the sweetness of Iman now what is killing us today social media Instagram Tik Tok we see people riding in expensive cars living in expensive houses traveling in private jet and we feel that well they're happy and we don't know that all of this is a punishment huh what punishment let Allah punish me don't laugh there are Muslims who say let them punish me when I was teaching once in a high school in Saudi I was a teacher 40 years ago and I was telling I teach I taught English but in my English I teach also Islam because English is lousy so I teach them 5 minutes English and then I give them high school teenagers so I was saying to them the story of Yu and how he refused the temptation of the wife of the aiz of m and among the seven who are in Allah's shade a man who's invited by a woman of beauty and authority and he says I fear Allah one of the boys stood up and said said sh where is she he's saying where is she let her come to me I will be there and this shows you how little Iman people have no Allah says to you in the Quran in two places inah and let not their wealth and their children impress you Allah only intends to punish them through them in this world and that their souls should be depart at death while they are disbelievers their wealth and their children is a punishment yes so this is something for you to see not everything that Allah gives to others is a favor and blessing it can be a punishment say alhamdulillah that Allah did not test you like them a lot of the Muslims see the westerners The Americans the Europeans and think that they are the best of people they are impressed by the way they dress the way they speak the way they eat not knowing that they are like those who were impressed by Kon you know karon huh K was one of the billionaires the keys of his vaults and saves were so heavy that a group of men could not carry the keys what about the vaults themselves what money was he richer than Elon Musk yes and he did not have a Tesla so the people were impressed and they said those who desired the worldly life said oh we wish we had like what was given to karun indeed he is one of the great Fortune so where is karon now down is that where is Pharaoh you know Pharaoh he was the king of the world he said I am your lord you worship me where is he now dead where isud where is had those who became billionaires through Haram money and through bribes and through cheating and they took properties of people where are they now after 60 70 years they died what is in their grave Hellfire so what's the use of the money where are all these long hours that a Playboy used to sit speaking with women fooling them trying to seduce them through his different ways where are these hours all gone now all of this is in Hell Fire for the losers and the sin is the biggest Blocker of Happiness unlike what most of us think they think the opposite you do sin you become happy no one of the sisters came to me she says sheh I have a problem with my son said what's the problem she says he watches a movie for an hour and a half or two hours and he's happy the minute the movie is over he comes to me and said I'm fed up I don't have anything to do so I say watch another movie he watches Another Movie he's happy the minute the movie finishes this is like drugs every time you take it you become addicted to it and you will never be happy true Muslims find happiness in worship the prophet said my satisfaction was placed inat the prophet whenever he was depressed or sad what would he do allahar pray connection directly with Allah he feels that he has the whole world in his hand and whoever plays around with Salat then he will never be happy any person who skips Salat misses Salat does not give Salat a priority he will never be happy because this is what Allah created you for now if you look at the Muslim houses you will see that divorce rate is very high in Arabia it's very high I don't know here is divorce rate high or why Subhan Allah they got married they spent money and all of a sudden divorce the woman becomes crazy the man becomes a woman and we have an imbalance we have a problem this was not found in the the time of the companions we find a lot of the Muslims going for therapy for counseling I have OCD I have depression I have anxiety I have why you shouldn't have all of this you're a Muslim you should trust Allah and fathers complaining from their children they're undutiful disobedient disrespectful children complaining from their parents they're abusive they're not fair they're treating us bad and all of this because they're seeking happiness not from the right Source from different sources so if you want happiness you have to seek it from who has it who owns it who's he Allah Allah you want Happ ask it from Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala and this life we're in it's a life of test nobody can be 100% happy it's a test but if you manage to study hard for your test and do well you will be the happiest person on Earth how when you feel content this is the happiest person who content in Arabic we call it whatever happens you're happy why because Allah DEC it I had a car accident she how do you feel alhamdulillah good you're content you're happy other person come says you're crazy why are you saying alhamdulillah you had a car accident said yes but imagine if I did not hit another car if I hit another person he died how would I feel oh alhamdulillah okay thank you and this is why Imam Ahmed was asked when does the slave of Allah find comfort and happiness when life is difficult he says the moment you put your first foot in Jenna when you put your first foot in Jenna there is no going back you're happy for I pray to Allah that he makes me and you among the happiest of all his servants and that he grants us the knowledge in Quran and in Sunnah and that he makes us steadfast on this religion until the day we meet him shall I go you done yes all right okay expect to have more time like until 9 or 10 no I you told me you told me 35 minutes to 40 so I Am timing I took exactly 3 36 minutes the ultimate happiness to [Music] Dey [Music] happiness

at all ask me something I will answer you but don't ask me how this how did you do that tell me about your past because if I kill you if I tell you I have to kill you okay that's it that's answer next person we have a gentl in the in white you start I think you can just up and share your question yeah gentle can see but really good okay [Music] [Music] may it [Music] [Music] Chef give us some suggestion thank you [Music] so with his three friends they are BL and the happiness of is when they can get together at this and together and we have our soalan programs andd is Happ so this question that suggestion uh what was that Happ thank okay may Allah put bar in your work and in the work of all those who Thrive to do what Allah loves the prophet said the Best of You are those who learn the Quran and teach it so if you are among those who are learning the Quran and teaching it you are among the best if you're not sorry bad news so what to do this Quran is Allah's words this is the Miracle of Islam this is this is the rope that if you abide by nobody can defeat you Allah has revealed a book which has your honor your dignity your high mentioning in this book but what are the Muslims doing with the Quran abandoning it abandoning the Quran and this is why you ask the vast majority of Muslims in Indonesia do you know Quran no those who know the Quran and recite it beautifully and maybe better than us Arabs you know the best reciters are from Indonesia AB ABD number two number three number five number 10 they're clones but they don't understand one single word what is it it's not the voice it's not the melody that is important it is how the Quran has impacted your life so the best you can do is learn about the Quran teach others about the Quran honor the Quran so that you live with it and you die by it and Allah knows best okay thank you thank you so much next question will people who looks very enthusastic so you're enthusiasm okay yeah check everybody of all my name is and I have a question your no he's also no one the first one yes my question is is it possible for us for not doing sin in one day thank you is it possible not to do a sin in one day yes the prophet said every son of Adam has to do sin now there are major sins there small sins there are sins that go in our minds there are sin that we look at so I don't know of anyone who cannot do a sin this is something that is in our DNA but the prophet said and the best of those who are sinful those who repent and this is the beauty of studying Allah's beautiful name names and attributes and this is what I always emphasize upon do you know Allah's beautiful names and attributes yes how many do you know can you write them all yes you write them all mallah let's assume yes yeah if you ask people how many of these names do you know the meaning they say ah I know them but I don't know what the meaning is so when I say when I say Al when I say you don't know the meaning so if you can't relate to Allah's beautiful names how will you find happiness in praying so now one of Allah beautiful names is so if you don't sin Allah will take you away and bring people who will sin and ask him for forgiveness and this is Allah's mercy upon us he knows that we're weak he's not telling us come come and sin so okay go to nightclub tonight and then oh Allah forgive me no but Allah knows we're weak we may fall and make a sin once we make a sin immediately come knock on Allah's door ask him for forgiveness and Allah will forgive you thank you thank you no next question um anyone's name ask if there is someone's name aen let him yeah one of name so many my name okay okay uh my question is simple uh before my question uh I want to share my experience when I first uh see you saw you in know social media uh I always overwhelm with your words I'm always I don't know entertain with your uh all of your answer even the question is so random and absur I we all agree that your question is so fast but funny and my question is simple uh how could you find uh uh F answer so fast so uh maybe uh if there is one of us in the future become a lecturer we could uh I think we could the uh lecture that F so the JAMA would uh don't know uh uh makes uh when when WECT they find it so easy to remember I don't know this this is not something I train or work for you know comedians standup comedian and and rappers they will sit and write scenarios and write scripts okay someone ask me like this and said I don't do this it is all from what Allah opens and I don't do this purposely and and and I'm getting really yeah agitated when people come and say oh she we like your humor we like your funny jokes and I say Subhan Allah 1 hour program of ask that serious questions and Halal Haram divorce Whispers of sh and and go to hell you leave all of this and you say she I'm your bigger biggest fan may Allah promote you to be an air conditioner and you take this and you make 1 million 2 million views what about the what about the Quran no no this is good good but this one I don't do this now some came to me and they were very angry said she you're disrespecting knowledge because this is you're in the Masjid everybody's laughing sometimes even in lectures there are women and women's laughter is not appreciated in Islam so she you should stop what do I say to them tough bananas tough luck I'm not going to stop this is who I am you want me to give you da I give you da the full package I will not pretend to be an honorable dignified shh I I cannot do this this is not me you like me Isaiah alhamd don't like me I have no problem so again these answers come from Allah maybe because I'm from Sumatra I don't know I don't know nothing I don't know this is they tell me I'm from I don't know it's all the same you try your level best to have sincerity to have and whatever Allah opens for you for your da for your work for your teaching Allah will make it stay inshallah and people will benefit thank you well this time I'd like to inv have please and you are nobody from regular [Music] after love you and all those who love me for his sake and make us in Paradise among who love one [Music] another SCH uh I have a lot of question but I will to ask you one question your name please oh sorry okay my name is from Central ja I'm college student I'm 22 and I'm here to ask you one question to be honest I have several home is from uh and you know majority there are n sometimes uh I talk to he or she in WhatsApp video call and uh they uh ask me about Islam so of course I'm as a Muslim tell them because uh it's compulsory to me as a Muslim and uh there's a several question which uh I have no idea to reply it because I'm a scholar like you I'm not I'm still studying uh the question is uh we know that Allah will give will guide us for a certain way we don't know dream or maybe other person come to us and tell us and uh we know there is people which live in Long Island or in other word we say Inland tribe Inland tribe so this uh these people they don't know about uh cars or Internet they so far away from modern society they don't know about things people like including you so uh when they die in The Testament day uh what Allah is going to do about it I mean uh is Allah what going to put them in the hell fire if so of course Muslim said your lord is merciful why your Lord put them in the hell uh we know that all of them when they still alive on Earth they don't know about Islam nobody person because many seal uh manyal reason one of them is uh when we try to them there is uh uh they they think that we enemies because like I told you earlier They don't know about us They so far away from mod Society I hope you can get my question send them my videos I understand the question okay I I will answer you I would answer you i' I've been I've been doing this for almost 23 years answering questions on TV live so all of these questions have come to me and already inshah I'm not that old I can't remember there is a Hadith which may Allah be pleased with him and other Scholars narrated to answer your question these people are known to be meaning that they are in the period there is no messenger there's no Prophet Allah will not punish them be without having knowledge Allah says in the Quran [Music] we will not torment a people until we send them a messenger these people don't have messenger so they will come on the day of judgment and they say oh Allah no messenger came to me how would I know that you exist you this you that this person will be tested on the day of judgment now imagine Resurrection all Humanity are there everything is clear Angels you see them Jin you see them humans are all resurrected you see hell and you see Paradise everything is clear now do you have any doubt on the day of judgment no doubt so when they say oh Allah I didn't know in this case Allah says okay Allah orders a the Hadith says a neck something like a beast from hell to come so it comes and Allah says enter it the believer he says okay Allah ordered me to enter it because he believes now he sees the disbeliever will say ha you want me to enter it it will take him to hell no I'm not entering it it will take him to hell but those who enter it it will take them directly to Paradise so their test will be on the day of judgment Allah's name the most merciful the most forgiven Allah will not punish people unjustly so don't let Shan whisper in your ears or head saying how is this Fair Allah will put them in Hell Allah no Allah will not put them in Hell without giving them a fair trial I hope this answers your question thank you next person is from we have their and microphone please okay well after this one we going to have question because she still running to a oh is that close oh it's very close that's me [Music] my name is my name is the distance from the microphone to the amplifi my name is I'm 23 years old and I want to ask you about illness many but one day I heard one of say that mental illness is a disease whose cure is in the sky because our souls we are created in the sky what do you think about this year sh I hope you know my question thank you maybe you should change your when we don't have an answer we say Allah I don't know but to say that The Cure of mental illness in the sky likewise knowledge of Quran is in the sky and knowledge of Hadith is in the sky and the Cure of our physical illnesses is in the sky because I was created in the sky what is this mental illness is like physical illness it is found and what was prevalent and well known in the past is depression so people who tried their level best to give DAW and when they did not respond to you you felt depressed or a little bit tight in the chest this is normal nowadays it has expanded and psychologists and psychiatrists have made it a little bit more difficult but yet more easy for you to do bad things and say oh I have bipolar I I have schizophrenia I have borderline this I have this I have that in Islam we have sane and insane so if I kill the Sheikh and I say oh I have temporarily Insanity in America they will make psychiatric evaluation they said okay okay put him 5 years in hospital and master that's nice good food good uh place to stay in Islam No you ask is he crazy insane how do you define insanity he goes out naked in the street he doesn't know day from morning or from evening he doesn't know his mother he doesn't know anything he doesn't this is insane he's not accountable but other than that no going to kill you you kill him I'm going to kill you this is Islam so mental illness is there but I say always to the Muslims don't go to psychiatrists who are not Muslims because they will give you the first thing they say first of all we have to have 10 sessions and each session is this much money and you come for half an hour and you the the Sak says speak so say what's this my name is no and he speaks and speaks and speaks and speaks and speaks and he says okay half an hour is finished next time come inshah after 3 days you come after 3 days uh speak to me about your childhood you speak you speak and M of course he's playing suduku but he's pretending that he's okay 10 sessions after that said okay now I understand take proac anti-depressant take opioid take this will make you sleep this but all of these are very dangerous you become addicted to it and it doesn't solve your problem on the other hand Manana say no no no mental illness is not in Islam there is no mental illness in Islam you just read the Quran and you will become perfect no this is not yeah true yes it's a healing but you have to acknowledge sometimes I do counseling I do therapy I did not study psychology or Psychiatry but I studied Islam most people who come to me with problems all what they need is eye opener just to show them where is their mistake oh sh I have this fear of death I have anxiety I have I have after 7 minutes I said because he he paid for it it's not free I do not give counseling sessions for free this I give for free da is for free you call me on the phone is free you write to me on my website is free but when you say no no no I want you to sit with me for half an hour okay pain I have no problem so most people when they come they just want to speak and I did this I did that I had just listen I know everything you're going to say so can I save you time and I speak for 3 to 5 minutes and the GU I didn't know now it's clear okay you have 15 minutes of your session no no I'm leaving and they leave and they never come back why because I give them the Islamic solution open your eyes I have anxiety in fear of death one of the people I always say this story he came to me crying he said what's the problem he said I have anxiety and fear of death I lost half of my weight and my job kicked me out and my wife divorced me and I cannot leave my room I cannot leave my house I did not take a shower in 3 weeks well life the guy is crying he said I don't know what to do I said okay how long you've been had this he said for 3 years she I've been suffering like this and I'm afraid of dying he said okay did you die of course not she said and what happens if you're going to live another 20 years is this the quality of life you're going to lead for 20 years are you stupid what is this is your birth and death pre-ordained 50,000 years years before Allah created the universe yes can your death be 1 minute early no can it be 1 minute late no so why are you afraid when it comes it comes but I'm not going to wait for it to come and sit and do nothing the guy was she I went to so many psychiatrist they took so much money of me and they gave me so much medication nobody ever told me this in 5 minutes said this is why I'm expensive so all what you need is to recognize whether you have a mental illness for sure or it's only a depression that can be solved through understanding what life is how Allah uh um tests us and then you will be content with the grace of Allah thank you so much sir I think the answer is very clear there mental illness in Islam and if you have honest you have mental illness you go to non-muslim said like very clear and we have one more [Music] please my name is and tonight I would like to ask some from you um talking about happiness um I think there is a misunder understanding not for me as a child but also for my parents because sometimes parents has their own definition of happiness and and so do I so in some cases parents just insist their children to do one they want and the children T them too so um for example maybe parents told the children you have to go to work in that company or you have to marry inide F too old now and yeah whatever they want do for us to do and me as a child I want my parents to give me like three times to give me space to try whatever I want um and these conditions just push me those condition that I cannot St like because I tried to feel my parents once but I still failed so yeah thiss make me feel like I cannot accept my tradition right now and and I find hard to find happiness here so maybe you can tell me or suggest me what I should do so we can find our happiness thank you there is no middle ground in the Quran in the Sunnah in the scholars views you must be obedient to your parents dutiful and respectful full stop but no but don't butt this is what you should do now there are extreme cases but these are rare generally speaking you cannot please everybody so it's like saying the president of Indonesia tells me to do this and this and I'm not happy so what are you going to do if you don't obey him he will put you in jail because this is a crime I don't like the red light in the street so I will not stop if you don't stop we'll put you in jail maybe you'll have an accident so you don't have a choice with your parents Allah Associated being beautiful to your parents with this is the most honorable form of worship you can do after now unfortunately because we watch a lot of movies we watch a lot of soap opras we watch a lot of uh talk shows that show us how the kufar are living and dealing with their parents in America your 16 years old you take your bag and leave your parents cry your parents say no no after 10 years you're homeless you want to come home your parents say no leave in Islam we don't have this we're always with our parents whether they're good or bad and I say that you have to formulate and condition yourself to be good with them and everyone has a test in my counseling sessions a lot of the people come to me un like the sister she says my mother does this my mother does that my mother says bad thing about me she's not fair with my siblings she always favors them over me and she gives them money and not me and whenever she sits with the relatives she says I'm evil I am this I am that and not them so I said to her out of 10 what is your Calamity with your mom I'm depressed she I'm getting anxiety I'm I cannot breathe I cannot eat how much she says 10 says okay would you like this test or breast cancer chemotherapy the diation the full nine yards said no sh this so okay would you like this or to be in Yemen or Syria where chemical bombs are dropped on you and you see your family and children being burnt in front of you and you cannot do anything said no no no this would you like this or you have your child 7 months old skin over bones walking 20 kilom under the heat of the Sun for half a glass of water and you see him giving his last breath and you can't help him she said no no no this okay look at the rja in buma the Buddhist monk come and Slaughter the children the infants and they play football with their heads in front of the parents look at the ogre in China forced to shave their beard take off their hijab eat and drink pork and wine in Ramadan part of of brainwashing would you like this say no sh okay now let's ask let me ask you again your Calamity out of 10 with your mother how much she said two BOS so always be grateful everyone has a test now let me ask you if your mother may Allah make your your mother is like this my mother died 9 months ago may Allah have mercy on her if your mother was the kindest person was very generous was always saying good words where is the test there's no test you have to be kind because she's kind to you she's giving you money she's saying beautiful words she's treating you and your wife and your children in the best of fashion you have no you have no other choice but to be kind where is the test there is no test but the test is when she's the opposite it here is where you have to show your tolerance show that you're doing it for the sake of Allah not for the sake of people and this is what defines you as a real practicing Muslim from someone who's not so my sister take it from someone who's been there W if you have a mother today go and kiss her feet tomorrow when she dies it's closed the door is closed no more may Allah make us all among those who are dutiful respectful and obedient to our parents thank you so much I that very very of we have actually some but this time I to find their chair ofd have very special so he will ask the question and answer it I have question what do you what do you think about is your wife here no no no so the the issue of marriage and uh uh polygeny as they call it is not a joke unfortunately most most men think that Tik Tok so most men think that it's a joy it's a ride it's fun y let's go huh how how many wives you have one oh sh I have two oh I have three mallah but it is not it is a responsibility because you have to know that if you come on the day of judgment and you're not fair to both of them you will come with your side tilted everybody on the day of judgment will know oh he has two wives but he was not fair it is a lot of money a lot of Tolerance I was married to two alhamdulillah for 25 years 10 years ago I divorced one of my wives because I was going to die I could not tolerate it anymore so it is a beautiful experience for those who can be patient tolerant and fair most of the men that married are not like this and they're not real men I have many counseling sessions she I got married to a second wife good for you but after one year of marriage my wife found out oh you didn't tell her said no said okay now she's telling me either divorce her or divorce me so I said what are you going to do she said my first wife has four kids my second wife has no kids or maybe one kid so no I will divorce the other one you're not a real man you should not have got married a real man gets married because it's a necessity he has to so if my first wife comes and says because I got married I cannot stay in this marriage I will leave you want to leave leave I love you I respect you I will be fair with you but you don't force me because I'm a man but if I'm not a man and I will feel oh I should divorce one of them no this is not good so again she p polygeny is only for men who can be fair who can be tolerant who are ready to receive blows with high heels on their head and say yes give me some more here please here this is inshallah good and Allah knows best thank you very [Music] cir you going be tolerant and you're going to be just Wise onl It's lady how to feel the anything in my heart even if I do five times pray day I don't have har relationship I do not do drugs I do not do alcohol but my heart is still empty now The Emptiness of the heart is due that to the fact you did not fill it up with the right thing the heart is like this class you fill it to the top with water I cannot add anything else because it will overflow but if it's half full you can put something that would mix with it a lot of us do five times prayer not because we love prayer because we're accustomed to it our parents pray we pray and this is why a lot of us when they travel they don't pray a lot of the Saudis are I speak about Saudis Arabs when they travel to Europe they do first three days after three days they do at the end of the night in three minutes finished after 5 days no Salat at all after they come two three weeks they go and make and then they start praying their prayer is not from the heart it's Customs it's because everybody's praying and this is very big problem if the prayer is not initiated from the heart and you're praying for the sake of Allah then you have this emptiness in your heart how to fill it up now number one with the Quran with the vi with the knowledge about Islam with good companions most likely the sister who's asking this question has no muslim sisters associated with her and this is what I always find in my counseling session when people say I have anxiety I have this I say do you have Muslim friends said no I always in my room alone said this is why the prophet said the wolf eats from the Sheep the one that goes astray when the Sheep are together the wolf stays away until one of the sheep says I'm fed up I want to go for a smoke the sheep goes then the wolf attacks so when you with the friends with the Muslims you're United Muslim United they told me I have to make an endorsement so so when you are with the Muslims you become strong but when you're alone this is when Shan comes open Tik Tok Open YouTube watch this alone I don't have anything so don't ever be alone fill your your heart with Quran with of Allah with knowing who Allah is imagine how many years did the prophet spend in mecah 13 doing what there was no Salat except in the last couple of years there was no zaka there was no fasting there was no there was no ha there was no divorce marriage uh RBA transactions nothing what was he doing 13 years in mecah he was teaching people who Allah is what is the day of judgment what are the Angels what are the prophets what are the scriptures what is and this is what you have to fill your heart with if you want to get real proper Iman and Allah knows best thank you sir one more question from online from virtual this um how to build trust to our husband or wife if our wife or our husband still put um materialistic things on their prity this is not related at all trust is an issue of infidelity cheating and materialistic thing has nothing to do with trust I want to become rich I want my wife to become rich I want to build a bigger house so I don't see the relationship between the two if you're saying that it's not trust maybe let's use another word um my spouse is more interested in materialistic things while I'm interested in spiritual things and reaching Allah no you have to be balanced you have to remember seek in what Allah has given you the Hereafter but don't forget your portion of dya so have a balance the prophet was not always praying and fasting he used to play with his wives he used to race with mother AA race on foot he raced with her twice the first time she won he did not forget he waited few years until she gained weight and then he said okay let's race she said I forgot and when I raised him he won he laughed he said this for that one too shame so the prophet used to enjoy life used to play with his wives you can't expect and this is is a big problem with people who get committed to Islam all of a sudden all of my life you're my friend you're my relative you're my brother you're my spouse you always been the one I know all of a sudden you started getting closer to Allah you started learning religion you started being practicing now the Gap is much bigger between you and I what do you do you keep on poking me you're not doing this you're not praying on time you're not wearing the hijab you're not a good Muslim Allah will put you in hell and the Gap is getting bigger and bigger I'm not getting closer to you I'm getting further away from you it's your mistake instead yeah I have so many youngsters finding hi and their parents are against their hi because oh move the picture move the idols this is Haram don't do this don't do that you're a punk how old are you you just came from the egg and now you want to preach this is not the right way of doing it they have to respect you they have to love you they have to know that you want the goodness for them not to be Simon Says do this do that you're not speaking to them with arrogance from an ivory Tower rather I love love you I would like you to be guided if you do this you will win your wife's heart but whenever the Gap is much bigger and you're failing to close up the Gap you will never find peace or or happiness unless you try to change your strategy W thank you so much it's now 9 p.m. um and the are still resing their hand then you we have to close the I have to be I have to be in my hotel room at 10 because I have a celing session at 10 so do three or four more questions uh then we finish by 9:15 because after that we going to have like a video um show like um it's about like okay let's see so we have like 15 minutes for question and answer we have gentl like right there yeah yeah microphone then okay one and then we to the gentl please Asam [Music] Excuse me yes sir before video show we'll be you the [Music] players what Le the players no I okay reading the prayers for everyone huh before I don't know what video sure promotion video okay [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] my name is p I'm from uh but college student in here uh I want to ask uh maybe I ask in for uh for [Music] [Music] okay thank you so much very complicated is 24 years old he just graduated from college he said that he happy some happy but not very happy and it's all love so uh he never did any girl and his prop there he's happy with that but at the same time is's jealous with his friends who girls with his friends get married into the young age but he's happy being single uh he said he's happy but not really happy because he's also jealous with his friends his question is how to be consistent how to be sta um to be single then happy and while pursuing his dreams of getting prop job things before his ready to get because actually he L somebody but that person he loves doesn't love that's so what do you say see this is the problem when you don't abide by Islam I don't have this problem of loving someone who doesn't love me everybody loves me but I don't have this problem because I don't sit with I don't give them the chance to love me or I love them back or relationships this is Haram in Islam I do not sit with my own cousins because they're not to me so I don't communicate with them on WhatsApp not that I am antisocial no my male cousins their brothers I speak with them and I talk with them and I mix with them but this is what what happens when you don't abide by Islam and this is what we mentioned that you will have a depressed life because you turned your back to Allah's remembrance if you filled your heart with the love of Allah you would not how would a person feel jealous of others falling into sin I could not understand this the prophet saidat in an authentic Hadith scary Hadith this world is categorized for four types of people number one IM whom Allah has given wealth and knowledge so he's using his knowledge in what pleases Allah in spending the wealth in what pleases Allah a man who Allah gave him knowledge but did not give him wealth so he says H if I had the wealth of number number one I would do exactly like him the prophet says they are in the same level of reward with what intention he doesn't have money but he has knowledge so he says if I had money I would have done exactly like him build masjids give charity la la la like the third one a man whom Allah did not give knowledge but gave wealth so this man having girlfriends having Haram income enjoy enjoying life going here and there so he's very sinful correct the Fourth Man Allah did not give knowledge and did do not give wealth so he says oh if I had the money this man had I would have done this and this and this and this exactly like him the prophet said they are in the same level of sin just because you intended it so I can't understand how does someone see Haram and wish I wish I could do this this is not me and Allah knows that two more question one from here one from really sorry guys so gentlemen yes I understand fin good night I mean different I am an English teacher from a high school well I want to ask is would you please give us and also some parents how to motivate and also how to give that to our teenagers because as you know teenagers are really unstable human being right now and they do a lot of bad behaviors I mean like in school we have conseling guids and also a friend is more important for them rather than their parents I think that's it thank you and my my name is thank Isa okay first of all I totally disagree with the comment you made that the teenagers are unstable if you look in the of the Prophet what was the age that the prophet would allow people to come and fight in Wars 15 so when you come and say no no we have teenagers sh we don't have the terminology in Islam of teenagers we do not have teenagers we have adults and non- adults in Islam the moment you hit puberty you're an adult you're accountable USB Z was 17 some say 18 years old when the prophet appointed himat as the ruler and Amir of an army who was in this Army under his leadership Abu Bak om and Ali o under was black so even the Arabs would say how is this possible no this is management if you look ATB Omar abdah Omar he was 15 when he was admitted to fight in the battle of and the prophet we used to scan and and Screen the companions how old are you 14 go back 15 come so I believe that the teenagers need trust need support need us to believe in them why do we always deal with them with doubt what are you watching show me your mobile what is in your back why did you come late who are you talking to why do we treat them okay don't they do bad things yes but excuse me parent don't you do bad things so it is the same concept number one number two when we fail to give our children quality time they will run when your child of course you don't have children but I'm talking out of experience when your child is five 6 7 8 until maybe 10 years of age he's running after you ABA I want to sit with you I want to talk to you let's go and play but you don't have time I have work I have da I have this I have that when he reaches 15 16 team you run after him come let's sit no no no I have friends I have uh football I have to go there I have to go that now you come and cry why is he not sitting with me you refus to sit with him in the beginning had you given him quality time from the beginning he would have been with you all the way so it's not Rights and Wrongs dos and don'ts it's a full package once you bring bring up the children to be adhering to Quran and Sunnah you will never never have these problems inshallah and Allah knows best final question from the gentleman please I want to add some Pitch from you guys from uh about how to find a real honest preacher of because in this time of period period of f we don't really really know uh who is telling the truth about the Quran and okay but uh sometimes uh there is some saying like uh by my experience I follow some and they say oh don't follow that guy that guy is or something don't follow that so sometime this kind of treatment give us the youth that lead that want ISL getting confused so is there anys from you thank you first of all no one is perfect even me unfortunately nobody's perfect and I've heard you say this so many times a scholar like you a scholar like you in Arabic a scholar is a I am not a I'm a student of knowledge I sat with like B Alani if you sit with them you would think yourself to be what am I nothing zero but to you you don't have any like those so unfortunately you see us like alims but we're not now the youth must never ever engage in labeling this is a very dangerous game uh what are you um Sufi salafi wab uh what what what are you I have to give you a I have to give you a sticker no this is very bad focus on learning the religion as was revealed to the prophet Alat how by reading the Quran learning it when we read the Quran and learn it you don't ask no I'm learning the Quran learn the Sunnah learn the proper according to would say no don't do it would say no don't do do it no no we say the way of the Prophet is the best of way if you focus on learning what is beneficial for you you will not have a problem the moment you watch YouTube channel she so and so is refuting she so and so putting the gloves okay this very good let me let me bring my popcorn okay what what did the other she say oh next week he's going to refute him good let's let's V watch you waste your time you waste your energy and you make your heart hard and black because if you meet the other sheh you don't want to speak to him you don't want to give him Salam don't do this I don't spend seconds on watching these refutations some of them are friends of mine some of them call me she ask what do you think I said don't call me don't ask me what you're doing is bad but he said bad things I have to ref him I have to say this and that said everyone who says bad things about you will it become true if someone says to you you're an ass sometimes they say to me you're an ass I said yes this is my nickname as I am so someone says to me you're an ass my students say oh very angry she he's insulting you when he says I'm an will I grow two ears and a tail I don't care what he says say whatever you want you're not going to make me go down and when you praise me I'm not going to go up so focus on learning the religion of Allah not following individuals not having allegiance to she so and so or group so and so this is not Islam Your Allegiance is to Quran toah with the understanding of the three favorite generations and I hope this answers your question thank you thank you thank you so very much ladies and gentlemen that's very much the WRA of this evening question and answer session so that this kind of like wrap up the session tonight thank you so much like I mentioned earlier we have like one minute or two minutes with you [Music] by I thought I thought he wanted me to record for Muslim United that's wasn't nobody told me it's not in the script okay"
