  "transcript": "and she also asks about the ruling on reciting Fatiha when going to mizar's graveyards is this okay or not well we have to know that a woman is not allowed to visit a graveyard and there is a hadith where the Prophet Allah saw some curses women who do this often so scholars said that it is not permissible for a woman to visit a graveyard simply because she is we don't have a justification from the Quran and Sunnah we have to do it as it is but some scholars thought of giving some classifications or justifications by saying this is due to the nature of women in general they are soft hearted and if they visit the graveyard of a husband or of a father or of a son they would probably cry and maybe do something that would be inappropriate for a woman to do outside of her house and therefore it is not permissible for a woman to visit a graveyard generally speaking what I read and her question was going to mizar's graveyard in in what if I understand this correctly in some so-called Islamic countries they have what is known as Mazar and Amazon is a tomb that is built over a grave and people think that this is a saint or a pious person and they go and pray and they may sacrifice some animals for this so-called saint and they may put candles and they may put forward their requests and needs in pieces of papers and may give sacrifices of different kinds and buy things and food etc such acts would be considered part of shirk that leads to associating others with Allah going to the graves and making Tawaf or touching them seeking their Baraka or sacrificing for the saint this is all these are deeds that can only be attributed to Allah so job asking the saint to facilitate things for us in this dunya or to prevent harm from coming our way is major shake whoever does this is not a Muslim anymore even if he prays fast and performs pilgrimage because he associated others with Allah Allah does not forgive any forms of associating others with him in Allah Allah Allah few I use shakopee Hama does not forgive people who associate others with him and he may forgive any other sin to whomever he wishes as stated in two places in the Quran so going to such saints or to such Mazar is completely prohibited for men and for women going to someone who's dead and asking him and telling him that I have this problem I'd like you to solve my wife is disobedient my son went astray I have debts I'm losing my job I'm ill asking anyone other than Allah is if you go to a deceased if you go to a dead person and ask him to do something for you that only Allah can do this is considered to be major shirk and this is not permissible at all so going to such graveyards for men and women is not permissible and unfortunately a lot of the Muslims are heavily involved in such shirk people believe in such Saints believing in calling the disease the dead asking them for guidance and for help they would swear by these so-called Saints yet they would refuse to swear by allah azza wa jal or they would find it easy to swear by Allah and lie rather than swearing by these Saints and like they could never lie and this is an indication that these are not Muslim because they are associating others with Allah Azza WA JAL if you go to Muslim countries you will find priests so-called Muslim that are taking care of these tombs and shrines and and places of worship to other than Allah is ocean and they are the priests that take the money from the poor and telling them that your prayers would be answered you will have a child and your debt would be paid and this and that and all of this is blasphemy you're associating others with Allah even if you do this with the Prophet Allah masala dosa leemarie even if you go to the grave of the Prophet Ali salatu salam and ask him and address him or prophet of allah do this for me do that for me or ask allah to do this for me or do that for me this is because you're asking someone to do something that only Allah can do for you and why go to Saints and to humans when you can go and turn to allah azzawajal they say yeah we know that but these Saints these pious people they're closer to Allah so we call them so that they could call Allah as the watcher and this is exactly what the mushriks the mushrikeen of mecca replied when they were told why do you worship these idols they said we don't worship them we don't believe that they have life and death in their hands or that they get the rain to fall down or that they bring us provisions we don't believe this but we take them as intermediates to allah azza wajal so it's our way to Allah through them and Allah described them as mushrikeen those who associate others with Allah so this is a very major issue he is far greater than how you pray or how you fast it's far important more important than committing adultery or drinking intoxicants either sins makes sense but what I've just mentioned is something that annihilates Islam that's voids Islam that cancels Islam altogether no matter what you do and it's something that we should take care of"
