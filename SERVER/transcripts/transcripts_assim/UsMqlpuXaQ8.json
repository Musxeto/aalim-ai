  "transcript": "Bilal from Morocco Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh I have a question When I go to Juma'ah And the Imam is doing Dua After the Dua If you wipe your hands Is it a bid'ah? It's an issue of dispute Ibn Abdul Bar who is also a Maliki Says that this is not done Except by the ignorance There is no authentic Hadith backing Raising the hands in Dua And then afterwards wiping the face Besides that it is not permissible For the congregation or the Imam To raise their hands in Juma'ah The Sahaba and the Tabi'een Would consider those who do this To have done an innovation And some of the Sahaba would make Dua Says Because this was not done by the Prophet He never raised his hands When doing Juma'ah While making Dua Except when asking Allah Azza Wa Jal for rain And only then the congregation may raise their hands When he says O Allah grant us rain O Allah make rainfall happen The congregation raise their hands and say Ameen Other than that whatever he makes Dua He does not raise his hands He just points his finger like this Index finger And the congregation just sit there and say Ameen And Allah knows best"
