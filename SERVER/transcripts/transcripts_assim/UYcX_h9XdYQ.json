  "transcript": "uh abdul wadud says is thinking or saying to someone it would have been better if i did this in the past rather than what i actually did does it come under shirk for example saying to someone if i wrote a answer instead of b in the exam i would have got good marks does this come under shirk the answer is no it doesn't come under shirk but it is under the prohibition of saying i wish i have done so and so because the prophet salam told us that it opens a door for satan to whisper to you and to mess up with your mind the prophet said and don't say had i done this and this that this and that would have happened but say whatever allah wills and decrees will take place so this is submitting your will to allah something that has already taken place why feel regretful over it and say it you have to submit your will it's gone it's it's done and this opens the door for shaytan because if i gave my son the medication he wouldn't have fallen ill he wouldn't have died and it starts to eat you from inside and this means that you do not submit your will to allah this is something that allah has preordained 50 000 years before he created the universe before he created the whole creation so it's been preordained and done and over with it took place and happened what's the use of saying if i were to book an earlier flight i would not have missed my flight but i didn't you've already missed your flight so what's the point of regretting and feeling remorseful over it it's only what satan does best to mess up with your mind but is it shirk no it isn't it's not shirk you believe in allah azzawajal but you're regretful does it decreed decrees my level of iman yes indeed because you're not submitting fully to the decree of allah and you're not believing in the sixth pillar of iman which is to believe in allah's predestiny whether good or bad part of the belief is to have this content to have this surrendering to what allah has chosen for you rather than to object in such a fashion allah as those knows best you"
