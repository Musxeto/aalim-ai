  "transcript": "Asa from the UK assalamu alaikum I wanted to ask you um what is the ruling on Allah what is the ruling like is there a possibility that Allah answers about the war in the west possible way or one of the worst ways for example if someone says to another person you're going to fail the exam would this mean that Allah takes away their hands so then they can't write or take away the eyesight so then they can't provide for it for you foreign so this is something that only Allah can answer the prophet said in an authentic Hadith do not make Dua against yourselves against your children against your servants or against your wealth so that you may not coincide a time where Allah answers the Dua and he answers your Dua a time of distress many people would say out of their ignorance oh Allah take me destroy me o Allah  me because of their frustration and it so happens that this coincides with a time where Allah accepts the Dua and Allah accepts it so this is possible but when someone randomly makes Dua against you may Allah azzawajal you may Allah break your back if you had not done a Bad Thing If You observe your ascar and you are a good Muslim the chances of Allah accepting such a bad Dua is very very minute so we shouldn't fear people's Dua if we are righteous and not oppressive or wrong wronging others we should have trust in Allah that Allah is fair and just and he would not hold us accountable for such um bad Dua that is not uh called for [Music] all right and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and the evening I will uh try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah"
