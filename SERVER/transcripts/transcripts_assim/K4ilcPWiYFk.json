  "transcript": "as-salam-o-alaikum welcome to another episode of with the Prophet Ali Coleman a be your host for today's show we are joined by special guest continuing with Sheikh Azam L Hakim from Saudi Arabia Salaam alaikum and welcome why are you insane my cat honor to have you with us to continue our discussion about how we should stay with the Prophet in our daily lives and we're looking at the Sun his example peace be upon him on how to do that we've been talking about family members around the Prophet SAW Lewis alone and today we look at another group of members of the society around him his servants both within and without of his of his home I'd like to start by describing the context that I'm coming from my home country of the United States generally those families those households that have permanent domestic staff are affluent families middle-class families may hire a domestic help on an as-needed basis but it is much more commonplace in developing countries in Africa and Asia and Latin America even among the poor families in these developing countries I've been there I've seen it with my own eyes on the subject of servants and slavery and labor laws and all this kind of thing some make the case that slavery never ended there are many modern forms of slavery even the middle class are indebted heavily such that they have no option but to continue to work for the rest of their lives they're very in terms of economics and finance is very few truly free people in the world my question is about the context of the Prophet peace be upon him the seventh century on the Arabian Peninsula what was please describe for us the situation for the servant the difference between the servant and the and the slave in this time time context Valera Mandela Haman hamdulillahi rabbil aalameen or Solomon Americana I'm the hero Dean I mean imagine water he or some be a Jemaine I'm about the issue of slavery needs to be looked into with an objective and I say this because the minute I open my mouth and I say slavery people have goose bumps it's a hot-button issue yeah and especially in the United States of America that's right and in Europe where over the past three or four hundred years there were atrocities there were crimes committed when they used to go to Africa and snatch people steal them or induct them right unjustly hmm and imprison them in boat trips that were horrific so many people died and once they reached the promised land they were dealt and met with things that are we cannot even speak about our imagine right now this took place but this also caused people to have a way of looking at things that may affect their objectivity when we look at slavery in Islam we have to understand that we talk from a position of power okay our religion comes from Koran and from the Sunnah so it's not something that is man-made and it's not something that can be changed over time first of all this is the example I usually give in my speak in speeches and and lectures that Islam is like a frame okay and our lives is like a picture the picture contains our desires our needs our misconceptions our superstitions so when a true Muslim wants to become a Muslim he puts the frame which is Islam and brings a pair of scissors and starts to cut the loose ends hmm so that the frame fits one percent his life is nice illustration now what the people are doing at the moment is they find that there's so many things to compromise in their lives which they're not willing to let go so what they do is they tend to distort and reshape the frame but this is not Islam so they break this edge they expand this corner in the use duct tape they bring a lot of extensions but at the end of the day when you get the frame fitting the picture it's not the frame we know right it's a it's a new religion or gather so Islam when it came in the seventh century when the Prophet a Salaam was given the revelation slavery existed so the Byzantines had them the Persians had them the Abyssinians had them everywhere had they had but the difference is that Islam made one source of slavery in other nations to date as you've mentioned white slavery when people need money I can go to Cambodia and I meet a farmer who is indebted and is it listened by my my child for $200 mm-hmm you can have my daughter for $500 it she's yours this is not permissible in slammer if you owe me money and you can't pay me long ago you will become my slave because this is an eye for an eye mmm in Islam this is a no-go the only source of slavery in Islam okay is prisoners or for I see this is an eye-opener for me because when you mentioned the transatlantic slave trade that the European Christians instituted both Catholic and Protestant Christians some 10 to 15 million human beings abducted 30 percent of which were Muslims many of them were Hafez as an accomplished Islamic scholars from West Africa it was done like harvesting resources correct there was no open or declared war a lot of the treaties and conventions of today didn't apply then but it was done under a different for different purposes it was pure exploitation you're telling us that even prior to the beginning of the transatlantic slave trade in Islam it was narrowed narrowly defined to only to situations of warfare correct then and this is a solution Islam comes with solutions to problems see war is inevitable this is the cycle of life and don't tell me about Geneva treaties and and and and the likes because look around you Muslims are being attacked worldwide mm-hmm non-muslims are being attacked countries have wars among them look at world war one world war two Muslims had nothing to do with it they killed hundreds of millions look at Nagasaki Hiroshima Muslims had nothing to do it so war is inevitable it happens but what to do when we have prisoners of war here hundreds of thousands millions of people do we simply place them in gas chambers do we put them in Guantanamo not knowing anything of them Islam gives them an honorable life it allocates them to Muslim families okay but they were they will work their slaves yes but as we will see in this segment or the following or the following depends on whenever inshallah we will get to it we will see how Islam gives them rights in a way that no other religion guys I look forward to it I look forward to now having said that slavery existed but through one source which is jihad which is the war between the Muslims and the non-muslim see now look at the exit doors from slavery if you think that Islam encourages slavery think again expirations for so many small and major sins the first thing you begin with is free asleep what is this so I made an oath I said what law he I will not have lunch at your home at your house tomorrow and then he told me listen Shaykh I'm making a really juicy steak and I just got that from South Africa beautiful and I said wow I love steaks listen I made an oath what should I do Allah Azza WA JAL tells us the expiration in chapter 6 Surat al-ma'idah you should feed 10 poor people or clothe them or free a slave okay so Islam tells you free a slave for what for just saying well I am up for swearing yes so Islam encourages this a person driving on the highway by accident makes a car accident and someone dies the expiation blood money mm-hmm plus he has to free a slave must he's it's a must not like you can do this for another blood money is 100 camels worth mmm and the freeing of the slave is a must if there is no slaves then he has to fast two consecutive months yeah I don't think we'd find this in any of the laws of the Protestant or Catholic not only not only that it's there's so many more in the pipeline hmm a person is prohibited to have intercourse during the daytime of Ramadan while fasting someone falls weak and has intimacy with his wife mmm the first thing to do is to expiate by freeing a slave a person says in a time in a moment of anger that you as my wife I will make you like my mother I will not have any intimacy with you and then he regrets it in expiration you first thing to do is to a slave and you go on and on so Islam doesn't promote slavery on the contrary it encourages that you free the slaves and imagine if this existed if slavery existed today you will rarely find slaves so because they would be all free so what I would I hear you saying describing for us and we're ready for our break number one it narrows it limits it restricts the conditions under which human beings can be taken into slavery and then secondly after they've been brought into slavery also creates multiple outlets for them to be free correct in addition to the fact that they have rights so it's not like a slave I can whip him I can amputate his organs I can kill him I can bury him and do whatever I want he's like trash to me no he's still a human being though he's a slave I can sell and buy yeah well that's a great start shake great foundation to continue and we look forward to this conversation after a short break assalamu alaikum and welcome back to with the Prophet and we are continuing our discussion with the Sheikh Hasina Saudi Arabia on the subject of servants who were around the Prophet of Islam Salah lahu waliyan solo let's continue by making a distinction between the status and the roles of the servants and slaves how were they different please elaborate on that okay first of all a slave is like something that you possess it's like a car it's like your couch you sell and buy yet he or she has rights a servant who is a free person this is totally different and his rights are far greater than the rights of a slave okay he's someone that you must pay on time he's someone that you may not punish or reprimand like you would do with your slave see it's different with your slave you may treat your slave in a fashion different than a slave and then a free person due to the fact that you own him so those who were around the prophet alayhi salatu salam the vast majority of them were free men and this is why they were servants the Prophet did have re salat WA Salam one or two concubines okay but in general he had servants and these servants were not with him like the tyrants the wealthy the kings the picture of the Pharaoh and someone standing over Fanning them yes it's not the same way they did not do his body cool body cooler and manicured or whatever no they had certain tasks first of all second of all he did not pay them because it was their honor to serve the Prophet as salabhasana yes they might have joined in in a meal or so because this was his habit that he would if ever he eats those around him eat with him but mainly speaking he did not have a lot to eat throughout his time because he was not living the life of a king but rather the life of a servant of Allah the Almighty so he had a number of servants he had a number of servants and as you said the people around him were free people meaning that there were no slaves that he possessed today ok so let me ask you about you know getting the testimony from those who were servants under the Prophet would be very valuable in terms of learning about the character of the Prophet towards them what was his manner his way he's one thing for us to say from the outside but to have the servant themselves and we do have such an example the person of honest eben Malik correct he was I understand served the Prophet in that capacity as a servant for 10 years yes what did this brother honest we'll all be pleased with him how did he characterize the way that the Prophet treated him ok first of all how did the Prophet employee anis simply when the Prophet migrated from Mecca to Medina I'm so lame who was a wise woman came to the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and she said oh prophet of Allah there is no man or woman in Medina except that they had given you a gift and I don't have money so when the Prophet came everyone brought him apart a pillow some food etc as a gift it's a good gesture now she said I don't have anything to give you except my son and my son is 10 years of age and he's young but he's learned it so keep him with you and he will serve you Oh prophet of Allah oh I see mm-hmm so Ana's was one of the prophets servant alayhi salatu was-salam you can see others such as anis was responsible for the profits as salam Erin's clothes special missions he interested him he trusted him a lot may Allah be pleased with him there was at the life in my suit the great companion of the Prophet am who says that 70-plus sewers of the Quran I took directly from the mouth of the Prophet Elisha and the Prophet told us if you want to learn the Quran properly learn it from for one of them is a Bonomi apt this is the nickname of the lovers who so he was the prophets at is no salaam servant but his tasks his job description was to take care of the prophets sandals and sea walk which is a toothbrush to always prepare them have them ready and carry them for the Prophet when the Prophet was not in need of them there was a banana algae honey and he was responsible for transportation in a sense meaning that he was responsible for the prophets mule and his ride whenever he traveled on trips and expeditions there was also a slap in the sherek and he was responsible for the prophet's camel so different rides different servants also there was bilal in araba now belad is well known to have been the Abyssinian slave v bilal yes who was tortured and then freed by abu bakr and then assumed a prominent role which is the more evident he was the one who called one of the more advanced who calls for prayer for salat of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and then you have a Buddha Allah fairy also one of the prophets are some companions who used to be the gatekeeper so the Prophet goes into a garden he sits at the gate not allowing anyone to come in without the prophets permission there was Aemon ignore obeyed and his mother Amon and they were all free slaves freed slaves so they came voluntary to assist and to serve the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and so on so when you look at he also had a Jew servant the professional had a Jew serving him a young boy but and this shows you the diversity now you're the messengers of of Allah and you tell us that we have to be proud of being Muslims and you have a Jew servant then how can we deal with this when nowadays people say you must hate Jews Christians anyone who's non-muslims again the issue of hate and love people are ignorant yeah if I hate something in you doesn't mean I have to kill you right maybe I hate in you that you are not generous I came to your house you did not buy me make me food for lunch but I love in you that you pray on time that you kind your wife that you kind to your parents that you are truthful you never lie that you're always or punctual on time so the issues of hate and love are there but we have to balance them it's not to go to extreme so when we looked at the Prophet himself I saw some had a Jew servant yeah then listen we have something wrong in our practicing of Islam all of these servants were not domestic servants in the sense that they come in the home they mix with the prophets wives they do no no no not at all like we see nowadays people doing so anis as coming back to your remark hmm anis himself told us that I've served the prophet alehissalaam for ten years okay never ever I was reprimanded by him in a sense that if he tells me to do something and after a while he would not say did you do what I asked you to do no micromanagement yes and if I don't do something he would not come to me and say why didn't you do that you should have done this and that so it was like easy going on his salon to a senator and Anna said he never beat he never hit me okay he never abused me he never cursed me now ten years you have a kid serving you the least you would expect is a report an incident where simply the Prophet lost it eisah never ever any of his servants mentioned such a thing [Music] subhanAllah that's a very strong record for on this aspect of the prophets life as the head of a household as the person who employed we are we used the term an indentured servants but I don't even know if that would apply in this case in any case they were free people and they were diverse in their duties and their their ethnic backgrounds in the case of the Jewish boy I'd like to also ask you about his it's one thing to have a good manner to respect the dignity of a human of your humanity to not micromanage your work to be trusting so on and so forth what about caring for their needs one area of modern concern in modern times for employment and labor laws is providing for health care minimum wage so on and so forth what example do we have was he buying them clothes was he providing for their healthcare and so on and so forth the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam clearly instructed in so many hadith and I'm sorry we were short on time about a minute and a half left ok Shama I'll try to wrap things up he clearly instructed us to feed them from what we eat ok and to clothe them from what we wear mmm without a fire he was seen once walking with his slave and he was like wearing a tux with jeans and his servant was wearing proper pants with a full / whatever yeah so one of the companions said listen if you were to wear the suit properly and let him wear something else that would have matched see it doesn't look right right so he said the prophet alayhi salat wa salam instructed us ordered us to wear to make to clothe them from what we wear and to feed them from what we eat and a Buddha was doing that to the letter in the sense that it's not how long it's not prohibited for you to give him something less but just to show you the level of piety in the level of righteousness that they had reached that he took the instruction of the Prophet are some to the letter so if I if I buy 5 or 10 meters of cloth to make clothing oh yeah and you know it's high-quality material you know I don't have to buy a lower quality for my servants they have to also make their clothes from the same material I purchase this is the Sunnah not only that there are hadiths authentic that when they cook food you must give them from that same food because they worked on it not the leftovers of the scraps or the unwanted parts and and this is what we handle practice back home in Saudi Arabia for example when we sent the driver to buy us food from a restaurant we tell them that this is what we want our order and you buy whatever you want from the same place in the same place so that he wouldn't feel that bringing them nice delicious smelly food and then he goes and eats a sandwich it's a beautiful standard and a beautiful discussion lots of good things that we got from this thank you very much Malik I love you we will conclude our discussion for today's episode thank you very much for being with us we look forward to continuing in our next episode another look at servants around the Prophet in this show with the Prophet assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
