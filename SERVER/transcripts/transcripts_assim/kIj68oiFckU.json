  "title": "Why do Maalikis put their hands by their sides when praying",
  "transcript": "ali from uk says al-maliki followers when you go \nto morocco algiers maybe some places in Nigeria or   whatever they what they call seddle they don't put \ntheir right hand over the left on the chest they   leave their hands to their sides so what's \nthe point of that some scholars say that   the followers of imam malik started doing \nthis when he started praying like that.   Why would imam malik imam darul \nhijrah pray like that when he knows   that the sunnah of the prophet islam as in the \nhadith of (Arabic) may Allah be pleased with him was to put the right over the left on \nthe chest and this is the sunnah of   all prophets why would Imam Mailk do this? The \nreason was that at some time or period of history   there was a disagreement between the muslim ruler \nand al imam malik which happens throughout history   with all scholars. This happened with imam ahmad \nthis happened with mahmoud hanifah this happened   with imamtamia who died in prison. All great \nscholars are tested and usually if they don't kiss   the backside or they don't polish shoes they \nwill be thrown in jail this is the norm.   So there was this disagreement which imam \nmailk refused to compromise the religion   which led the Muslim ruler to flog him and beat \nhim in prison that led an injury to his arm which   prevented him from being able to lift it so he \nused to pray with his arms to his side. Some of   his disciples and students apparently who were not \nvery smart followed that way of prayer instead of   going back to his books to his hadiths that he \nused to teach to learn how the prophet used to   pray and they mimicked that and made it part of \ntheir religion or part of their school of thought   which is totally bogus which is totally not true \nand Ali my friend, as a Muslim we have to go back   to the references Quran and sunnah not to what \ntom dick and harry did with all due respect to   them but Allah ordered us to follow the Quran and \nthe sunnah and people differ people have their   different preferences and understanding to things \nso we are not to get closer to Allah by their   understanding rather by the Quran the sunnah \nwith the understanding of the three favorite   generations the companions \nTabieen and taba'tabeen."
