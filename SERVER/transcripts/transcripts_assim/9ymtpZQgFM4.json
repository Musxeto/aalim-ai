  "transcript": "There is a good example for you in the Messenger of Allah for those who hope for Allah and the Last Day and remember Allah a lot. In the name of Allah, the most gracious, ever merciful Praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds I send my greetings and blessings upon the one who was sent to the world Our master Muhammad and upon his family and companions As for after Dear brothers and sisters in Islam Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh It is without doubt that our Prophet Muhammad ﷺ was the kindest person ever to have lived And he was the best of people in moral conduct and ethics and way of dealing with people He was soft and kind, tolerant, easy going He lived with people and they loved how he lived with them He was kind and soft and compassionate towards his wives, children, his companions With everyone, everyone who knew him, loved him at first sight Allah Azza Wa Jal described him and praised him by saying So by the mercy from Allah, O Muhammad, you were lenient with them And if you had been rude in speech and harsh in heart They would have disabandoned from about you So the Prophet ﷺ was easy going, was kind, was tolerant Not rude, not aggressive, not intimidating And this is something that is rare to find nowadays It's a quality that can only be found in leaders Whom you respect yet you feel their love and care Not to be intimidated or frightened from them This is how the Prophet ﷺ was When it came to his wives and we know that wives differ Some can be kind, some can be arrogant, some can be nagging, some can be rude Women differ like men However, the Prophet ﷺ with all of them was loving and caring and kind He used to check on them each one, every single day Nine women, he used to check on them in the morning and after Asr Nowadays we hear complaints from so-called men who are married to more than one And their wives complain that he may abandon her for a month or two Without even calling or texting or checking or not even paying them their allowance And providing for them the essentials such as food and shelter These are not real men, let alone to be Muslims Because this is not how the Prophet dealt with his wives, alayhis salatu was salam He, when he married Aisha, she was a young girl And she loved him more than anything on earth And he ﷺ would appreciate and put into consideration her young age So he used to send her other young girls to play with, her friends So that she wouldn't be feeling lonely He also used to do whatever she desired As long as it was halal, he would go with it Once, the Abyssinians were playing with their swords and spears in the masjid A form of training, a form of let's say dancing but it's training actually And the Prophet ﷺ was watching them Aisha came from behind, from inside her house And the Prophet ﷺ said, would you like to watch? And she said yes He wouldn't say, no, go, hide, don't look, don't watch, don't do this, don't do that Like so many of us may do, prohibiting what is permissible Just to be safe, no, no, to be safe, don't do this Without any knowledge, the Prophet ﷺ said to her, come She placed her chin on his shoulder and kept on watching And after a while the Prophet ﷺ said, had you had enough? And she said, no, no, no, I'd like to watch more And the Prophet ﷺ would leave her Whenever she drank from a glass, let's say milk The Prophet ﷺ would take the glass and search for where she had placed her lips on to drink from And drink from the same spot Just to show her how much love he has for her And of course a woman would be delighted to see her husband not being repulsed or disgusted To use the same utensils she had used Like we always make a joke when I say to my wife, bring me a spoon please so I can eat with She says, take my spoon I said, okay, wash it seven times with water and once with soil And then I get smack on the face This is a joke, but unfortunately there are men who may act like this No, no, no, I wouldn't eat with the same spoon The Prophet ﷺ did that He even went further to see when she had a bite from a bone that had meat on it He would take it and look where she snatched the meat from And do the same from the same spot And this makes the love grow between the spouses When he used to call his wife He used to use what's known in Arabic as al-tarkhim And al-tarkhim is deleting a letter or two to give a nickname So instead of Aisha, he would say Ya Aish And that is a beautiful way of calling her And he would also show his kindness even when she is the wrongdoer It was reported in an authentic hadith by Nu'man ibn Bashir May Allah be pleased with him and with his father That once the Prophet ﷺ was with Aisha in their home And they were in a heated argument Like any couple, when Abu Bakr, Aisha's father, sought permission to enter So he was given the permission and he entered his daughter's home And he found Aisha shouting at the Prophet ﷺ In a sense, raising her voice when talking to him And he charged on her, wanting to beat her and scold her Saying to her, do you raise your voice over the Prophet ﷺ? And when the Prophet saw this, of course if he is the husband And his wife was treating him like this And it's her father who wants to reprimand her and scold her or beat her up I didn't do anything, I didn't ask for it, I don't mind, be my guest No, the Prophet ﷺ immediately intervened and stood in Abu Bakr's face And he prevented him, of course, from doing anything Because he was in his face, in his way So Abu Bakr left the house angrily with his daughter So the Prophet ﷺ went to terrified Aisha and said to her Don't you see? I prevented him from beating you up Don't you see? I saved you from the man You should be appreciative, look how kind I am to you So he's showing her what he did to her And few minutes later, she started laughing with him And the Prophet ﷺ was laughing with her back And they were happy again Abu Bakr came to the house again Wanted to see what things are happening there And when he entered and found them laughing and giggling He said, Oh Prophet of Allah, as you have engaged me in your war moments ago Engage me in your peace and tell me what you're laughing about No harm's done And the case was resolved This is how kind the Prophet was ﷺ He was extremely kind with children Whether his own or others The Prophet ﷺ used to show his kindness Ibn Abbas, his cousin, may Allah be pleased with him He used to say that the Prophet ﷺ once saw me He wiped over my head and made dua that Allah grants me wisdom Anas ibn Malik, his servant, was a boy, a young boy serving the Prophet ﷺ The Prophet would always address him by saying, Ya Abu Nayy, my son And this shows that the Prophet was showing him kindness and empathy And being kind to him Not only that, even toddlers, 4 years, 5 years of age The Prophet would nickname them Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, had a brother And this brother had a small bird in a cage And when the bird died, the boy wept and was saddened by it And every time the Prophet came into their house, his ﷺ would say Ya Abu Umair, what shall we do? He would nickname him, a child And he would say, Ya Aba Umair, the father of Umair And the boy did not have a wife, let alone a child But this is one of the etiquettes in Islam to nickname children And also there was this young girl that the Prophet used to call Umm Khalid He used to joke sometimes, but he never says any lies He jokes, but never says any lies Anas says, once the Prophet ﷺ called me, oh you with the 2 ears And of course everyone has 2 ears, but sometimes people would feel insulted But what do you mean by 2 ears? You have 2 ears I didn't say that they're long or big or small or ugly 2 ears So the Prophet used to do this ﷺ, but he would not lie He would also not reprimand his servants or the children Anas Ibn Malik says, one day the Prophet ﷺ sent me on an errand And I embedded in myself not to go I wanted to play, I wanted to have some time off So I saw a group of children playing So I stood there watching them and maybe wanting to play with them When all of a sudden I had someone holding me from my neck, from behind me And I looked and it was the Prophet ﷺ laughing And he said, Unais, his name is Anas, Unais is the smaller version of the name Unais, did you go where I ordered you to do or to go? So I said, yes oh Prophet of Allah I'm going now And the Prophet ﷺ let him go laughing No reprimanding, no scolding Anas says, I served the Prophet ﷺ since I was a young boy for 9 years And never ever he said to something I had done, why did you do this? Or for something I did not do, wouldn't you have done so and so? He served the Prophet ﷺ for nothing This was the idea of his smart, wise mother, Umm Sulaym Who brought him to the Prophet ﷺ when he migrated to Medina And she said, oh Prophet of Allah, this young child is Anas He is a smart young boy, let him serve you And the Prophet ﷺ made dua for him And indeed that was one of the best steps a mother could ever take for her son Who accompanied the Prophet ﷺ, who memorized his hadith Who was with the Prophet ﷺ wherever he went Who got dua, tremendous blessing and favors from Allah When the Prophet ﷺ says, oh Allah, prolong his life And give him many children and bless his wealth Anas said, after the Prophet ﷺ made these duas for me Due to the request of my mom, I am the longest of all the companions I don't know companions left, he lived over a hundred And my offspring exceeded, my children and grandchildren and great grandchildren Exceeded a hundred and I've buried many of them And as for my wealth, all farms in Medina produce once a year Mine only produce twice a year So what a beautiful reward for serving the best man ever to walk the earth Nowadays, liberals and enemies of Islam said, look, this is child abuse How dare she give her own child to the Prophet to serve him ﷺ A foreigner, a stranger, blah blah blah Look at the fruits he managed to gain from serving the Prophet ﷺ The Prophet was kind ﷺ to his own grandchildren He loved them more than his own children Al-Hussein ibn Ali, his grandson He was a young toddler playing in the roads of Medina with other boys When the Prophet ﷺ saw him When Al-Hussein saw the Prophet ﷺ, he ran to him in a playful manner And the Prophet extended his hands So Al-Hussein would go right and the Prophet would do this And the Prophet would go left and do this until he embraced him And he took him and kissed him And he said, Al-Hussein is from me and I am from him May Allah love whoever loves Al-Hussein And by Allah, we love Al-Hussein Because the Prophet loved him Because he is a great companion Because he is the son of Ali, one of the ten heaven bound And the son of Fatima, the daughter of the Prophet ﷺ And he is one of the masters of the youth of Jannah The Prophet ﷺ was so kind that even in fard prayers Imagine, when the Prophet is leading the congregation And he is prostrating Al-Hassan or Al-Hussein, one of the two grandsons of his Would mount him as a ride The companions said, the Prophet once prayed dhuhr And he prostrated and he prolonged the prostration We thought that he might have died And all of us raised his head and found that his grandson is mounting him So he went back to prostration And when the Prophet concluded the prayer, they said, O Prophet of Allah, you've done something You've never done before, you prolonged the sujood We thought that either you had died or Allah is revealing Quran to you He said, neither of this happened but my son, referring to his grandson Mounted me as a ride and I hated to haste him So I just left him until he got bored and left Compare this kindness with the grandchildren With what many of us do nowadays Leaving their children to daycare Just because the mother wants to work for extra cash She doesn't need it but she's bored, she wants to work Leaving the children to foreigner maids Foreign maids who come from overseas with their customs and habits And with even their different religions at times And we don't know what they do with them And we snatch the children from their moms laps And throw them to these maids or to the daycare centers How such children would grow up This act of kindness during prayer illustrates the iman I saw a clip the other day of an Algerian Imam leading taraweeh And there was a camera in front of him And while he was reciting a cat climbed all over him to sit on his shoulder Licking his face and his recitation was not interrupted He just patted the cat while continuing to recite the Quran Instead of tossing it against the wall or stepping on it Or doing something or being frightened Kindness even with the animals This is what we lack in our religion The Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam was playful and joyful with children Mahmoud ibn Rabee' one of the companions One of the youngest companions ever to be classified as a companion He said I still memorize, I still remember An incident where the Prophet was making wudu And I came as a 5 year old and I stood next to him And the Prophet threw some water from his mouth while making wudu in my face Like we do with children when they are standing next to us And we throw water in their faces and they laugh and enjoy this So Mahmoud who's a stranger but recalls how the Prophet was kind to him The Prophet was kind even to his companions Even when they were angry Once he went to his daughter's house Fatima And he asked where is Ali And she confessed we had a fight or a heated argument Yes we're companions, we're heaven bound but we're humans We tend to have different opinions over things So we argued and he did not like what he heard So he left the house and did not come for the afternoon nap So the Prophet sent someone to look for him And they found him lying in the masjid on the soil So the Prophet went to him and made him get up Dusting the dust from his shoulders saying Qum Aba Turab, rise up the father of dust Ali says, by Allah this nickname is better for me and more beloved to me than Aba Hassan He's eldest is Hassan and usually we nickname a person by the eldest of his sons So he says, Aba Turab, the father of soil or dust By Allah he is better and more beloved to me than Aba Hassan Because it was said by the Prophet And it shows us that the father in law tries to reconcile He's wise, he's trying to patch things up Instead of saying to his daughter, he was having a fight with you? Leave the house and come to my house I'll teach him a lesson Like so many arrogant ignorant imbeciles do with their daughters Instead of telling their daughters, be patient, be tolerant Even if your husband curses me or swears at me Or says bad things about me, ignore it as if nothing had happened Your husband comes first\n281"
