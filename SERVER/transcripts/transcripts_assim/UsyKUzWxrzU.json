  "transcript": "uh my question is that um there are skin care products that um is written on them that they brighten the skin but uh uh I don't know if Like It Is by like by removing the impurities from the skin uh or like by changing the color of the skin which is not permissible so uh is it permissible uh to buy those products if you don't know how would I know yeah you need to tell me does it change the color of the skin yes or no uh I I don't know they are it is just written on like on them that they like enhance the skin color but I'm confused about that if you don't know I cannot answer you if a product softens the skin gives it a bright look it's healthy it's medically safe no problem but the problem is that if you apply it on someone who is dark skinn he BEC becomes white as in the case of Michael Jackson for example now this is a problem because now you're changing the creation of Allah Asel whether surgically or through applying chemicals that would alter the change of Allah per permanently or for a very very long time this becomes Haram applying makeup foundation powdering um whatever they apply this is temporary for half an hour 1 hour 5 hours and it's gone this is permissible and there's no change of creation of Allah's uh creation uh through that but applying chemicals that would give your you a different uh uh skin tone for 6 months or the likes this is what is not permissible"
