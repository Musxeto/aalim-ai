Britney from outside www don't bring me your duck call that you care although belonging mean a shape on your mangy bismillah i'm off mon amour here e Salaam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh a just ruler that was one of the seven whom Allah would shade in his shade on the day of judgment may Allah make me and you among them the second one is a youngster a young man a boy however this boy is not like any other one he's a person he's a young man who was brought up who grows in worshipping allah azzawajal and one would say ok so what we are all like this no you will not definitely we are not youth is something that is highly looked upon in Islam it's a stage that each and every one of us must go through and it is between two weaknesses the weakness of childhood and the weakness of becoming old so this gap is quite important in a Muslims life because in it he gives and he produces most of what would benefit him on the day of judgment or what would harm him may Allah czaja protect us all on the day of judgment and not everyone can claim that Allah has blessed him to have such a successful youth the Prophet told us Ali salatu salam into authentic hadith that the foot or the feet of the son of Adam would not be moved on the day of judgment until he's asked about four in a narration about five one of them in both hadith his youth and how he utilized it so you will be questioned about every single day every single week every single year of your youth every single moment what have you done and why you did that and if you look at the Muslim Ummah you'll find that it was established on the shoulders of the youth who Sam is 8 16 17 years of age and as we know Malik when the Prophet died that is awesome he was in his late teens as Abdullah have news of a his father before him as ube Urmila wom who was 13 or 14 years of age when he became a Muslim and he was the first one to hold his sword in defense of the Prophet racism while he was 13 or 14 years of age Abu Hurairah it been a bass great scholars of Islam Islam was established on their shoulders and in this era that we live in where temptation is surrounding us where the devil soldiers are calling us to come and to answer them when everything is easy it's difficult to find a young man far away from all of these things it's difficult to find a young man who did not fall in sin who was brought up to worship Allah and he does it willingly not by his parents forcing him his double is doing it for the sake of allah azzawajal it's difficult to find a young man sitting alone and not browsing pornography sites or watching a movie or listening to music or doing something Haram in this time in era we live in a lot of the youth they deviate they divert from the straight path sex drugs intoxications partying doing things that Eliza does not approve of and even if there were youngsters and I pray to Allah that there would be a lot of them who are far away from this filth and from these major sins those who are not indulgent major since the majority of them are wasting their lives they don't have a target in life because they were not brought up on Islam they waste a lot of time they kill time as if time committed a crime to be killed for they do not prey on time they do not pray in the message it they spend their days and nights laughing about things engaging themselves in silly things and the most important thing for them to do is to kill time and the most thing that would bring pleasure to them is their football team winning a match winning a trophy winning a tournament or when they spend their time watching an action movie why because they do not have an objective in life that boy that young man who was brought up worshipping allah azzawajal is a different species altogether his objective is to please allah his target is to up bring a nation that abides by the Quran and the Sunnah so he's focused on getting his community his society to become the elite he works hard at school he works hard and the University he tries to give and to acquire knowledge and at the same time his moral conduct his ethics his behavior is top notched he's always kind to the elder he is merciful to the young he's obedient to his parents he's connecting to the next of kin he is generous and kind to his neighbor's his friends loved him and adored him why because he was brought up worshipping allah azzawajal and he knows that this is what Elijah wants from him his inspiration his worries are for the Ummah are for the Muslims and not for his own desires and own lust this is a man who was brought up worshipping Allah as erosion may Allah make me in you among those whom Allah shades in his shade assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh although the lung amina shape on your g bismillah more money more here e mean"
