  "transcript": "Mubarak says my parents told me to finish a certain course in a certain Institute am i obliged to follow them in that matter if my parents tell me I want you to study engineering what I want you to come to our city and work there am I obliged to follow that order or am I only obliged to follow orders which give them benefits like give me a glass of water or go to the grocery and buy things first of all it is mandatory for us to obey our parents when they ordered when they order us to do things that are beneficial for them and it does not harm us so my father says go fetch me food from the kitchen immediately I have to do that because it's beneficial for him he says come down and carry the groceries from the car with me immediately I have to go and obey Him if I have a football match and he says I need you to stay because I've have guests coming and I need you to serve them coffee and to bring the food and etc I must cancel my football match no doubt about it so these things as long as it is beneficial for the parents and there's no harm on me I'm obliged to obey them when it comes to your major in university or studying a particular course in an institution this has no benefit for them they may recommend by all means but they do not have the right to force me to study something I don't want to study like the old saying you can lead a horse to water but you can't force the water that the horse to drink so they can say I'd like you to become an engineer or a doctor but they don't have the right to force me to do this and if you don't I'm angry and Allah would not make you successful and Allah scars would be upon you this is nonsense it's nothing it's it has no impact none whatsoever therefore yes you may diplomatically reject that and do whatever you want to do this is your life this is your future and no one has the right to dictate that to you even your parents but again having said that do not go head to head or take a head-on collision with them always remember that you have to be dutiful you have to be respectful and you have to be diplomatic so find a way to reach their hearts but at the end of the day you do not need to continue except what you desire and want to pursue as your career or as your academia"
