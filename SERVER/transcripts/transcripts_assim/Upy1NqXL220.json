  "transcript": "a brother says dear sir we know that it is haram to have intercourse during menses but if someone has done it with his wife then what he has to do for this sin what does he have to do for this sin is the expiration for both husband and wife or just the husband and is there any forgiveness from Allah or not first of all it is a major sin to have intimacy to have intercourse with the wife when she is having her menses we're not going to talk about medical harms and diseases etc this is beside the point it's Haram end of story for us as Muslims what's the penalty the penalty was mentioned in the hadith of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam that he should give expiation of one dinar or half a dinar which one is which well one dinar is equivalent to four point two five four point two five grams of gold which means that it's approximately of the any almost 700 reals almost $200 a little bit less and this is one dinar why is that because you've committed a sin so should it be one dinner or half a dinner scholars say that if the menses is in its peak then it's a full dinner if it's about to dry out at the very end this is half a teener and who should pay them the hadith doesn't say but most likely it's only the man who does this because only usually the man is the one who calls for this are they both sinful definitely unless the woman was trying to resist and was unable to do so but without any engagement her site inshallah she is not sinful is there any forgiveness from Allah definitely whoever commits a sin and six Allah's forgiveness no matter how big the sin is Allah is most forgiving"
