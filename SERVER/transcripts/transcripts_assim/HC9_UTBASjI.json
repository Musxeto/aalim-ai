  "transcript": "foreign [Music] and welcome to this um 17th class of the islamic faith for soul fil and today we have with us um chapter number nine this chapter in general deals with a very common mistake that people are falling into these days [Music] i wouldn't say that they are not paying attention or out of ignorance rather out of a combination of things among them is arrogance and wanting the religion to be according to their own whims and desires so this chapter deals with the basics what is islam is it a set of commands do's and don'ts is it a set of rituals that we have to perform without knowing what they mean or what they lead to is islam a set of phrases and paragraphs that we parrot and just repeat without any conviction this is what this chapter is going to give us an insight over inshallah and it should be a good eye-opener for all of us first of all the authority to legislate belongs to allah alone this is a big confusion he makes what he wills permissible or forbidden according to his knowledge and infinite wisdom his legislation is to ensure that both religion and life are on the proper course his commands apply to all those who are subject to them and cannot be removed at any time or place without his permission this is a very bold statement the vast majority of muslims would say yeah yeah okay move on no no no wait you have to pause a little bit and ponder upon it and reflect whether you're actually a true muslim or not the authority to legislate only belongs to allah azzawajal to say what is permissible what is prohibited because he did this with knowledge with wisdom and his legislation is not for a personal gain like when i legislate so man made laws when i put a ruling what do i want from this ruling to serve a set of objectives one of them is mine so i wan i would like to legislate something that would serve me no human being would legislate something that goes against him why because this is human nature while when it is through allah azzawajal is the creator the owner the sustainer of this universe so he has no conflict of interest because he owns everything and he would only legislate what ensures that both religion and life are on the proper course and his legislation is not limited to a specific era or a specific location there are no people who are exempted from his legislation so one cannot say that yeah yeah this is for you guys but for us we're different so rulers are not exempted they're exactly like us people of dissent people of honorable lineage like the lineage of the prophet they're not exempted they're just like us and no one can change this without allah's permission if you look around unfortunately you will find that a lot of people don't abide by this a lot of the people tend to segregate between religious and worldly legislations as we will come to discover inshallah the sheikh says we do not differentiate between allah's legislation for religion and allah's legislation for life they are both religious and for life so allah's legislation is governing every aspect in our lives the religious ones the legislation pertaining to religion include what we know of religion such as prayer fasting pilgrimage glorifying allah attending the messages etc all things that people attribute to religion those that are concerned with human life meaning worldly affairs which peoples think that this is not part of islam include commercial transactions marriage divorce inheritance etc whoever distinguishes between the two assigning judgment over religious matters to allah and giving to someone other than allah the authority to rule over worldly life matters this person is a disbeliever why because allah made this world and governed it so when you come and say listen islam is all about prayer we are opening your masjid islam is all about zakat we're facilitating 2.5 from your income islam is all about pilgrimage about fasting you can do whatever you want we totally support you but when it comes to riba interest-based transactions when it comes to corruption which includes bribery when it includes embezzlement it includes cheating lying deceiving people engaging in haram transactions this is a worldly matter you have your messages you have your ramadan do whatever you want but when it comes to worldly matters this belongs to us when it comes to inheritance it is not logical to give a brother double the amount that his sister is getting no no this this doesn't make any sense subhanallah now what you're saying is a very dangerous thing because these laws were mandated by allah so are you telling me that you accept allah to mandate laws governing forms of worship but not governing our lives and transaction and worldly affairs if you say yes then you're giving this right to another human being whether it's a british laws the french laws or whatever and this would make you a disbeliever judgment the sheikh says belongs to allah alone and whoever assigns this authority to anyone else is in the same position as one who says that prostration may be offered by right to someone other than allah and this analogy is very crystal clear if you say that as a court we can legislate rulings that go against the quran and the sunnah meaning that a woman has the right to divorce a man or to marry more than one man or to take half of his property if he divorces her and you say that a court has the right to legislate such things and you abide by it going against quran the sunnah this is kufar allah says all judgment rests with allah alone it's like saying yeah you can pray fajr blah blah but you also may dedicate twitter to the constitution of the state this is shirk because you are giving what is only for allah azzawajal to someone other than allah the almighty this is oh this was the way the children of israel became disbelievers it's exactly the same way allah says in the quran they make of their rabbis and their monks and of the christ peace be upon him son of mary they make of them lords beside allah yet they have been ordered to worship none but the one allah other than whom there is no deity exalted be he above those to whom they descri ascribe divinity in this verse allah clearly describes their actions as giving divinity to being other than allah now some people may argue with this ayah and this is exactly what happened when the prophet salallahu salaam invited adi who was a christian and the tribe's leader of his tribe and he thought of coming becoming a muslim so he came to the prophet in medina the prophet honored him and invited him to his home while he was sitting and the prophet is giving him da'wah the prophet read this ayah to him that the jews and the christians took their rabbis and and priests alongside jesus christ son of mary peace be upon him they took them as gods and they worshipped them though they have been worsh ordered not to worship other than allah azzawajal so adi said oh prophet of allah there seemed to be some confusion we did not worship them our rabbis and monks they are like us they are human we don't worship them so the prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam clarified to us what was meant by this verse of the quran in surat verse number 31 allah says the almighty that we took them as lords beside allah so the prophet hassan explained to him with a question he said didn't they that is the rabbis and the monks make what is halal haram and what is haram halal didn't they change by prohibiting what is permissible and making permissible what is prohibited hadi said yes if you ask me about what they had done i would say yes this is exactly what they used to do change the scripture change what was known to be prohibited into permissible and the opposite then the prophet said isalam that is worshipping them this hadith is really scary that is worshipping them so if you live in a country and this country legislates laws and these laws goes against the quran and the sunnah totally if you are compelled and ordered to obey them and you have no other alternative like in the case of car insurance for example it's mandatory we know insurance is haram but it's mandatory what should i do go to jail in this case it is permissible like eating pork when falling hungry in the desert and about to die there's no other alternative to save yourself except to eat a portion of this pork or dead donkey it becomes hala but when the muslims neglect sharia law quran and sunnah and abandon them and insist on taking the legislation of man-made law and embracing it and believing in it while abandoning with choice and will the law of islam this is blasphemy this is taking people out of the fold of islam allah revealed his book and gave his legislation knowing what conditions will be like at all times and what had happened in the past and this is an important point when you actually hear muslims or those pretending to be muslims that times have changed what was suitable 15 centuries ago at the time of the prophet salam when they had no social media they had no televisions and movies and mobile phones and electric cars and the internet things were different back then now islam has to adapt it has to progress evolve by saying this a person is slowly walking into a death trap if not already in it because you are claiming that allah does not know how things will change and this is blasphemous allah knows the past knows the present knows the future so when he revealed his sharia his book his sunna to the prophet he knew exactly how the conditions would be like at all times he also knew the exact situation at the time he bestowed his legislation from on high his knowledge is not diminished because of an event that might have taken place in the past or may take place in the future nor his knowledge increased because of an event that is happening at present to him knowledge of the past present and the future is all the same all glory be to him and this is part of understanding and comprehending the beautiful name of allah allah's knowledge is not like any other creatures knowledge my knowledge when i figure out something new when i know of something that's going to happen this gives me an edge over my peers it increases in my knowledge and likewise when i forget something of the past when i forget something that took place and i cannot have any recollection of it it reduces my knowledge allah is not like that allah's knowledge is endless infinite it has no beginning no end allah knows everything and it does not increase or decrees by events that took place in the past or that will take place in the present or in the future therefore think again before you say that maybe this was not suitable for our times allah azza did not make it suitable for our times because this is a serious offense whoever believes that allah's legislation was only suitable for the time when it was revealed and in future people may legislate for themselves what they feel suitable even though it may be in conflict with allah's legislation and judgment whoever believes this he is a disbeliever he is a kafir wow why because you are accusing allah's knowledge of not being capable of knowing what would happen in the future whoever says this starts from the premise that human that human knowledge of the present and what has not yet taken place is different and as a result man's judgment will differ according to the difference in his knowledge he imagines that this also applies to allah this is a problem when man and this is related to chapter 8 which we took last week same day last monday it's a very important chapter if you saw it so see it again it gives you an insight how people think but i'm talking about the enemies of islam or the liberals all or those hypocrites who tend to think that they can [Music] be equal to sharia or excel it those who think that they can come up with what saves humanity in isolation to sharia and we said if you remember last week a very beautiful statement shariah is the light and our reason and intellect is our eyes if you're in a room that is pitch dark and you open your eyes you're not gonna see anything so no matter what you do you're not gonna see anything without light your eyesight even if it's seven or eight over six you cannot see a thing without the presence of light and likewise in this world no matter how smart you are you cannot see and determine what pleases allah what is beneficial for your world without consulting and taking the guidance of sharia why is this happening because human beings imagine that this also applies to allah they think that allah azzawajal may not know and i seek refuge in allah from such blasphemous thinking that may not know what is good and what is bad until it takes place so he imagines that this also applies to allah and thus gives present human knowledge a higher position than that of allah's knowledge at the time of revelation or what will happen in the future this is a blatant disbelief allah knows what is witnessed in the here and now in exactly the same way as he knows what is beyond the present so this is something that without conviction of you're not a muslim if you think that allah's knowledge is limited to yours and mine and he only knows what's happening at the moment and what happened in the past then you're a disbeliever you don't know allah you don't know who you're worshiping your conviction as a muslim mandates that you believe that allah knows the past the present the future and what will not happen in the future how it would have been if it were to happen hypothetically allah knows all of this so if you doubt this then you are definitely a disbeliever as he described describes himself he knows all that is beyond the reach of human perception and all that can be witnessed sublimely exalted in his above everything they associate as partner with him he knows everything whether it's seen or unseen and allah's judgment applies to what is witnessed in the same way at it applies to what it lies beyond our perception so allah says say allah originator of the heavens and the earth you have knowledge of all that is beyond anyone's perception and all that anyone may witness it is you who will judge between your servants concerning all that over which they differ no one has this ultimate knowledge except allah azzawajal his judgment applies to all his servants those who are present and those who are not so why do we repeat the same stuff again and again because this is part an essential part of your conviction of your faith of your belief in the islamic this is the islamic this is the line it's not only the beard that is big and the your dress or garment or trousers are above your ankle it's not the swag that you put in your pocket that defines you it's your haphida as i said before many many people come and they look to be practicing but when you start to talk to them you find that they're not practicing they're willing to go to british courts or u.s courts to get what is not islamically theirs such as half of the property of their husband and they don't care if it's haram or they don't care if it goes against the legislation of the sharia they want money that's it full stop and they know that in islam they have no right in this so are they willing to jeopardize their safety and enter hell from the largest widest gate and they would say yeah if i'm getting two million dollars because we did not sign a prenup what's the problem in that it's haram it's not your money you so what the the court gave it to me this is exactly what the prophet warned us from alain when he said two of you come in dispute to me so that i can rule between them one of you might have better wisdom and more articulate so he presents his case better than his opponent and i would give the right to him over the opponent who is unable to explain to me that he has the right the prophet says allah if i give him a portion of this dunya by allah i'm giving him a portion of hellfire because he knows that he's lying and i was convinced by his light i only judge through what i see so those who refuse this and insist that they would want the worldly courts to rule over sharia and accept that these are full-fledged hypocrites whoever separates judgment on religious matters from that of life matters assigning the first to allah and giving man the authority to judge the latter favors a multiplicity of legislators while in fact allah alone is the legislator do you then believe in some parts of the scriptures and deny others this is a rhetorical question in the quran chapter 2 verse 85. this is exactly what's happening now when you say that religious legislation is to allah everything else is to man made laws this is blasphemous whoever denies any part of allah's book denies it all and this is exactly what we hear from the hypocrites who claim to be muslims liberals secularists atheists those who want to spread corruption in the world they say masjids are open people worship allah in ramadan but whatever it is to caesar is to caesar and whatever is to god is to god this is blasphemous everything is for allah this to allah azza it belongs to allah you cannot differentiate and say this is for caesar and this is for allah all rulings is to allah all legislation is to allah it is allah's comma commandment that judgment between people should be on the basis of what he has revealed to his messenger of the book and wisdom so this is how the prophet ordered us through his messenger to rule and to judge between people allah says to his messenger hence judge between them in accordance with what allah has revealed and do not follow their vain desires but beware of them lest they tempt you away from any part of what allah has revealed to you so the verse relates to judgment and disputes between people we here see a warning to the prophet against submitting to any temptation that leads him to deviate from allah's judgment what are the muslim nowadays ruling by how many countries ruled by sharia one two maybe less why is that because even muslim countries don't know this fact don't have the correct islamic apida and believe me this is not an easy issue to discuss but no one wants to discuss it because it would take them to different venues every muslim has to have this conviction in his heart that no one has the right to legislate other than allah and this is why kafir governments kafir systems oppose this teeth and nails and they fight any mentioning of shariado even if it was in a of a tribe in the jungles of africa not a country why because this is a precedence and once people clench in onto it and hold on to it and pursue what shariah mandates upon them this is destruction for disbelief and for the systems of evil because this is the only antidote to the poisons of kufr this is the only cure and healing to the systems of disbelief the only way of salvation to the muslims to the poor to the oppressed is through sharia law is through the law of allah azza and this is the only reason they're fighting us tooth and nail to prevent us from implementing sharia either by deviating the laws or corrupting women and encouraging free mixing fighting circles of memorizing the quran fighting conferences and seminars and lectures about islam to the rest of their ability banning scholars and students of knowledge from visa which happened to me and with me and with others why we never called for violence we never called for bloodshed the only thing we called for was islam quran and sharia end of story and this is more than enough for them to fight us the sheikh goes on to say on questions where revelations do not give us any details and this is probable see some people think that the quran has the answer for every single question and one of them is a story it says that one of the smart alex came to al-imam shafi and he says that you claim that the quran has an answer to every question and imam shepherd says yes he says okay this is a bag of wheat how many loafs of bread can we make from it so shafferi took the bag and went to a baker and the baker told him you can make a hundred loaves of bread so he went back to the man he said you can make a hundred loaves of bread so he said where did you find this in the quran he said allah says in the quran allah says asks ask those who have knowledge ask those of expertise if you do not know so i went and followed the quran and asked someone who has knowledge so does quran really have an answer to every single detail quran is a general book is a constitution till the day of judgment it cannot give you a detailed answer to whether it's permissible for men to put a golden tooth or not this is not part of what quran tells you because there is the sunnah that explains and talks in details of many of the general things in the quran but what if there is no mentioning of that in the quran or in the sunnah clear mentioning there might be forms of analogy that the scholars can use for example someone says what's the ruling on tobacco on vaping on e-cigarettes on hoka on whatever so we look in the quran the sunnah said it's not mentioned it wasn't at the time of the prophet so they say okay this is one goal for the home and zero for the visitors so no not necessarily if you look in the quran you will find a verse in chapter seven where allah says that the prophet prohibits whatever is khabib and permits whatever is clean and pure so the word khabib means bad either medically or due to its odor due to its [Music] harm so what would you label tobacco to be something that is good or something that is harmful and khabib everybody says it's habit definitely in this case this is prohibited so the analogy is there but what if it's not mentioned on questions where revelations do not give us any details com uh details competent scholars may deduce rulings provided that the judgment they arrive at is not in conflict with any confirmed divine ruling such as intoxicants are haram the only thing that is mentioned in the quran is wine and the prophet islam gave us a wider explanation when he said that whatever intoxicates you is prohibited so this includes wine it includes whiskey vodka scotch rum brandy tequila whatever that intoxicates you so we know that these liquids these or this liquor intoxicates harm but what about the new things that they come up with heroin cocaine opium marijuana hash pot crack amphetamine and the whole nine yards these are different so what do we do it's not mentioned in the quran it's not mentioned in the sunnah the scholars come and say no it is mentioned where well the prophet said whatever intoxicates whatever covers your intellect and your ability to choose and to make a decision this becomes prohibited then it takes the same ruling that we have to flog you 80 lashes if you were caught red-handed or confessed and that if you [Music] do it the your prayers of 40 days would be invalid in the sense that you will not be rewarded for them you are obliged to pray but you won't be rewarded for that among other things so it is the duty of scholars competent scholars finally people's judgment uh where are we okay people's judgment that is in conflict with allah's ruling may not be given precedence and definitely this is a fact if allah judges the case can anyone come and say yeah but judge so-and-so or supreme court judge so and so said against that of course not presidents is going precedence is given to ruling had this been the case if people's ruling would be given a priority had this been the case prophets would have deviated from the truth why prophets were sent to people who had already agreed among themselves what was contrary to the divine law at least most of them and in delivering their messages prophets advocated what was contrary to the views of their communities so this is a well-established fact if you say that we must adhere to what the people say as in the case of democracy and this is why muslims and islam oppose democracy not because we do not like or not because we support tyrants not that we support oppressive regimes no it is simply because we support islam what does islam tell us islam tells us that the ruling is for allah so when you come and say though though that no democracy is the rule and we have to go to the people and ask the people what they want and implement what they want and this is what should be done in democratic countries you said this is blasphemous because allah has already told us what to be done so if you claim that democracy should govern you are accusing the prophets of going against the democracy of their people because they came with a new revelation and they fought all of their people until they submitted to the religion of allah and to the command of allah so where the prophets at the time renegades rebels or were they executing the religion of allah and they were doing what pleases allah this is something that we should ponder upon and we should always come back with an allegation that supports what we have heard which is no one has the right to overrule allah's commands and allah knows the past present and the future so to claim that today's commercial laws are not befitting islam and sharia and we have to abandon sharia allah and allow riba to prevail allow haram transactions to be dealt with just simply because we have to this is blasphemous to believe that allah azzawajal did not know or to think that sharia has failed this is blasphemous that is why this chapter is very important to those who have liberal ideas who think that they can think out of the box and by the box we mean islam so they think that they are permitted to think out of islam boundaries and introduce something that goes against islam and as i said this is a very important issue for us to think about and allah azzawajal knows best uh we move on to the questions we have zeba khan she says how do we calculate zakat on 22 gold 22 karat gold first of all zeba what are the conditions that we have to pay zakat over gold condition number one it has to reach the threshold condition number two a full lunar year must pass while it is in our possession so condition two i'm not gonna talk about we were assuming that you got it as a gift from your in-laws exactly one lunar year ago now we come to the threshold what is the threshold the threshold in or for gold is 85 grams of 24 carat gold so if you have 12 um 84.5 grams of 24 carat gold there is no zakat on it clear clear so one of what if i have 18 carat of gold or 20 carats of gold or 22. what is the 18 20 22 16 it means that there are grams in this one carrot that are not made of gold so the 22 carrot gold has 22 for example portions of real gold and two portions of copper to compensate so it's not 24 carat it is 22 16 whatever so if i have a 100 grams of 16 carrot gold do i have to give zakat or not well first of all we have to convert that into 24 um carrot of gold so we go to the calculator i have a hundred grams of sixteen carrot so the hundred i multiply it by sixteen and i divide it by twenty four how much gold do i have in this um gold of mine how many 24 karat it has 66 grams of 24 karat of gold there is no zakat wow i didn't know that check so if i have a hundred grams of 22 carrots of gold do i pay the cat for that multiply 100 by 22 divided by 24 and it gives you 91 grams of 24 carat gold you have to pay the cut for that because it's over 85. how to calculate the cat if you don't want to undergo this process i have half a kilo share so it's definitely above 85 carat of uh [Music] 85 grams of 24 karat gold definitely half a kilo you're talking about a lot of uh grams here so i don't want to do the calculation i know that it is above the threshold how do i calculate zakat multiply by 2.5 divide by 100 and if you want to make it one single shot just easily whatever amount you have divide that by 40. usually what people say do is they calculate the gold and they ask how much is the value of the gold and they're giving a certain amount of euros dollars whatever and then they simply divided by 40. the result would be the zakat amount so if i have 80 000 dollars of uh gold divided by 40 my result is 2 000 this is my zakat 2 000 is to be given for zakat oh that's simple so if i have forty thousand one thousand is your zakat if i have a hundred thousand two thousand five hundred is your zakat and so on says can one put english translation of quranic verse as their dp or profile no problem in that if you put uh say he is allah the one no problem there is nothing wrong in that insha allah farzana says is it she sent three questions is it allowed for a muslim woman to wear a bindi which is a dot placed in the middle of the forehead as a way to beautify herself please note that the hindus use a red bindi for religious reasons but in my country most women wear them for beautification this is totally prohibited this is part of the hindu religious traditions no muslim with dignity and honor would imitate them in what they're doing even if it is for the sake of beautification why put it here put it on your nose maybe you become more beautiful put two spots here like dolls maybe you will become more beautiful it is prohibited for a muslim to follow what the hindus do in such a fashion we have our religion we have our honor we have our dignity we go and what else maybe tomorrow you want to wear a saree exposing your uh chest and and stomach what else would you maybe like to dance in front of men this is all prohibited sharia has precedence the law of allah overrules everything else so you don't use your logic or reason or intellect when allah azza orders you to follow his commands when the prophet sallallahu sallam tells you that whoever imitates a people is one of them so by imitating them you risk the danger of being with them on the day of judgment would you want to be with the henders a man came to the prophet and the hadith is muslim he said oh prophet of allah i made a vow that i would slaughter a camel in a village by the name of buana which was near medina so the prophet asked him two questions i saw is there an idol worshiped for the idol worshipers the man said no which means that if he said yes the prophet would say no it's prohibited because people would see you slaughter a camel and they would think that this is further idle not for allah though your intention is 100 pure but just to avoid people thinking that it becomes prohibitive the bindi is prohibited for the same reason the second question the prophet said allah is there any festival for the disbelievers there because if they see you slaughter a camel they would think that you're doing it for their festival and you're celebrating with them the man said no so the prophet said to him fulfill your vow go ahead and slaughter your camel over there as you have vowed and pledged there's no problem in that and allano's best uh her second question can we read the dua for protection from jinn for our children for ourselves so i think she is referring to the dua of ibrahim peace be upon him which the prophet used to say over al-hasan and hussein his grandchildren can we recite this of on ourselves the answer is yes but better is to read the afkar of the morning in the evening where part of it is three times would definitely be better for you than that and finally is it okay to read the quran in hindu pakistani script it is significantly different in writing style from the uthmani script to my knowledge which is very little the into pakistani script is just the writing the handwriting yet the script itself is identical to the uthmani script so the way that the quran was written initially is the same it's the same script there is an addition of wow and many other differences but the indo-pakistani writing the drawing of the letters themselves are different yet the script as it is it is identical and it is the same and there is no problem there is no issue in sha allah in using that and reading it as millions of people depend and rely on it and it is authentic this is all the time we have until we meet next thursday maybe not because i'm going to uh makkah tomorrow inshallah for umrah and to stay a couple of days there so probably thursday i will have to skip because i will come back home late uh so i would be uh appreciative if you guys allow me to skip thursday and we will meet next monday be"
