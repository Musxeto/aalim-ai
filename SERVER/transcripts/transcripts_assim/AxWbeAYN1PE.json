  "transcript": "but um I got my Menses and did not fast any ramadans up until 2021 and that's when I started practicing the religion um do I have to make up these fasts keep in mind I have diabetes and my doctor told me not to fast because my routine would have to be changed I fasted anyways and sometimes my blood sugar would be high and I would give a bit of insulin sometimes it would be low and I would break the fast and sometimes I'm okay and I keep the fast do I have to make up these fast and since ramadan's like roughly two months away if I don't make up these fast on time do I have to make a compensation and my fine my family's financially low in income first of all fasting Ramadan is one of the pillars of Islam and it is without any doubt mandatory upon every capable adult Muslim individual those who Miss fasting a day of Ramadan either did this intentionally before the day was due meaning that at night time tomorrow is a day of Ramadan they intended from night time that they're not fasting so when the a Break of Dawn takes place they're obliged to fast they're not fasting this means that they've skipped fasting this particular day of Ramadan or particular days intentionally Scholars say that such intentional skipping cannot be compensated so there is no Financial expiation you cannot make that day up because the time has elapsed and gone you cannot make it up the second scenario is a person who fasts Ramadan on a particular day or days after the break of dawn while he's fasting he changes his mind and breaks his fast and eats or drinks that day is a debt he broke a day that he started fasting so he has to make that day up from your question it seems that you either were determined not too fast or negligent of the ruling if you were determined not to fast intentionally you didn't want to fast in this case there are no days for you to make up but if you were negligent of the ruling did not know you were ignorant that you have to fast or to make up the missed fast then it is a must upon you to make these days up is there any Financial expiation while making it up that most authentic opinion is that there is no Financial expiation if you are chronically ill and the doctors say that you cannot fast the moment you fast your sugar level drops and you are threatened of being harmed or maybe of dying in this case you are Exempted from fasting you have to feed a poor person for every day you miss if you're totally poor and broke you don't have money then oh this is even forgiven and it's gone you don't have to feed until when Allah makes you rich and you have enough money then you may compensate that by feeding poor people for every day you have missed but if you are not type 1 diabetes diabetic if you type 2 . so fasting would not boast your sugar levels rather it may preserve it and it's good for you and if it's up you can take an insulin shot and this doesn't impact your fasting at all in this case you have to give it a shot and try every now and then to make as much as possible in Allah Knows Best"
