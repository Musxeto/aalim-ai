  "transcript": "from germany he says about a tale that people circulate about a girl who used to read the quran in her room who passed away and her parents hear things crying in her room and they brought a maulana and the mawlana said that oh no problem that this was a angels crying for her death and not being able to read the quran so he's asking is this true that the angels cry this is a fabrication this is most likely either their imagination or the jinn and this mawlana they should have brought a ghostbuster instead what is he talking about does he have a machine and he just sits there and scans the room so oops yep that's an angel that's an angel and they're crying what is this how can you even attribute such a description that the angels cry without having any evidence from the quran from the sunnah these so-called mawlana they make a lot of bucks they make a lot of money because they feed the on on people's ignorance like this this is most likely either the jinn or their imagination and they should not pay any attention to it read surat al-baqarah in that room or in that house inshallah it will go away you"
