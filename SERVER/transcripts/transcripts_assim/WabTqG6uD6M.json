  "title": "Can we prevent Li'an by using DNA tests to prove that the child is his or is NOT his",
  "transcript": "my question is somehow related to the earlier question today as we know there are many medical tests we know where we can prove the parent of the child so can we prevent early and and go through the medical test should identify better brother is asking about referring to dna for example and we can prove so claim that the child belongs to this person or to that person through dna so can we make this as a way of proving that the child is not his or the child is his even if he makes answer is no because dna is in the hands of a number of people and in some cases maybe rarely but happens that they make a mistake they say that the print itself it's a fingerprint the dna can never make mistakes but it so happens it may be misinterpreted or misread and there would come a time that a mistake may happen in islam it does not rely on dna maybe we can use it as a supporting evidence but not the evidence so if a man comes and said this is not my son and she says he is your son and we go to the judge and the judge gives me or gives him and orders him to swear four times and testify that it is not his the fifth allah's curse upon him and he does that and she brings the medical proof that the dna wise it's his son does the judge tell him it is your son you have to take him no this is only as a supporting evidence but it has no effect in rejecting or refuting such"
