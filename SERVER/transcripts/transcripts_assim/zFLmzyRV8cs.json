  "transcript": "I'm at says what should I do if someone confronts me about a sin I've done should I lie about it and say I didn't do it what if they think what if they ask me to swear by Allah that I didn't do it in this case not swearing would obviously be like telling that person I've committed the sin so what should I do in these cases first of all it is totally prohibited in Islam to lie and it's also totally prohibited to expose your previous and past sins so what to do if someone is an imbecile coming and asking me a direct question share have you ever tried whiskey now I could simply say no and I did never hand Allah sorry should know so did you do this I said no and he keeps on asking this never ends and this is not appropriate it's like going to a girl who's a virgin who's young and you say have you ever committed zina have you ever tried the secret habit I would even know what kind of an imbecile would ask such immoral questions so the right approach the right thing to do would be to express your anger and show that person asking you before he even escalates it to asking you to swear because if I say no I've never tried to said say Allah what is this is this an interrogation so the moment he asks you such an inappropriate and immoral question you have to express your rage and anger and show him truly that you are insulted what kind of question is this are you crazy asking me about this question so now I just wanted to know you don't you have no right in asking such questions I'm not someone from the street for you to interrogate I'm not working for you this is insulted I come from honorable family I'm a person who's committed to how dare you ask me such a question and if you do this even if he's your spouse or she's your spouse even if it's a relative of your kinship you should stop talking to them for a day two maybe three until the Islamic period is over which allows you to buy cut another Muslim you can buy cut them totally not as it's showing them that you are insulted and humiliated by such a question and this is the best way out insha Allah if they are not satisfied by that the heck with them who cares don't even pay attention to them don't even respond to them don't even talk to them such people are not worth wasting time with"
