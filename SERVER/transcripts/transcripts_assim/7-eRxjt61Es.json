  "transcript": "I wanted to ask a question on behalf of an individual who missed a few fast intentionally meaning they made a mistake I tried searching uh for an answer on many forums like Islam q a and even your past videos but uh all answers are relating to uh breaking the fast intentionally rather than failing to keep the fast due to an invalid reason so in this case the uh they informed that they mystery in the past as a result of being under the influence of alcohol or drugs Etc so and I informed them that since this is not a valid reason for missing the fast that they may have to pay kofara so is there a recompensation in this case for missing a fast or they just repent and make up their missed fast after Ramadan first of all there is no kafara for missing the fast intentionally or breaking your fast except if a person has intercourse during the day time of Ramadan then this there is this major expiation which is freeing a slave if not possible fasting two consecutive months without breaking a day if not possible then feeding 60 poor people for having intercourse during the daytime of Ramadan but other reasons someone started fasting then broke his fast by drinking or eating then there's no expiation he had committed a major sin and he has to make up for these missed days and in our videos we mentioned the opinion of where he says those who Skip the fasting of Ramadan are one of two either someone who started fasting and in the middle of the day changed his mind and broke his fast this person started a form of worship and broke it so he is obliged to make it up the other scenario is someone from night time intending I'm not gonna fast tomorrow I don't have a reason but I'm not gonna fast so there is no intention this person can never make up for that mistake because he missed it intentionally and did not want to fast initially and the time that was this form of worship prescribed at was missed so he cannot make it up let him move on repent to ask Allah for forgiveness have deep remorse and do a lot of good deeds hoping that Allah May forgive him now if I understand your question correctly someone who's been fasting for the past seven eight days and his intention was to fast the whole of Ramadan we say that the most authentic opinion is the first intention for the first day is sufficient so when announced that tomorrow is Ramadan and you eat your pre-male uh pre-dawn meals the sir this is your intention do I have to have the same intention every single night the answer is no because it's connected so the first initial intention is sufficient unless you break the fasting by illness or by travel then when you resume too fast a few days later you have to have an intention at night time those who were intoxicated they were drunk they were drugged though they intended to fast the following day but they did not eat their pre-dawn meal because they were wasted if they wake up in the middle of the day continue to fast their fasting is valid and they don't have to make it up and Allah Knows Best"
