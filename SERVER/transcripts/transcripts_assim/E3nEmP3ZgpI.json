  "transcript": "Sonia says I heard we make duaa Institute and before Salaam so do I need to recite Fatiha and the route in the beginning and the end if I don't then my daughter won't be accepted Sonya's question about making dua Institute and before Salam first of all generally speaking I'm sitting in my room I'm not doing anything all of a sudden I want to make dua to allah azza wajal to guide my children to abide by islam and guide my daughters to abide by hijab what to do there are etiquettes now this is a general door the etiquette is to raise my hands and to praise allah azza wa jal allahu malik al hamdu Hamelin kaffir anti even mubarak a fee and to offer salutation what is known as the route in order so i said allah humma salli ala muhammadin wa ala muhammad in Kumasi later Ibrahim Allah illiberal him in the committee machine because the Prophet said Alice a lot Salam dua is blocked between heaven and the earth until you offer salutation upon me so we have to offer salutation upon the Prophet I saw Sarah and after that I would say o Allah guide my children to abide by Islam or Allah guide my daughters to abide by the hijab and go on this is the etiquette of drop now when I am in sujood the Prophet told us that when your salute you are as close as you can be to allah azza wajal so make duaa and he did not tell us praise Allah george'll or offer salutation upon the prophet alayhi salat wa salam so we go directly without doing that and also before salam after the salutation in the last raka the prophet says our salaam choose whatever dua you wish so praising allah azza wajal is not part of the sunnah here and offering the salutation is not needed because i have just done this a couple of seconds ago now fatiha is not included at all she says Sonia do I need to recite the fatiha fatiha is not never recited when making duaa whether generally speaking or when you are Institute not only that it is prohibited to be recited Institute it is prohibited to be recited before the Salam because this is an innovation and in the suit it is prohibited to recite the core and therefore you are not allowed to do this you don't have to praise Allah or a facilitation upon the Prophet iris son what happens if I do during scheduled it's okay it's a door but it is not part of the son that you do so because we were not directed to do so analyze OHL knows best"
