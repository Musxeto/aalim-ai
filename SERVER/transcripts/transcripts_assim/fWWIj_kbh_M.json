  "title": "Ok to let young children (6 -7) fast half a day in Ramadan? #ramadan #islam #islamic assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question is in my country the kids are told by their parents to pass half a day is that permissible in our religion or how old are they just like about six to seven years old sh of course yes this is very very uh acceptable first of all because they're not obliged to fast they're children so their accountability starts when they reach the age of puberty when they become adults however part of training them is to instruct them instruct them little by little to fast half a day and when it's noon we give them food and drink and if we just give them uh food without drinking until it's Sunset that's good little by little year by year and in a couple of years time they'll be able to fast fully without any problem inshallah"
