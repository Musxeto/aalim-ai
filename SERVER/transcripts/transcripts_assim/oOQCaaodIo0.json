  "transcript": "Those who slander me and speak about me drinking alcohol-free beer, which was like 15 years ago before I became diabetic and I stopped, and they say the Sheikh drinks beer, he gets wasted, he does this, he does that, and they make videos out of it. I'm so shocked by the amount of haters that I have. It's all good for business. I'm getting lots of good deeds from them. Alhamdulillah. Keep up the good work. You're not going to get under my skin. I'm not going to be affected by that because I'm not saying to please you or others. I'm saying what I'm saying to please Allah. This is what I believe. So these people who keep on slandering me and saying bad things and awful things about me, they themselves consume, not make, without any problem. And subhanAllah how they weigh with two different scales."
