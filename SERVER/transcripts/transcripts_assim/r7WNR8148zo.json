  "title": "Is Makhraj mandatory for reciting Quran and for prayer to be accepted",
  "transcript": "Consider subscribing. recite this in front of them. See, makhaarij is the place where the air comes out, depending on the place of the tongue in your mouth. So if you don't pronounce it correctly, and you don't let the air out from the right passage, referring to the mouth of course, then you have a problem. So if someone says dha, this is the right pronunciation of the letter dha in the word yanzuroon, look, nazara, but if someone says dha, this is not the right makhaarij, and it's wrong. And if someone pronounces the letter dhaad, ghayri maghdoobi alayhim walad daaleen, that's the right pronunciation. If he uses the wrong makhaarij, he says ghayri maghdoobi, now it's a dha, that's inappropriate and wrong, and he should try to fix it. So you have to sit in front of an Arab. It's highly recommended that he's an expert in tajweed and recitation of the Quran so that he can correct you and direct you in a better way, and Allah knows best."
