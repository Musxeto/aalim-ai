  "transcript": "[Questioner] from the U.S so my question was \nif I said the last line of the tashahud while   standing up due to being in a hurry is the prayer \nvalid if you've done this intentionally meaning   that the shahud is compromised of a number of \nsentences so if you say to the end of his stood up   and while standing up you said if you've done \nthis deliberately their prayer is invalid   because this the shahud should have been done \nwhile sitting down and doing it while standing   up you are deliberately skipping it and skipping \nsomething that is mandatory breaks your Salah   if you've done this out of ignorance or \nforgetfulness or you were absent-minded and   discovered that already after you stood up then \nyou have to compensate this with sujud asahu two   prostrations of forgetfulness before Salam if \nyou did not offer this as well because you did   not know that this was the ruling inshallah \nyour prayer is valid and Allah Knows Best and have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford it \nthat's good for you if you cannot you're entitled   for one free session and this is for everybody \nif they can affirm by Allah that they cannot   afford it because they're poor I'll give them \none free session without a problem a full half   an hour so come to me and let's speak about \nit inshallah within the following two days   or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for All"
