  "transcript": "my question I already did the things you know you said I talked to him rosira and other other things to have to do with Islam so the thing is if he dies now and I'm in this situation where his relatives want to burn him uh and I'm standing there and say he was Muslim he shouldn't be cremated he will get into trouble or he may get beaten up I uh I may get beaten up or I was sent to the psychiatrist three times before because my because my father calls me of happy long story so how much effort do I need to invest to prevent them is it like when I'm forced to say cover I need to give really much strength I don't know I'm I'm nervous sorry so how much effort do I need to invest to prevent them from doing this you can't do anything according to the law everything is in your grandfather's hand if he writes a will saying that I want to be cremated then it will be implemented if he writes a will and tells those who are around him and writes a legal document that I would like to be buried as a Muslim then it will be followed you as a grandchild in the presence of all of his sons and daughters have no say and even if you say that he was a Muslim they will say prove it and you won't be able to prove it and this is why I said to you in the beginning that you have to try to strengthen his Iman uplift it and make him make such a statement and endorse or not endorse Proclaim and say that he's a Muslim so that everybody knows what to do afterwards if he fails to do this this is his fault his problem and not yours and Allah Knows Best"
