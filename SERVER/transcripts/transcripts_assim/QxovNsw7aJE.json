  "title": "Should I quit my job if they donâ€™t let me pray Friday Prayer in the masjid? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Potter what yer says what is the view on quitting permanently a job due to the fact that this is a schedule does not allow the person to attend Friday salat it goes without saying that attending Friday prayer is a must a mandatory action upon all male Muslim adults however this ruling differs if you are a minority or if you're living in a non-muslim country where they do not force people to close down for prayer so if you're working in the UK for example Friday is a working day if you ask your boss for an hour or two of leave a lot of the non-muslims would allow this they have an amount of tolerance with the grace of Allah and they allow you but if for example your boss does not allow that and he tells you no you can't leave while working you have an option to leave and quit this job providing that you won't come after a couple of weeks begging saying sure I don't have a job I quit my job for Friday now I don't have any income so I'm begging you for money because the scholars say that skipping Friday if there is harm upon you whether physically or even financially is permissible and you can pray in for her so we have to look into your case brother palette if you tell us that alhamdulillah and a professional IT expert and I have so many proposals to work and I can leave this job and get another job maybe lesser pay or more pay but I know that I'll survive well off without needing to beg anyone the answer is yes you have to look for a job that allows you to pray but if you say no I am I've just arrived in the country and I'm barely its hands to mouth and I can barely live with the income I I have if I quit I'm going to go into debt and maybe have to compromise other things in this case we see no stay in your job until Allah makes and a way out for you"
