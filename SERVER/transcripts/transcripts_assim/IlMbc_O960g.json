  "transcript": "foreign 86 is about one of the atkar we say in the morning and the evening and the prophet says um in the name of allah with whose name nothing is harmed on earth nor in the heavens and he is the old seeing the all-knowing three times what does this that entail it entails that you are beginning your day and you are concluding your night or evening in the name of allah acknowledging that he is the protector that nothing can harm you or harm anything else in the heavens or in the earth without his permission and he's all hearing and he's all knowing you say that three times with conviction how would your day be how do you think you're going to go about your business with lots of confidence trusting allah azzawajal now some may say that okay i say the dua and i had a car accident and i fell sick and this and that happened how could this be possible scholars say that this is the dua it has conditions and if the conditions were fulfilled the dua will fit sometimes people say it neglectfully not paying attention or concentration to it sometimes people don't say it as in the case of abandonment the narrator of this hadith he said that there was one day i forgot to say it and i got half paralyzed so you never know when the dua would not be effect effective because there is a possibility that you are not paying attention or concentrating and this is where you will go wrong hadith 87 also part of the athkar islamic i'm pleased with allah as a lord and islam as a religion and muhammad as a prophet you say this three times now saying it once is a confirmed sunna any time of the day and night and whoever says this allah would forgive his sins saying it after the adhan every adhan saying it once is also a confirmed sunna saying it in the morning three times is a sunnah and not in the evening as scholars say so it is only to be said in the morning three times and this is part of the afkar that when you see people sitting in the masjid and you don't know what they're doing now you know they sit for 10 minutes 15 minutes making vikkar all of this is to gain allah's protection and to follow the sunnah of the prophet hadith number 88. part of the atkar as well of the morning and evening the prophet used to say is subsisting and supporter of all meaning the sustainer by your mercy i seek assistance i can't assist myself i need you i need your help and allah's mercy is one of his beautiful attributes so i seek his mercy and i seek it through praising him as a wajal by saying what do i want rectify for me all of my affairs and do not leave me to myself even for a blink of an eye meaning that i am nothing i can't do anything without your support without your help not even for a blink of an eye a fraction of a second and this shows you those arrogant people who beat on their chests and say i succeeded in doing this and in achieving this and in conquering these avenues with my intellect with my power not what a proper muslim does and definitely this is wrong the following hadith is hadith 89 this hadith was graded weak by sheikh al-bani may allah have mercy on his soul so we'll just read it without going through it we have reached the morning and at this very time all sovereignty belongs to allah lord of the worlds oh allah i ask you for the good of this day its triumphs and its victories its light and its blessings and its guidance and i take refuge in you from the evil of this day and the evil that follows it this is a beautiful dua there's no problem in asking allah or invoking allah with it however our methodology is that we do not attribute it to the prophet al-islam or think that it is part of the sunnah though some scholars did authenticate it but as you know we usually follow and this is the the general trend the authentication of a great imam as such such as may allah have mercy on his soul and the following hadith hadith 19. a beautiful hadith the prophet alaihis to say islam muhammad that means we wake up this morning upon the fitrah and the fitra is the tawheed the acknowledgement of allah existence of allah's lordship worship and tawheed al-asmad the beautiful names and the attributes so we rise upon the fitra of islam and the word of pure faith and this is and upon the religion of our prophet muhammad and the religion of our forefather ibrahim who was a muslim and of true faith and was not of those who associate others with allah pure declaration of tahit and this is islam we wake up we live and we go to bed until heat we worship only allah we do not associate others with him azzawajal and this purifies our souls from any impurities that may associate others with allah that may cast doubt that there are others that help allah no one helps allah who has no assistance no assistance who has no peers who has no offspring he's the first without the beginning and the last without an end as wajal this is all the time we have until we meet next time i leave here [Music] foreign"
