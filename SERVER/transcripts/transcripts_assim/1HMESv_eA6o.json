  "transcript": "don't be lying in a shape on your warning this manually me tell I mean maybe another magic water and he was not mean yes Magnum about a ceremony from welcome to Lodi baba Licata this is the first time I do this lecture so I'm rehearsing on you inshallah i'll be doing it six more times so practice makes perfect I don't know how much time we'll take the material I have it can fit in five minutes and it can go on get ready neshama on frigid nuts that far away so shallow bear with me the prophets and messengers of allah azzawajal are the cream of allah's creation they are the ambassador's of allah azzawajal they are the elite allah subhana allah created them and he ordered us to love them to follow them and to believe in them as you know there are pillars of islam there huh makers or slap fight and there are pillars of Iman from aprils of a masochist one's missing six pillars of email and you're among them is to beauty in others messengers and as the brother said a lot of us don't know these messengers so if you ask any Muslim ok who is the prophet of our loop they mean if you would say sorry correct then this is its origin now if you ask them about who is the messenger of the people of heart that should be hood the people of and whose tribes fried and alighting they're both of them's in it's a dispute among custodian whether they were the same people or two different tribes and the most authentic that they were two different clothes by tribes and so on and if you say a simple wrong word that discredit any of them this would void your Islam it is one of the things that nullifies is lamb to say any negative or to make a joke of any one of them and allah azzawajal instructed us end up or add to follow their lead and to take them as role models indeed there has been an excellent example for you Indy braheem and those with him so Allah is telling us they are the best of examples to us not only that Allah specifically or than his message of solomon in jerusalem to follow their lead as well when he mentioned all of these prophets and messengers allah said after that they are those who mama had guided so follow their guidance allah is telling the Prophet ocean to follow the guidance of the these prophets and there is a dispute among scholars in regard to the number of prophets and the numbers of the messengers and what's the difference between a prophet and a messenger and the most authentic opinion is that a messenger is an individual who was sent with a new revelation and a new law to his people so Allah aveal to have this long and this message while a profit was not given a new message he was ordered to teach and preach the message of the previous messenger so a prop every messenger is a prophet but not every prophet is a messenger and the number varies and the messengers that is as mentioned in the authentic hadith there were 315 messenger but fits there are more than 100,000 and we don't know except a handful of them but we believe in them as a whole we're going to speak about the legacy of three prophets of a large there was You Adam no and raheem peace be upon them all and each one of them deserves a number of lectures not a single lecture so to just congested and try to squeeze it all in one would not be fair so we will talk about Adams repentance about newest Dawa and about Ibrahim is perseverance may allah peace and blessings be upon them all Adam he is the father of all of humanity and allah azzawajal honored him favorite him blessed him with things that no other human being had the privilege to have among this is that Allah created him with his hand does Allah have a hand yes ova has two hands as mentioned in the Quran when he spoke to his the police and said why didn't you prostrate to what I have 80 with my two hands at least did not say well you created me as well with you two hands so what's the point he didn't because he wasn't and in the authentic hadith abajo del created for things with his hands and one of them is Adam the paradise of Eden the throne and the pen that registered everything that will take place until the day of judgment these are the only four things that I hated with his own hand to honor them other things were raided by Alma's ordered some had so Hannah who was Hana not only that Allah ordered angels to prostrate to Adam and none of them was like us objecting to all instructions say how can prospect you only told us you prostrate to yourself this did not take place because they knew that the essence of the magic is that you should follow you should comply so Alma tells you do this you do that you have no other option Adam was the proper the first profit by default and Allah spoke to him and between him and no there were ten centuries so a thousand years separated them apart you know the story i'm not going to go to that a logical hated him and created Eve Oh hawa from his rib and Allah instructed them not to eat from the forbidden truth from the forbidden tree and they disobeyed Allah and they ate from it and then there I was exposed and this was all due to Satan's whispering and seduction what's the model of the story so that we could try and make time I make use of the time even those who are great for even those who are chosen sin and this is normal the Prophet is awesome said that in a crystal-clear hadith could nobody had a la roja roja pagina total every son of Adam is it sinful however he did not stop here otherwise we would have gone to the pub next door immediately after the football because hey we sinful by default now he said and the best of those sinful are those who repent so human nature a lot of knowledge is that we are sinful but here where we come to the fork of the road when you sin what do you do if you keep on you have a problem and if you repent then you are among the chosen one and one would argue yeah he how is it possible we did not see the profit by the Sun we did not see the companions we did not hear the Quran Ian when it was revealed yet when someone sends we shivered and and we feel like we want to jump and beat the hell out of him how dare you sin what about Adam who spoke to Allah Allah created him with his hand is so paradise is so heavy so the Angels he saw everything the whole nine yards and get this only instruction he didn't tell you to fray he didn't tell you to fast he just told you do not approach that tree and yet he fell and said this is come on it's too much now it's not too much when Allah will something it happens and not only that why didn't add them send he was misguided he did not send because he desired something he sent because as I said in the Quran and he that is Satan swore by Allah to them both verily I'm one of this in seed will wishes to you book and they did not have any experience they did not deal with con man there is not deal with those who try to embezzle or take your money get fresh so someone comes with them said wallahi I'm i wish i wish you well and I'm advising you for the sake of Allah what will you do so they fell into his trickery and they ain't from the forbidden tree now the first stage when you fall is to admit your sin look at all us sinners do we admit that we're sitting maybe in the very beginning when we fall into a sin we feel remorse we're sad we depress me cry and after a couple of months we'll go back again and the same process but a little bit less and the duration is less so it's another month when we follow get another week and we fall again and then another day and then it becomes normal and it becomes a habit no remorse no confession of sin and then it turns 180 degrees when we become promoters of sin so not only doing it I think here's a DVD of the latest movie of shrinking and I keep on calling people to do this to do that and I become instead of one of the soldier he'll say fine I'll become a channel and sometimes shape on comes to me say feel a lot what are you doing do that extend some of us unfortunately or would exceed what Shaitaan does so you have to confess and confession is not like forgive me Father for I have sinned we don't have a box because time doesn't allow me to sit in a box that long and heater confessions Islam is very easy who do you confess to what do you need a mediator do you need any was five you need any help did filiform go stamp no it's between you and Allah solution Moses did it so allah ye will send them when he killed the coptic is it oh allah wrote myself self and I confess of my sin forgive me Eunice Jonah when he was in the belly of the whale he said the e92 Sahara in equal to my body I confess I was among the wrongdoers the Prophet says in his Dora I have wronged myself and confessed of my sin the Prophet SAW himself not only that when abu bakr who doesn't know about the greatest man on earth after the prophets and messengers the first one to enter agenda after the Prophet Rajasthan is Abu Bakr the first one to an agenda from this boomba is Abu Bakr yes he goes to the Prophet o prophet of allah saw sudden teach me adora i say that i will say it in my prayer he told him / book is say o Allah increase my wealth no it improved my health no increase my offspring no he said or what they say Allah let me near on to them not enough see old man kehillah I have known myself a large whenever I over a little bit in the end and there is no one that would forgive sins except you follow fiddly mother feel at an ending or ham in the cattle of over him so forgive me and have mercy from you you are the most forgiving and the most merciful look at the door so first step confess yeah if you don't look around you is it I don't have any sense the brother has all substances and brother has a lot of sales with delivery I'm nothing to confess about then you doomed seriously you doomed if you don't sit with yourself for half an hour a day not doing Zacher Allah no i'm talking about sitting with yourself for half an hour contemplating on what I had done how much rib I did I cake how much money did I steal how many lies did I say how many got by things did I throw left right and center what about the poor lady my home how much transgression my doing how bad am I with my children and not bringing them correctly how we need so much fun did I miss this year people's economy this year he say how many popular a mess this week a brother I was wealthier the UK say mashallah how many prayers of tragedy Yogi's a month said she her clearly twice a month and he's involved it down just a big beard why is that I stay until two o'clock am doing manners and doing this late listen and the president and that the magnitude is gone down the drain it shows you that you have to confess don't confess the people looking for sleep good crystallize overjet so that a Martian Hannah Tyler would forgive your sins and we don't say that a stepfather we're not going to go there look at the sin of a police and the sin of Adam identical correct no they are completely different although they are a sin both of them others Allison Schaben or English or Satan's in was out of elegance prostrate to mom not logical I was created from fired he's created from mud clay from dust so there is no comparison I'm better and the same thing this logic this methodology of logic in things I think do this is no this is not logical why should i do this where I can do that and this shows you the compliance with the Sharia if you are true Muslim you would say 70 upon I'm not going to argue with you Allah says this in the Quran I'm not going to argue the Prophet orders need to do this and let's gonna argue shape on are used so if you are like this you have a problem a woman cannot travel without the mire of why the Prophet second son it is not permissible for a woman who believes in allah and that they have judgment to travel without the Mahad and the sister comes yes but my brother is taking me to the airport in my husband and picking me up in the country it is having profits in this yes chef it's not logical maybe there because they had camels now we have airplanes now we have trustworthy women with us we have men nobody's gonna jump me and I'm nothing's going to happen it is the property who said this yeah but there is a share in Google someone else he says it's okay it says it's not okay and you say is ok what you want me to say to say to you this is the way of the meta methodology of shape on how he thinks so his sin was out of arrogance and Adam's sin what oh it was out of forgetfulness he forgot and that is why Allah zildjian said and indeed we made a covenant with Adam before but he forgot so his'n came out of forgetfulness not out of arrogance and pride and look at the majority of Muslim sinners nowadays they fall under one of these two categories either sending you to arrogance and they insist and they continue to do this and they will do this until the day they die or out of human error weakness everybody falls in this even you share from the first one to fall in this we all beak without our support to us we're nothing so it is only a mod that guides us it is only Allah who choses us and he somehow I doubt I when he chooses us he tells us and what you do and what not to do and he gives us the power to follow all of that so we have among us those who go out of arrogance and pride and never come back and we have those who fall into their weaknesses but they are desperate they are remorseful and they have this humidity of the same so whenever you talk to them they look down and say may Allah forgive us and they admit and repentance is two types there are net a number of time so do not got to go into details the first cut is that allah azzawajal guide you to repentance and the second type is that allah accepts your attendance and so many sinners come to me chef I've sent so much and now I've repented my prayers are message it I am doing everything according to the book and doing charity night prayer how can I know that allah accepted my dependence can you you cannot you have to keep on living in hope and fear until you've done and when you die inshallah you'll find that a lot accepted it but once you and then saturday we have cards that have the fifth gear now we have I believe never have 16 and 17 movie we are okay with back when you put the 15 you go into cruise control so you just drive and move on if you know and you feel that Allah has I give it all of your sins you're going to put it in the fifth gear and relax and you're gonna cool down and you're not going to feel that in Morse and this would call at least shake on once again to go into looting you to extend so if Allah guides you to repent you're in good hands now you have to anticipate for a lot accounting and accepting your repentance Adam these be upon hadley seen these beautiful words that initiated and declared his repentance ravenna bottom Memphis era while in them to Helen hours of having up then I Coonan Amir Hossain they said or our Lord we have wronged ourselves if you do not forgive us and bestow upon us your mercy we shall certainly be of the losers so repentance is a vast topic yet this what we learn from agent peace be upon him and by the way Musa please be upon him met Adam as the Prophet tells us and he said you are either Andalusian can see did you or the one who all are created you with your hand with his hands and made the pain just four straight to him she yes and he said you didn't know any better than to let us of gender and this is modular to be is okay because we're suffering me while we suffer because of his mistake no this is wrong we are suffering so that we would have the rest of our lives in paradise not the rest of our lives this is an understatement to infinity no end but if he continued to live in paradise per person probably they wouldn't have any offspring so we'll be existing at the moment adam said to him you are musa emesis it is you are the one whom allah spoke to without any intermediate and without any interpreter he said yes he said when didn't you know and find any what allah has revealed to you that this was written fifteen thousand years before Allah created the creation hideous is what I think so we told him how dare you object to me of something that allows it has the gate now I want don't want to go to ikeda because if I need someone coming out of the power of the nighttime safety how dare you come up is it did you know that allah wrote this fifty thousand years ago and they justify their wrong doings with what with other if I met someone this is a joke I met someone are coming out of a pop and he said this clue me when I said you see how dare you go to a nightclub or a pop and do these things I said it's better and I smack them in the nose so what did you do this acids father so be careful between two things it is permissible to use the other in justifying calamities but it is not permissible to use butter in justifying sense meaning my house is burnt to the ground yeah what is this this is better hamdillah this is ok but if I fall into sin and someone asks me what did you do this it is a spider this is what this is prohibited insuperable moving on because like I have five minutes to do newest legacy know if peace be upon him he is the second father of humanity because the first father was Adam and when the earth was flooded the entire whole planet was flooded with water then only those of his offspring that came from him so he is known to be as the father of the humanity he is the first of the strong-willed messengers of allah azzawajal the thing that yummy is so visible in his Tarawa other than the trust of the messengers is that he is one of the greatest Diaries to Allah one of the greatest scholars to Allah simply because he continued to do that for 915 so he's longer than a katana zoom he eat it's 950 years Panama and what do you think of it you can have anything to do it and have the internet hidden okay Danny it look into it and look at the aspects when described in the Quran to learn the lessons mama did not send them for nothing and did not tell us about the stories for nothing he told us about the solar so that we learned from the first of all a person who calls to Allah for the sake of allah azzawajal he has to be patient he should not get bored and he should not ever give up 1 950 years and never giving up on this people and not only that he changed his dower in so different ways the methodology the means of doing down not only when you like myself give downward to you guys you came with your own free will unless you contain them I don't know but Sean all of them coming with all their own free will and they left in their houses the TV sets and some of them fled their wives maybe this is one of the reasons they come the brothers saying the shape is coming overseas to give dower instead of the students flying all over the from all over the place to him well it is mixed intentions are you come and fly to give down but it gives me time off from the wives and the children so whenever I'm invited anywhere I'll just go so male about me how these sincere to his safe especially if you have two wives never try this at home now seriously speaking when you give them to someone who wants to learn it happens instantly but when you give that one to people whose Russ their fingers in their ears and they take their cloaks and clothing garments and cover themselves and if you come from the right they turn to the left they don't want to listen to you Johnny how clear can they make it to yourselves and verily every time I called home to them that you might forgive them they I'm not asking for their money don't 10 minutes or less what did me this was the hundred minutes I think I'll finish my lecture professor stuff like if I was you so much work yeah if this is right and no no cigars so Allah says I'm calling them that so you might forgive them but they trust the fingers into their ears covered themselves up with the garments and persist in their refusal and magnify themselves in tribe so what does he do I would've easily went back home to my comfort and the hell with 950 years yeah kiya what I would do this for an hour if I'm a great day I would do it for a whole day if I'm being paid for it it for a week but if you give me the whole goal of the world I cannot go for a month a year 10 100 950 years not only that some of the wives complain I tried everything with my husband and I can't find a way to reconcile no he didn't try to manage try to differ your approach to him come to him through his stomach if this is not sufficient coming through his eyes if this is not sufficient take MMA and make a choke grappling in your position and maybe then he would concede subhanAllah no please be upon him look at him he tried it publicly loudly and then he tried it secretly and he did it privately and he did it in the morning did it end in the evening the then we learn from this at the die is not limited to 95 job it's not a profession it is a lifestyle 24-7 would you hear what he has said I called upon them and now then verily I proclaim to them in public and I have appeal to them in private everything not only that as the majority of Diaries when we talk to people Hellfire is waiting for you just die and you will enter Hell from the whitest gates we intimidate people we warn people because with a so relaxed if I tell them how do you say like in a high drama and you will intention as a prophet said I saw Sara the people said why are we sitting the messaging I say like that 100 times let's go and do what we want to do is go and party it's it's like Saturday night or friday night or whatever but we find that it is best to feed to do to warn people of north of hellfire so that this would make them more afraid of Ibaka sodium the same thing was done by all messengers but they brought the glad tidings and the warnings as well so add I should very his style so he warned them about Hellfire and that you will end up in hell that you disobey Allah yet he gave them the carrot-and-stick so the stick is held and what about the carrot Allah says I said to them ask for forgiveness from your Lord verily he is oft-forgiving what will happen he will send a link to you and of in abundance and give you increase in wealth and children and bestow on you gardens and bestow on you Giffords so he's giving them the carrot this is Allah soldier you do asking for forgiveness and look what he will do to you continuation don't ever give up no he was described by his own Idol worshipers and they said oh no you have disputed with us and much have you prolonged the dispute with us so it's not one time okay this is how long none of your business okay thank you house now he keeps on going changing and trying his level best and his prerogative his objective is to get people out from darkness into the light so you're not asking people for money intention is to help and benefit the people and the final thing enjoys a legacy would be that a daddy his effort is not measured by those who follow him because if you look at Noah please be upon him 950 years you have expected that all of his family would be believers but his wife died as a captured and his son refused to obey Him and to join him on that ship so don't be deceived and see that there is a deviant dine there is a deviant scholar who has millions of followers and there is this Navy or a scholar who follows a piranha exactly to the letter and to the spirit and only a few followers of his so it is not the quantity in slam that trounce it is the quality the prophets of Allah my evaluation and said I have seen the nation's displayed in front of me so I saw the nation with a message with with a prophet and also the Prophet with a group of people that I saw a profit with a man or two men accompanied him and I saw a profit without anyone following him so don't look at how many followers you have on Facebook or on Twitter to see that arm on the right path or not Justin Bieber has minions and Shelby bass that took their account has like a couple of hundred so after I think now know what counts is the quality and that is why the people of better they were a handful 300-plus but they managed to beat an army that was fully armed with everything three times as much it is the heart that comes it is the quality that comes moving on to ibrahim peace be upon him mother Alice Cooper okay Ibrahim is the second messenger and prophet that was described to be of strong with Buddhism there is no Rahim he's Musa Aisha and muhammad sallallahu and five of em yet described in the Quran to be of utilizing Ibrahim is the role model of perseverance of compliance of executing what is ordered to do no questions asked Solamar body while you said and that is why we offer seller sole attention to the prophetess as we offer it to Ibraheem and this shows you that he is hurry robot in the best of companions to allah azzawajal what the Muslims made the mistake of saying ibraheem have you about Hamlet have Ebola and this is wrong honey is a higher level than heavy and the Prophet himself is also hyerollah an authentic hadith if I were to take a close companion ethylene I would have taken Abu Bakr but I had only but I am the head of a large subject so the best of companion to a loss of entire life ibrahim ibrahim was complemented in the quran allah says and remember with rahim was tried by a lot with certain commands which he fulfilled so what stands out about the braheem that he fulfills all the commands 'it's been given to him no questions asked al also said and of ibrahim who fulfilled his commit commitments so this is another ayah which highlights that He fulfilled the commitments such as he was ordered to give their word to his people he gave down to his people they refused he was a young boy a child innocence he was yeah yeah a young man so what did he do he went to the idols and he broke them and when the people came and were astonished they said what we heard a boy mentioning them and they brought him he was ordered to slaughter his own son by the way he was not given any offspring until he was really old among the commandments that the Prophet told us a lesson about Ibrahim he was 18 years old how old is done it's like 70 years more than I my actual age he was 80 years of age when he was commanded to circumcise it didn't go to the mufti k this is I'm afraid of you know getting a infection too old and you know one mistake it whoops sorry stop it he circumcised himself with an axe when he was 18 I think this is between you and Allah georgette but this is a man who does what he's told from Allah soldier so so Oh in need of children and then our grandson is mine and just while it's matter was about 13 or 14 years of age when you're old and you don't have someone to carry the groceries I know this all of my offspring are girls and girls are subject that are confined to their homes to that they don't go and you know do shopping indicated the groceries from the car with you so I look I have to do the dirty work myself so when you're 80 you don't have except this 13 or 14 years old boy and you feel that handle a few more years and he'll take the burden off my shoulders and he'll do everything just at that right moment alonzo jealous ends ibrahim a vision not even an injury efficient in his dream and the dreams of the profits are at a variation and he says when his son was old enough to walk with him he said oh my son i have seen in a dream that I'm slaughtering you llama so he's taking them assure of his son he's going to it he's going to do it but he has to break it down to his son what does the Sun say well my father do as you're commanded you will find me in sha Allah among those who are patient so the command itself it's a mind-blower Danny come on if it came to us what would we say ok your problem but why what's the logic come in two years I don't have children and when you give me a Charlie and I've heard this from a lot of people by the way complaining about a las other when his son died I mean why does he kill my son store for all your years of prayer and fasting is gone down the drain you object to a Mazda key who gave you the Sun in the first place it's his so he wants to take him it is his and this is exactly what happened once he put him on the floor and he was ready on his side and he told his father don't look me in the eyes but make me look the other way so that you wouldn't feel weak palace at 13 year old a 12 year old saying this to his father but wisdom is this yet ibraheem had no hesitation he went on and then allah azzawajal told him that this was a trial for you and you passed and Allah substituted them immensely when he broke these idols they built a great building and they make ditches and they filled it with a firewood and ignited a fire that was so huge with beyond imagination and they threw him in that fire he had no problem he only said one word one sentence what is it the beautiful centers that you all should remember and all remember but you don't know that is in this occasion it is the same sentence that the prophet said alice ozawa in the back of the book after being beaten or slightly had having a setback when they told him that the motion ET de she called the ocular worshipers are coming back you can I elate you completely What did he say that's when Allah when a man machine and it turned into a garden this fire and that is why when you look at how Abraham complied with a misogynist not only that in the very early ages before the story of the slaughtering when his money was few months of age he moves all the way from Egypt or from era and those to Makkah where we live at the moment between the mountains in the complete desserted area not the single life you would find the life-form you find there no water nothing and he goes and obedient wife does not speak doesn't miss a listen what's our itinerary what's the schedule we were gonna have dinner tonight she goes all the way once he reaches the place he turns his back and moved and ghost he doesn't say any word he doesn't say even goodbye because i was told him not to and she says to him why are you doing this and it doesn't reply it doesn't even look behind and he moves on she is only there with her child no water no food nothing this is not logical I believe your messenger of allah believe a prophet of allah but come on and then she with the believing heart says did Allah order you to do this and without looking back he said yes he did and then she then she said then allah azzawajal would not let us into harm's way Allah social will take care of this is his protege she is his student with older a man but he never looked back and that is why he deserved to be called and boom man Allah says in the Quran vernia bah he was an umma obedient to Allah hannifin and he was not one of those who were among the chicken what is the meaning of omagh oh my god comes in for meanings by the way it comes as in here a leader of the people it comes as a nation it also comes as a religion in nevada havana and akuma we found our forefathers or a religion and photoshop also is mentioned in the Quran to mean a period of time which we have exceeded a lot and Allah says for death haha by the omen elusive and he remembered after a period of time so this is Umbra he and this is no and this is how their peace be upon you if you follow the desktop if you follow Adam in his repentance a lot of forgive your sins if you follow nor in his dower Allah would give you all the reward of the people that followed and finally if you follow the perseverance of Ibraheem peace be upon him and you are on the straight path you yourself would be at puma you would be a leader and that is what we call in our prayers Rob Donna Hamlin I mean as well as in able to read Tina or what are you lean wide right now lynnwood capilla de nada and makes us any man to the followers and to the believers and allah azzawajal knows best salsa rumba you"
