  "transcript": "a sister says my husband wants to give money to his sister because she to buy property for her kids and my husband has three daughters two are already grown up he never ever buys any kind of property for them and his salary also is pretty good he doesn't think about our daughters only his mother and sisters mattered to him how should I convince him to think about our daughters please give suggestions first of all if I were in your husband's shoes and you talked to me about the financial help I'm giving to my mom and to my sister and you would like me to buy properties and gold etc for your daughters I'd be offended the first thing that would come to my mind would be that you are a materialistic person I'm doing my mother and sister a favor I'm giving them money and you are angry because of that my question to you is is there anything missing in the house have I ever not given you what you want and desire food clothes maybe even trips etc and you said no but we would like some property a plot a house etc well this is not to you this is my money I work hard for that money and I've saved some of it in the bank which you and your daughters will get a share of I might have bought some property you don't know off I might have invested money in investments that you do not know of but basically I resent the way you look at my efforts to please my mom and sister and to be kind to them you being selfish so my advice to you is not to interfere every husband and a father is concerned about his wife and children's well-being and he always have this at the back of his mind but I'm still young I'm earning I'm still working and my salary as you've mentioned is good so why are you so concerned about the future when everything is fine and I'm did a lot this is not the right way of thinking my suggestion to you would be that you leave things as they are and if you were to suggest to him to buy you a flat a house or a plot that you do not at all mention not from near nor from far his mother or his sister's financial situation"
