  "transcript": "adrian from the uk says i have a problem with dead skin don't we all so sometimes i've i have a wound i have uh we got fly i have something here that is dead in my elbows in my knees uh in my foot so when i perform mudu or russell do i have to peel it off the answer is no this is part of your body this is not a layer of paint that you have brought upon yourself this is not cement this is not something that would impact your wudu this is part of your body this is your skin so washing it externally that does the job insha allah and by the way it's the same question with faison who has eczema and he has a a cut and if you bend the cut the wound is a little bit deep so when he puts the cream on it once he wants to wash the cream off for wado externally is done but to go inside and deep in washing it who said that you need to go deep you have to just wash the surface if there's a cut and it's deep you don't have to watch it wash inside it i'll give you another example women have earrings so if they take their earrings there's a small hole so are they allowed or supposed to open it and get water in it no who said this there's no need at all for such extremism just wash the external part and this does the job for you insha allah"
