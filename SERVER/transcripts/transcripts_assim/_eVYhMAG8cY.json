  "title": "Can a revert stay married to her non muslim husband after accepting Islam? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Hadiya is a revert may allah azzawajal make her steadfast on Islam and give her strength in her religion and knowledge she says that she is or she was married to her husband who remains a Christian and she wants to know how to speak to him first of all this issue is very sensitive especially to a lot of the new reverts to Islam because it makes and constitutes one of the biggest hurdles for them to accept Islam it goes without saying and without sugarcoating it once a Muslim woman reverts to Islam she cannot remain with her non-muslim husband they are not man and wife in the sense that they could have intimacy they can mix with one another they can do whatever they want no once she accepts Islam it is over however if the man were to accept Islam as well then they are man and wife without any problem no marriage contract nothing because the same old marriage contract is still valid but if he doesn't scholars say that she has to remain her edia period her waiting period which is counted by three monthly cycles and after that if he does not accept Islam the marriage is nullified how can she give her husband Dawa she can talk to him on the phone she can tell him that she found the light and she tells him about the beauty of Islam about the common things between Islam and her previous religion and how Islam excels her previous religion so all the beautiful things in her old religion are found in Islam with an extra edge of purity and sincerity and she tries as hard as she can to tell him in a diplomatic but in a firm way that this is her conviction she is not going back to her old religion and she has no way forward except if he accepts and reverses to Islam as well and she tries to call him to Islam as much as possible by showing him the scientific signs and and and and the miracles of the Quran and the nature of Islam that is the widest and fastest spreading religion on earth and maybe Allah would guide him she should make a lot of Dura but at the end of the day she should make it crystal clear to him that this is her conviction and religion and if he is not willing then she has no other choice but to ask for divorce and she can move on with her new life insha'Allah"
