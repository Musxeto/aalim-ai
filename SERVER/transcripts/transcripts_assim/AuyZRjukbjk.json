  "title": "Talking during Athaan & Iqamah & Can the one who calls athaan or iqamah lead the prayer?",
  "transcript": "Abdur-Rahman from the UK. He says \nthat; 'Is it permissible to speak   while the adhaan is being called or the \niqamah is being called?' The answer is 'Yes'.   There's nothing authentic that prohibits it. Is \nit the best thing to do? Of course not. The best   thing is to listen and repeat and then say the \nsupplication that would qualify you to receive the   intercession of the Prophet, sallallahu 'aleyhi \nwa sallam, on the Day of Judgment. But if you   continue to speak, or work, or write, or read \nwhile the adhaan is being called, there is no sin   on you none whatsoever. And, he asked a sub \nquestion - I don't see it sub but, yani - he says,   'Can the one who calls the adhaan and the iqamah \nlead the prayer?' The answer is 'No problem in   that at all'. If I were to substitute for the \nMu'adhdhin, and I give the call for the adhaan,   and I give the iqamah, and I lead \nthe prayer - this is totally legit."
