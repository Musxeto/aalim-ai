  "transcript": "the next question is from um zakaria can i use my zakat to pay my brother-in-law's debt if this debt is not interest-based because a lot of the muslims nowadays don't care whether they borrow from a bank in interest or a halal loan so the vast majority of them they opt for mortgage they buy houses for 100 000 pounds or more and then they go before ramadan begging their relatives for help to pay off the debt no this is not permissible you cannot participate in paying off someone's interest based loan but if the loan was taken due to a necessity but not interest-based so i borrowed money because my wife needed surgery i didn't have social uh medical insurance and i didn't have the means to i borrowed to do this now i'm in debt no problem give him zakah i ran out of money and i had to borrow to pay off the rent give him zika i needed to get my daughter married didn't have any funds no savings give him zakat no problem but to buy a lexus and 2021 escalade platinum uh sports top of the line on installments and then before ramadan said guys i need money what for sure will i have lots of installments to pay be paid it's a it's a debt oh okay can we give you from zakat nope this was taken for luxury i'm going to the south of spain for a month i borrowed twenty thousand or twenty thousand two thousand uh uh kwedi dinars and now i'm back i need to pay them off this is not a necessity so it cannot be given part of the zakat because it was acquired for luxury and for nonsense so yes if your brother-in-law is indebted and is in need because he lost his business and the debtors want their money or something of the nature which is halal and legitimate no problem"
