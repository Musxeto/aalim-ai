  "transcript": "Maysha from Bangladesh. Zareef from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. How are you doing Sheikh? I'm doing great, Alhamdulillah. Alhamdulillah. Sheikh, yesterday after Iftar, my brother and I, we were, you know, just chilling and we were joking around. And amidst all this joking, I spewed, by mistake of course, I spewed that, Oh my God, you're God. And I made it, we immediately stopped joking. And I said, Astaghfirullah. And a couple of minutes later, I even said the Shahada. Did I commit, Sheikh? Jazakallahu Khair Sheikh. It depends, Akhi. If you said to someone intentionally, you're God, meaning that he is a God, that is Kufr. Because we're Muslims, we know that there is no God worthy of being worshipped other than Allah Azza wa Jal. But if it was a figure of speech due to the games you play and you see this frequently coming war of God or something like these things. All of this is corrupting your Aqeedah. But if you did not have any intention to say it and it just came out unintentionally, no, there is no Kufr in that. But you have to ask Allah for forgiveness."
