  "transcript": "sahabas says should we recite Fatiha behind the imam during silent prayers and silent records it's an issue of dispute the most authentic opinion is the opinion of the majority of scholars that is in silent truckies it is a pillar upon everyone praying whether an imam or an individual or a follower you can't be other than these three you must recite the fact and if you don't this raka would be rendered invalid unless you come late and the Imam is in Recor and you just have time to make record then your prayer is okay"
