  "transcript": "now stages of revelation was the Quran revealed all at once poland parts in parts both sure this is the safest thing whenever someone says is this halal or Haram say there is two opinions of scholars and this is a famous story had that happened to be enough away he was a scholar in Islam and squat also scholar in the Arabic language he had a gathering in the message forfeit work and he had to go somewhere for half an hour so he brought his father and told him to sit here and whenever someone asks you this is a joker wherever someone asks you to there's two opinion so the man went and the father you know old and sat in the chair and said oh sure I divorced my wife three times in the same gathered in the same location I said para para para the she divorce said there are two opinions for scholars of this another man comes it says yeah sure I ate camels meat do I have to move I don't have to make up the rule there are two scholarly opinions regarding this subject and her man is listening to this is it Allah this chick is is a genie so he went to him is a chair is there any doubt in Allah there are two opinions for scholars and the whole of the people in the masjid wanted to kill them at you what are you doing his son came in and he said what's happened to listen to this crazy old man miss asking is there any doubt and the existence of a lot and he saying that are two opinions among scholars said yes linguistically I feel a he shotgun Attila is a jar and mushroom and who played it linguistically and started saying that this is whatever this is how I cut them and this is so and this is so and the people said ok and they accepted this so actually in reality this is almost true whatever you ask you just say there are two billions three opinions for opinions and that is why we always relate our thinking our ibadah our belief not to the opinions of scholars because they can play football with you always relate everything to the quran and volition this is what Allah will ask you on the day of judgment you will not ask you what the taqman team members say or what Schaffer he said you will ask you what did the quraían say and what did the prophet is awesome said so coming back to the same is the revelation was it revealed all at once or separate a number of opinion of scholars regarding his position some say it was revealed twice some say it was revealed once and some say it was revealed three times actually it's true but scholars say three times because they speak of the origin of it so the first revelation or the stage was to be written in a lotion my food the preserved tablets and this is with a large ocean no one knows what's in it except allah almighty in the hadith the Prophet Alice awesome says when Allah created the pen where Allah first created the pen he told it right and the pens what should I write o Allah and Allah told him right the destiny of all the creations until the day of judgment and this the Prophet says and this was fifty thousand years before Allah created the creation so Allah knows what has happened and what is happening and what is going to happen and what was to happen if it did not happen everything Allah knows soprano italia his knowledge is not like ours then that is why people say if everything is written down why should I care if Allah knows that I'm going to sin if Allah knows that I'm going to do these bad things why do you blame me for doing bad things you have the choice yes you see but it's all written so Marshall you believe this suggests i believe it's all written so why do you blame if my sins i say go to the top roof and throw yourself it's all written if you're going to die you're going to die if not you've got to land on your feet so you're crazy you're not crazy you know that it's written suggest president nobody does this so subhanAllah how do you justify your sins by saying it's written do you want certain or not you don't so you make your choice Allah knows what's choice you're going to me but he gave you the freedom to choose and his knowledge is so vast and huge that he knows everything is to happen Allah says nay this is indeed a glorious quran described in the low and my fool this is at the end of surat al bruges in the Holy Keith Urban where it goes let me a Quran Majeed feel ocean my food ok the second stage is the descending of the Quran as a whole from lohan my food to beta laser and this is the house of honor what is the house of honor this is like hell baton more like the Kaaba where 70,000 enter this house every single day from x 2 minus the beloved way teresa this is descended to mate raised but it a pair appears to be the same what is it fatal mahmood like how many enter it every day 70,000 so it was revealed to that and the pain jal's can see that but it was revealed at once the whole thing and why was it revealed so that the Angels would see it so that they would realize the greatness of allah azzawajal over the period of 23 years Allah knows everything is going to happen and they're seeing it in the way they see it and that is why the scholars say that what was revealed to beta Reza there is no obligation in it it is the book we have while the one in the lotion my food it has everything what slitting and the lotion muffled everything you are going to do even the things that change for example alonzo gel decreed to the I enjoyed that I should live 60 years it's written that his age ends at 60 years but in the Lohan my food it is written that I should live until I'm 70 why because it says that I am going to make connection to my next of kin select a rhyme and this increases the lifespan the prophetess of ceramics acaba her said whoever wants his lifespan to increase and Alonzo gel would give him more provisions more money he connect to the next of kin so the Angels finding that his age is 60 years old but because he's connecting his brush him Allah ordered them to increase it into 17 what's the whole process is found in the doctor my food but what they have is something that is fixed and they can see the reason and that is why Allah Allah says insert the rod young fool mahu nyasha what is a bit when the row home will get a Palazzo del e raise is what she wishes and he approves what he wishes but he has homered kitab which is a lower and ma fool and the third stage the Quran was revealed over the period of twenty three years to the Prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam a large area says and truly this Quran is a revelation from the lord of the worlds which the trustworthy away now her on Karina's ellaby her who her I mean a la fábrica de takuna min almandine and scholars some scholars not all of them some scholars said that gibril joke the Quran from a low had my food and he gave it to the Prophet Aristotle sauna and this is not accepted at all because Allah spoke with the Quran and he gave it to jbeil and joe breeley gave it to the Prophet early salatu salam otherwise we wouldn't be worse than the Jews allah azzawajal draught the tablets with his hands to Musa and they took it from the tablets now if we are to take it from the prophets who took it from gibril who took it from the low hand my food then we will be lower than them in the narration chain and that is what scholars say this is unacceptable shettleston bethania spoke about this and many many scholars spoke about this and said that this is unacceptable gibril took it straight direct from Allah without any in immediate and he gave it to the prophet salallahu alayhi wasallam we have few questions where was the Quran mostly revealed in quantities in Medina how many suitors were revealed in Medina 86 we should take this present oh no should take it away and Medina was released it was about 20 the most were revealed in Makkah and we will come to this inshallah but as quantities you know over the period of 23 years the Quran used to be revealed in five to ten verses a day sometimes when were symptoms part of a verse and sometimes of maschera and it was revealed gradually but the quantities in large quantities were at the last heal or two years of the prophets life at his la tercera and that is why because his death was nearing the quantities were all revealed as the Companions its say but in numbers it was revealed in motion will come to mention how many sewers exactly how many ayahs were revealed at a time I think I've answered this so i think i need the present five and some say 10 and those who say 10 because it used to come five in the morning and five in the evening and the Companions said like autumn a graph and are blowing through that the Companions would learn 10 verses from the Quran memorize them practice them and understand them and then they move on to the next why because this is the best way of reciting and understanding rather than taking quantities do you want quantities or quality we want quality in the that'll embedded what defeated the mushrikun with the grace of Allah the quality in the battle of her name you know hanging where is it saturated this is very funny some 11 will was asked what other day what is the nationality of muhammad sallallahu Lucy Saudi this is strange people would even relate to history nationality Saudi her name is next 25 and in this battle the Prophet was headed 25 to 30 and they were surrounding and hiding in the mountains and the minute they went into this body which was very narrow they started throwing their arrows at them and the Muslims were frightened they retreated only the Prophet is awesome and few of his companions his cousin his uncle have a snuggly mood Polly and two or three more remain with him and instead of retreating he was not on his cabin which is a big animal not only his horse which is a strong and agile and fast he was on his mule and you know how fast the meal goes and he started marching to the army and he's saying an enemy back headed I never know how to build McCauley I am the perfect there is no lie in this I am the son of Abdul Muttalib who was his grandfather and he's calling people to him how brave is he Salah Larson and a bus is saying his uncle ism I'm holding his his mood what are you doing and only these three people are for people with him kept and defending him and fighting the army against him and then he said a bass call the people of the tree has harbored similar where they gave the Pledge of Allegiance when was were an odd idea when they heard that earth man was killed he told them who give me the pleasure allegiance to die and the old gave him so he said call them and called the Mujahideen and cold answer because the rest about 4,000 or 5,000 are all rubbish their quantity not quality so he called them and immediately once they heard the voice of a bus they came back and the defeat immediately change into victory Subhan Allah and the Prophet got more than 500 they say or four hundred thousand sheep the hundred thousand camels things that would blow your mind the amount of bounties they got and the long story goes on so the Prophet was concentrating on quality and not quantity and that is why they used to revise memorize 10 verses very little but excellent because they would practice it now why okay this verse of the Quran is mentioned and if I recall correctly in Surat Annisa la hwy app i doona where a lot of the girls who say that those who sit back are not equal to those who fight in the cause of allah and this was only revealed not equal are those of the believers who sit at home that is it why and those who strive hard and fight in the cause of allah when this was revealed it will unlock tomb came to the prophet that is awesome he said the prophet of allah i am i'm blind my a blind man and also another companion also came to the prophet or tram if i recall correctly that balaam josh and he also was blind so the verse was revealed and the one who was describing it was they didn't have it and when this verse beginning was revealed they was complaining from the thigh of the prophetess am almost breaking it and when the revelation was over and these companions complained that we are blind how can we fight we have to sit home Allah so jeal revealed this portion except those who are disabled and as a to inhabit said now the second time it was revealed i am definitely i was sure i'm not going to walk it's definitely broken because it's so heavy so in this ayah was revealed part of it was also revealed in this sense not in the full sense benefits from gradual revelation what is the benefit we get when we know that the revelations was gradual there are a number of benefits imagine if it was all revealed at once how long it will take you to study it and to analyze it and to know which was revealed for what purpose it would be very difficult the promises and all that we relate to you O Muhammad SAW are seldom of the news of the messengers in order that we may make your heart strong and firm so this is the first benefit what is it quality no wow the mother no no think look at the person think this is this when they send what no II to dignity ignis see how to take example of those who came before you when the Prophet Alice lobster and gets the revelation in gradually this would make him learn and be any firm on the path he is going if it was revealed all of once it will make him strong for a month or two but then he man would weaken so this refreshes you by gradually strengthening your heart and firmly making you on the right path through the gradual revelation this will come mashallah also it is easier when it comes gradually to memorize and it's simpler if I tell you take this ten pages and memorize it I'll make you recite it in half an hour is this he is here or that if I tell you take this page you have five minutes and after five minutes I'm gonna make you reset another one this is much easier and simpler to understand also to prove the truthfulness of the prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam in the sense that he is faced with many questions many incidents if it was revealed to him all at once and three four years someone asks him a question and he has to go and refer to the Quran it would not be as when he affected when he gives the answer immediately that is why yes i doona kind of roar they ask you about the spirit about the soul but did not know what to answer immediately revelation comes he gives him the answer so this proves that it is not coming from him it is coming from allah azzawajal and it would prove his truthfulness also it's gradual because the Prophet lived over the span of 23 years as a prophet and messenger so he had to reveal the laws of Islam revealed the laws concerning marriages inheritance selling and buying regarding the punishment prescribed punishment for the wrong doings how to relate between the Muslim societies among themselves and Muslims and non-muslims alike so this had to be revealed over the period of 23 years and to govern the Muslim society and as we've said when gibril came in the angelic form it was very awesome and Tyson Hill a prophet is awesome so if it was reviewed all of us it might have killed him so that is why it was easier for him to take the revelation bit by bit as a human being and also it was a challenge for the Arabs the elves were the Masters in words in saying few words that has a lot and a lot of meaning and the Prophet is Islam over the period of 23 years this gradual revelation caused the Arabs to be challenged over a long period of time not one week not one month not one year 23 is you have all the time you want I am challenging you with the Quran produced only three verses you cannot so over the period of 23 years it was a challenge for them it was a challenge not only in Arabic also in incidence when Allah says that but here the avila have been whatever when Allah curses and condemns the uncle of the Prophet his name was I would have unless stated in this world in this surah that he is in hell and his wife is in hell it was the easiest thing to prove the Quran draw for I will have to say a shadow al-ilah washim hamdullah immediately this would prove in him to be a liar it's easy but neither i will have not his wife did this why because this is a revolution from Allah he is doing he's in hell he cannot do it any of the items you have quote I will have a said listen take whatever money you want just claim that you're a Muslim for monday cus it's over now we prove that boys alive he did not so this was a challenge not only by the eloquent arabic but also by the fact and the content and also if someone is talking for an hour you might find it difficult to disagree with him or to find loopholes or deficiencies if he talks for a day he might make mistakes might if he talks for 23 years definitely he will make lots and lots and lots of mistakes so 23 years the revelation of the Quran and you cannot find any mistake and it proves that it is not human there's something from the creator of the heavens and of the Earth's ok then we come to another alien of quran now these are all the printer room the al-quran valois he and we come the relations a gradual gradual revelations we come to the first and last to be revealed what benefit do we get from this would get to know the benefits shala later on but it is essential for a person studying the quran you know what was first and what was last so that he can understand the Quran you cannot know the abrogation in the Quran knowing which is first otherwise this is a very sensual in obligation to know the date not necessarily this was an mundane this was Tuesday but you have to know which was prior to the other the first to be revealed to the Prophet is salatu salam at the beginning of solar de la la hora bismillah bikila D Hanukkah Hanukkah in sauna malapa wore a google account and Lady unnameable column a lemon in San maniana this was the first to be revealed and this is the majority of scholars why do we see the majority because there is another hadith narrated by java cannot deny me allah be pleased with him and with his father when he says that the first that was reviewed was the iu hundred method but this though it is in a Bihari it is not the most authentic opinion there was in the hadith itself abjabar well agrees with him says that and then the prophet saw the angel that came to him and he told him we are you have a death so what did the prophet see him this indicates"
