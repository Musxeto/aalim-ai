  "title": "Wiping Face After Dua & How to politely advise people about what they are doing wrong? Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "fatima says i saw many muslims including my self after making dua or supplication wipe hands over face is this perceived by a fatwa or sunnah or whatever you call it the answer is no when we make dua generally speaking not related to after salah generally speaking i am between adam and eve raise my hands and make dua after i finish some people wipe their faces and this is not backed up by any authentic hadith so the hadith that backs it up is not authentic hence one should not do that now look at the steps of shaytan how many times have you seen people not only wiping their faces but rather wiping their whole bodies and every inch of it i've seen many how did this start i've i approached i personally have approached many and usually i approach them with diplomacy because i know that i scare people and many people told me that i have an intimidating face in a very serious world this is the face of a killer so i go to them and say salaam alaikum and the ghost says accept a word of advice from an elder brother or should i refrain immediately when they see you speak like this so no no no if they're younger uncle please advise me if he's a little bit older he says yeah no problem if he's way older he says hey don't make yourself older i'm older than you so i broke the ice with the grace of allah so i would tell him i saw you do this do you know any hadith that backs it up 99.9 says no but i saw someone do this so i thought that this is baraka blah blah blah okay i'll tell you the proper sunnah and it's up to you to take it or not the prophet saws would never do this except in two occasions one before going to bed he used to cup his hands blow then recite the three holes and wipe over his body repeat this three times or whenever he felt pain or got sick he used to do roughly on himself by cupping his hands reciting the vehicles then blow see the opposite night atkar or bedtime of car we blow then recite in rookia we recite then blow and he would wipe over the area that aches him or hurts him never ever was it reported that the prophet assam wiped his face after salat or after dua or his body so this is my advice i apologize again for interrupting you and for uh intruding on your privacy like this but i hope you forgive me 100 percent would never argue and would say allah increases in knowledge i have learned from you end of story so always remember when you have a hadith people honor it people value it i never go and say ah sheikh so and so says so-and-so says this makes some people retract a little bit not accept unless you know that they are 100 okay with great scholars of islam that you're coaching then yes this is a point of power that you can add to it so in short wiping the face after dua or in vocation or supplication is an innovation it's not valid"
