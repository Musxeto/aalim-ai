  "transcript": "muhammad from the u.s he says i have like 99 percent whenever i pray i make mistakes and recitation of the fatiha or something else in the quran or in the atkar so is it permissible for me to say subhanallah alhamdulillah instead of reading the quran no this is not permissible at all this was taught to the by the prophet islam to the companion who came and could not memorize anything of the quran you my friend with the pronunciation you just said subhanallah have a problem your arabic is excellent your pronunciation is perfect which means that you don't have a problem in reciting the fatiha you have a problem here shaytaan is messing up with you and if the vast majority of your prayers you have these with us and feeling like you're making mistakes you must with a capital must you must ignore these doubts continue your prayer despite of any imagined or alleged mistakes and finish it without any sujudas and never look back so your prayer is valid totally in five to seven days if you continue to pray without repeating it without even looking back at what you have done or listening to the whispers of shaytan you may have nullified your prayer you may have committed a major sin ignore in five to seven days all of these whispers would go down the durian"
