  "transcript": "he says what is the ruling on appointing women in leadership positions or high public office positions the issue is an issue that people usually ask about and whenever there is a dispute among different people the logic necessitates that we refer back to the Quran and the Sunnah why because this is what Allah azzawajal commanded Us in the Quran when he said and if you dispute over an issue then refer it back to Allah and to the prophet Allah and this is by all Scholars referring to the Sunnah so whatever there is a dispute between you and I we shouldn't argue and fight about it refer it to the Quran and the Sunnah with the understanding of the three favorite Generations this is the decisive controlling element in any argument between Muslims not the logic not what is happening not history rather the Quran the Sunnah so what's the ruling on women taking High positions a ruler a leader Etc Allah says in the Quran men are Guardians and Protectors of women why for two reasons one because Allah favored men over women that's it Muslims don't argue this is what Allah says in the Quran two because what they spend from their wealth and this is an indication that it's the man's duty to spend over his woman fork his mom his wife his daughters now from the Sunnah the prophet said Any Nation would not Prosper us would not succeed if they were to hire and appoint a woman as their leader and this was related to Persia when their King had died and they appointed his daughter and through logic women are ordered to wear the hijab and to be segregated for men and to be appointed upon men who are non-mahram to her defies the purpose of hijab she would have to communicate she would have to be in seclusion she would have to look at them and they look at her this is not Islam maybe it's a different religion but don't associate this with Islam beside the point that she has her cycle every month that may impair or jeopardize or hamper her decision making among other things so it is not permissible for a woman to assume a public position uh or to lead when there is mixing with men but if she is the owner of a company she's the CEO and she can delegate things and she doesn't have to mix with uh other men or be alone with them in this case inshallah there's nothing wrong in that"
