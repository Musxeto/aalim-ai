  "transcript": "is from abroad she says is it possible to see Allah in our dreams this is an issue of dispute we have a Hadith that is authentic that the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam saw Allah in a dream however Allah is beyond our imagination and no one can see Allah azzawajal before the day of judgment as he would reveal himself to us when we are in Paradise if Allah grant us this greatest favor and blessing of all while in dreams it's a possibility that Allah azzawajal May manifest himself as he wishes and pleases to an individual as per the Hadith and it was reported that Imam Ahmed said that he saw Allah in a dream the issue is nowadays if I see a dream where someone says that he's Allah how would I verify this I can't and the vast majority of such claims would most likely and probably be Satan impersonating Allah and telling him telling the individual he comes in his dream that he's Allah so that he must guide him but is it a possibility it is a possibility are there any consequences not that I know of so if in your dream you see Allah and he tells you that I have Exempted you from praying Fajr on time you have to only pray for prayers this is Satan definitely or changing the law of sharia this is Satan or telling you when the day of judgment is this is Satan all of these things are not true and can't be true because they go against the religion of Allah and their religion is complete foreign today I have completed your religion so the religion is complete it cannot be completed more or you cannot add things or subscribe things from the religion now because that would go against the Ayah where Allah shows us his favor and Blessing by telling us that the deal is complete at the time of the Prophet The Deen is complete there's no way that it can be altered or changed till the day of judgment so I hope this answers your question"
