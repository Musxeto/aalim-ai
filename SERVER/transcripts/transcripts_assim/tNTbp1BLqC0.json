  "transcript": "and he says that if a man goes to sleep the night of ramadan so today is 30th of sha'ban or 29th of let's assume it's the 29th of japan and he went to bed after isha he did not hear the news whether tomorrow is ramadan or not no one talked about the sighting this person's fasting depends on the following if he did not have any intention to fast tomorrow thinking that tomorrow is 30 then this fasting of his is a void it's not valid he has to make up for that day if he goes to bed saying that wallahi tomorrow might be ramadan or not i don't have time to wait until they tell me whether they cited the moon or not i'm going to bed and if it's proven to be ramadan to more than i'm fasting in this case his fasting is correct it's like the uh hajj of ali may allah be pleased with him i think it was ali when he came from yemen and joined the prophet assam for hajj and the prophet told him which hajj are you making to ephrath he said i said as the prophet had did or as the prophet had done so he made it on a condition which is the prophet's type of hajj likewise this person's niya is valid"
