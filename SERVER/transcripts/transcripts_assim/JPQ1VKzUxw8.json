  "title": "Can I share a halal video if the channel also has haram content Am I sinful if he clicks ponzi schem",
  "transcript": "Mer from Germany. So when working at the company um I can introduce other people into this company and if they work there um I may get profit and get commissions if they go do well. So showing what the company is like um I can send him a video of it where the CEO of this company explains everything. I could also explain it but the CEO does very good. So I rather send this uh of the CEO the video of the CEO the video is on YouTube and um I may send this video to this brothers like this YouTube video and this video has no haram in it everything halal. So the thing is that if my friend clicks on this video and then on the channel of this video and then on other videos of this channel, he may see haram like music or women who are dressed not well, not good. So my question is can I send my friends or my colleagues this video? As long as the video itself is halal, then there is no problem and it is his sin. if he roams around and navigates around haram things. The problem is not here mer. The problem is if the company you're talking about is based on networking marketing which is a ponzi scheme. So it's like gold quest. It's like business. It's like these products where they tell you, \"Okay, we have this pen. We have 2,000 only items of it.\" And the price of the market is €1, but we will sell it for €10. And you explain to the people that it is something that is extraordinary, one of a kind. If you manage to sell 10 people and they become marketer marketeers or people who market this product like you, whatever they sell, you will get a percentage and the one who recruited you will get a percentage. And in order to engage in this scheme, which is a Ponzi scheme, a pyramid scheme, you have to buy yourself this product for €10. as a starter and then you can become someone working in sales. This is harami and I don't know of a company that says that if you recruit people we will give you a percentage of the people that come in unless it is like this. So you have to look into it."
