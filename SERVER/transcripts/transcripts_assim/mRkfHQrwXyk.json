  "transcript": "smilla half of my neighbor him at hamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa Navarro theorem attend little I mean nabina muhammad in wa ala alihi wa sahbihi ajma'in i'm a body brothers sisters in islam assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh our personality that we are about to attempt to talk about is a great muslim individual she is the daughter of the first man of the Ummah of the Prophet as a Salam to enter Jannah she is the daughter of the most beloved person on earth to the heart of a prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam she is Asma the daughter of Abu Bakr acid dip may Allah be pleased with her and with him she is the sister of Aisha sharing the same father but different mothers her mother is Katella bint utbah Rosa Allah Maria and Asthma was nicknamed as um Abdullah because of her son Abdullah is no severe marijuana Allah be pleased with them she was ten years older than ayesha and her rank among those who accepted Islam was the 17th which means that she was among the very first to accept Islam at a very early age she's known among the Muslims by the nickname there to nipa hi Nene and Nia top is singular natok pain is to new thought is a belt women wear on their dresses so that they would lift their dresses up on top of that belt so that they would not tremble if the dress is too long while working at home she's remembered for helping the Prophet Allison and her father when they escaped Mecca and hid for three days in the cave so that those Posse trying to kill them would not find them for three days she used to prepare the food and the water and walk the distance of two hours on foot hiding from the people facing the dangers of the dark and being alone just to deliver the food for a very just cause she took her belt divided it into two and tied the water container and the bag of food because she didn't have anything to tie it with and when the prophet saw this allahís alot wa sallam he made dua for this young girl saying 'my allah substitute you with these two with two belts in paradise meaning that may allow so I'll admit you to paradise she was a blessed woman who suffered at an early age due to her Islam she was a role model she wasn't someone who did not have high ambitions high aspirations she was like anyone else wanting to live to enjoy but she knew that she had a mission in life and that mission was to worship allah azza wajal to spread the deen of allah to assist in any way this great religion of islam that she has absolute unconditional conviction in and this is a role model to our girls to our women who unfortunately are misguided by the fashion the catwalk the entertainment industry ESMA suffered at an early age may Allah be pleased with her it was reported that when the Prophet as a salam escaped mecca and the idol worshippers came looking for him and did not find him and only found Ali may Allah be pleased with him pretending to be him sleeping in in his bed Abu jahil the Pharaoh of this Ummah was furious he came with other men with fire in their eyes wanting to kill so he knocked the door Asma opened it and he asked her arrogantly where is your father and she said I don't know this Pharaoh of this Ummah this tyrant smacked her on the face so hard her earring fell she would not budge she would not move a step because she had Eman filling up her heart knowing that she is on the right track and on the right on the straight path Asma was the daughter of abu bakr abu bakr in the early days of Islam was responsible for five or six of the ten heaven bound to enter Islam to imagine Abu Bakr managed to convince Northman in a fan to accept Islam as you bury me now one tall habner obeyed Allah and many others among those whom Allah guided on his hands was a Subhan Allah one who was a zoo baron verner hawa az-zubair marijuana was the cousin of the prophet alayhi salatu salam as uber his mother was Sofia been to Abdul Mutallab may Allah be pleased with her so it was normal that a zubayr would propose to this man who had guided him to Islam and to marry his daughter Abu Bakr could not find anyone more worthy of asthma than zubayr so they got married asthma was a lawful wife and Allah Azza WA JAL granted the couple many children the first of them was out the liveness ube now we know that asthma migrated late so asthma Ayesha and the daughters of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam rakia and uncle Thome and Fatima they all went when they deny Haritha who was the adopted son of the prophetess and came to pick them up Asma was pregnant and she was on her final days expecting delivery anytime but she could not afford to miss this blessed gathering migrating to Medina so she took the risk and traveled three days journey of four on camel's back until they reached Medina only to find the pains of labor and she gave birth in Kaaba which was a joyful event for the Muslims the Jews circulated among the Muslims that we have spare we had casted we have casted a spell on the Muslims that they would never ever give birth to children in Medina and some of the Muslims were afraid of this being true so when Asma gave birth to the first born Muslim in Medina it was a joyful occasion and the Muslims were happy this blessed woman would not breast feed her newborn infant which is a very natural thing to do instead she sent her firstborn directly to the prophet alayhi salatu salam and the prophet salallahu alaihe salam made dua for the boy and for his parents so this blessed woman gained the door of the Prophet al-assad sallam not only that the Prophet performed what is known as technique and this is soon a ritual in our religion that the first thing to be or to enter the mouth of a newborn would be a very menu tin tiny piece of date that a person choose quite well until it is almost liquid like and then it's put a small piece in the upper ceiling of the child's throat and the child would suckle it and swallow it and doctors say that this type of glucose of sugar is extremely important for the well-being of the child in order to prevent suffocation due to lack of many things medical things that I'm not well aware of what I know that they say that there are a number of benefits of it and that would help a child to suckle naturally and normally so the first thing that entered of the line is uveitis throat and stomach was this small piece of date mixed with the saliva of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam and what a blessing it was asthma may Allah be pleased with her and you can guess that by now was very strong and committed to Islam and to her religion after all the suffering she faced from the idol worshipers the pride she had in her heart was the norm among all Muslims and this is what most of us nowadays lack Muslims nowadays don't have any honor dignity or pride in their religion except few the vast majority would have no problem in bowing down to the disbelievers conceding to their demands Simon Says yes master not asthma asthma was a typical Muslim at the time of the prophet alayhi salatu salam where they had their dignity where they proclaimed only ayyuhal hadirun say o you who disbelieve la Abudu Metabo doing I don't worship what you worship you do not worship what I worship you have your religion I have mine this is the pride of a Muslim without any arrogance you have to be proud in your religion Asma may Allah be pleased with her gave us a beautiful example in the sahi she reports or she narrates she says that my mother came to visit me in medina so patella came while she was still a disbeliever she came with meat with ghee with dates with so much food as gifts to her daughter so she Asma in the beginning refused to accept any of it and she said you're a disbeliever and I am a believer and I have to seek permission from the prophet alayhi salatu salam is this possible yes it is possible at an earlier age when the profit has migrated to Medina with Abu Bakr Abu Bakr took all of his cash deposits about 6,000 dinar order him and fled and left with the Prophet and migrated this money is to be utilized in our purposes in spreading Islam in supporting the Prophet erase a lot sir when Ibaka hoffa the father of Abu Bakr who was not yet Muslim and he was a blind man an old man he came to the home of his son only to find that he migrated so he said to his grandchildren I bet that your father did not only frighten you by leaving that also he frightened you by taking all his his wealth as well leaving you in poverty Asma being the proud Muslim 'she was she didn't want her grandfather who was an idol worshipper to criticize Islam or to criticize her father so she came to a bag and put some stones in it and placed it in her father's safe and put a piece of cloth on it to hide it and she took her grandfather's hand and said no no grandfather you got this all wrong my father left a lot of money for us look and she put his hand in the safe over that pile of stones and when he felt it he said oh if this is the case then hamdulillah he left a lot of money for you you won't need my assistance and this shows you how proud she was of her religion and this is why she rejected her mother's gift because she didn't want any favours from a non-muslim over her so she asked Oh prophet of Allah my mother came to connect her kinship with me she wants to give me a gift so that I'm happy would I reciprocate with her would I accept that so the Prophet said are they in salat wa salam yes be dutiful and kind to your mother even Jerry robbery in history Shir said that the following ayah was revealed due to that incident Allah says in the Quran Allah does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes Allah does not forbid you from being righteous towards them and acting justly toward them indeed Allah loves those who act justly Subhan Allah where are the Muslims from such a beautiful verse where are those extremists those terrorists who kill any non-muslim because he's an enemy of Islam have they ever read the Quran no yes they are a point zero zero zero one of the population there are not even a minority there not to be even looked at but they make a bigger sound their bark is far greater than their bite unfortunately if they read the Quran and saw this ayah non-muslims who do not fight us because of religion because of our Islam and they do not expel us from our homes Allah says it's totally permissible to be kind to them to be just towards them and to be righteous give them gifts deal with them nicely and kindly there is nothing wrong in that but people are so ignorant they are so far away from Islam I dare at the Koran they would have found what the religion of peace tells us about this now as mal was married to zubayr managua who was one of the courageous soldiers of islam and she was the mother of abdullah and we all know who I'm the lion Zubair was may allah be pleased with all of them yet she was not a fancy woman she was not a woman of aristocrat life she used to work with her own hands struggle suffer though her father was a rich man but she was with her husband now and her husband was stoned broke he had only his horse she used to walk like two three kilometres to bring dates seed grind it and feed it to his horse and she used to do this daily do the shores in the home cook make dough everything one day while on her way back from the farm of a zubayr carrying those dates seeds on her head the Prophet came along with his companions al is awesome and he was on his camel back so he said to her he didn't even call her this is a sound to draw attention and the Prophet got his camel to sit on the ground so that she can mount the camel behind the Prophet at least Allah - Salaam knowing that the Prophet Isis ohm is her brother-in-law he is her father's brother meaning uncle and that he is the messenger of allah is not any normal person so when the Prophet offered her alysus on this ride she remembered a zoo bears jealousy so she declined and she'd afraid refrained so the Prophet has moved on with his companions remembering the husband's jealousy and acting upon that this is a formula of a happy marriage when a wife respects her husband's feelings whether wrong or right he has the right to feel jealous she respects that instead of fighting it ridiculous and not paying attention to it and we get so many problems from men complaining from disobedience of their wives and not paying attention to issues of free mixing with the cousins posting their photo photos on social media doing so many things that Islam does not approve of but of course we get so many complaints of sisters complaining of their husbands chit-chatting with nan muharram and doing hideous things that this is not the time to discuss what matter is that Asma remembered the jealousy of her husband and acted accordingly though he was not there he was not present he was not watching but it's the fear of Allah that reminded her of that I smell like all the mothers of the believers like all the great companions like all those close to the circle of the Prophet eyes of Salaam used to spend generously in the cause of Allah Abdullah Vanessa Bayer may Allah be pleased with the man with his father said I assure and asthma worse but they're spending in the cause of Allah was different Aisha whenever she got something she used to pilot little or big she used to pilot until it was worthy of being spent she would spend it all at once as Matt was different whatever comes goes nothing stays and asthma was known that whenever she got sick she would immediately free all slaves that she has and spent all money that she has seeking the pleasure of Allah as there were gentleman this brave woman at a very old age she was she was almost over a hundred years of age when L had judging the use of Ithaca fee killed her son and crucified him and he came and sent from his palace someone to summon Asma in his court so when the messenger came telling her to come and meet al hajar she said to him go I'm not coming tell him I'm not coming so a judge sent the messenger again and said to him tell her if she does not come willingly I'll send someone to pull her from her braids from her hair and drag her all the way look at this disrespect from this person she said to him I challenge him let him send whoever he wishes to drag me from my braids so immediately and her Josh came to see her in her house and he said to her what do you think of what I had done to the enemy of Allah meaning her son of the law who is a companion the son of a companion but this is the arrogance some people have and this is when you sell your soul to the devil for few dirhams so she said to him you haven't done anything I see that you have spoiled his dunya by killing him you spoiled his life on earth yet he spoiled your Acura by you killing him he has pulled your Acura when you meet a large L and you'll pay for your bad deeds and she bluntly said that to his face I heard the Prophet say alaysalam that in the cave the tribe of L had judge which is in Taif in fact if thou there will be a liar and an executioner executioner someone who kills people a lot the liar we have seen him and I see that he is Almo terribly obey the thaka fee and the man who kills and execute people I see that he is no one but you she said that not fearing death for her judge was known to kill people discriminately without any cost he killed Sahib new Jubei one of the greatest tabi een and scholars of Islam he killed the zubur managua a companion without any problem to him as Matt was a person of knowledge generated a lot of hadith about the Prophet heiress of Salaam and she narrated 58 hadith Al Bukhari and Muslim agreed on 13 of them Buhari narrated 5 on his own and Muslim four on his own she may Allah be pleased with her was the last to die from among them muhajireen men and women and she died in the year 73 of allah may allah azzawajal be pleased with her heather Allahu Alem when especially in melee Islam was all allahu wa sallim wa barik alaa Abdera surah he nabina muhammad while early he was happy ajma'in wa salaamu alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh assalamu alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatu today I'm gonna talk about the book interactions of the greatest leader Abu Huraira may allah be pleased with him said the messenger of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam said no one's wealth helped me as much as the wealth of abu bakr helped me after which abu bakr began to weep and say and is my life and wealth for anything besides you o messenger of allah this narration shows the level of etiquette and humbleness that abu bakr may allah be pleased with him had in the presence of the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam for he likened himself to a slave of the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wa send him by saying that his wealth was only for the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wa senem as well as his soul and self this comes as no surprise for the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam has more rights on the believers than themselves he may Allah be pleased with him spent his wealth in the cause of Allah and he consoled the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wasallam through his own self so the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam recognized that for him and said in order to build his teacher and to remind the ummah of virtues no one's wealth helped me as much as the wealth of Abu Bakr helped me among the benefits of this narration it is important to keep good manners and humbleness in the presence of the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wasallam thanking someone who has bestowed some favour on you as well as supplicating for them is part of having good manners reported by Albahari reported by Al Timothy and even majeure Albani ruled it authentic in his book sahih al jermeir the explanation of a Cindy on the book of eben maha and at a seer Bashar al German a surreal salam aliekum wa rahamtullah and welcome back I think we have Osama on the line from Pakistan Salam after la yes Sheikh hope you I'm fine cycle of here hamdulillah what can I do for your salmon I have two questions yes the first question is my father is very abusive man and he was too whenever he gets into and fight with my mom used to curse all of my siblings and me as well so the question is how do I handle these things I should be neutral if I do nothing but and whenever I get involved my siblings laugh as well they used to tell me what are you doing here what you should not do you should not get involved in our lives so should I do a minimum distance with all of them I would not get in for that thing as well and second question is Sheikh you told about these ending time of zohar prayer so I couldn't I will do I get it so can you tell the can you recommend me any app that can tell me in the ending time of each side okay or you can tell the time period what is before next to them being inshaallah second la here Osama says that his father is abusive and he fights a lot with his mother and whenever they fight his father curses his wife his children everybody so he curses Osama and his siblings so he wants to know how to deal with such a a person in such abuse because whenever he wants to interfere people tell them don't interfere well this is true interference between your father and mother is very problematic as they say damned if you do damned if you don't because if you take sides the other parent would hate you for that and make dua against you so it's your mother's problem as long it's normal fights mental abuse cursing words nothing physical this seems that your mother is responsible for that she can file for divorce for Haller she can get people to interfere from his family and her family she can put an end to it and most likely most of the times she's involved in causing such problems because such abuse is a cocktail between the personality of the abuser the father and the conditions that your mother is setting to it for him so she's calling for it she knows how to avoid it but she doesn't and this lack of communication is the mother of all trouble between and conflicts between spouses not only that also the lack of respect which is obvious and clear to anyone who's looking that they both lack they don't respect one so what to do I believe that the best form of action is to stay away and to individually when they are in a good mood give a word or two of advice so you don't advise your father in front of your mom you don't advise your father when your father is upset or angry you try to choose the time and the place secondly you must not respond to any such abuse when people abuse you they want to upset you to anger you to provoke provoke a negative response from you and to hear something bad if you remain silent you do not defend yourself you do not argue you do not reply back after a while they will feel silly and they will stop or at least reduce finally and thirdly that this is your test from Allah would you like to be tested with cancer you personally Osama no would you like to be tested as those brothers and sisters of ours in the rural India and many more who are being raped killed slaughtered or in even in India would you like to be tested like our Muslim brothers they're being oppressed answers no would you like to be in Syria with barrels of bombs coming and burning all you have children all your siblings or your your family you cannot do anything about it no and so on so this is your test from Allah be patient and diplomatic and inshallah Allah we'll find a way for you Abdullah I don't see the full name Abdullah from Canada I strongly shake how are you I'm fine zachanassian Shaikh I have a few questions for you shaping my first question is in regards to the the length of a must - she had this I have this hair trimmer with different settings on it and I was wondering if I like if I use setting four or five where the hair is slightly longer is that okay or should I go smaller like one or two okay I'm confused about the length of the moustache in mice my second question is are there are there any specific due hours that the Prophet Muhammad SAW sallam used to recite on the odd nights of Ramadan like any specific in the books of knowledge that you know of and just one final question is what's the best dawah that somebody can make for good health just good health that's that's all Sampson la Rey Yan from the US Salam alikoum allahi wa barakato cilantro avocado house and hamdulillah I'm fine Zack Allah here what can I do for your a yen I have three questions yes sir my first question is what are your thoughts on joint family on what joint families joint families okay I remember too is um I know that Allah Azza WA JAL heeds they divorced the more the most hatred think to Allah as he divorced but I was passing hammer salon rising the worst what was he divorced yeah crazy divorced the Prophet yeah I heard many people say that he was divorced and many like scholars say that he was divorced okay I will answer that hopefully third question my last question is how many wives did possum Hamas's and have altogether sensei fourteenth of these twelve and something something Mary okay welcome so Osama's second question he says is there any app that can tell me when the timing of the ends because Osama is from Pakistan and they follow the hanafi madhhab and we know that there are sir is definitely not according to sooner and this is against the three other schools of thought against the hadith of gibreel may Allah be pleased with him male-male a peace be upon him and among other evidences so what's the timing I would highly recommend that you follow the ohm al hora calculations and if you open any app like I don't know what what they're Muslim finder Islamic finder or pro Muslim or whatever apps I don't know these apps you will find that in the settings methods of calculation Karachi University wammy the Muslim League isne and Omar Cora chooser McCory this is the most accurate forfeiture of La Raza and Muharram their calculation of Asia is not accurate and must not be followed you can follow all the other [Music] calculations without any problem in sha Allah Abdullah from Canada says what's the length I should set or the degree I should set my trimmer to on my shaving machine when I do my moustache this is up to you you can set it up to seven to ten or to one you must not shave it this is what's not permissible according to a most authentic opinion in my Malek says that this is mutilation but you have to and I help the director gets a closer shot you have to avoid having the hair of your mustache going down on your lips and some of the narrations that they used to get one miswak and put it on the upper lip and cut the hair so that it would not go down on the lip but if you trim it like I do maybe because of the video it it shows that I don't have any but this is like one setting and this is clear a cleaner for me and it depends on your preference so there isn't a specific length yet it is highly recommended to shorten it as much as possible without shaving it second question of Abdullah from Canada saying that is there in a specific dua that the Prophet used to say as some for the odd numbers of last night's 10 nights of ramadan dances no there's no specific door neither for the odd or even the only hadith we have is the hadith of mother Aisha may Allah be pleased with her and she said o prophet of Allah what should I say if I were to identify the night of other so if I know that tonight is lailatul cut what should I say the Prophet said that is some say a llama in the car for one to hit Bulava far for any oh Allah you are most forgiving you love pardoning so forgive me and pardon me so this is a dua for the whole last ten nights you say as many as you wish and this is highly recommended me lad from the US selamat Allah save have two questions first of all these can you shed some light on the squeezing of the grave and whether it's painful is there can we make dua for it and then second question is if someone say makes two three million a year is it permissible for such a person to buy a twenty-five thousand dollar watch that's it okay so Abdullah third question he's saying that what is like I barely can read my writing who he's saying what's the best door but for what I forgot yeah I'd appreciate if you if you drop me a call Abdallah and remind me what's the best draw of what for the prophetess Salaam I have no idea Rayanne's question from the US what's your thoughts about joint family joint family is a necessity in some cases but to have it as the norm this is totally wrong if there is a necessity in it's rare and not that frequent in this case Islamic rulings must be followed no free mixing between and Mahan's so your wife cannot mix with your brother who is her brother-in-law he must abide by the footage AB as she abides by it in front of me on the street and in front of Nanda Maharaj being your brother doesn't mean that she can ease the hijab a little bit because the danger is far greater the danger of your brother is far greater than the danger of mine because I'm a total stranger but he is mixing with her cracking jokes living when you're out of the house he's in there you don't know what can happen and what Shaitaan is capable of doing so if these rules are governed and the woman herself approves of it because it's her god-given right Allah gave her the right to have a separate accommodation of her own you cannot deprive her of her right that Allah has given just because you want to live with your parents or you want to be with your family also that your father is not angry with you his anger is unjustifiable and you must not listen to him because what he's telling you to do is something Haram and transgresses on your wife's rights so this is in short my thoughts on that fatima from Saudi okay I dream Rukia is tuilik okay to to play it huh to play it as in a recording no I have a Rukia card like ATM card it's always in my pocket and sometimes my wallet I will bring it in toilet oh so it's written it's written on the card yeah yeah okay and second question is can I keep my circuitry threat to my cousin's the car what are the cattle fir tree to your cousin's sheep because I like okay and I have questions yesterday but I think I asked about social media posting yes there is an organic organization in our country they are giving good like right and then they are taking pictures on that and together with the receiver so we have to date on that that it's nothing any appropriate because it can embarrass to the one Holyfield and they they said it's for the sake of Allah and although I am asking my question yes do they have the word fully for that okay our Moroccan avocado so rayon second question he said that the Allah Azza WA JAL hates most divorce no this is not true this is a statement laymen usually circulate and they say abakada la la la la la la the most abhorred had a thing to Allah esta lock and this is not true sometimes it is sold loved by Allah as a gel that you rewarded for divorce depending on how evil your wife is so someone is married to a woman only to discover that she is a prostitute and he keeps staying married to her while she's still working the nights definitely he has he has to divorce her and is rewarded for divorcing such an evil woman so divorce can't be halal can be Haram can be mandatory it depends on the situation and he says that the Prophet was a divorcee Don this is not true the Prophet throughout our series women around the Prophet as a sow we told you that in an incident he divorced hafsa the daughter of Omar for something that she had done and it wasn't that he did not love her but because of what she had done he divorced her only to get gibreel coming from the seventh heaven ordering him to revoke the divorce and reconcile with her because this is the instruction of allah azza wajal she's a woman that prays and fasts so the Prophet revoked the divorce but he was a divorcee know that he was not a divorcee Allah his salat WA Salam as for the number of wives the Prophet had a son he died with nine wives with him and they differed whether he in total married eleven thirteen less or more depending on the wives that he did not marry al Junia for example was a woman from a noble tribe but somebody tricked her or she herself after the wedding was done when the Prophet came to his house and he approached her she said I seek refuge in Allah from you that was sufficient so the Prophet said if you sought refuge in Allah then no one is greater than Allah go to your family you're divorced because she sought refuge in Allah so the Prophet could not do anything but that so there is a dis dispute and an issue of difference among the people of Syrah in regards of that and Allah knows best Malad from the US says can you tell us about the squeeze of the grave yes this is authentic every soul that dies must suffer the squeeze of the grave and the difference of opinion would be our prophets and messengers included or not and the most authentic opinion is by default no they're not but everyone else including great companions such as Mahalo manageable whom the hadith came to tell us about the squeeze that he got and then it was really relieved so this squeeze is not a punishment it is a sort of a hardship that a believer gets and then he is relieved from it and his second question a person who earns two or three million dollars would it be extravagant to buy a $25,000 watch than says yes see it's not what your income is all about it what is considered among the people to be extravagant or not and there are a number of hadith I cannot elaborate now the but the Prophet says al Islam in a hadith one bed for you one bed for your wife one bed for your guest fourth bed is for Shaitaan so to live in a mansion of a hundred rooms where you only live and use one room and the rest is for showing off this is extravagance a watch of $25,000 that tells the time as good a as a watch over $10 watch this is extravagance and all what you want is to show off and Allah knows best fatima says taking in my wallet something that has the names of allah or rakia you should not do that anything that has the name of allah should be kept out of the toilet rukia or even the name of allah the cutoff filter can we give it to our cousins if they are poor or needy they have to be labeled and classified as poor or needy this is permissible can it be cash the answer's no it has to be staple food and finally the organization that donates and gives donations and charity but they click photos of the people while receiving it this is humiliating to the poor this respecting them and it's not permissible if you want to advertise or to bring attention so that others would donate then you have to blur the faces of the poor people so that their dignity would not be touched I'm afraid that this is the last episode of women around the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam there are speculations negotiations I don't know about what would be scheduled might we might continue on Saturday with asked that for four or five days only questions and answers and not this program but this beautiful program I had the privilege and honor to share these beautiful stories about great women who were around the prophet alayhi salatu salam may allah azzawajal accept our prayers and fasting is during this blessed month of ramadan and may Allah Azza WA JAL make us among those who are resurrected on the day of judgment under the flagship of the prophet muhammad sallallahoalyhiwasallam had our lahu alum when is better el Mila he Aslam assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
