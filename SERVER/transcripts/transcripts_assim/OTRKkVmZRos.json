  "transcript": "is it an obligation to share with the prospective groom deficiencies in the character of the bride since many aspects of the character of hidden marks and sighs no this is not at all wise none of us is exempted from having shortcomings and flaws in our character so imagine me going to a woman wanting to propose to her and in the presence of her father we start chit chatting and she's liking what she sees and then I say listen I snore when I sleep and I get very angry when my wife does not do this or that and I don't like to lend people money and I also I'm not a very social person so I may not go to visit in-laws a lot if any and I don't like eating at restaurants what am i doing I'm trying to scare her away and I will definitely succeed in that this is not logical it's not logical for a woman to say listen that I'm not a very good cook I do this I do that and she tells me all about her shortcomings and these are not serious but these are not the things you wanna say in an interview as an former HR Human Resources director when someone sits in an interview and he says I am a bit lazy I don't know how to type quickly sometimes I get agitated when someone jokes with me so in a team I may not be pretty immediately I said nice meeting you kiddo because this is what he's telling me he's telling me that he's no good no you have to pitch for yourself and try to show that you are a good person while trying to fix these shortcomings and being a better man than you look or a better woman that you look but to give up front all of your sins and mistakes and shortcomings this is another all advisor"
