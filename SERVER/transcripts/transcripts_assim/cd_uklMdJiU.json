  "title": "Special reward for praying in Rawdah in Madinah ( Riyad ul jannah)? #assimalhakeem assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question is regarding the in Medina is there a special award for praying inside or duas we them inside the that is my the prophet s wasam said between my house and my member is that's why they call it a garden of The Gardens of paradise so some people said that this area was extracted from Paradise and put there some people say that praying in this area would lead you to the paradise in the Hereafter and some people said that due to the closeness of the first draw and to the member and to the prophet it indicates that it should draw you closer to Jenna because of your keenness to pray there and to be there the first to come is there any specific reward for praying two raas there not that I know of and the way the people come and fight just to pray stay there and to sit there and consider it to be something of of great importance I fail to find a justification for that so what the people are doing I believe that it is not right yes the area itself the closer you are to the first raw and sometimes people sit there and insist on sitting there and leave the front rows next to the member and this is also not correct at all because that area is far greater and important than the uh um area where the carpet's color is changed because it's closer to the first row or it is part of the first row and Allah Knows Best"
