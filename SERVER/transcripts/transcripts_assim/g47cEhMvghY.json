  "transcript": "i'm the summit from saudi arabia he says that he has problems while reciting the quran and sometimes his ocd is so strong that he may stop at a particular letter because it is he's unable to pronounce it correctly and he may repeat it so he says in so he says does this invalidate my prayer the answer is no it does not invalidate your prayer he says because i feel that i am like mocking the quran that's a good feeling mocking the quran no no no that you recognize it's a feeling i always get the question sheikh what's the ruling if i sit on the bed while my brother is sitting on the floor and he's reciting the quran do i leave the fold of islam because this is mocking the quran i'm asking you are you mocking the quran said by allah no i'm just lying on my bed then why do you say do i leave the fold of islam coming to you at the summit when you repeat a letter or repronounce a word so that you perfect it are you mocking the quran do you intend to do that then why are you allowing shaytaan to mess with your head like this big time so definitely this has nothing to do with mocking the quran and it does not impact your prayer"
