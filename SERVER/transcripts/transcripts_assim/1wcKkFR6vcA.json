  "transcript": "what's the ruling on giving zakat to trustworthy charity organizations if they are trustworthy they're knowledgeable and you know that they'll utilize your zakat money and spend it lawfully then there's no problem in that because you're giving them the power of attorney to act on your behalf and they're trustworthy what is not permissible is to give your zakat to organizations that don't have a clear agenda meaning they're not knowledgeable they're not students of knowledge and most likely they would simply go and give your zakat to non-muslims they would contribute with your zakat in building hospitals or building masjids or doing orphanages and all of these are not one of the eight categories mentioned in verse 60 in surat chapter 9 where allah indicates to us the eight categories that may be recipients of the zakat money so if they are trustworthy as you have described then there's no problem in giving them your zakat insha allah"
