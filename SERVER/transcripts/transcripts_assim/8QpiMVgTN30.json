  "title": "What does Tahiyatul masjid mean and where did this name come from? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "and the Prophet had said that I saw Salaam whenever some of you or one of you enters the Masjid he must not sit down until he prays two rakahs now if you look at all the Hadees you will never ever find the description of the Haga tool message it though we know that the prayer is called salat the hated machine so where did the name come from the name came from the scholars who looked into the hadith and wanted to give a description to these prayers and this description misled some of the Muslims to think that these two rakahs are a particular set of rakahs that are intended for themselves and this led them to think that if I enter a message it I have to pray 2 rakats the hatin machine then I have to pray another two rakahs for the Sunnah of fudger for example if it's Fajr prayer this is wrong the Prophet said is a Salam whenever you enter a message just pray any two random ruckus which means that if I enter a Masjid and I make wudu I come into the Masjid I pray a set of torah cos only this would suffice for the hated math this would suffice for the heya - Ludo because I just made Google and this would suffice for soon a tell fetcher if I intended that this is so not affect the rest I do not need to intend it it comes by default"
