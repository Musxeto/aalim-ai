  "title": "Where to place the hands in salah while standing? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "raise my hands the Sunnah is to put the right hand over the left hand on the chest as per the hadith of wa-l even Hodor may Allah be pleased with him and this was a confirmed sunnah of the prophet alayhi salatu salam to place the right hand over the left on the chest well the chest itself is an issue of dispute because some authenticate the hadith some don't and those who don't differ whether to put it on the belly or to put it underneath the belly but the most authentic is to put it on the chest it's from here to here so you put the right hand on the left hand on this chest while in the standing position because the hadith when describing the prophets pray or allah√≠s OTO Salaam they used to say that he used to put the right on the left hand in the standing position I place my right hand over the left hand on the chest and there are two ways of doing this look at my fingers this is my wrist my palm and my arm it's in between like this so this is one way of doing it the other way which is also authentic of doing it is grabbing my wrist like this so I'm grabbing it some people want to make something in between so they do this and this is wrong either you put the whole palm of your hand with the fingers on the arm wrist and hand or you simply grab your wrist left wrist like this so what people do like this is totally wrong some brothers from Africa do this they tilt themselves what are you doing they said we're preserving the heart when was the last time you took an x-ray maybe your heart is on the right then we have a problem where are you getting this from the sunna is to stand idle in the middle not to the left not to the right as a prophet used to pray alehissalaam"
