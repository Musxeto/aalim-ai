  "transcript": "begin place with reciting what is the evidence for the six pillars of belief okay none the proof of the six pillars of build of of Islam this is another one lost behind over to ila where he says righteousness albiric is not that the eternia fish 20 is and the West in prayer but rather righteousness al beer is for the one who believes in Allah and the larvae and the angels and the books of a prophet okay before that we would like to mention the last two pillars that we could not mention so we begin by bismillah r-rahman r-rahim al-hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik ala muhammad until allah be the begin imagining wasabi hedge rain am added in the hadith of gibreel peace be upon him when he came in the form of a man to the prophet alayhi salat wa sallam asking him about four specific topics what is Islam what is Eman what is X an and what are the signs of the Day of Judgment the time and the site so we spoke about Islam and its five pillars we also talked about Eman and it's six pillars so to believe in Allah to believe in the angels to believe in the scriptures and to believe in the messengers and we talked and explained all of these now there are two pillars remaining to believe in the day of judgment or in the last day and the last day is the day of reckoning all what we do in this world is reflected on the last day and the last day is the essence of the belief of Muslims those who do not believe in the last day they're not Muslims those who fail to fulfill their belief in the last day and to transform it into actions they're not real believers and the concept of the last day is found in all religions and specifically the religions that are from allah azzawajal so you'll find the concept of the last day present whenever you hear anything from the religion of Prophet nor Ibrahim Mousa Lisa and the other prophets of hood for example of Salah of Shrine of the wood of Solomon of Ayub all the messengers and prophets of Allah dodging all revolved around the issue of believing in Allah and the day of judgment the vast majority of hadith highlight this if you listen to the verses of the Quran you will find this many many places so what is to believe in the last day what does it include first of all you cannot reach the last day without being resurrected so part of believing in the last day is to believe that all people who had died they will be resurrected they will be risen from the dead that there will come a time when all those who lived on earth will die and this is the first blow and the second blow of the trumpet is when everybody would rise from the dead and they will be resurrected so resurrection is inevitable unlike religions that say that there is nothing after death such as the idol worshipers one of the tyrants from the idol worshipers and his name is alwa 11 alas or a swoon while a semi came to the prophet alayhi salatu salam and he said while holding a piece of old bone and crushing it and making it turn into dust he says if I die and I become like this bone Allah would resurrect me and he's saying this not to ask to inquire or to find an answer to his question rather to mock and joke about Islam so the Prophet said to him I said yes and after that he will introduce you and admit you to Hellfire so the concept of resurrection a lot of the people who lack logic and lack Eman rejected it said how is it possible that after we die in decay and we turn into dust that allah azzawajal easier access Subhan Allah do you think that this is difficult to make you up from something you were or is it more difficult to create you from nothing to create you from vacuum what's more difficult to manufacture and invent a car from scratch or to renovate an old car by removing the dust and give it giving it a new paint job and fixing some of the broken things but people don't think so resurrection is much easier than creating something from scratch though nothing is difficult to a large the water but this is to go down to the level of these people who reject the concept of allah azzawajal re directing human beings after the death so deliberately the belief in Allah and the day of judgment or the belief in the last day includes that you believe in resurrection secondly it includes that after resurrection there would be accountability and this is why resurrection is there imagine someone who has committed heinous sins in his life he killed so many people he raped so many women he took the money in the millions he lied he cheated he embezzled he did things that are beyond imagination would it be possible for a Las wisdom to let this person run away with all what he had done and how would that be fair compared to others who prayed and fasted and given the card who had never ever cheated or lied or done anything wrong or break only and they did never break the law and they were trying to be good citizens can it be that both of them have the same ending no accountability they would think to themselves that we we're at loss if there is no accountability why are we praying why are we doing good deeds why are we stopping ourselves from doing whatever we want this doesn't make any sense so Alma's fairness and wisdom dictate that there has to be a day of reckoning and if you'd read the Quran you will find that allah azza wajal talks about this a lot when he says in Elena Yahoo come in Alena hi Szabo home to us they shall return and after that we shall hold them accountable Allah says whoever does a good deed he will be rewarded tenfold when a woman and whoever does a bad deed he will not be held accountable except for a bad deed similar to it Allah says about erecting the scales where the good days and the bad days would be weighed so that not even a mustard seed would be unaccounted for everything is accounted for and mentioned and there are a number of hadith that support this but we don't want to go into details the greatest hadith known which is when allah azza wajal brings the believer and covers the believer from all the people and he shows him his deeds do you remember the sin you remember the sin do you remember the sin and the believer says yes my lord until he shows him all of his sins and when the servant of Allah believes that he's done for it he's doomed allah azza wajal says to him i have covered it for you concealed it for you on earth and today I forgive it for you and he's then handed his book in his right hand while the disbelievers and the hypocrites they are called publicly where everybody can see and hear that may Allah curse them the curse of allah azzawajal is on the wrongdoers and the transgressors those this shows you that the day of well the last day in is included in it after the resurrection the accountability and to know what good deeds and what bad deeds a person had done so number one resurrection number two accountability what's next number three which is the belief in heaven and hell and if you do not believe in heaven and hell then you do not believe in the last day which means that you don't have belief in your heart and you're not a Muslim how is that when you're hot when you're held accountable what's the reason so that you'll either be rewarded or tormented and this takes face in paradise or in hell all what you read in the Quran is accountability reward or punishment reward or punishment so some scholars say that the Quran is divided into three types didn't the Prophet Allah say that cool whoo Allahu Ahad is equivalent to one third of the Quran and whoever recites it three times as if he recited the whole Quran this is an authentic hadith now the issue is why is it one third of the Quran scholars say one third of the Quran talks about a Las beautiful names and attributes so it tells us about allah azzawajal when you read the quran you learn about Allah subhana WA Ta'ala the second third of the Quran is stories about the messengers of allah azza wajal and their Dawa and of those who obeyed them and they went to Jenna and those who disobeyed them and went to hell so you'll find the description of the struggle of the prophets and messengers in the Quran alongside with what Allah has prepared for his believers for his servants what Allah Allah has prepared in terms of paradise of favours of Allah Azza WA JAL the Prophet says alayhi salat WA Salam Allah says in the hood see hadith I have prepared to my servants what no I had seen no ear had heard of and it never crossed the heart of a human being so this is Jenna we have so many hadith talking about the different types of Nayeem a favor of enjoyment in it and likewise we have a lot talking about Hellfire and what Allah has prepared for the people of Hell and how they would suffer and how they would see the things that they claim to be false come into reality and they would be tormented till the day of no ending which is eternity and the third third of the Quran is about rulings of Allah's religion of prayer of fasting the do's and the don'ts so this is roughly what some scholars say that the Quran is composed of therefore the belief in heaven and hell the belief in paradise and Hellfire is part of the belief of the last day now everyone who had read the Quran understand this well but there are more things related to the belief of the day or the last day for example the questioning in your grave because once you die you leave this world and you enter the world of the Barossa which is part of the world of the because there's no going back to this dunya and you have to believe that that is questioning in the grave and guess what the three questions you will be asked in your grave are these atha atha to us all that we studying who's your Lord what is your religion who's this man who was sent to you and whoever manages to answer these questions correctly then he would be most likely among those who would prosper and succeed and whoever fails he will be among those who are doomed may Allah protect us so believing in the questioning and it's called fitna - and hablar when the two angels moon Caruana kir come in a horrible scene to ask and interrogate in a very rough and tough manner only those who allah make them steadfast will be able to answer and pass also as a result there will be torment of the grave if you fail or even if you succeed there will there will be torment of the grave according to the sins that you had done when you were alive and there will be blessing and favours of Allah for those who were righteous and did good deeds so the grave can be a pit of hellfire and it can be widened to be a garden of paradise we know that the believer after passing the exam and answering the questions is shown his seat in gender and a window is open to gender where he gets its coolness and breeze and fragrances from it and he would be also shown his seat in Hellfire and he would be given the glad tidings this is this was supposed to be your seat and Hellfire Allah has replaced it with a seat of Jenna another seat for you while the disbeliever would be shown his seat in paradise and he would be told this is this was supposed to be your seat in paradise allah has substituted you with a seat in hellfire and he will get the heat and the steam from that window opened to Hellfire now one may ask how is it possible that I passed the test and I answer the three questions yet I am tormented in my grave the torment of the grave is not related to how a good Muslim you are or not the torment of the grave takes place due to a number of sins that you've committed and it is not related to your going to hell or not on the day of judgment which means that the norm is those who pay for their sins particular sins such as backbiting such as slandering such as not cleaning oneself from urine after urinating or impurities and the Jazz on his clothes among other things if a person does these things when he was alive he will be tormented on or in his grave now having said that there is a big possibility that when the day of judgement is do when he is resurrected he goes straight to paradise he's not held accountable but there also can be people in their graves who are not tormented because they didn't do any of these things that require torment in the grave but on the day of judgment they have other sins that we they will have to pay for and they might go to hell for some time and then saved to paradise now there are so many things related to grave torment and enjoyment depending are you a bad Muslim or a good Muslim or a Muslim or a non-muslim but the time is not sufficient to expand on that yet it is important to understand that the belief in the torment of the grave is part of our Eman is part of believing in the last day and this is why almost every Muslim before concluding his salat would always recite the dua Allah who manaro to become inaudible Jahannam women either bilhuber women written until mejia well mammoth women fit neatly Allen Messi hit the gel so seeking refuge in allah azzawajal from the torment of the grave is something that all muslims agreeable upon with the exception of some deviant sects like el martes allah and the Hawara CH who say that this is not realistic we place a man in his grave and after a few days we dig him up and there's nothing on his body there are no torture marks or burns or any of this sort so we don't believe that how is it possible for a man to be seated in a grave where he's in a coffin or he's buried how this is not logical subhanAllah how easy it is for such ignorant people to destroy their own selves with their own hands when you look logically if we don't want logic or an in the Sunnah is our evidence we don't need to logic things we have Khurana Swindon so you guys are crazy how do you say things with your own logic it's exactly like shape on it is exactly like Satan why did you not prostrate to Adam as I've instructed you to do so Allah says he says this is not logical I am better than him you created me from fire and created him from clay fire is a superior manner or material or whatever it is not logical for me to prostrate to him so he used his logic against Allah's commands and these people used their logic which is illogical against Allah's commands in the Quran and the prophets hadith alayhi salat wa sallam one would say but check they may have a point I say Aki they don't have a point you're a Muslim you should submit your will to whatever the Prophet Isis and tells you to and I'll give you a logical explanation two people are sleeping there on their beds on their mattresses nothing seems so peculiar all of a sudden after they wake up one of them tells us about the places he had been in his dreams I've been to Gardens to rivers I've seen many beautiful women serving me I used to drink and eat while I was in heaven while the other one says I had the worst nightmare in my life I was chased by lions and tigers and fell in a pit filled with scorpions and snakes managed to swim in a swamp with alligators and each are taking a bite of my body I was shouting and screaming and sweating and in great pain then I woke up and you seemed to be amazed both of them were sleeping in front of me and I could not tell that one was having the time and the joy of his life and the other one was being tormented and punished the grave is far easier than this and again and again and again we measure things in three dimension in the length the width and the height while things after this life are measured in different dimensions so there is a fourth dimension a fifth dimension a tenth dimension that we cannot comprehend and do not know of so it's totally wrong to measure things of the world of Barza or of the world of the hereafter compared to the standards we have in this world so what are the benefits of believing in the day of the last day well there are so many benefits first you are pushed and encouraged to do more good deeds and to offer a forms of worship trying your level best to attain the reward of that day and also it helps you to refrain from doing sins now if I know that if I do something specific that Allah social will throw me in hell would I do it definitely not if I have honey that I know that there is poison in it but it tastes mighty well would I taste it eat it definitely definitely not my knowledge that there is a day of reckoning there is a day of judgment makes me refrain from Haram and encourages me to do halal and among the benefits of your our belief in the Day of Judgment is that it helps us take calamities in a better way so many times people think Allah have wasted my time look at my friend he's a multimillionaire look at my friend he has this in that position Authority what do I have after all of these years that I've spent in my life what do I have when you believe in the last day it will comfort you to know that okay let them enjoy their wealth let them enjoy their power let people enjoy their health I will enjoy the Hereafter insha Allah because I've always stayed away from sin and I've done as many good deeds as I can and my heart is clean it has no hatred or Envy or does not hold any grudges against others so I'm confident that on the day of judgment allah azzawajal would make me happy and the things can go on and on and on of course there are people who have denied all of this and this comes from their disbelief in a large division like atheists like Hindus and other deviants X who believe in reincarnation so they believe that there is no day of judgment we die and we are reincarnated in someone's else body if we do well we will be healthy people if we do bad we will be reincarnated in sick people or insects or in and I remember once I was talking to one of the Guru's deviant sex is one of the 72 sects in Islam they claimed their Muslims but they're not so he was telling me that he's dirty etc from Lebanon and I was talking him about the issue of reincarnation and he says that yeah this is what we believe and subhanAllah I love going to the beach I love surfing and and skiing and swimming and scuba diving so I said to him maybe you were a fish in a previous life do you remember anything of that so the guy smiled and well actually he laughed and he understood what I was aiming at no one bill no one knows what he was in a previous life and definitely it is not logical that people would turn into insects or animals or monkeys when they reincarnated in a different life and why would an animal do good things and become human in the other life because with this logic everybody should be animals for good animals cannot promoted to human beings because this their second life can't be better they're animals what good did they do to deserve to T to become human beings but these people don't think they don't have any logic they don't have anything to hold on to and allah azzawajal knows best we have the last pillar but this one might take some time so I think we will postpone it to our following class and now we make a charlotta vote the remaining time to questions if we have in now my fellowship we have just a few questions the first one is the malecon brother what if I ask for forgiveness for all the things such as about biting and slandering will I be tormented in my grave first of all sins are divided into two types or more the main parts are the sins between you and Allah so whatever you transgress against yourself between you and Allah if I watch pornography if I drink intoxicants if I miss salat if I curse and swear a lot this is between me and allah azza wajal Allah may forgive and allah may hold me accountable for every single thing and there are sins that are between me and others so if price i take someone's money if i beat someone up if i lie to someone if i backbite him if i slander him these sins between us must be cleared in this life why prophet alayhi salatu salam says in an authentic hadith whoever holds something against his brother or his brother holds something against him you guys must clear it up in this life before the day of judgement why because on the day of judgement there is no dirham ordinary meaning there are no niara no euros no dollars no currencies you can buy your way out with there is no dirham no or dinar there is only good deeds and bad deeds so if you've wronged someone you would have to give him from your good deeds in an authentic hadith the Prophet Allah so someone's asked his companions do you know who is a loof list which translates to someone who is stone broke someone does not have a thing so do you know who is that so the Companions said yeah a person who doesn't have dinner they're ham or dinner a person who is poor doesn't have a bank account doesn't have any money in his wallet so the Prophet said I said no a broke person is a person who comes on the day of judgment with prayers fasting and charity but he had beaten bits one shed the blood of this one cursed this one slandered this one so he comes on the day of judgment and he gives from his good deeds to those whom he had wronged to compensate them and if his good deeds are over before finishing compensating them he will take from their sins add it upon his own sins and then he would be thrown in Hellfire so the issue of wronging others of slandering others is not an easy thing it is something that you will have to pay for therefore if you have something against cher Hassan for example I said bad words about him I said that he is what they would do they say on Twitter petrodollar share or share $4 or he is a boot kisser or he is milkshake or he is this and people are insulting me slandering me on Twitter I could care less who cares do you think that I'm saying what I'm saying just to please the masses and make them happy I could have been that it's just man on earth if I wanted to do that all what I care is to convey what I believe what do you like it or not who gives a whatever so if you did this I'm okay with it because you're not man enough to come and say to my face but on the day of judgement it's the day of reckoning this is the day with well I will start to harvest and gain good deeds from people and I will build a lot of glory with their good deeds hamdulillah so what to do share you have to ask for for forgiveness so if I come to you and say share I did wrong and I said bad things and I'm remorseful please forgive me what do you think I'm gonna do hell no man I'm gonna sue you and I'm gonna take every good deed you have on the day of judgment I wouldn't not say that I would say Ya Allah forgive you because I will still be rewarded for that humdinger but if you fear that if you come to me I would escalate things as in the case of for example if you go to your best friend whom you had back bitten and you say um Mohammed listen man you're my best friend for like 20 years the other day I didn't control myself and I said this and this and this about you and the guy is outraged what you say this about me after all these years and he swears and curses and stops all communication with me forever for good I try to send people to him I tried to extend him gifts like nothing the guy is totally blocked so the scholars say you have to weigh the consequences if you feel that by telling him about the sins and asking for forgiveness that would add more fuel to the fire and would be more harmful don't do that because there's no point of creating more trouble and instead ask Allah for forgiveness depend to Allah be remorseful whatever his name is mentioned when he's not around praise him with good things in him say that he is generous he is a good man this that which is true not false don't lie if you can't go to him and say in a diplomatic way ah he yeah he sometimes we feel we can speak about others without thinking and we all do this so I just want to get it off my chest if you a man had ever said anything bad about me I forgive you for the sake of Allah and I hope that if I had ever hypothetically said anything bad about you that you also forgive me he wouldn't media say yeah okay I'll forgive you so you don't have to specify sittin yeah I spoke about your wife and I said bad things I said nasty things about her and did this and did that no don't go that Lane and a large surgeon knows best now Michelle s radical a sickness question in America what is the holy non image stored on phones or computers without being printed these images are not fixed and cannot be shown except by means of equipment such as online computers walaikum assalam wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh images are of two types a type that you create so if I get my pen and I start drawing something whether on my iPad or on a piece of piece of paper I am creating it whether electronically or actual drawing this is one of the major sins in Islam the Prophet said alayhi salatu was-salam I should do nasiha dabin yomel qiyamah al-mussawi rune the most severely tormented segment of people on the day of judgment are those who draw weather pictures or make statues the word is moussah women anyone who makes images and this refers to 2d and to 3d 3d there is no differences of opinion among scholars they all agree that making statues sculptures of living creatures such as humans animals fish birds insects all of this is totally prohibited and Haram and falls under this threat of the Prophet Elisha la tercera 2d meaning drawing on a piece of paper is an issue of dispute the majority say it is included in the prohibition and it is also Haram so this is category number one of image making category number two is taking an image that I have no influence over like snapping pictures when I snap a picture of myself and put it on Twitter and I get people asking me on Twitter share what's the ruling on snapping photos question mark and then he continues to say and if it is permissible Haram why are you posting your picture okay are you asking me so you ask the first question I understand I'll answer you but then you start attacking me and saying why do you do this no you should use your common sense if I publish my picture this means that I think and believe it's Halle unless you think of me as a hypocrite and you want to expose me to the people by asking such a very very stupid question with all due respect then so assuming that you're asking the first question only when I take a photograph am i creating something similar to a las creation like a person drawing a port trade so I get someone for a painting davinci for example when he comes and draws the Mona Lisa that was a real person you look at the paintings wow this is nice is this Allis creation is this him analyse itself no he's mimicking he's imitating and this question in this case this person is among those who will be tormented on the on the day of judgement the Prophet said that I saw some part of their torment is Allah would order them to give life to such portraits to such drawings to such animations and they want so they will be tormented by it allowed put life at and it will torment them in Hellfire so when you take a picture or a photograph you're not imitating the creation of Allah because if I see my photo and someone says what is this people would say this is you share ah so this is the creation of Allah it's like when someone says can you sign this check and I sign the check and he goes and makes a Xerox copy out of it and he brings the original and the Xerox and he says whose signature is this on the Xerox would I say it's not mine mine is on the check this is not mine or would I say this is my signature so when we take photos we do not imitate or replicate the creation of Allah this is the creation of Allah it's like looking into a mirror a reflection of light so this is me but what you see on your mobile screens or your computer screens are fear Allah this is not the creation this is shehas it's the same thing the same features the same person so when we come to image making keeping the photos of people on your mobile phones or on your PDAs or on your computers is fine with the exception of two things photos of women grown-up women and photos of deceased why sure these are the creation of Allah I know it is not permissible for women to be photographed or filmed unless there's an urgent need for that such as documents for an ID card or a passport or the likes but why share because women are bound or are obliged to wear the hijab and exposing themselves on a camera or a mobile phone or a computer defies the purpose of hijab share I'll be the only one looking at it it's my own photo or is my wife's photos or my daughter's photos I'm the owner of the device I know but you know if you have the knowledge that any electronic device whether camera or a mobile or a computer even if the hard disk was formatted everything was erased reset it to the factory defaults it can still be retrieved and I have encountered this myself with totally formatted and erased laptops being restored and retrieving all the photo private photos family photos of people who sold their laptop as a secondhand device after being ensured that everything was erased it was it can never be erased so this is why we tell sisters and they hate this I know but this is what we believe that Eliza would would want you to do according to the knowledge that we have and also keeping the photos of the deceased is not permissible because scholars say that the origin of started from that from building statues over the people that belonged the righteous people that belonged to the people of north and after that the generation was over and gone they started worshipping that and  started from that we know that families after the death of their father go to the portrait hung on the wall after few years and speak to the father Oh daddy I wish you were here to help us solve our problems our brothers are fighting over the inheritance and the property and we are in real big troubles where are you daddy and he's speaking to the dead and without doubt this form of sugar so this is in a nutshell what I believe analyze of journals best Charlotte American logic discipline love Aaron I think we'll stop here for today Charla and Sundays young made me large division and I pray to Allah that Allah would benefit us from what we hear and say how Allahu Alem when especially meaning Haslem sallallahu wasallam Barnaby and Muhammad while anniversary as main wassalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
