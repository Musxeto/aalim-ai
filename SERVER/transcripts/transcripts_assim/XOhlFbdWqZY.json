  "transcript": "SH I had a question regarding uh salat dba. Um and now my question is uh is it permissible to read salat um more than once? Because sometimes after I read my five daily prayers such as salat zur I may uh I finish salat then I'll read salata and then uh sometimes whenever I'm free or I've got nothing to do I'll read salat toba. Is it permissible for me to do this? No it's not permissible. Salat toba is a prayer that we offer when we've committed a sin and we would like to repent from it. So we offer this and ask Allah for forgiveness. When we do it on daily basis or after a particular fault prayer this becomes an innovation because now I'm just saying oh yeah I'm going to pray salah toba for what? Oh I've got so many sins. So what are you praying it for? I don't know just asking Allah for forgiveness. No, this doesn't work like that and becomes an innovation if you do this on regular basis and Allah knows best."
