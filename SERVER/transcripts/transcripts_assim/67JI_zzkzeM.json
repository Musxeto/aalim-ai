  "transcript": "Okay, the next question is, my family members believe that taweez or the amulet is giving them protection against jinns. They tie it around their waist and keep it under their pillow. Can you please explain if this is shirk and what are the consequences? These are healing processes mentioned in the Qur'an and Sunnah. This is shar'i. Number two, healing process through medication known through experiment and science. This is shirk that takes a person out of Islam."
