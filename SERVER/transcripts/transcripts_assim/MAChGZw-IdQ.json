  "title": "Long hadith on intention the martyr, scholar and charitable person",
  "transcript": "Listen to this hadith reported by Imam Muslim in the Sahih. The Prophet said Alayhis Salatu Wassalam the first to be judged on the day of judgment will be a man who had died as a martyr. So this guy is a martyr. He died on the battlefield. He will be brought forward. Allah will remind him of the favours he had bestowed upon him and the man will acknowledge. Then he will ask him what did you do to express gratitude for it? The man replies I fought for your cause till I was killed. Allah Azza Wa Jal says you have lied. You fought so that people might call you courageous and brave and they have done so and then Allah will give the command to pull him on his face and throw him in hellfire. This is the first one to be held accountable on the day of judgment. Next the Prophet says Alayhis Salatu Wassalam a man who had acquired and imparted knowledge and read the Quran. He will be brought forward. Allah will show him his favours and blessing upon him and the man acknowledges that yes you Allah gave all of this to me. Then Allah will ask what did you do to express gratitude for it? The man will say I acquired knowledge and taught it and taught it and read the Quran for your sake. I was spending six hours in the masjid doing tahfiz. I was answering people's inquiries and teaching them only for your sake. Allah Azza Wa Jal would say you have lied. You acquired knowledge so that people might call you a learned man and you read the Quran so that they might call you a reciter and they have done so and Allah would command that he would be pulled on his face and thrown into hellfire. Next the Prophet says Alayhis Salatu Wassalam a man who Allah had made affluent and to whom Allah has given plenty of wealth. Plenty of money like so many businessmen we have. He will be brought forward. Allah would show him his favours and blessings upon him in the dunya. The man would acknowledge that Allah has given this all to him. Then Allah would say what did you do to express gratitude? The man would reply I did not neglect any of the ways you liked wealth to be spent liberally for your sake. I gave left right and center anywhere that you love. I spent all of my wealth and Allah will say you have lied. You did it so that people might call you generous and they have done so. Then he will command that he will be dragged on his face and thrown into hell. Servants of Allah if this martyr scholar and charitable generous person is treated in such a fashion on the day of judgment just because their intention was not sincere and pure for Allah. Do we guarantee that what we do is sincere? Isn't sincerity, isn't al-ikhlas, isn't intention the most important thing that we should rectify 24 hours seven days a week? Don't care about covid, don't care about illnesses, don't care about your business, don't care about how many umrahs you've done, how many rakahs you've prayed, how many fasts you've made. Care about will Allah accept from me or not?"
