  "transcript": "the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam humbled himself before Allah whenever he did these acts of worship so for example he used to say that I feel like a cloud is surrounding my heart and I ask Allah for forgiveness more than aund times a day and he was the one whom Allah forgave his previous and upcoming sins yet he constant L keep on remembering Allah asking Allah for forgiveness repenting to Allah subhanahu waala as for his recitation of the Quran it was the best of all people the prophet Salli wasallam as um Sal tells us he used to stop at the end of every verse so he used to say ald and stop and stop and stop this is how described his recitation at each and every Ayah he would stop and the prophet sallallah Al wasallam when he used to recite the Quran he used to do it sometimes silently sometimes loudly and he used to make it in between and this shows us that the prophet did not limit us to one way or the other uman says I used to hear the prophet's recitation from my room which means that sometimes he would raise his voice and this is also a Sunnah because sometimes if you don't Raise Your Voice you would lose concentration and if you continue to recite silently all the time you may not be able to contemplate upon the Quran the way of the prophet in reciting was slow and with a lot of submissiveness and you would hear his recitation and you would know that the the person reciting it knows exactly what he is reciting and this is called a so to do the T when you recite the Quran and to contemplate is far better than reciting it in a very quick fashion seeking quantity and disregarding quality IB Abbas a man came to him and said I recite the Quran so fast that I finish it in 3 days IB Abbas said to me I'd rather recite only one chapter per night like Surah Bak slowly and contemplating upon it that would be far greater to me than to recite it as you have just described and the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam would recite the Quran and beautify his voice with it in a very nice fashion and this is the Sunnah when you recite the Quran you try to beautify your voice with it and you try to do what the prophet used to do the wavering tone and this type of recitation is to recite the uh uh suras of the Quran and you play with your voice in a way that it was beautify [Music] it this is called the way of wavering it or when you say see the wavering this is one way of saying it and it beautifies your voice with the Quran that would leave a huge impact upon the people listening to it and they would feel a profound impact to your recitation Abu musari was one of those whom may Allah be pleased with him recited the Quran in a very very nice way and the prophet used to listen to it in say to him that this way of recitation was so beautiful if you heard saw us last night Abu Musa we passed by your home when you were reciting the Quran and we just paused there and listen to it you were giving some of the pipes of dahud peace be upon him and Abu Musa said had I known you were listening of prophet Alam I would have beautified it even more for your sake so this shows us that beautifying your voice to impress others with the Quran is not an act of showing off because your intention is to beautify your voice with the Quran so that you would make it more appealing to them and make them closer to Allah which is something that Allah loves"
