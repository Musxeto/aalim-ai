  "transcript": "is from Mahmoud Mahmoud says is it permissible to eat raw seafood or raw meat the answer is yes there is nothing Haram in eating Suchi for example unless they put alcohol in it if it's alcohol free and it's only raw seafood there's no problem in that so many of us eat raw salmon for breakfast with some cheese and some vegetables in a toast or whatever so this is permissible providing it is not harmful when there is a possibility of it being harmful or poisonous or may cause medical problems then in this case it becomes Haram and Allah azzawajal Knows Best"
