  "transcript": "do we have brother ali from pakistan the first advice one is i'm beginning to learn arabic some people have advised that i should just start with the basics and focus on quran because that's what i want to learn it for and i should just focus on reading and understanding and forget about speaking and learning to write at the moment so i equip myself enough to understand what the imam is saying is this a good approach okay so ali from pakistan has two questions the first one is about learning arabic and to me as a native it's difficult for me to tell you what's the best way because i speak arabic since birth so i didn't go through the process of learning arabic like non-arabs did so i won't be able to pinpoint what's best however logically speaking and as a person who's bilingual and trying to learn more languages i tell you that it depends on what you're going to do with the language if i were to learn spanish trying to write speak read and listen is a comprehensive process but in my agent lack of time might be difficult so i would rather just listen understand and that's enough to be able to understand that felice is happy that's more than good for me how to spell it don't ask me when to use esther and the other verb to be it's a little bit difficult but i have a vague idea of it if i had the time i would say no if you want to do real proper learning of english of arabic and become a student of knowledge you have to do more than that as for now you know your conditions and you know the time span you have if you don't have a lot of time then yes reading the quran listening and understanding it does the job but if you have time and if you're young and you have the ability and the enthusiasm i said no you have to take the whole thing from the beginning from scratch and one of the best ways of doing this is reading newspapers daily newspapers so you know exactly what had happened in france and the spread of the omicron virus and a hundred or two hundred thousand cases a day and when you read it in arabic you may know two or three words and miss one or two but because you know what it is about you'll figure out the other two words that you did not understand and bit by bit you'll find that whoa now i'm learning i know what this word means through intuition and experience not because i've read it in the dictionary and also listening to news um radio in arabic news programs so also this adds value is global coming from saudi arabia with a hadith with programs beneficial adds to your vocabulary that's your knowledge so you have to do this depending on your situation you"
