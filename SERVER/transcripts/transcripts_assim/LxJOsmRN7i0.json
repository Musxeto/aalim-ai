  "transcript": "Fifthly, calamities reveal our true identity. We, to the people, are good people. Only calamities expose us and show us do we walk the talk? We all, Masha Allah, say good words, Islam, we have to defend Islam, we have to preach Islam, we have to fear Allah Azza Wa Jal, but when you test me on my rizq, when my income is threatened, when I get a very hefty, big fat check just to compromise the Deen, Sheikh, I divorced my wife 75 times and I would like to get back to her. I said, haram, three times is enough and the rest is a bonus. What is this? Are you AK-47? This is divorce? What is this? You're playing with Allah's Zikr? Sheikh, I love my wife and this is a check of $500,000 just in case. Well, this is the difference of the opinion of scholars. We will talk. Let's go for dinner. Watch out. This is where Allah exposes you. How many of us were exposed when business transaction was at risk and we had to give bribes or we have to take bribes or we had to cheat, we had to lie, we had to do this and that. Allah says in the Quran, do people, and this is in the beginning of Surat Al-Ankabut, the spider, do people think that they will be left alone because they say we believe and will not be tested? And we indeed tested those who were before them and Allah will certainly make it known the truth of those who are true and will certainly make it known the falsehood of those who are liars. Allah exposes us in this life."
