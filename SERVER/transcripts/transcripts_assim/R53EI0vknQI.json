  "transcript": "And our first caller is Sam from Canada. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. How are you Sheikh? I'm doing great Alhamdulillah. How can I help you? Alhamdulillah Sheikh, my question is what is your advice for people who live in America, Canada or the West? Sometimes they get fed up and say that they're never going to find a righteous spouse or they say the culture is not same. Like back home the parents are not available, it's hard to reach them and they give up. How do we give them hope that this is not the case? Akhi, first of all, putting obstacles and being negative is everybody's game and toy. Everybody can put obstacles that blocks them from progressing and moving forward. Complaining and whining and putting excuses would never ever help you as an individual or the ummah at large. I've done counseling with the grace of Allah for so many people in Canada, in America, in Europe and I tell you that there are so many great women there waiting for the right shooter and so many great men waiting for the right woman to choose. But they need to look and as I said before, if I had the chance and the time and the effort, I would have done this, but I don't have the time nor the mental ability to take such a responsibility. I know that there are a lot of matrimonial websites that are Islamic, that the founders of it are trying their level best to walk the talk, no photographs of women, no matchmaking in Islamic dating. As they say, it's all legit, only the guardian can intervene and be the mediator between the two. But you have to look, you have to do your due diligence and make a lot of dua and keep your hopes up high and Allah would grant you according to your positivity."
