  "transcript": "Miriam says is it mandatory to reply to Salam on text messages in a group or individually the answer is that it's an issue of dispute most likely it is best to reply for Salam if it's individually someone sends me a text message it is best to say while he comes salam wa ha too long but is it mandatory I am inclined that it is not especially in Twitter in Facebook sometimes I sit on Twitter for an hour and I get like maybe a hundred two hundred questions and when everyone asks me and says assalamu alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh cher you just you reply and say why they can sounds love barakato I would maybe answer five or ten questions but if I don't and if I skipped the reply of the Salam and I answer the questions I would probably cover like sixty or a hundred so which is more feasible definitely not to answer as the question or the Salam was not addressed to me specifically especially in such platforms and Allah knows best"
