  "title": "Is it mandatory by Saudi Universities for a woman to come with her male mahram? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "finally says is it a prerequisite for islamic universities in saudi arabia for a woman to come with a mahram to my knowledge this used to be a precondition now has things changed i have no idea you have to go to their website and inquire but islamically you're not allowed to travel without a mahram so there has to be a mahram accompanying you on the airplane now if a mahram comes with you to makkah or to medina puts you in a hostel and ensures that you are in a safe dorm and things are set then he travels back home you can't stay here without any problem the issue is with the traveling from one country to the other you have to have a male mahram accompanying you and allah azzawajal knows best"
