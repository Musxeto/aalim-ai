  "title": "He forgets if he is in his 1st or 2nd Sujood when he makes a LONG Dua in Sujood, what to do?",
  "transcript": "okay if you hear me my question is when i'm praying and i prolong my duas in sujud for a long time in my native language i happen to forget whether it's my first or second rakah but i can clearly remember i i forget whether it's my first or second sushi sorry but i can clearly remember whether it's my first or second rakah or third or fourth so what should i do in this situation when i forget whether it's my first or second sujud jazakallahu khairan where jazak so brother hamza i think is asking that when he prolongs the sujud he forgets whether it is his first or second sajdah if this is happening all the time i highly recommend that you do not prolong your sajdah why to maintain the format of the salat and avoid forgetting things in it and disconnect the road for shaytan to distract you this is a priority a modern yasser once may allah please with a man with his father prayed sunnah prayer and he was fast so his companion said to him after he finished you were fast in prayer so he looked at him and said did i miss any of the pillars or the mandatory acts he said no you did not do anything as such he said in this case what i've done was right because i was raising the shaytan so that he would not distract me in my prayer what's the use if i pray two raka's in ten minutes and masha'allah i'm having sure but my head is distracted in the grocery list i have to buy in the debts i have to pay off in the car if i'm going to take it to the car wash and i neglectful yes i look to the people that whoa mashallah is praying good prayers but when i do it actually i'm at lost i'm not in the prayer is this better or is it better to pray two raka's in five minutes where i say subhanallah three times with concentrations with concentration and continue my salat concentrating on what i was saying of course the latter is better so this is my advice for you and allah knows best you"
