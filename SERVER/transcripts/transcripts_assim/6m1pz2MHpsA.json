  "title": "Construction of a Building That May Be Used for Sin, Earning Haram? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Muhammad from Canada so if someone lives in the west and they have been trying to find Halal jobs for for many many months now and they were not able to find a Halal job so finally they settled down on construction work now the construction work that that they were doing they found out that their employer employer puts them in different locations to build different things like parking lots and buildings and stuff so past for the past few weeks he was working on a small small Mall type location where he was involved in making parking lots and some stores but now just two to three days ago he found out that the owner that uh the the owner that the employe is working for is actually going to rent out one of the stores to a tattoo pilor and the parking lot is going to be used as a poke pizza place so the question is that the earning that he is receiving from that work is it haram no it is not Haram it is halal and one should not be involved in look for so trivial and little details that would make his life impossible so you're building you're working in construction it is not your duty to go and ask what are the places you're going to rent it to are they Muslims or are they uh uh non-muslims are they going to worship other than Allah are they going to hang a cross in it will they be clean shaven or they will have beards and this is none of your business you work in construction focus on it don't go and ask for a copy of the drawings and the blueprints this is an Overkill and this is only going to make your life difficult and unbearable and Allah Knows Best"
