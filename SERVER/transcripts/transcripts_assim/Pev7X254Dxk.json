  "title": "Punished for giving verdict without knowledge? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Because, when people give verdicts without such proper knowledge, Allah Azza Wa Jal will punish them. A man was in an expedition and he was hit by a stone that made him have a vicious cut in his head and he bled. And they tried to treat him. He went to sleep at night, woke up having nocturnal emission, so he has to perform ghusl. He went to his companions and said, listen guys, you know that I am bleeding and I have trauma and I have problems and I'm afraid if I use water this would harm me. Can I do tayammum? His companions said, no, as long as water is available, how could you do tayammum? You have to make ghusl. So the man took ghusl and he died. When the Prophet alayhis salatu wassalam heard of what they had done and what had happened to him, he was angered by it and he said, they have killed him, may Allah kill them. Why did they not ask if they did not know? The cure of the one who does not know is to ask. So the Prophet did not take it easy on them alayhis salatu wassalam. He said, you have killed him with your wrong fatwa. You did not have knowledge, why did you give such a verdict? You should have said, I don't know. You do whatever you can and maybe Allah would find you a way out, but not to tell him you cannot use tayammum."
