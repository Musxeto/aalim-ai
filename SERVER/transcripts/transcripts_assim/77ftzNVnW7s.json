  "transcript": "uh first of all last time I promised you that we will talk inshallah about the signs that Allah indicates with them to the individual that he loves him and it is essential for us to know that believing that Allah loves and is loved this is one part of the characteristics of so we both believe that Allah loves and is loved and in a number of verses of the Quran Allah the almighty tells us that he loves the righteous and he loves those who repent he loves those who clean themselves he loves those who are patient and Allah also encourages us to do good things because he loves these Good Deeds for example the prophet says Allah the almighty loves the top level of moral conduct or good ethics and also in the Hadith the prophet tells us that Allah the almighty does not encourage or endorse laziness and not doing what you have to do in the perfect manner on the contrary the prophet tells usam Allah the almighty loves that when an individual makes something that he perfects it likewise Allah the almighty loves all different forms of worship that an individual makes and offers to get closer to Allah a prophet Isam addressed the students of knowledge those who memorize the Quran and he said oh people of Quran offer your Witter prayer because Allah loves Witter now having said that this doesn't mean that whomever is not doing well in terms of Good Deeds or whoever does not have the best of moral conduct and behavior this doesn't mean those who do not have these things in them that Allah does not love them no but it means that they don't have the the perfect love of Allah the almighty because whoever has the full love of Allah which he limits to his righteous and servant that is the full love maybe a person would have half of that 3/4 of that one3 of that depending on the goodness in him but whoever has the full love of Allah then he has reached the ultimate goal and there are signs as Scholars say that an individual once he finds one of these signs in him this is an indication that Allah might love him and we will mention some of these characteristics or signs inshallah in uh what is is sufficient regarding the time for example the prophet tells usat that Allah the almighty protects his believing servant from the temptation of this dun of this world of this life while he loves him like you protect your sick people or your patient from food and drink because you're afraid over him Subhan Allah contemplate on this Hadith the prophet is telling us that Allah protects his believing servant from this D while he loves him because Allah may protect someone without loving him but his believing servant Allah protects him while he loves him which means that if he doesn't give him Provisions if he does not give him what he wants from this life this does not mean that Allah does not love him on the contrary it means that Allah the almighty loves him and this is obvious if you look at the prophet and the Servants of Allah the Almighty you would find that Allah Pro protected them from falling into the lust and desires of this dun and he protected them from being polluted by its Temptations so that their hearts would not be connected to the D and they would not love staying in this dun and this is not an indication at all that whenever Allah the almighty loves an individual he would make him rich and whenever he does not live love an individual he will make him poor this is not an indication at all because it is not an indication of Allah's love and hatred to an individual to make him rich or poor what is meant is that Allah protects him from being connected to this Dunya and Allah diverts his heart from loving this world and from being occupied by this world and you can take as an example the case of a person who buys a Ferrari for example for hundreds of thousands of Euros or dollars and he pays it without even drinking but when he is asked to donate for the cause of Allah he pays 100 or 50 while his heart is being ripped apart Subhan Allah this is an indication that this person is not loved by Allah because there were lots of Rich Companions of the Prophet however the D and the love of this life was not in their hearts it was in their hands and that is why whenever they were requested to spend they would give without any account they would give generously because the D was in their hands they throw it right left and center and without having any hesitation unlike those who are connected to this life among the signs that Allah loves an individual is that when Allah loves an individual he would introduce to him the characteristic of and a r is translated into gentleness and it also can be translated into kindness or an amount of Tolerance the opposite of violence so the prophet tells us if Allah loves a household if Allah loves a family he would introduce to them kindness so this is a clear indication when you see a man being kind tolerant lean with all the people and especially with his wife and kids and family if you find someone like this then you should know that this is a sign of Allah's love to him so many times we hear people being abusive being insultive they insult their wives and they do this deliberately in front of their children and some of them they do this in front of their wives families just to humilate them and insult them and by Allah this is a sign that this person is not loved by Allah the almighty because he did not introduce kindness and gentleness into his heart you should always respect your wife you should always praise your wife especially in front of her family even if you fighting even if you have disputes whenever you meet your family with your wife you always say mashallah my wife was this and was that and you make her family you make her parents you make her siblings feel proud that they've entrusted you with their uh uh flesh and blood and that you're taking real good care of her among the signs that Allah loves an individual is that you find people respecting and loving this IND as well the prophet sallallah alai wasallam said that whenever Allah loves one of his servants he calls the Archangel jel peace be upon him and he says that I love this servant of mine so jel you too love him so jel loves him and then he calls in the heavens and he says that Allah the almighty loves his servant so and so you must love him as well so all the angels all the inhabitants of the heavens love this individual the prophet say and then acceptance is laid for him on Earth what the meaning of acceptance is laid for him on Earth meaning that you would find people liking this guy loving this guy respecting this guy or this woman because of the acceptance that Allah has placed for them on Earth and do not be fooled or confused because what counts is the love and respect of the people of religion of the righteous and Pious people these people their love is an indication that Allah loves this individual why do we say this well it's very simple because if you nowadays look at someone who is sinful and a caller for Innovation for example if you see one of them actors or actresses or a singer or an ENT Entertainer all of these people are sinful yet you find millions of people love them and call their names in respect and in devotion and in love as well does this mean that Allah hased has has laid down acceptance for him on Earth no because their love and devotion their love and respect does not count what counts is the love of the p and and and and righteous people among there are two or three more but I don't want to consume all the time mentioning them so we may inshallah uh postpone that to uh next Sunday and we will take whatever questions you have in the remaining time and Allah Knows Best"
