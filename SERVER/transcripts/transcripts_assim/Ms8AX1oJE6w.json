  "title": "Used to backbite people, some I don't remember, some I do, should I apologize? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so it's half from india so my question is regarding backbiting and i understand how serious it is and what the consequences will be on the day of judgment so let's say a person spoke bad about many people in the past and today he does not even remember who all he spoke bad about but for the ones that he remembers he's in deep remorse and wants to settle it by confronting them and apologizing but he's afraid that it will spoil his relationship with them after he tells them that he has spoken bad about them so what should one do in this case and also what can he do for the ones that he does not remember anymore okay i will answer you in sha allah from india says he in the past remembers that he backbit people whom he doesn't remember them at the moment and people that he knows so what to do because if he goes and approaches the people he had back bitten it would be embarrassing maybe they will um be outraged and angry with him so we say in such conditions as haqq you simply repent to allah seek his forgiveness express deep remorse and if you can whatever their name is mentioned mention them with something that is good those whom you do not know of there's nothing you can do but to repent seek forgiveness and ask allah azza to forgive you and them and to show deep remorse and allah knows best"
