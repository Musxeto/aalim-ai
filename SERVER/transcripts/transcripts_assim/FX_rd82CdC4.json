  "transcript": "consider subscribing amina says can girls become lawyers since becoming judges is not permissible what is the definition of or what is the job description of a lawyer a judge rules with sharia or with other than what allah has revealed and this is a major sin and it can be blasphemous and taking the person out of the fold of islam as per ayah 44 45 and 47 in chapter five surat al-maidah so it depends and this is not the time to explain that in details a judge a muslim ruler or a ruler who puts laws in sharia against the sharia of allah now a lawyer is neither why a lawyer is an advocate he's a representative he's an agent so he represents me in whatever i tell him to represent me in therefore we do need lawyers when a person is entitled and required to pursue his rights someone stole my money someone broke a contract someone banged into my car and there was a car accident there were injuries i need compensation someone was accused unlawfully of a crime i defend him i represent him i prove to the judge and to the public that he's innocent i manage it to help him acquire his rights so i'm representing him this is halal i'm not ruling i'm not judging them not legislating anything other than what allah has revealed therefore the occupation and the job of a lawyer depends on case by case scenario so if what you're doing is to help someone in getting his lawful rights this is totally halal and permissible and you can do that but without any transgression so he's entitled for ten thousand dollars you get him the ten thousand dollars in some kafir country you're entitled to sue him for a million dollars that's not halal that's not sharia compliant you know that he is accused of being a drug dealer and he is a drug dealer you can't defend him even if the law permits it because you know that he is a criminal so you are preventing this criminal from doing time and serving his sentence and you're helping him continue his crimes against humanity and the community this is not permissible so it depends from case to case but generally speaking a woman to become a lawyer alongside what i've said earlier is required to abide by the hijab not to free mix not to be alone in seclusion with non-mahram if she can do all of this for instance a woman lawyer working in a law firm and preparing the papers for the lawyers to uh go and present it to the court so she's in the back bench or it's not the back bench in the back office maybe yeah that would be fine but if she is to go in front of the judge in front of everybody else and to prosecute and to defend and to speak publicly this is not permissible allah knows best you"
