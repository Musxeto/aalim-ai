  "transcript": "oh [Music] Lord I'm about jabber even Abdullah be pleased with a man with his father says that the prophet is verily the best supplication is alhamdulillah and indeed the best form of remembrance is now remember supplications and thicker they are interlinked and they almost have the same meaning but it highlights over and over again that the best of Decker is alhamdulillah subhanallah Allahu Akbar and also Dua the best of Dua is alhamdulillah and Allah because this is Dua of praising Allah not requesting things from Allah the Almighty and the following Hadith number 265 the Everlasting righteous Deeds what are they this is what the prophet Allah interpreted the Quran when he said that they are Allah alhamdulillah is one of the treasures of paradise and this in indeed compel us to memorize these in Arabic it's very simple subhanallah now if I were to say these a number of times like a hundred fifty Thirty twenty how should I make the tasbi remembering Allah saying subhanallah and by the way is taking for from the word subhanallah techbir is taken from the word Allahu Akbar tahmeed taken from from the word alhamdulillah and so on so how would I make this be and I believe may Allah be pleased with a man with his father he says I saw the prophet Aslam make this beer with his right hand so this is the way the prophet would not use his left to honor the tespie subhanallah alhamdulillah Allah and there's no specific format to do it three times on one on the pinky and and three on the on the following no it's the sky is the limit and this indicates that these fingers would testify for you on the day of judgment as the prophet said Allah when you make this be on your fingers and count them they will speak on the day of judgment so when you have a TSB counter or a prayer Beats though it's permissible but it's not from the authentic Sunnah and it would not testify for you as your fingertips and finally the etiquette of retiring for the night and this Hadith the compiler of the Fortress of the Muslim concluded his his book with it as if to show us that nighty night have a good night this is what we do when we come to the conclusion of the night is we go to bed and this is what we come to do at the conclusion of our booklet the Blessed booklet of the Fortress of the Muslim he narrates or he reports the Hadith where the Prophet Islam instructs Us by saying if foreign foreign that is after sunset at Maghrib time restrain your children from going out because at such time the Devils spread about so number one the restricted time for setting the children out on their own unattended is from Sunset to Russia time which is about an hour an hour and 15 minutes this is when the Devils spread and they may possess unattended children or harm them but if they are accompanied by an adult if they are within the vicinity of their own homes there's no problem in that setting them off or sending them out is a problem then the prophet goes on to say after a period of time has passed let them be and that is the hour and so after sunset shut your doors and mention Allah's name for verily the devil does not open a shut door so when you close the door of your home say Bismillah and by the way a lot of the folks call me and say that we've noticed that things are being taken away from our homes money has been stolen one of the sisters called me and said that I've lost a great amount of money though I live alone and sometimes I put the money in the cupboard to check it after five minutes is gone so this is definitely gin doing this although she is a well-known Daria and she besides the Quran she knows the Quran she says her athkar nevertheless this happens so I advise her to say Bismillah every time she places the money alhamdulillah it stopped since then so whenever things like this happen always gain the protection of Allah by saying Bismillah when you close the door because the devil would not be able to open a shut door that the name of Allah was mentioned upon it the prophet says tie up your water skins that is the water container made of skins and tie it up but still mention the name of Allah cover your vessels with anything and mention the name of Allah so that no illness or disease would come to it and put out your lamps what is putting out your lamps because lanterns and lamps were made of fire and lit by fire and in another Hadith the prophet told us that the mouse would come and snitch the fuse or a piece of thread and light it from such lanterns or candles or whatever is lit and he burns the house with it so the prophet tells us to turn it off not to have any fire in the house now if we have lights that the devil cannot use to ignite the house and set it on fire so electrical lights are okay to have all the time because it does not fall under this threat which the prophet warned us from and with this we praise Allah azzawajal and we express our gratitude to him subhanahu wa ta'ala for giving us the energy and the help needed to accomplish this booklet may Allah make all of her Deeds sincere for his sake and may Allah provide us with the protection when we say this Dua and we conclude by offering salutation upon the Prophet Muhammad was foreign [Music]"
