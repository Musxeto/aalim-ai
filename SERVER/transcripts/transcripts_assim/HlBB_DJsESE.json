  "transcript": "Aroobi from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaikumussalam and you are? Aroobi. Okay, yes Aroobi. Sheikh, my sister is getting bad day by day. Even a few days ago she wanted to kill my father with a knife because he slapped her as she was doing wrong things such as misbehaving and a little zina etc. Now I managed her a little. She promised me that she won't do zina and she will pray five times and sahajud and she will learn Quran from me. But the condition is that I have to let her use computer. If we don't give her computer, she will be the worst. So I accepted it. Now everyone is a little afraid of her. How can I guide her? I stay 24 hours with her. If I understand your question correctly, either your sister is mentally sick and she needs psychiatric attention before she harms herself or others, or she's just faking it and she's a spoiled brat pretending to have a problem so that she would get what she wants at the end of the day. If it's only the computer that she's insisting on having while giving promises of praying on time of being a good Muslim and abiding by the Islamic law, give her the computer while monitoring whatever she does on it and the best thing is to give her access to a PC with a big screen in the living room facing everyone else. So the back of the screen is to the wall and the screen is facing everyone else. So everybody could see what she is doing on that PC and let her have whatever she wants because people can monitor it and this is the worst of the two evils and Allah knows best."
