  "transcript": "one of the conditions that is required the acceptance so if one of them did not accept the managed contract is okay providing they approve what do we mean by acceptance that the boy accepts the marriage sometimes you go and work in canada or in america you come back home for vacation and the father says alhamdulillah i got you married last year to so-and-so what what kind of a a gift is this is your wife take her no i did not give you the power of attorney and i don't accept her marriage the marriage then is void likewise it happens with the girls a lot so the father says to his wife to his daughter i gave you in marriage to our neighbor so and so can the father do this no the approval of the girl is essential and that is why the prophet alaihis salaam said that the virgin is to be ordered and the non-virgin is to be requested and asked and the compa and the companions asked more and the prophet said the version acceptance is when she does not comment and scholars say that the majority of virgins and young girls when their father say wallahi so and so proposed to marry you so what do you think usually a virgin who's young and shy and bashful would look down and smile nowadays how much does he earn how does he look no i have to know does he have a car does he play sports does he enjoy traveling i enjoy i want one a lot of the virgins are like this nowadays they're so outcoming they ask questions that make the father blush the prophet was talking about the norm where such girls are usually bashful and shy and they don't comment so that is why scholars say their acceptance is by not saying anything this is approval but if she starts to to cry she doesn't say anything and she cries and cries and cries is this acceptance no the scholars say you have to look if some there's something wrong in what she's doing then definitely i will not pressure her but she has to approve of it and that is why at the time of the prophet a woman came to the prophet and said o prophet of allah my father gave me in marriage to his cousin or to his nephew to his nephew so that he would elevate any humiliation because he's his nephew his blood and no one is giving him in marriage so he forced me to marry him the prophet said allah he has no right to do that and you can if you wish reject the marriage it's void to that extent the woman said no i accept the marriage or prophet of allah but i wanted my sisters to know their rights this is your right now the girls so many times i've mentioned this yesterday and i mentioned it today again so many times they are forced if the father does not fear allah azzawajal he insists and he's angry in me shout he may beat her you have to marry this one man i've committed myself and i will not accept no for an answer you have to you it must and she says i'm forced no you're not forced don't destroy your life do not obey your father but this is a form of worship i'm getting closer to a if i if i uh obey my father not in this if your father tells you sweep the floor sweep the floor a form of worship if he tells you do the dishes do the dishes if he tells you don't go to school do not go to school you have to obey him if he tells you marry someone you do not want do not marry him you will be destroying your life now this is a very sensitive question who among the sisters now is married against their will masha allah that's good or they're lying but inshallah inshallah no nowadays alhamdulillah people are more educated they have more fear of allah it's very rare it may be found in saudi arabia in villages in tribes that live in the desert where would the girl go no other alternative but nowadays alhamdulillah people are more educated they fear allah more so alhamdulillah however this does not mean all forced marriages are bad because even if she was forced the father knows what's best for her and after a year or two she says it's like allah father for such a man this happens the same happened with aisha she was married to the prophet when she was alas 60 years of age and the marriage was consummated when she was nine did she complain she was blessed with such a marriage because it was the right choice you"
