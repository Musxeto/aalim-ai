  "transcript": "foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] first of all my take is that people should devote their work for the sake of Allah azzawajal I go to Mecca I go to Medina do you see me ever posting pictures of myself and well I'm taking a umra oh this is the Masjid of the Prophet that is no why don't I do such things don't I like people saying good comments and say masha'allah may Allah bless you share you are a righteous no everybody likes to be praised this is human nature but you don't want to spoil your good deeds by showing off So when you say alhamdulillah Allah blessed us with doing blah blah blah you make claim that I'm doing this to encourage people to do amrah and this is between you and Allah I'm not going to judge you my take is I don't have to encourage people through through showing them that I did umrah because they also when I go to a Hilltop where the Sun is setting I do take selfies and say look at the beautiful sunset look at this look at that and every moment of my life is being shared on social media why all what I want is attention or to be followed or to have likes or to be famous and recognize and remember this is one of the doors for shaytan it corrupts a lot of people's hearts so I would say refrain now if you're doing this as a tutorial okay I have many followers so I want to show them how to make umrah this is once in a lifetime no problem but every time you go to Umbra you take selfies I'm drinking zamzam look I'm squatting while drinking zamzam this is the Kaaba this is uh oh look at this man he's praying he's reading the Quran this is inappropriate it takes the spirituality out of the uh of the heart in addition to the fact that sometimes you also may be doing a problem when you're photographing people without their consent and this happened to me a number of times I did not give my consent to people to take my photos and publish it and I don't like this and I don't endorse it so it is inappropriate unethical to do such things on Allah knows best [Music] and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and the evening I will uh try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah thank you"
