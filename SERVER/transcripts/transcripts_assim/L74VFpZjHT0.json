مُّبِينًا بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم الحمد لله رب العالمين والصلاة والسلام على المبعوث رحمة للعالمين نبينا محمد وعلى آله وصحبه أجمعين أما بعد Dear brothers and sisters in Islam السلام عليكم ورحمة الله وبركاته One of the ways our Prophet used to address people's mistakes and errors was to show the people, to guide the people to which will prevent them from making such mistakes and this is the logical thing when you see something wrong you correct it and you guide that person what to do in the future so that he would avoid falling in the same trap again In an authentic hadith Sahl ibn Hunayf may Allah be pleased with him one of the companions of the Prophet ﷺ was with the Prophet once and they were traveling nearby Medina and he needed to wash himself either to cool down or to clean up and at the time people had no lavatories no bathrooms they were camping they were traveling so all what he needed to do was to cover his awrah from the navel to the knee and then do what he was supposed to do so he was washing himself and in order to do this of course his upper part of the body was exposed and Amr ibn Rabi'ah saw him bathe and he was amazed and he said to himself I have not seen such clear and pure skin like today look at Sahl's skin so he's telling the people around him his friends look how pure his skin is and the moment he said this Sahl fell on the ground he could not raise his head he got sick so the people went to the Prophet seeking his guidance telling him wouldn't you come and see what happened to Sahl maybe you can help him so he said what happened they said the oh Prophet of Allah he has fainted he fell sick he's unable to even raise his head so the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam said to them do you accuse anyone of doing something wrong so they said well Amr ibn Rabi'ah may Allah be pleased with him looked at him and we suspect that he gave him an evil eye so the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam summoned Amr and rebuked him admonished him and was really harsh to him and he said why would anyone of you kill his brother why if you were to see something you like wouldn't say may Allah bless it so the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam directed Amr and the Muslims how to block the evil eye and how not to make such a mistake in the future to say may Allah bless you Allahumma Barak Barakallahu Lak this is what we use to block our evil eye now I know some of you would think that we are in the era of space travel NASA and we have technological advances and science and the likes and you're telling us about evil eye at the end of the day we are Muslims and we believe in the Quran and the Sunnah and we definitely believe that they override any science because this is from Allah Azza wa Jal the creator of the heavens and the earth and it's a proven record for the past 15 centuries that everything in the Quran and in the Sunnah is authentic valid scientific logical proven without any doubt so why would I suspect why would I not believe in the presence of the evil eye when it is mentioned in the Quran and it is mentioned in the authentic Sunnah and we see it with our own eyes we see it in our own lives how people are affected by the evil eye I know people that when they go in some places and see something they like immediately something bad happens especially when they comment on it without saying Allahumma Barik some people go to a room they turn on the light and the lights are so bright and they say whoa and immediately the light goes off the light bulb is burnt gone people see a car and they say wow what a fast car and 5 minutes later it has an accident and the Prophet said alayhis salatu was salam the evil eye is truth is something that is existing it would cause a camel to die and be cooked and go into the cooking pot and it would cause a man to enter his grave sometimes we ourselves give evil eye without knowing to our own children when we don't say Allahumma Barik when we see our own children play around and we say whoa look how fast he is how strong he is without saying Allahumma Barik so evil eye exists and it does not mean that the person who gives it is an evil person Amir ibn Rabia is a companion and definitely he did not have ill intent and be careful because there is a difference between evil eye that comes out without intention most of the time and between envy which is a major sin envy or hasad is something that a person wishes that a particular favor or blessing of Allah is to be removed from that individual because he's envious he doesn't deserve it when you see a neighbor moving into a nice house you're envious you wish that he loses this wealth or the house is burnt to the ground when you see a friend marrying a beautiful woman from a reputable family you're envious you wish they divorce this is a major sin and this consumes good deeds like bushfire does to a forest or to the plantations evil eye is different it's called in Arabic Al-Ayn the Prophet said Al-Aynu Haq evil eye is undeniably true it exists but we have to block it by saying Allahumma Barik so many people come to me and they say Oh Shaykh I used to be an A student I used to be a hard worker I used to be a good da'ia I used to be a student of knowledge and overnight my life crumbled and was toppled and now I cannot do any of these things and I say to them this is evil eye 100% do ruqya and Insha'Allah it will all go away and you will be as good as new now if someone knows the person that made this evil eye to him there is a cure for that so the Prophet alayhis salatu was salam when he rebuked Amr ibn Rabia he ordered him to wash himself and collect the water so Amr did exactly as the Prophet ordered him alayhis salatu was salam he washed his face he washed his hands his elbows his knees the side of his feet and the inside of his waist wrapper and collected all this in a pot or in a bucket and then the Prophet ordered someone to come from behind Sahal ibn Hunaif and to pour it over his head and back and to turn the bucket upside down so this is the format so Amr did what the Prophet said alayhis salatu was salam and the collected water was thrown on Sahal in the same fashion the Prophet commanded alayhis salatu was salam and all of a sudden Sahal stood up as nothing was ever wrong with him and he started walking and acting normally so this is a fact when such a mistake takes place you direct the people to what blocks it and how to rectify it nowadays unfortunately people are not like that if someone says such an evil comment and you notice that this had negatively impacted your life and you go to them and you ask them to wash in the same fashion they would reject you they would say you're crazy and you tell them about the Hadith still they don't apply it unfortunately people don't have Iman they don't have belief what to do? you go to step number two which is to do Ruqya and you've heard me say this word Ruqya multiple times reciting the verses of the Quran to seek healing from Allah and you can do that on your water or on yourself and wipe over the affected area and this works beautifully with the grace of Allah four to five days and you're as good as new drinking from that water multiple times making a lot of Dua in your Sujood and Allah will cure you without any problem unfortunately some of the people cascade this into avenues that were not exposed before so a teacher finds herself suffering from an illness she goes to her class or classes and requests that they wash for her or for him and they collect the water from the students and do this this is not valid such collective effort gaining such water this is not even hygienic so this does not work you have to suspect a particular individual then ask that individual to make this Wudu or to wash for you in the same fashion and use that not to just hold people in the Masjid or in the neighborhood and ask them to collect such things and Allah Azzawajal knows best now in this Hadith we see that the Prophet A.S. rebuked Amr and was really angry with him telling him why would anyone kill his own brother just to highlight the severity and the true gravity of what he had done the mistake he had done and this is why so many times we are in gatherings and people may compliment something you have there is no problem in saying to them Akhi say Allahumma Barik to block his evil eye some people are offended and they have no right to be offended and if they are offended who cares say it to their face so that they would block their evil eye before they are not offended but I am hurt because of that usually if one observes his morning and evening Adhkar the Adhkar after the fourth prayer the Adhkar before going to bed and the Adhkar before leaving the home usually with the grace of Allah he is protected but nevertheless one must take the means so sometimes when people do such mistakes it is permissible to be harsh in rebuking them so that they won't repeat that again and from this story we learn that some mistakes may lead to killing people such as giving an evil eye or even driving recklessly so when you see someone driving recklessly or speeding you may rebuke them you may be harsh before something that is worse may happen in the future and then there is no point in regretting it and saying I wish I did this I wish I did that and finally in this Hadith in this story the Prophet A.S. is teaching us how to block mistakes from happening in the future so when you see someone doing a sin or an error you teach them that this is wrong and in the future you should do so and so to avoid falling into the same mistake we have a short break stay tuned and Inshallah we'll be right back Thanks for watching!"
