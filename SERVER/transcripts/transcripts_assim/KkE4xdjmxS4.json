  "transcript": "The first scholar is Brother Hamza from Bosnia Herzegovina. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Sheikh, if my mother asks me to drive her so she can visit her sister or her female friend, and I know for sure that there would be pre-mixing for my mother, would I be sinful if I just drop her there and pick her up later on? Jazak Allah Khairan. Wa Jazakum. First of all, the main rule in Islam in Surah Al-Ma'idah, chapter number 5, Allah says in the beginning, وَتَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْبِرِّ وَالتَّقْوَى وَلَا تَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْإِثْمِ وَالْعُدُوَانِ and collaborate upon righteousness and virtue and do not collaborate upon transgression and vice or sin. So, your mother is your mother. You have to obey her. You have to be dutiful to her. You have to be respectful. If you know that the sole purpose of her going there is to commit haram, you cannot assist her on that. But if it's a by-product, where she's going to attend a halal event, she has something to do, she has relatives to visit, and as a by-product there might be pre-mixing, or there might not. This is a by-product, this is not the origin. She's not going to a musical concert, or she's going to a bar, for example. Rather, she's going to a gathering that might be pre-mixing, and this is a by-product, then you have to try to advise her, to try to be diplomatic with her, to avoid taking her there, and if this is not possible, then you should take her while hating it with your heart, because at the end of the day she's going most likely to take a cab, or to do something haram other than that, in addition to what may result of that in the future. And may Allah azza wa jal guide her heart to abiding by the rulings of Islam. www.mooji.org"
