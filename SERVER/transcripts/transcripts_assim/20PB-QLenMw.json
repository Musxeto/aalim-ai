  "transcript": "uh fidan from turkey so you've mentioned a number of times that if a person can't pronounce a letter then they should not pay attention too much to it even if um if they appear they'll pronounce it properly but my mistake is a bit more obvious in the sense that like in the middle of a word my voice just stops and then there's a tiny pause or when i ellen gate it just cracks or shakes my voice just shakes and instead of like being like e it just goes like e that kind of thing so it sounds very strange and then i keep on repeating myself so my question is is this too big of a mistake that i should repeat myself or should i ignore that completely even if that sounds too strange okay i will answer it inshallah um faidan from turkey she says that the mistakes that take place in salat are due to the shivering in her voice i think it's a she and that sometimes she's out of breath so instead of saying [Music] she takes a pause lean to take her breath and continue so does this invalidate the salat no it does not invalidate the salat in sha allah"
