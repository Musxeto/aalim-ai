  "transcript": "[Music] I have a Malibu him and hamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa salam wa ala nabina muhammad in weii he was happy here and remain dear brothers and sisters in Islam Salaam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh hadith number four from the book an Armenian every year which was compiled by the amendment Noah we may Allah have mercy on his soul the hadith was narrated by one of the great companions of the Prophet Elisha lacerum abdullah having Massoud he said that the prophet of allah salallahu alaihe wasalam and he is the truthful the believed he narrated to us verily the creation of each one of you is brought together in his mother's womb for 40 days in the form of a loofah which is a sperm-drop so these are the first 40 days then he becomes a laka which is a cut of blood or a leash the leech is well known worm that the arabs know off the Prophet says for a similar period there is another 40 days then a muddler which is a morsel of flesh for a similar period there is a third 40 days then there is sent to him the angel who blows his soul into him and who is commanded with four matters for words for things to write down his RISP his lifespan his deeds and whether he will be blessed or doomed by Allah whom there is no deity worthy of worship except him verily one of you performs the actions of the people of paradise until there is an arm's-length between him and it and that which has been written overtakes him and so he acts with the actions of the people of hellfire and thus enters it and verily one of you performs the actions of the people of hellfire until there is but an arm's length between him and it and that which has been written overtakes him and so he acts with the actions of the people of paradise and thus he enters it this hadith was narrated by al-bukhari and Muslim in dosa which grades it at the very top of authenticity now this hadith is a well-known hadith it talks about the stages of pregnancy and I will not go into the medical aspects of it because as Muslims we believe in what the Prophet tells us at a salat wa salam and the majority of medical doctors who are specialized in this field see in it one of the prophecies and the miracles of the Prophet is lots of cinema because we're talking about something that was said 14 centuries ago so imagine 1400 years ago he's talking about something only 60 or 50 years ago scientists of today recognized how true that is from the hadith we'll learn that and this is part of our belief in the existence of angels which we mentioned in the pillars of Eman six pillars of email what our ancient angels are a creation of Allah as origin they're created from light as the Prophet tells us eyes of cinema so we have angels we have jinn and we have humans angels are created from light jinn are created from fire humans are created from clay or from mud the angels are so many and no one knows your number except Allah the wizard they're so powerful the Prophet tells us ally salat wa salam in terms of quantity that every single day elvatyl more which is similar to the kaepa on earth there's another structure and the seventh heaven the Prophet tells us Isis am that seventy thousand angels enter it and never come back to it and imagine if seventy thousand entered it and you do the math from the time allocated the creation until the day of judgment Allah has so many angels we do not even can imagine these angels do whatever Elijah tells them to do and they're so strong they're so powerful they're so fast no one can stand in their faces the highest and most important three of them are gibreel Micahel and Ezra field and the three of them they deal with life and what brings life to us so gibreel the arc angel Gabriel deals with the life of the soul and of the heart and he is appointed to deliver the revelation of Allah Azza WA JAL to The Messenger of Allah so the Quran is what revives our hearts that gives life to our hearts Ezra field is the angel appointed to blow the trumpet so he's the one who gives with the permission of Allah life back to the dead for resurrection and Micahel is the angel appointed to allow rain to fall and with rain we get crops that animals and cattle feed on and we also feed on both the crops and the cattle and they have different tasks and jobs among them is what the Prophet told us an angel that he's appointed to do four things and this deals with the pregnancy these things this is shala what we will try to learn more about after the break so stay tuned [Music] [Music] stories of beauties [Music]

in Dhamma in Allah next on peace TV Salaam alaikum and welcome back so just as we've discussed before the break there are different types of angels the highest and most important three of them are gibreel Micahel and Ezra field and the three of them they deal with life and what brings life to us so gibreel the arc angel Gabriel deals with the life of the soul and of the heart and he is appointed to deliver the revelation of Allah Azza WA JAL to the Messenger of Allah so the Quran is what revives our hearts that gives life to our hearts Ezra field is the angel appointed to blow the trumpet so he's the one who gives with the permission of Allah life back to the dead for resurrection and Micahel is the angel appointed to allow rain to fall and with rain we get crops that animals and cattle feed on and we also feed on both the crops and the cattle among the Angels is the Angel of Death and people falsely call him Israel and this is not his name we know that the angel of hell is Malik we know that the angels of questioning in the grave are munkar and nakir and we know among these angels is the angel that we get to encounter even before we are born and he's the angel that would blow the soul with Allah's permission in our bodies when we are in our mother's womb and he asks Allah Azza WA JAL to permit him and to give him the information of four things as a prophet said alehissalaam wasallam Allah sends this angel and the angel asks allah azza wajal for four things that Allah orders him to write and that is his provision or sustance his lifespan his deeds and whether he is blessed or doomed so these are the four things that he writes his provision his wrist and when studying this hadith and reading this I feel at ease why because I believe that a mirage it is the provider and he is the one who withholds his provision from reaching me subhana Allah and all for a reason and for wisdom so I believe in these two things these beautiful attributes of allah azzawajal and this makes me at ease because so many times I am worried where am I gonna get money to do this or to do that how can I get food to put on the table for my children how would I provide for them once I believe in this hadith and that my provision has been written before I was born I feel at ease because I know that no matter what I do nothing would come except if Allah allows it to do so why worry work I do work go and look for provisions you do go out and look for provisions but with a heart that is satisfied and with a heart that is connected to Allah nothing comes to me except through Alice will so the angel writes number one your provisions he writes your lifespan and this is something that has been done and it's over so Allah knows each one of us how long he's going to live this child is going to die when he's nine years old this man is going to die when he's seventy eighty thirty ten you do not know how old or how many years you're gonna live and this is not something that we inherit we say oh this person he comes from a family that live long so many people died in the problem of their youth in the fittest form they've ever been strong young but they died and so many people reached the end of their lives seventy eighty a hundred years of age no peace be upon him The Messenger of Allah the first Messenger of Allah lived or remained with his people for nine hundred and fifty years so their lifespan was so long eventually they died but this is something that had been done with your lifespan is over it's been written recorded when it's going to be only Allah knows about that the third thing is your deeds what are you going to do so all of this has been recorded by the angel of course he doesn't know the unseen Allah orders him to rights this and that and finally whether this infant in his mother's womb would be among the Blessed ones to do well and end up in paradise or would be among the doomed people who would do the actions of hell and then enter it and that is why abdullah al masud goes on to that the Prophet said that a salat wa salam told us that there are two types of people and this is reality you're either blessed or doomed you're either from the people of paradise or from the people of help so the Prophet tells us to be careful and to work as hard as possible while cleansing our hearts and make it clean and pure and sincere for Alonzo what does the Prophet tell us he tells us that there are people who act and behave and would do things that would qualify the doer to be among the people of paradise in accordance to what others observe and this came in another narration the Prophet Alice Aslam is telling us that among you there are people who do things worship prayer fasting the act of the people of paradise 60 years 70 years until there is an arm's length between him and death meaning that this close to his dying time and date the Prophet says as it appears to those observing meaning on the surface he's a good person he prays he fasts he gives money and charity he looks a Muslim practicing Muslim however just before his death time he does something from the actions of the people of Hell meaning he sins he commits heinous acts and he dies while doing this and he enters hell and the opposite is the same a person who's completely sinful all of his life doing bad things and just before his death he repents and he starts to act like the actions of the people of paradise is to worship Allah and he dies and he ends up in paradise this hadith caused a lot of confusion among the people because when they look at it they think this is unfair the man was worshipping Allah for 6070 years and then he ends up in hell well first of all be extremely careful when you discuss such things now you said WA fan vamoose alone Allah the Almighty is never questioned by anything about what he does while all of his creation are that is the art questioned so no one has the right to come and say why this why did Allah do that take this as default take this as something I'm negotiating is fair and just Allah is all knowledgable Allah owns everything what do I mean by Allah is fair and just meaning that Allah soldier is never unfair or unjust to anyone so those who did 60 years or 70 years of worshipping allah azza wajal on the surface on what people think they did well but inside their hearts were corrupt and that affected them when they were on the dying bed and they died as non-muslims or as hypocrites or whatever and this happened at the time of the Prophet Ezra in a battle there was a man among the Muslims killing the disbelievers right left and center and the Companions were so impressed with him they said to a prophet of Allah dismantling us he killed so many the Prophet looked at him and said he's in hell the Muslims were shocked if this person who's doing jihad and he is doing well is in hell there is something wrong one of the Companions said I'm the one to associate with him I'll bring you his news so he followed him during the battle until that man got injured and he was in so much pain and agony he could not tolerate the pain so he put the tip of his sword in his chest and throat and then leaned the ground and committed suicide so the man went to the prophet and told him I believe that you are the Messenger of Allah solo on sanam in the prophesied why he said the man who told us about he did this and that and then the Prophet said this hadith so the man though to us was a great fighter a great believer he ended his life and committed suicide and was admitted to hell alonzo jail is fair and just and Allah Azza WA JAL is knowledgeable so he knows what this person is going to do and what this person is not going to do and Allah Azza WA JAL owns everything so if I take a $1,000 bill if it exists and I burn it it's mine you have no right to complain I can do whatever I want in the things that I possess Allah has the higher example so a lie is never unfair or unjust you have to believe in that likewise those who are sinful don't be hasty in judging them you never know what Allah would conclude his life with maybe he would be higher than you in paradise you give him dower you tell him that this is wrong but at the same time you never know how his life is going to end like an asylum from Beni Abdullah sure from the Unser all of his life he was a disbeliever in one battle he went and fought with the prophets of Salaam and they found him among the wounded and those who were to die so they asked him why did you come out to fight did you come out because you wanted to be called a brave one or because you wanted to be with your tribe he was in his wounds and dying he said no by Allah I came out to fight for Allah and for His Messenger so the man ended his life never prayed one single prayer never prostrated one single prostration all of his years of Cofer disbelief shirk was raised and he concluded his life with this beautiful martyrdom and he died in the cause of Allah ending in paradise so this hadith illustrates that no matter how good you are how close you think you are - Eliza shall always have this balance between fear and hope the fear that Allah would reject all of your good deeds because there were not sincere and this is something that we have to work on our hearts we have to cleanse them we have to clean them we have to fill them with what pleases Allah Azza WA JAL and the hope that Allah is most forgiving most merciful and that we anticipate we look forward for all of that this is all the time we have until we meet you next Anthea Manila assalamualaikum warahmatullahi over I got"
