  "title": "I keep repeating Fatiha in salah due to mistakes in makhraj, what should I do #islam assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "please Shake listen my question fully I take a long time to recite Surah Al because of the letter d and I try to pronounce them correctly since I know their M but I not perfect in it yet I don't know what counts as my best so I keep repeating them during prayer I trying again and again however they still aren't pronounced perfectly and because of this praying become very difficult for me what should I do sh you have one of two options you can leave the prayer alt together and not pray and this is exactly what Shan is pushing you to do and it's very very strange and weird how people keep on listening to The Whispers of shatan people have been reciting the FAA for 10 or 15 years every single day multiple times all of a sudden they've discovered that oh the m is not valid it's not correct and they keep on repeating the same word or the same verse and sometimes they nullify thebar and repeat it again and again and again 50 times a day why because Shan is sitting there laughing his head on you he's laughing look how stupid he is he's repeating the prayer because I'm telling him and he's oblivious he's crazy this is what Shan is doing to you and you have the audacity to listen to Shan not only that to obey him and when you please shatan by obeying him guess what Allah is angry and not only that you have lost the sweetness of Salah you don't enjoy Salat it's become a burden and it's a struggle and it will soon come to an end where you will abandon Salah Al together this is exactly what Shan does to you so you have one of two choices either to ignore Shan and not listen to him and you can do that by usually having a counseling session with me if you can afford it where I'll talk you out of it or you obey him and listen to him and make life difficult which will lead eventually to you leaving Salat may Allah protect us all"
