  "title": "Forgot I was fasting (voluntary fast) & ate, did my fast break or can I continue? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "If I am fasting, voluntary fasts, and I eat or drink, should I continue or cancel it? The Prophet ï·º said in an authentic hadith, when a fasting person forgets and eats or drinks, he should continue his fast because Allah has fed him. This hadith is for Fard, Ramadan, it is for Wajib, expiation, and also for Sunnah fasting. It's the same. But the problem is, sometimes it is too much. I was in my home, and I get a call from my son-in-law, he's married to my daughter. So he said, uncle, I was fasting today because it is Monday. I said, okay. He said, I went to the kitchen before I go to work, and I had two big sandwiches and a glass of milk, and I forgot. So what should I do? I said, Alhamdulillah, this is from Allah, continue. He called me three hours later. He says, I went to work, yes, and the boys at work brought lunch. So I ate with them. You know bake? I'll bake. I'll bake chicken, fried chicken. So I ate with them, and we had some cake, and one large Coke. And then I remembered I was fasting. So should I continue, or? I looked at him and said, come on, according to the hadith, Alhamdulillah, continue. This is gift from Allah, but where is your mind? Eating so much, you eat more than when you're not fasting, and Alhamdulillah, this is valid. Now for your second question."
