  "title": "Is conveying salam to my cuzs through my aunt keeping ties of kinship? #Assim #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh when we call our relatives to keep the ties of kinship and if we call our Aunt for example and at the end of the conversation we tell her to convey our Salam to everyone in the house including our male cousins who live there does that count as if we also connected the ties of kinship with our cousins for that specific period of time or must we separately call the cousins we've talked about this so many times the levels of kinship differs so how you connect to your parents is not how you connect to your siblings and how you connect to your siblings is not how you connect to your uncles and aunts and how you connect to your uncles and aunts is not how you connect to your cousins so if you call your uncles and aunts what once every week or couple of weeks you may call your cousins once every month or two months so saying and conveying to them to your uncles or aunts give my regards to my C Abdullah and Muhammad and give them my Salam that's fine but it is not similar to you contacting them individually once every month just to keep in touch and Allah Knows Best"
