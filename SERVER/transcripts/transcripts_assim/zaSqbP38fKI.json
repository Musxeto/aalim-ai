  "title": "Can I get an Abortion if a disease can be passed on to the fetus or baby?",
  "transcript": "i have a family history of blood disorder hemophilia in which the blood does not uh clot normally and this is an incurable medical disorder i am a carrier of disorder of this disorder and my father died because of this there are 50 chances that my male child will be affected with this my gynecologist has told me that at the third month of pregnancy they will do the test and they will find out if the child is affected by this uncurable disease if that's the case the gynecologist is advising for abortion what is the ruling on me well this is something that requires going through the type of disease and the impact on the child but if i understand it correctly there's a fifty percent fifty percent why would i go for the negative fifty percent instead of being positive and thinking well of allah and making dua and hoping for the best besides this is not something that a child would be born without a brain or without any hands or legs and cannot see and and deaf and mute and dumb and whatever no he's a normal child but he has a sort of blood deficiency which is might be fatal might not be fatal so i don't see any reason to believe what these doctors are saying and i believe that trusting allah is the best thing and believing in that allah can change things with dua and life is a test so i believe that you should not go for abortion as this is not a life-threatening situation for you as a mother and for the child it is also 50 50 and we hope for the best and allah's [Music] best"
