  "title": "Are gifts given to pharmaceutical companies considered to be BRIBES?",
  "transcript": "Shawrin from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh My question is my father owns a medicine shop. The medicine companies from which we source the medicine say that if we can sell the medicine for an amount of money, we will give them a fridge or a washing machine or take them on a trip. So even when the month of Ramadan comes, they give the praying mat or various Islamic books as gifts. Is it permissible to take these gifts? What pharmaceutical companies offer can be a gift and can be a bribe. What they give to the clinic owner or the doctor who operates his own clinic or the pharmacy owner, and they say if you sell this amount or you promote this medication, we will give you so and so and so. And there are no strings attached. This is a gift because it's like a commission. I'm selling as many possible of this particular medication and I'm not cheating anyone and it's my money. It's my clinic. I'm not working for someone else. But if I'm working for a hospital and they come to me with a gift or with a three-day seminar in Sharm El Sheikh or in Dubai or they give me a laptop or they give me a mobile phone and they say, yeah this is a gift so that I can prescribe this medication as much as possible to patients, this is a clear cut bribe and Allah knows best."
