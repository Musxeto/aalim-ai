  "title": "Is it permissible to sing a romantic song that doesn't have vulgar or kufr words? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "from Pakistan but if I'm singing a song and there's no music and there is but there are some romantic lines and I am alone singing it would it be halal I would say that this is similar to Nasheed and if there is no uh profanity or vulgar language used and there isn't a possibility that shaytan will trick you to listen to the original then inshallah there is nothing wrong in that however it's best not to do it because if I were to hear you singing it I would say how did you know that you put yourself in trouble and you cast doubts upon yourself that oh he listens to music this is why he learned this song and now he's chanting it but if there is no fear of such thing happening and shaytan will not come to you and say listen wow man this song is great I used to listen to it like gazillion years ago let me look and listen to the original with music Just For All Time time's sake then this becomes a Haram thing to do in Allah Knows Best"
