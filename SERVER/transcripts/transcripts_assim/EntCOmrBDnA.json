  "transcript": "foreign first of all women according to the most authentic opinion are Exempted from the prohibition of wearing rings in these two fingers according to the Hadith narrated by alibner may Allah be pleased with him a Muslim in the chapter dealing with adornments and clothes the prophet prohibited us from wearing rings in the index finger and in the middle finger so the scholars said that this is specifically for men others say yes it's for all both men and women but the most authentic opinion is that women are not excluded from adorning themselves in whatever finger they wish so it is restricted to men secondly wearing a ring with the name of Allah is permissible the prophets sealed which was a ring had the writings engraved on it Muhammad rasool Allah so the name of Allah was there the name of Muhammad was there and some of the salaf used to write in or in grave reminders on their rings this is permissible but we have to be careful not to enter the toilet with such a engravement or such a ring like the prophet whenever he went Allah to answer the call of nature he used to take off his ring so we should do this aim is it recommended I personally believe that one should not do that because usually when you wear a ring with only Allah's name engraved on it what is the purpose most likely you would think that this is a form of protection and to bring good to you and this by itself is a minor shirk that can mount to Major shirk so you should refrain from that if you have such an intention and Allah Knows Best"
