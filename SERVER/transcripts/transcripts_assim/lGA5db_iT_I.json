  "transcript": "and this is from abdullah he says if i apply for u.s or canada visa and when i get it i seek for asylum but the only way is to lie and is that haram to allah to lie for citizenship yet on my heart i'm lying but looking for a good life to support my family i fear to annoy allah of course if you lie you're committing a major sin if you lie claiming that you are gay or you are christian so that they would have sympathy to you and give you asylum this is a major sin that may take you out of the fold of islam for what i need a better life i want to live the american dream oh masha allah i thought you were starving no no she have a good job but you know in my country we are not respected with this with that you cannot migrate to a cafe country leading your muslim country and you cannot lie to the authorities in order to get asylum how do people like this think i remember like 10 years ago or maybe more a minister in the uk government i forgot his name he's a short wicked person um he came in public saying that a woman who's an akabi who's pregnant was asking for benefits being not married is this possible he says she's a liar she's married she has four kids her husband is living with her but because they didn't register their marriage so she's claiming benefits ready to lie being a nikabi pregnant just to get a couple of hundreds of pounds how cheap islam is to such people willing to compromise their religion willing to say they're gay or their christian or their disbelievers or whatever willing to insult islam for a couple hundreds of dollars or pounds may allah protect us"
