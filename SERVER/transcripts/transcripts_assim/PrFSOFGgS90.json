  "transcript": "he was selling was here today what you know the brothers and sisters about it on the Sony gay here screaming after no more honest well senior to me assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh welcome to contemporary Islamic issues on hooda TV I'm your host arkin Rashid and today's episode we will be speaking about the westernization of Muslims and what is this concept of westernization why is it so common amongst Muslims and we're gonna specifically speak about westernization amongst our religious principles so I want to start off by welcoming and introducing my guest for today share casa mil√† Hucky i said i'm rodrigo and welcome to the show Nadia come Sonoma love occurred - wanna share Qasim let's start off by defining westernization so we're all on the same page here with the viewers smeller handle of salat wa salam ala rasoolillah here oh so happy a many today who the who am i back the westernization is a state of mind where the Muslims tend to mimic or copy the western style of thinking of living and in some cases even in practicing their religion so it is what some people call as putting them in a melting pot so they would be transformed into something else rather than abiding by their religion and culture okay so I want to introduce program just to give an over cap of what we're gonna do I want to go through the reasons for westernization I want to go through the effects that it has on Muslims and I want to like we said specifically deal with westernization in religious principles so let's start off by the reasons what would you say are some of the reasons why Muslims would want to be like the West whether in Muslim countries or whether Muslim citizens living in the West raised in the West in terms of obviously for example in terms of what they wear that changes you know culturally and there's many things that change depending on their culture but in terms of religious practices why would you say they want to be like the West basically speaking the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam warned us when he said better to be honest and then let in a public that you will follow the footsteps of those before you and to the even the smallest details that it is a hand span or an arm span even to the extent that if they were to enter a lizards hole you would follow them so the Prophet is warning us of something that would happen in the future where people would mimic where copy would imitate the people before them to that extent so the Companions asked the Prophet Isis Salam are you referring to the Jews and the Christians are you saying that we will follow their footsteps and the Prophet said yes that is a lobster so this means that the greatest reason for following the footsteps of or falling into the trap of westernization is stemmed from this hadith share upon is there is the driving force behind it also there is the lack of knowledge so the less knowledge a person has the more influenced he is thirdly there is the inferiority complex because it is human nature that people tend to look to those who are stronger to those who are more influential to those who are richer you know Arun as mentioned in surah al-qasas at the end who was some say the cousin of prophet Musa some say but he was a multi-billionaire he was the richest man on earth and he was so boastful of his wealth to the extent that the igni and said we wish we had like Haroon has and they've neglected the blessings and favours of Allah upon them of being Muslims of being healthy of they wanted to reach that level due to their inferiority complex they look down at themselves so a lot of the Muslims would imitate would fall into this trap of westernization because they want to live the American dream they want to do this they want to do that they want to be like that actor or this actress or that sportsman or athlete or a businessman well if you wanna continue that the fourth reason of trying or falling under the trap or the Infosys of westernization is the media what you see affects you and this is also a human nature if you sit in a room and someone is hysterically laughing you can't hold yourself but laugh there are clips that comes of a child you know in an infant of a year or two laughing his head off and all what you can do is just laughing you don't know what he's laughing at bit but when you see someone laughing you by nature laugh and if you someone who's depressed and sad he depresses you so the influence of media is extremely dangerous as well what I wanted to say is that why is westernization a new issue I mean if we look in Islamic history we didn't find before that Muslims wanted to be like the West rather we find the exact opposite that many of many countries or societies in Europe wanted to imitate Muslim lands so why is it that now this is the contemporary why is that the case because as I said is an inferiority complex human nature who's strong now who's the man it's the disbeliever it's the marine soldier who does wonders it's portrayed in the media this FBI agent or CIA agent or the international spy who masha'allah shoots his pistol with like a gazillion bullets with one magazine I would I would love to buy a pistol like this or a 9-millimeter that can shoot endlessly we are turning out of bullets but this is how we feel and I mean it's very sad when I come to countries of the Gulf for example or Egypt or Jordan or whatever Muslim countries and you see the WWE wrestlers coming from the US with the tattoos with their in proprietary their effects with their pop culture and they invade the country with what they call a performance or with their art and you see the youth the youngsters doing the same thing watching them being influenced by them I was in the gym the other day and this teenage boy came to me 16 years of age and he said to me you look like so-and-so he was talking and then he said he mentioned the name and I said yeah who's this he said you don't know him he's a world famous wrestler said I don't know him he said yeah you don't know this and I asked around that I could go do it and some of the brothers showed me equipment subhanAllah the Muslim youth are influenced by this due to the media due to their feeling of weakness and vulnerability they think that these are the most powerful oh this is the most powerful nation these are the most powerful men to the extent that even now being brainwashed like this if you see a wrestler but he's coming from America you think that he has the power to beat a battalion on his own turf what is this he's a but this is how we feel and think because of our negative influence of westernization okay so I mean that's that's a very good reason for the influence of westernize westernized culture entering Islam and Muslims and influencing the youth now obviously I want to get into how we can counter these influences but before we do that I want to get into the effects that it has on the youth so let's just lightly speak about some of the effects that you know has on the youth and it has on society in general and then we'll get into how can we counter this sort of westernization of the Muslim Minds we can say well if I may I'd like to point out something sure now westernization again there are themes and a middle path one extreme says you have to take the whole nine yards live the Western dream with everything in it even if it goes against Islam and on the other extreme we have the anti westernization who would even refuse riding a car or using a mobile phone or they look at electricity as a menace from the West and prohibiting all of these things and by the way this is not hypothetically speaking there are segments of the society in some Muslim countries who are like the Amish they think all of this civilization stuff is Haram and taboo Islam is not like this Islam tells you because so many liberals come to you and secularists from among the claim to be Muslims say why are you wearing a watch why are right car this is innovation this is beta this is westernization no no no don't go down that line our role model alayhi salatu was-salam used to wear what is known as jube button Rumia it's from the Byzantines but it's a formal clothes that the Prophet used to wear he used to wear Nihad Satya that is from Yunnan and Yemen was not a Muslim country so taking what is good is highly recommended but staying from what affects your religion and goes against the teachings of the Quran and Sunnah this is a must nowadays if you want to look at it in a contemporary way I go to Western universities to study I learned there medicine there engineering I learned there knowledge is and knowledge and Sciences to benefit Islam in the Muslims but I do not go to the extreme of taking what is not permissible in Islam their lifestyle their ethics their morals their religious practice so I think this we need this concept to define exactly what westernization the do's and the don'ts so we can say the negative Western influences in terms of negatives in terms of against our religion or against the core principles of our religion now before we get into how we can counter these negative effects we're going to go for a short break so stay tuned Oh welcome back to contemporary Islamic issues on her the TV now before we went for that short break we were speaking about the westernization of Islamic societies and the Shia mentioned that it's not all types of westernization it's the negative aspects that affect our religion and we said when we come back from this short break that we will speak about how we can counter this but before I actually speak about how we can counter this shift something very interesting that you mentioned before we went for that break was that the prophet sallallaahu Ali was selling war a Roman soap and he wore slippers that were from Yemen and there's there's a very very common concept in the cotton it's a famous hadith of the Prophet SAW cinimon imitating the non-believers so doesn't this fall under this okay wearing a Roman Philibert slippers from non-muslims fall under imitating the Kafar or how do we define this concept in Islam okay a small correction it was not a Roman soap or a Byzantine soap it was made in Byzantium so what's the difference here when I wear a cap or something to cover my head from the Sun that everybody does wear it there's no problem but if I wear a hat that only people in Texas wear it they have a problem the Prophet that is as I've said in the hadith you have referred to which was narrated by Abdullah normal may Allah be pleased with the matter with his father the Prophet said in a long hadith at the end women tashabbaha bi qawmin for who am in home that whoever imitates a people then he is part of them he's one of them now to understand this hadith you have to look into what is considered to be part of the other people's culture that nobody shares it with them or part of their religion or part of their social way of living and by what is shared that commonly by people so if someone says share your wedding a watch said okay what's the problem which is a quite nice one as well what is the problem with that said no this is from the Kafar so yeah but Muslims and non-muslims were you wearing a suit and a tie and this this is the dress code of the kafir but it's also shared by hundreds of millions of Muslims so it's not only specifically for the disbelievers now this is something shared by everyone so the Prophet or some when he wore that shoe button Rumia that was made in Byzantium this was not an indication or a sign whomever saw him said ha he is from Byzantium he is from the Romans no this was worn by everyone now this is different to someone wearing a specific type of clothes that is only worn by kafir or disbelievers non-muslims so if a woman goes into a party wearing a kimono for example the tight dress of women in Japan Japan is not a Muslim country so following the culture is not permissible in that aspect and I am shocked by some of the people go to Japanese or Chinese restaurants and they eat with his chopsticks and you see the rice falling on their laps and defect what are you doing should I'm eating Chinese food with chopsticks okay that the Chinese food is okay for you to eat it's a lot but the method of doing it you're imitating the kafir for what there's no benefit in it you know using a fork or a spoon this is the right way of doing it eating with your bare hands would be even better if you want but to go to the extreme of mimicking and imitating the disbelievers this shows that you have an inferiority complex which brings me to the fact that the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam went against the jews and the christians and so many thing and if you go through the sooner you will always read the phrase highly full-year who the one in module seven Messara go against the way of the Jews the Christians and the five worshipers don't do this don't do that even when it comes to the pre-dawn meal in fasting or breaking your fast after sunset the Prophet said Isis Salam the people are still in good terms as long as they hastened to break their fast and delay in postpone their pre-dawn meal because the people of the book do not do this praying in your sandals is a Sunnah the Prophet Sarah Sarah go against the Jews pray in your sandals because the Jews do not pray in their sandals they pray therefore it growing the beards the problem for men of course I don't want the sisters because our let's do it the Prophet said erase salat wa salam - yahoo devil medusa or nasarah ha ha ha Akram le ha ha ha all of these verbs indicating an instruction and an order to let go and the reason the main reason it's a Sunnah but also another reason is to go against them so in short we have to have our identity westernization comes to remove all of that and this is probably why when someone calls for Sunnah people try their level best to discredit him wherever you go in Muslim world or in non-muslim countries those who call for the Sunnah for preserving the heritage of our prophet irresolute Sturm usually they are sought after to ban and to stop why because this is what maintains the people's heritage and faith inside my Muslim the Lord never reveal us may Allah be pleased with him came to the Prophet that is a sign with two garments which were dyed in saffron a yellow Sh hope that gives the clothes a very bright shiny yellow color now among the Muslims this type of clothes was only worn by the disbelievers so what did the Prophet do Eraser when he saw him he said Abdullah did your mother order you to do this and this is sort of reprimanding him in a very harsh fashion because a man is not his mama's boy he's a grown up man so when you ask him this question this means that a man does not do this Abdullah acknowledged immediately and he knew his mistake so he asked the Prophet Ali Salim should I wash them because washing them would remove the saffron from it and it would become white again the Prophet said no burned them scholars interpreted this hadith by saying that this is the dress code of the kafir of the disbelievers and as a form of reprimanding him washing washing it would have done the job but he wanted it to stick in his mind by telling him to burn it so that he would not ever imitate the disbelievers again sure Qasim I want to ask you two questions actually that many of the viewers are probably thinking by now so after listening to your explanation two things popped into my mind the first being that obviously we're supposed to follow this another prophecy of Allah while you're sediment at the same time you said that we've been ordered to you know separate ourselves and distinguish ourselves from the Christians the Jewish and the fire worshippers now say for example all the Jews all the Jews start growing their beards exactly how the Muslims do it now do we have to differentiate ourselves in this aspect because now if we grow our beards in a certain way if we grow our beards long and trimmer mustache this is what every single Christian is doing now so how can we differentiate ourselves in this that's that's a very good question and it's hypothetical it will never happen but if it did happen the Muslims have to maintain the instruction and the sunnah of the prophet elijah by keep growing it for example hypothetically if all the christians and the jews decided to pray five times a day like we do but still remain on following their religion would we stop praying no because this is an instruction to pray and there's a byproduct of it which is to go against them so if they were to follow suit and to imitate us this does not mean that we have to as well go against them and leave our prayers Islam tells us to do certain things going against the Jews and the Christians but these things are not related to their acts it is part of the reason of doing it but the main part is to worship Allah so John by following such a thing okay and the the second question was that obviously you said that if something is very specific to the non-muslims then that is the act we can't do so if something is shared between Muslims and non-muslims such as wearing certain closed and you know those things could be done it's not considered imitating the non-muslims however if they act is if an act is specifically to a group of non-muslims then we cannot copy this act now what if this act was originally specific to one group and now it becomes spread amongst Muslims does this still become specifically to one group is there still imitating the non-muslims or is it something that we can do now part of the greatness of Islam is that it evolves as long as there is room for that like 500 years ago wearing a suit was totally prohibited because this was the dress code of the kafir of the colonizer if you wish now the first Muslims at that time to wear suits and to imitate the kafirs were cursed by Allah as OSHA and were sinful while the circle grew and more and more people became acquainted with such an act or a dress code the sin has been reduced until it completely vanished when the majority of the Muslims wearing it not because it is from the kafir but this is what's convenient for them so if you go to Egypt if you go to Jordan everybody's wearing suits this is what they wear 24/7 not because the Americans or the Wester do this not because they're under the influence of westernization but now this is becoming the norm likewise when you come to things dealing with customs and traditions yeah any for example a woman wears on her wedding night a white wedding dress now wearing such a dress 200 years ago was not part of Islam or our culture so those introducing it and they may have contributed into the westernization process due to this those who introduced it at the very beginning were cursed because they were imitating the disbelievers nowadays you will not have a single wedding without the bride wearing such a a dress do we say it's Haram should know it's totally permissible as long as it falls under the Islamic regulations not being too tight not being nude not being based not being that and so on so what I can extract from your answer there is that it depends on the intention and the reason why it's being done so like you said the people that did it in the beginning their intention was to imitate whereas now it's just a normal Hmong Society so they're they don't have any intention of imitating a certain group or certain people if the intention still is present today then it's sinful again but people don't usually do this because no one wears a suit in such countries saying that while I look like President Obama they wear the suit because this is the norm but again the intention itself is not sufficient it has to coincide with the act so if someone says my intention is good but my act is evil then you will fall into the they have to go side by side okay all right unfortunately we did not get to cover everything we wanted to so we're gonna continue this conversation over another episode so at least for this I want to thank you for joining us an inch on the next episode we will get into how we can counter such negative influences dear viewers I hope you guys benefited from tonight's program or today's program and I hope that you join us for the continuation of this program so we can get into how we can counter such negative effects and until then may allah subhanho wa taala bless us all assalamu alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh Oh if muhammad sallallahu aleyhi we sellem was here today what you know the brothers and sisters departed on the so many gay he be screaming after no more Amish well say no to me returned to the guidance of Allah I will set you free"
