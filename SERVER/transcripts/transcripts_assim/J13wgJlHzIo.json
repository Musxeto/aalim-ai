  "transcript": "our FIFA says I attended a casual gathering and once the gathering was over the people made a group dua before everyone left and she objected to that telling them that this is a bidder and they said that it's done very rarely once in a while therefore it's not a bidder but if done on regular basis then it will be better is this true Doha is a Sunnah the Prophet says that Islam when someone does you a favor reward him and if you cannot reward him make dua for him so making duaa is a good thing and people usually mix things up so they say that congregational dua after every fault prayer as many countries do this is an innovation a beta which is totally true why because it's being done every single fourth prayer congregational vicar the Imam says Subhan Allah Subhan Allah and the a facilitation to the process I mean they repeat after him this is totally innovation but if we go to a place and there's a wedding and one of the elders during the wedding or during the party or at the conclusion of the party raised his hat praises Allah a social facilitation to the Prophet Simon Says may allah azzawajal make their marriage successful may Allah grant them righteous offspring and everybody's saying I mean there's nothing wrong in that this is totally legit and there is nothing wrong in that but if this becomes a regular habit after every time we for example gather at a certain event and it's a must that we make duaa no yes the Prophet Isis am whenever he dined at people's houses he would make dua for them so if you come and eat lunch at my house I don't promise I'm gonna invite you but if you so happen and come and you make dua will I stop you know definitely lunch make door Shakalaka the Prophet used to say as a collateral Macabre after in the community like America used to supplicate for the people so this is permissible it is not related to a particular advisor such as prayer and it's becoming a habit a regular habit therefore I don't believe that there is anything wrong in that insha Allah"
