  "title": "Ruling on Nutmeg | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "RK says my mother uses a spice mixture in which nut mug is listed as an ingredient so what's the ruling on that if I understand it correctly not mug is a spice in arabic we call it Joseph Lib it's it's a nut and the scholars when asked about it the vast majority of scholars say that it is prohibited why they say that if consumed in certain amounts it can lead to hallucination and it has a similar impact of pot or drugs marijuana whatever and therefore they say that the ruling of it it's Haram in the humbly school of thought they prohibited totally and this is why the scholars say the general rule whatever consumed in large quantities small quantities is Harlem so a nut mug is from that type it surely hallucinates at least it puts you down or it intoxicates you as a people of experience say and hence putting a little of it in the spices in the food would render it and make it Haram and Allah Azza WA JAL knows best"
