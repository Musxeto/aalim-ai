  "title": "Can I choose a spouse with lower Imaan if they strive and aspire for an Islamic lifestyle?",
  "transcript": "As no one is perfect when choosing a spouse, can we choose someone who might have more demand than us, as we really like them, but we are willing to improve every day, and have a family more than we need in Islamic life style? And you go, Bismillah. Okay, I win. But this is Russian roulette. You cannot marry someone, of course, there are things that compensate. You say, she has low iman. Yeah, but she is Miss Universe 2015. So, I'd rather okay. She is the daughter of a multi-billionaire, like the Sheikh mentioned to us in the elevator. People say, which elevator Sheikh? Everybody is looking to go to the elevator. So, yeah, this compensate. But seriously, it's a life decision. When you marry one, when you take someone as a spouse, you cannot compromise in your religion for beauty or for wealth or for lineage. You choose and try your level best and do your due diligence to pick the right one. She's going to be your wife, who you'll be stuck with for the rest of your life, hopefully. She's going to be the mother of your children. She's going to be the daughter-in-law of your mom. So, it's a full package. You may need some time to look into it. But when you make the decision, pray istikhara and go for it and try to get someone better than you in religion. Someone that drags you up, not drags you down, and Allah knows best."
