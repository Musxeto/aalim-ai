  "transcript": "what are the best and most efficient way to memorize the Quran well this is not an answer that can fit all it's not one size that fits all some people memorize the Quran through writing and this is what is known in the old times as Al or Al tab they used to take the children when they're seven or eight years old they give them a black board small board and they write the Ayah the verse the one verse and they erase it and they they say it out of memory to the sheh if it is correct they move on to the second Ayah or they would have to write it again and again and again and definitely writing is one of the easiest ways to memorize anything do because the more you write it the uh uh easier it is to stick to your mind that is why long AO to those who are old and know the usages of blackboards this is what the teacher used to do he he would reprimand a student or a pupil by asking him or her to write on the board 100 times I will not uh uh throw something on the floor again or I will not run in the corridors again so this would make the students realize and memorize this for good other people would probably uh think that uh memorizing it by repeating it without writing it some find it easier to memorize at the end of the night others find it easier and best for them to memorize the Quran after F or just before fer uh other people find it easier for them to memorize it on their own other folks say know it's easier for us to recite uh the Quran and read it to others so when we are in a group we tend to memorize it easier than when we are on our own therefore it depends from person to person I believe that memorizing a small portion of the of the Quran let's say one page and revising it in night prayer every uh night this makes it stick into your mind uh likewise if you hear it in the car and you recite it with the reader from the T from the tape or from the cassette or from the DVD by reciting it over and over this uh inshallah makes it easier for you to uh Rec"
