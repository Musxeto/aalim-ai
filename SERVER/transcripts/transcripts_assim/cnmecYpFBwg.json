  "transcript": "[Music] alhamd we are still in the chapter that deals with marriage and the Hadith that we have today is Hadith number 303 which anas Malik may Allah be pleased with him reported so who will be kind enough to read this Hadith for us yes reported that some of the companion of Allah's Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam asked his wives about the act that he performed in private someone among them said I will not marry woman and someone among them said I will not eat meat and someone among them said I will not lie down in bed he the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam praised Allah and glorified him and said what is with these people saying so and so but I pray and sleep I fast and suspend observing fast and a marry woman he who turns away from myah he has no relation with me very good now we know of course and it's obvious the relation of this Hadith to the chapter that deals with marriage because these were three Companions of the Prophet wasam they were so afraid of Hellfire and so eager to be admitted to Paradise so they wanted to check on what the prophet Alam being the best among the Muslims and the messenger of Allah they wanted to check what he does in private so they went to the wives of the Prophet Alam who happened to be their mothers the mothers of the Believers and they described what the prophet's daily routine was these three men thought that this was nothing compared to them they expected that it would be much more so they Justified this and said oh of course the prophet Alam was Exempted from all of his previous and upcoming sins Allah forgave everything so no matter what he does he's forgiven so he's not like us so one of them said I will never marry women the other one said I will not eat meat meaning that he would fast every single day and only break his fast after Sunset and the third one said I will not touch a bed what does that have to do with being righteous and God-fearing meaning that he will never sleep at night he will always pray night prayer the whole period when the prophet heard of thisat he went to the pulpit praised Allah and glorified him and then said why do people say such and such again the prophet did notam name people he just gave sallallahu alaihi wasallam the concept why do people do so and so by Allah I marry women and I fast and I break my fast and I sleep at night and I pray whoever runs away from my Sunnah whoever wants another Sunnah different than mine he is not from Among Us now this leads us to go to the following Hadith that is Hadith number 304 who read this Hadith for us the brother there reported the messenger of Allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam rejected the idea of M living in celibacy and if he the holy prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam had given him permission he would have got ourselves castrated okay now this Hadith goes and revolves around the same concept people think that not marrying that staying away from women totally that living the life of cacy or having oneself cerated that this is something good and draws you closer to Allah Islam is unlike other religions Islam forbids this this can be found in other religions correct if you go to some religions you'll have monks who never marry and live for ever until they die without any marriage if you go to some sect in Christianity the priests never marry the nuns never marry and they tell people you have to be righteous and God-fearing like us so if everyone became as righteous and God-fearing then we will have no life on Earth because everybody would die and this is not natural Allah is the creator of the heavens and the Earth he created us as he said inah doesn't he know who he created the answer is definitely yes this is a rhetorical question the answer is definitely Allah knows who he created and that is why it is Allah who permitted us to live and to enjoy life now it is true that Allah created us only to worship him but part of worshiping him is to enjoy what is halal and part of what is halal is to get married this is something natural and from these two hadiths we learn that whoever wants to oppose nature he is sinful he is not rewarded for that in the Hadith where the three came and asked about the prophet's forms of worship sallallahu alaih wasallam so that man who said will not marry it was not because he hated women on the contrary he loved women so much that he wanted to get closer to Allah by making it forbidden on himself and the other man who wanted to pray all night he loved sleeping but he want to Prive himself from this part of enjoying life so that he would get closer to Allah and so on the prophet told him this is this is not not his religion Islam is a religion of being moderate of being on the middle path Allah permits you to get married and forbids you to fornicate and this was not only the feeling of these companions even may Allah be pleased with him they all went to the prophet Alat seeking his approval to castrate themselves meaning to prevent and to stop themselves from being able to have sex they wanted to live a life of celibacy not being associated with women like monks Prophet approve of that definitely not he forbade them from doing such a thing why because the human race has to continue secondly Islam is a religion that caters for the needs of the human beings if you go against your nature and prevent or forbid things that are needed you will re result to Haram things and that is why unfortunately in some religions where men do not get married and women do not get married and they claim to devote themselves to Allah and his worship you end up finding them fornicating and you end up finding illegitimate Offspring children being born out of wedlock you find homosexuality and we hear the news we read it in different countries of the world where such monks and such people who claim to be closer to Allah who refuse who reject their human nature and say that we would live the life of celibacy we find them being exposed in the media their houses of worship is used to Harbor such sins of fornication and not only that child abuse and we hear the confession of lots of men who were abused by such men of religion Islam tells you no marry one not enough two not enough three not enough four with a very big condition which is that you are fair to all of them and that you are physically and financially capable of sufficing them other than that it is forbidden for you to get married to more than one so from this Hadith we learn that it is not part of Islam not to get married on the contrary this is the Sunnah of the Prophet Alam but does this mean that it is mandatory to get married no it is forbidden not to marry to get closer to Allah this becomes an innovation this is forbidden we have a

India on peace TV and welcome back we open the floor for questions so the first brother my question in regards with the part of an Hadith where Prophet Sall said he who turns away from my Sunnah he has no relationship with me can you elaborate more on it okay this sentence has been mentioned by the prophet in a different number of hadiths for example one of the most famous one when the prophet went to the market and he saw a pile of food wheat or grain he put his hand inside and he finds wetness so he asked oh owner of this pile of food what is this witness inside he said oh prophet of Allah last night it was raining so it was soaked with water which spoils it which spoils your grain or wheat so I turned it over so it would be dry from the outside this is type of what of cheating so the prophet said whoever cheats us is not from among us even in other hadiths the prophet saysat whoever raises his arms raises his weapon he's not from Among Us the prophet says whoever does not trim his mustach he's not from among us all of these hadiths indicate not that the person who does this is a cfir or has nullified his Islam No it clarifies that whoever does such things has not fulfilled the 60 plus branches of Iman the prophet sallallah wasallam said IM is 60 plus branches the highest is ill and the lowest is removing harmful stuff from people's way and bashfulness or Al shyness is a branch of IM from this Hadith we learn that it's 60 plus branches which means that you cannot be a full-fledged mmin you can be a Muslim but not a full-fledged mmin until you achieve these 60 plus branches so if you for example choose not to get married and this is against the Sunnah of the Prophet Alat then you have not f filled your levels and branches of Iman not that you are a cfir so I hope this clarifies this second question my question is from the previous sessions topic that if the father of the male does not approve to the marriage so is the marriage allowed to get forwarded okay very good question we spoke before when we were talking about marriage that the consent and approval of the guardian of the girl is essential and if it's not there then the marriage is invalid the contract is void so the brother is asking what about the boy's father is his approval part of the marriage and the answer is no a boy's will is independent unlike the girl's will in marriage she has to have her Guardians approval as for the boy he could marry even if his parents are against his marriage now IM my encouraging youngsters to go okay I'm going to get married no there is a difference between the validity of the contract and being encouraged to do so as a marriage contract it is correct and the marriage is valid if you have children they're yours legally islamically they're born out of authentic and acceptable marriage however it is not recommended to go against your parents will unless they are unlawful in their refusal and rejection so if a boy says I am 19 or 18 years of age I want to get married my father is not allowing me or my father approves of my marriage my mother opposes it and I want to get married even though we ask this brother wait why are you doing this said I love this girl okay then what majority of such similar cases marriage take place they lived together for five six years they have children they want to visit the father and the mother of the boy and they refuse and if they accept they will treat the woman the wife their daughter-in-law in a very bad way you're the one who made our son disobey us and marry you and sometimes there will happen as usually does with all spouses few arguments and the man goes to his parents and tell them them and they say this is what we told you this is what you deserve and then they end up in marriage or unhappy L my advice is there are so many women to get try your level best to choose the one that pleases your parents as much as possible but if your parents are wrongdoers themselves you give them a list of 100 women and they say no no none of them who who do you want me to marry you have to marry your cousin I don't want to marry my cousin you must if you don't we will be angry with you and Allah would put you in hell this is not acceptable this is what they usually do this is not acceptable so the approval of the parents for the boy is not part of the marriage contract but it is highly recommended to obtain that yes brother Alum my question is how do you choose a woman to marry if we are not allowed to look at the opposite sex well first of all there is the section phase and after the selection phase comes the engagement phase which is preceded by looking at one another the selection phase means that you ask who is suitable to get married to usually you ask your mother your sister your Maham women so they look around and they say well we heard that the family of so and so they have a good suitable girl that fits your description you tell them go and see her they go this is what happens in Arabia and this is the conventional way of getting married I don't know them what happens is that my mother my sister go and see and they come to me they say mallah she's religiously practicing they give me the picture of describing her so that I would see okay if I like what I hear I make an appointment with her father the father sits with me interviews me looks at at my credentials looks at my religious practice and my and he tries to ask around he asks around in my locality my Masjid my work so the father asks about me at school at work and where I live where I go my friends and if he's okay with that he appoints time where I will come and visit him in the house I go and while I'm talking to him he calls his daughter she comes she sits we talk to each other in his presence 15 minutes 20 minutes half an hour depending she has questions she asks me I have questions I ask her usually people are shy so she would be looking in the ground he would be looking in the ground and they would not look at each other because they're still young but then they are encouraged they have ways of doing this I remember my first wife when I proposed to her she said after getting married mallah you so shy you did not look I love this in you I said who told you so I was looking in the table in front of you the mirror and I was looking and and I liked what I saw so there are ways once you do this and there is mutual liking now she saw me and I saw her we go home in the evening the family's called yes we like what we see we saw and they say yes we she liked what she saw alhamdulillah we get married this is the proper way of doing it but to think that she how can I get married without seeing the opposite sex so what do you want to do I'd like to go to the female college and you know just wander around and and look and yes this is not acceptable can we have like two months before marriage just to get to know each other no no premarital relationship neither on Facebook nor on Twitter nor on chatting Medias no smss no phone calls all of this is har he is a complete stranger to you and she is a complete stranger to you we're engaged you're not married yet he could change mind anytime she can change her mind any time that you're not still married so this is a very sensitive issue that all people should be aware of yes sir how do we ensure that we are just between our wives spiritually emotionally first of all it is impossible to be fair with your wives emotionally definitely you will love one more than the other and this is something that only Allah controls the love in the heart is in the hands of Allah but what Allah holds you accountable for is what you show is what you spend is the time you allocate so in Islam this is what you're supposed to be fair in in the time one night here one night here if you love this one more it is forbidden for you to spend two nights here and one night here MoneyWise it is forbidden for you to buy this one gift and things and perfumes and new dresses and this one that you do not like you buy her only onions and garlic this is not acceptable you have to be fair in gifts and also in accommodation it is not befitting that you put your wife with your mother and father in a house and the other one you give her a house of her own or something that is more expensive and lavish than the other one you have to be fair in such expenditures emotions this is uncontrollable and of course you cannot express your love to this one and to this one express your hatred this is not being fair the least don't show your emotions don't show the one that you don't love as much that you do not love her as much show her as they say fake it try to do something that at least would be acceptable to her does Islam encourages to marry four or discourages because in one verse it says that marry two three or four and in another words it say if you are not able to deal justly marry only one in other words it say it says that and never be able to deal justly with a woman so what should there are two ayas that covers this the first one the one that says that marry twice Thrice or four times but if you're unable to be fair then only marry one this is one verse and the other verse I think it's 126 inaha chapter four I think it's something like 126 121 where Allah says you will not be able to be fair with women even if you are trying your best if you continue the Ayah Allah says to us that in this case if you're unable to be fair do not leave her hanging meaning do not transgress on the woman that you do not love as much as the first one so you leave her hanging not giving her a rice no you you cannot be fair in your emotions but you can be fair in what you spend and how to be equal with both now does Islam encourage marrying more than one it depends on the individual if you are happy with one and you have no need for one and there is no woman who is in need of getting married and is unable to find someone to marry her then yes remain married to one but if you have the need to marry one find financially capable and there are women who need to be married and not finding people or men to marry them because the percentage usually men are more are lesser and fewer in number than women if this is the case then you're encouraged to marry and Allah knows best this is all the time we have until we meet next time oh [Music]"
