  "transcript": "me oh always in continuation of working for the sake of allah it all started when he was revealed to for the first time by the archangel gabriel delivering the message of allah and allah azzawajal instructed him that o wrapped in your blankets stand up and deliver the message of allah azzawajal and when khadija may allah be pleased with her call the prophet salla to come and sleep he told her the time of sleep my beloved khadijah has gone now it's all time the only the only time remaining is to call people and to work for the sake of allah azza after the battle of khaibar and after the truth has been signed with the polyphist of quraysh in what was known as the agreement of hudaibiyah or the truth of hudabia after the prophet sallam utilized all his efforts to conquer and subdue the jews around medina one would think that it's time for him to rest but this was not the case on the month of shaaban the eighth month of the islamic calendar on the eighth year of hijrah the tribe of bani bakr assaulted the tribe of huzzara and just as a reminder one of the items in the treaty of hudabia in the truce of hudaibiyah was that whoever enters in alliance with the prophet any attack against him would be an attack on the muslims and whoever enters in the alliance of the politics of quraish any attack on that tribe would be considered as an attack on the people of quraish now huzzah immediately after signing this agreement went into the alliance of the muslims and the prophets went in alliance with the people of quraysh before this they had tens of years of history in bloody feud among them so just when they thought it was safe for them because they were in the alliance of a strong power banu bakker thought of it as the chance for them to avenge the old dead the dead and the old battles that was oh that were with them or between them so on the month of shaban in the middle of the night the tribe of banu bakker assaulted the tribe of while they were at a water by the name of water they were close to a well as you know that the arabs usually traveled as nomads and they used to set camp next to water wells and oasis so they were close to this oasis or this well by the name of water they raided them while they were asleep so they had taken them by surprise they slaughtered 20 of them and the tribe of jose woke up in fear and terror they went immediately to mecca because it was known to be the haram the sacred area so arabs even though they were not muslims they considered the haram area the forbidden area from launching attacks so they even went to the kaaba itself and the tribesmen of baru bakker told their chief that ye naufal this is the haram and this is your god these are your gods and naofa said a very strong word he said no gods today today we avenge our dead from the tribe of huzzah so they kept on fighting this tribe where in the haram and they were aided by the polytheist of quraish okay banu bakker the the the apologist of supplied banu bakker with weapons they supplied them with slaves and some of them actually contributed to the fights physically and among the dignitaries of quraish so one of the tribe of huzzah went to the prophet he immediately went to medina of course those who were attacked by the haram they went to the house of buddha who was one of the dignitary and to another man by the name of rafa seeking seeking asylum so that no one would attack them now this went straight to medina and as the habit of arabs he said poetry requesting the assistance of the prophet alaihis as he was their main ally and he said beautiful verses and beautiful lines of poetry that made the prophet alaihis tell him and give him the glad tiding that by allah you were granted victory and i'm coming with you and this was enough now the prophet salaam and this is a clear sign of how fair the prophet alison was with his enemies the agreement was if one of our allies was attacked this gives us a right to consider this agreement as if it was not uh uh it's broken it's broken so it gives me the right to go and attack you the prophet could have done this also some easily but because he was fair and just he sent a messenger to the people of mecca dignitaries of makkah giving them three choices he told them first choice get rid of the alliance of banu bakker and tell them that you're not allied with us anymore you're on your own so we take care of them second choice you have to pay the blood money to the tribe of hosa for those whom you had killed this is fair yeah if you don't like any of the two choices then it's war between you and us the answer was very negative still the polytheist of mecca thought that they had the power to fight the muslims they were still defiant thinking that we're arrogant we can do whatever we want and they sent the messenger back with this negative reply and just as he was leaving they felt sorry they realized that they had made the mistake of their lives because they had the recollection of what took place with the prophet salam and the muslims and they found it all to be against them yeah so they thought that oops we made a mistake and apparently we're going to pay dearly for it if you were in their shoes what would you do surrender to the muslims well it's too late now so muhammad for me i'll try to get hold of the messenger before he go back to the prophet salallahu and try to you know change my mind and tell him that i have changed my mind that would have been a very good idea but it was too late the messenger had arrived in medina so the last thing that they could do is to request the prophet sallam to neglect that message and renew the contract again with them the agreement again and prolong the truce so they sent their top dignitary they sent abu sufyan abu sufyan went to madinah of course after he sought the uh the permission to enter medina because he is our enemy and also this is reported in the books of hadith that all of these were considered to be slaves at the early time of islam in mecca they were sitting and in came abu sufyan with the company of someone to protect him and the story says that they looked at him and said by allah our swords the swords of allah did not take what is what it should had taken from this man we couldn't kill him and and they were saying that this was the right moment and they're you know they're sorry he was not killed in battle now remember the man is coming to ask for renewal renewal of the agreement may allah be pleased with him was present and he heard them and he told them do you say this to the top man in quraysh in one of the top dignitaries of our tribe by allah i'm going to say that to the prophet i'm going to tell him what you said and abu bakr al-sadiq imagine now who was talking and a group of companions companions who were slaves slaves and those names all of them uh most of them lost their freedom for a while i was he lost all of his money there they lost something they were all slaves they were deprived of everything yes yeah so he went to the prophet and he told them told him what they said about abu sufyan and the prophet sallam his answer was astonishing stay tuned and inshallah after the break i'll tell you what the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said according to the quran we live in a universe that worships allah it is not just human beings who celebrate his praises but animals as well join us every wednesday at 20 gmt for your show even animals glorify may allah be pleased with him heard something that was a straightforward insult to the dignitary of quraysh abu sufyan a group of the companions who were before enslaved by the pagans and they themselves were set free by abu bakr himself yes he heard them say by allah our swords did not take what it was its own uh uh from this enemy of allah and they were pointing at abu sufyan so they felt that their swords did not take a taste of abu sufyan's blood yeah and they're regretting this abu bakr told them do you say this to the dignitary the top man the top brass of a quraysh by allah i will tell the prophet so he went to the prophet complaining about what the companions said and thinking that they shouldn't have said this so the prophet alaihis al-assam said did you make them angry by allah if you made them angry allah is angry with you imagine this amount of respect to those who are weak and poor to those who are enslaved and also this is a footnote islam thinks highly of those who are poor and weak and the prophet sallam told us in the authentic hadith that he told the muslims do you think that allah grants you victory other than because of the prayers of your weak ones allah does not grant you victory except because of these prayers so the prophet sallam put it in black and white to abu bakr abu bakr though you are my closest friend and ally though you are my beloved companion though you are the first to enter paradise from my followers and by far you are the best of them all yet if you made these four if you made these companions angry by allah you have made allah angry abu bakr immediately not adding any word or complaint he went to the companions and said oh brothers have i made you angry ask allah for forgiveness for me and they immediately with clean hearts other people would say that yes you made us angry you're talking to us and we're your brothers against this infidel against this enemy of allah they immediately said we ask and pray allah azza to forgive you our brother beautiful hearts clean white and pure abu sufyan requested an appointment with the prophet and while waiting he thought of passing by his daughter and his daughter was um habiba and um as you all remember was one of the migrants to abyssinia and the prophet sallam sent proposing to her to the najashi the leader of obsidian and he married her there and when she came to medina on the seventh year a year ago then she became among the mothers of the believers abu sufyan went to visit his daughter and she greeted him and the minute he went into her room he wanted to sit on the mattress of the prophet salazar she quickly folded it so that he would sit on the ground and abu sufyan was shocked and astonished and he said daughter i don't know which one was it was it that you thought that this mattress was not clean and honorable for me to sit on that's why you folded it or was it that you thought it was too clean and too honorable for me to sit on which one was it i don't know i'm astonished so she told him that by allah this is the mattress of the prophet of allah and no way as an infidel as a pagan as a idol worshipper that you would sit on the mattress of the prophet and the guy was shocked he said by allah nothing good happened to you after you left me because is this a way to treat me your father and the top dignitary of mecca and of course nothing in her heart was more valuable than the messenger of allah and that's why she migrated to abyssinia and then traveled from abyssinia to medina for the sake of allah and for the love of islam class question sure how does islam look on non-muslims in regards to treatment whether it be someone became muslim how do they treat his mother his father his friends what is the relationship between us well as you can tell from the seerah itself that the prophet is the best example yes now regarding the fathers and the mothers the prophet sallam had great love to them though he could not have any recollection of his father because he died while he was an infant or some say as his mother was pregnant and his mother he could only have little recollection of because she died when he was less than six years old and most of his time was in the wilderness where he was breastfed and raised by tribes yes it this is the custom of the people of mecca they used to give their children in infancy to be breastfed in the wilderness because the air was cleaner the environment was cleaner and they would become stronger and tougher and at the same time the food is much cleaner and it is best for their arabic for their tongue so that their arabic and their language would be perfect so the prophet sallam despite all of this had great love for his mother and it was reported in the sahih that he once cried and the companion is companions asked him why why did you why do you cry he told them that i requested allah the almighty that i may pray for my mother and ask him for forgiveness he deprived me from doing that which meant that she is not from the people of paradise she is in health and this is punishment from allah so this what made him cry because she was his mother the prophet sallam also taught us as was revealed in the holy quran as in surat alan kabut and elsewhere that allah tells us that even if your parents struggle and do their very best to make you associate others with allah this is a serious offense yet allah tells you that do not obey them if they ask you to associate others with allah yet accompany them in good manners though they are asking you to commit an act of blasphemy to associate others with allah don't obey them but be nice to them it tells us also the seerah that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam used to treat the non-muslims in a very nice way for example adivan had him and he was the son of the dignitary hatimat the most generous man of the whole of arabia he was a christian and he was the leader of his tribe when he came to the prophet the prophet hosted him in his house and he gave him a couch to lean on and this is form of hospitality and he received him in a very nice way the prophet himself used to visit those who were not muslim and calling them to islam in a very nice way as he did with the young jew who used to serve the prophet sallam and got sick the prophet visited him and he called him to islam the boy looked at his father and his father told him obey abel qasim the prophet of allah and he accepted islam yes yes the prophet himself alice al-sam used to answer the invitations of non-muslims as in the a case of the wife of salaam mushkim the jew she was a jew herself she invited the prophet alice of and his companions to a a feast to to a dinner party or lunch party and she presented them with a sheep but she had poison in it yeah and the prophet saws got poisoned and one of his companions died because of that it tells us that muslims should have equal term they should treat the non-muslims in a very nice way not taking them as allies not taking them as close friends and buddies but to treat them as they treat anybody else in the sense that to have a good ethics when treating them you do not cheat them you do not lie to them and you do not misbehave in the sense that people would think that because they are not muslims because they are disbelievers it's okay for us to beat them to steal from them to kill them no it's not the point is that uh if we say we have the truth we have the quran and the sunnah we should be an example so that if they look at us they want to follow us but if our example is bad then they're going to run away from us well this is also it has two points to it one point is being fair yes now if i claim to be a muslim but i am a bad muslim this should not reflect on islam yes it's the same thing when i go to ireland and i see the catholics and the protestants fighting and killing each other it's unfair for me to say that christianity is a violent religion and all of them are killers but at the same time it puts a great responsibility on each and every muslims to be as some scholars describe it a walking quran so you should have this in in you the way you talk the way you look the way you treat others because whatever you you're gonna do it's gonna be magnified under the microscope yes so if you say something if you behave in a certain way everybody is gonna misinterpret this yes and they wanna label islam of the way that you have done this and if you look at um habiba's role in all of this it portrays to you that she thought and she believed that islam would always prevail and that is why she received her father in a very nice way she didn't tell him and at the door leave he cannot be here i don't want to talk to you you're an infidel you're a disbeliever on the country she accepted him received him but he may not sit on the mattress of the prophet by no means i believe that this is all the time we have for today's program until we meet next time was allah um hmm"
