  "title": "Is makhraj necessary for pronouncing letters & for our prayers to be valid? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "check is makraj mandatory for correct pronouncing of arabic letters and the prayer to be accepted this is too generic uh shihab and i always receive a lot of such questions and i direct people to go to an arab native and recite this in front of them see maharish is the place where the air comes out depending on the place of the tongue in your mouth so if you don't pronounce it correctly and you don't let the air out from the right passage referring to the mouth of course then you have a problem so if someone says this is the right pronunciation of the letter va in the word young but if someone says this is not the right and it's wrong and if someone pronounces the letter bod that's the right pronunciation if he uses the wrong mahras he says that's inappropriate and wrong and he should try to fix it so you have to sit in front of an arab it's highly recommended that he's an expert in tajweed and recitation of the quran so that he could correct you and direct you in a better way and allah knows best you"
