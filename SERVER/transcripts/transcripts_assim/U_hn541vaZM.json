  "title": "Dyeing the hair black for young people - Sheikh Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "the question is a man who is thirty years of age and he's married and recently and he has gray hair a lot of gray hair on his head so can he dye it in black dyeing the hair in black is forbidden and this is the most authentic opinion of scholars because the Prophet is awesome when he came on the eighth year to Makkah and the conquest of Makkah Abu who had the father of Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him was brought to him and his hair and beard was all white so the Prophet said has some changed this whiteness and avoid black so dyeing and black is not permissible and this is the most authentic opinion of scholars however we have a rule in Islam that if something is abnormal then to restore it to its normal condition it's permissible so someone who is thirty years of age it's not normal to have all of his hair white so if this happens due to an illness it is permissible to dye his hair back into black as it was because this is removing the abnormality a person has having six fingers this is abnormal we surgically remove the six finger so it would be a normal so if the brothers asking this question has a number of white hair inner like 610 this is normal but if it's all white or the majority of his hair is white giving him 20 years over his actual age in this case it is permissible to abnormality and allah azza wajal knows best"
