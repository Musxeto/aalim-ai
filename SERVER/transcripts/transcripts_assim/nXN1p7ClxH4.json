  "transcript": "question just may Allah promote you to a split unit I want to ask if a woman is shy to say can the father say for her of course this is a place of bargaining so the the woman is not yeah comfortable in stating her mAh usually women don't say their M and the man comes for the show the first interview so that they can see one another he speaks she speaks about their ambition aspirations their uh future plans and there is chemistry between them she doesn't conclude by saying okay I'd like to have 10 million chillings as a Mahar say no this is too expensive what's your model I'm 20 24 said no no no too expensive give us a discount 50% this is not done like this a woman is bashful she doesn't speak about these things yes after there is mutual uh uh liking then they sent their approval The Father's Side sent his consent then they negotiate and the man says well he for my daughter we would expect to have X amount as do Mah and that usually around the people there's an average every country has an average so usually it's like $5,000 I don't know how much is it here more less I should be coming and visiting no alhamdulillah so usually it's $5,000 in Saudi it's like maybe1 to $20,000 dowy it depends on the income and and if there is gold involved some countries they would say $1,000 in America maybe they would say anything but but it has to be according to the norm of the people you don't want to take less so that they would not insult your daughter and you don't want to pay too much that would it make a burden for the others when they want to get married and Allah Knows Best"
