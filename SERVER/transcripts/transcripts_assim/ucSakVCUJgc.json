  "title": "Should One Make up for Fasts Missed During Non-Practicing Days?",
  "transcript": "[Music] I recently started practicing Islam and taking it more seriously how should I make up the fasts for the previous 10 years which I have missed good question first of all the days that you have missed are one of two either you decided from night time not too fast or more meaning that a lot of the Muslims simply don't have the intention to fast so they don't fast the whole month or 10 days or one week or whatever they don't even bother by eating suhoor the pre-dawn meal and fast half of the day they don't fast to begin with or a person fasted couple of hours or so and then broke his fast so these are two different scenarios if the ten years that you have skipped if you were from the first scenario meaning that you are so neglectful you were so heedless that you didn't even intend to fast tomorrow so tomorrow is the first day of Ramadan tomorrow is the tenth day of Ramadan who cares I'm not fasting you go to bed intending not too fast to wake up not fasting eating and drinking it whatever if this is the case then you cannot make up for these ten years what do you mean share well actually allah azzawajal has instructed you to fast and gave you a time limit to fast and you skipped fasting intentionally without any legitimate reason in this case you cannot make up for the missed days likewise with prayer by the way Alonzo gel has prescribed upon us to pray of the from this particular time where when it begins and it finishes at the time of a sir during which I didn't pray why didn't you pray well I was at my work at my desk working then we had a come / a couple of conference calls then we had a meeting with the boss then I was too lazy it's like half an hour to prayer I don't feel like praying now and the van was called and all of a sudden I have did not pray the whole a stop for Allah I'm gonna pray it now no no don't bother you can't I can't yes you can't and if you do a low not accepted come on shift what is the concept of Allah in Arabic is Allah so what's the concept of cuz' making it up a making it up when you have a legitimate reason such as over sleeping or forgetfulness I always pray on time the heart of Prayer was called hollows okay in 10 minutes I'm going to go to the message and pray I started on my email I got few phone calls I met my boss I totally forgot though her prayer until awesome was then given yeah Wow I didn't pray well why I forgot I can make it up because I have a legitimate reason the Prophet said Nana his salat WA Salam whoever oversleeps upon a prayer or forgets it must pray it as soon as he remembers it there's no expiration for that now listen carefully must pray it as soon as he remembers it there is no expiration expiration for what forgetfulness and oversleeping are already exempted by allah azza wajal from vanilla to a hidden escena of Tana do not uh-uh-uh-uh-uh hold us accountable if we forget or her make an error and also the prophecy that the pan is uplifted from those who are who is asleep until he wakes up so there's no sin on me yes yet the Prophet said there is no expiation for what was done except to pray it as soon as you remember which means that if you're neither sleeping nor forgetting then you cannot pray it you cannot make it up and I'll give you a third example when do people go to Hajj in Arafah answers on the ninth of the age' all go to alpha which is a pillar of Hajj I come from my country wearing my haram on the seventh day two days before our own I'm eager and I'm happy I go to the customs they look into my passport they check my visa and they see that there is some mistake earth they detained me for four nights frustrated hurt angry on the first night they say now you can leave we rectify the mistake we've checked with the embassy it's authentic you can go so now it is the 11th of the ledger every single program is in Mena so immediately from the airport I go to Arafat to Mount Arafat not a single soul is there so I stay there and what are you doing I'm performing Hajj excuse me yeah but I was detained for four nights what do you expect okay but hedges on the 9th of Arafah I know but what do you want me to do I came all the way so I have to sorry no can do because hatch is prescribed at a specific time and you've missed the time Allah says in the Quran in NASA data can add al mumineen he tab and mo puta that verily prayer was prescribed upon the believers at specific times if you miss the time you missed a prayer I'll make it up you don't have a legitimate reason it's gone forever fasting was prescribed in Ramadan if you come a month earlier you say hmm Shabbat is a good month I'm gonna fast Ramadan in Shaban does it work definitely not if you say this Ramadan I have a lot of football matches tennis tournaments I'm a sportsman I'm not gonna fast Ramadan I'm gonna shift it to show well it doesn't work okay it's not up to me in you it is specifically set at a particular date you miss it no legitimate reason read it very well it's gone scenario number two I woke up with the intention of fasting I had to hold last night and I'm tending to fast 10 o'clock god I'm hungry look right look left no one is watching opened the can of tuna fish put some lemon some salt black pepper maybe a little bit of onions excellent some bread and a glass of milk and I consumed this meal I broke my fast after Ramadan I regretted it chef can I make up that miss day or am I considered to be like our friend who missed the 10 years without any legitimate reason in your case you have to make up he objects what's the difference between me and him ah I'll tell you the difference the difference is that he started the worship and he broke it intentionally he has to make it up because he started it you on the other hand did not even intend to start it so it's gone the time is gone it's missed so as a punishment for him he has to make up what he broke any any bada that you break you have to make it up if a person was in hedge in Islam one of the things that are restricted for him before the day of Arafah is to have intimacy with his spouse if he has intimacy with his spouse if he has intimacy with his spouse in his Haram his Hajj is invalid he has to sacrifice a camel or a cow he has to continue this present Hajj and next year he has to perform a new hush because this hide was totally invalid capiche so it's the same thing this guy he broke his fast he has to make it up this guy did not fast nor intend to fast to begin with then he cannot make that up and I hope this explains things to you [Music] you [Applause]"
