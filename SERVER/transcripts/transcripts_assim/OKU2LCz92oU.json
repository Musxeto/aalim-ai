  "title": "Fermentation - Beans with foam on top halal to eat or intoxication? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "man from the U.S so we had some beans and lentils soaking in water and they were covered and they were sitting like that for two days and then after the two days when you would look at it you would see foam on the top and I read online that fermentation starts after 24 hours of soaking so I don't know if like something happened to the water and it became like alcoholic or something and if these beans are Halal to eat I cannot answer this question because I don't have knowledge in it fermentation usually takes place when you put raisins or the likes dates maybe something that is sweet in water and it stays for a couple of days three days and then it may become nabiv and the beef is something that is soaked in water and it has a sweet taste not necessarily fermented not necessarily alcoholic or intoxicating but there is a chance of it being intoxicating so usually when you put beans in water you're not gonna drink the water I hope you're going to use the beans because now it's they're softened and you can use them to cook or to use in food which usually is not intoxicating but you can tell by the taste of the water if you take it give it a taste and it's like stinging and and it has a weird taste I don't I hope it doesn't intoxicate you and those people of expert would probably know whether it is intoxicating or not but are the beans intoxicating I don't think so I don't have knowledge in this so I cannot put any valuable information to it you have to ask maybe a chemistry teacher maybe a biology a biology teacher who would put some info into this [Music] and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and the evening I will uh try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah"
