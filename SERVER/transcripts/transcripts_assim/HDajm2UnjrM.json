  "title": "Am I sinful if I recite Quran fast in order to complete it, is Tajweed mandatory",
  "transcript": "Abdur-Rafa' says sometimes I'd like to go \nfor quantity rather than quality which is not   prohibited so in order to finish the Quran   in a shorter period of time I may be \nrequired to recite in al hadar in a fast   pace which means that a lot of the mudud \nwould be shortened so instead of saying I would say: wassama i wa tariq so that's half the time would I be \nsinful for that the answer is no,   you will not be sinful because \nat-tajweed is not mandatory to do these   mudud is a highly recommended sunnah and \nis part of the quality of your recitation   of the Quran but it is not mandatory \nand you can skip that without a problem"
