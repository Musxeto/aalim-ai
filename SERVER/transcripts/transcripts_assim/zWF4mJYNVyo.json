  "title": "Struggling in reciting tahweed in prayer, what to do & is it mandatory? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "me so Sheikh in our country Pakistan many people recite Arabic just like Urdu because it has the same characters as Arabic so since I have started to try to recite the the Jewish right in Salah I am not able to recite in the moderate volume and speed either I recite it a bit loud or I decided to slow so what should I do in this case actually they say practice makes perfect tajweed is not mandatory in your recitation of the Quran or in your Salat so you don't have to have Ahmed al-wagib in you don't have to have if you say was that that's the job and your recitation is valid your prayer is valid however the more you perfect your recitation for the sake of Allah and not to please others and not to impress others then you are rewarded for that and practice makes perfect with the grace of Allah so the more you repeat and repeat and repeat the more you listen to a good reciter and recite with him you will find that you have perfected it with the grace of Allah in no time"
