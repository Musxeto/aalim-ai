  "title": "Did Prophet salla Allahu alaihi wa sallam have knowledge of the unseen(ilm ul ghaib)?",
  "transcript": "Reyes or release asked a question through the email and he said did prophet muhammad sallallahu alayhi wasallam have a real male Elmo ape translates into English to the knowledge of the unseen so it is unseen to us what had happened in the previous centuries it is unseen to us what will happen in the future it is unknown to us what is happening in the oceans and underneath the earth or what's happening in the heavens and the hell for example so all of this is known to be real moon rape and this is part of the knowledge that allah azza wajal kept for himself allah says no one in the heavens and the earth knows the unseen the rape except allah and they do not know when they will be resurrected meaning after death so this type of knowledge only is known to Allah however Allah tells us that he may reveal parts of this knowledge to selected messengers of his so in a sense the unseen on earth is relative so here I can see things this is alum of Shahada I can witness things I can see it what's beyond the walls of this studio is unseen for me it's rape but those who are behind and beyond the wall they know what's happening so to them it's not unseen likewise but on a really larger scale people don't know the unseen but when Allah Azza WA JAL tells his messengers about it and they reveal some of it to us this is with the permission of Allah so the prophet alayhi salatu salam had prophecies and we see that a lot of them had taken place and a lot will take place without a shred of doubt this is part of the unseen that Allah has revealed to his messenger sallallahu alayhi wa sallam however he does not know when his death will come sallallahu wasallam he does not know what is stored for him or for his Ummah except that Allah which Allah had told him about Allah says in the Quran that the Prophet says if I were to know the unseen I would have gathered a lot of good if I know as a human being the unseen what will happen in the future there are so many things that I would not do because I know the outcome of it because I know the unseen I would have chosen to buy certain stocks because I know tomorrow the prices will go up and sell some stocks because the prices would go down but people do not know that and see and no one can know the unseen so to answer your question release the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam does not know the unseen however unfortunately though allah clearly stated and the prophet in in the Quran and the Prophet told us that there are five keys of the unseen that only Allah know of yet still some deviant sects in Islam pretend and claim that the Prophet Elisha had these five keys of the unseen so they say that the Prophet Isom knows when the hour is when the day of judgment is and they also claim that the prophet Elijah knows when people would die knows this and knows that and all of this is baseless and not true therefore one has to abide by the Quran and Sunnah and one must not elevate the Prophet allosaurus era over the level that Allah had placed him nor looked down at him below the status of prophets and messengers and the most beloved to Allah the all-mighty"
