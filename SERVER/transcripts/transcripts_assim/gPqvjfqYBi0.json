  "transcript": "Rupa from Bangladesh at what level of knowledge does a student of knowledge attain the ability to choose a fatwa from multiple fatwas based on evidence what qualifications should one have for this as I said he has to be a student of knowledge he has to know Arabic he has to have the basics of Quran so that when he Compares Apple to Apple he could know for you for example someone who doesn't know Arabic you get the fatwa of Alani and you look into them and say I don't know sometimes the Sheikh may have done a mistake through Arabic and he misunderstood it so you follow that while ignoring the other two this is wrong you're not qualified to choose sometimes in the sheh takes something that is sh or or not the norm and applies it where it should have been rejected due to that this is again your fault sometimes he makes this if you don't have the necessary and needy tools you cannot go and evaluate which fatwa is right and which fatwa is wrong so many mutis unfortunately come and they say my logic says I'll apply common sense you you're not allowed to do this what you're doing is a grave sin and you would be misleading those who listen to you when you just apply your common sense well I looked into different opinions and this seems to be the most uh uh logical Subhan Allah this is a grave and serious issue that is why it is not permissible for you to follow any Tom Dick or Harry you have to follow Scholars great Scholars of Islam she baz Alani and the likes who have strong command and a strong grip over what they say and they are rarely making mistakes instead of going to someone who keeps on flipping and changing his opinion every now and then"
