  "transcript": "Fahim from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum. Sheikh, since our local graveyard does not have a numbering system or anything similar, so only for identification purposes, unlike Kuffar's headstone, can we just place a simple steel nameplate on the grave where just a deceased name and his designation would be written? It is permissible to put something that is not extravagant, not high, it's not built on the grave to identify the grave and who is buried inside. And this was done by the Prophet, peace be upon him, and the companions. They would put a stone or something to mark that grave which belongs to their loved one or their friends. So if one puts a small steel plate or whatever that is not a tombstone that costs an arm and a leg and it's not built over the grave with cement and blocks and marble and the likes, it's just a simple sign or something to indicate that this who's buried there is so-and-so, that's not a problem inshallah. I personally would not recommend putting his biography like people they sometimes do or put his CV. So-and-so, Asim al-Hakim, born this date, died in this date. He assumed the following positions in these companies and he used to do this and he used to do that, his hobbies. This is a great, this is a cemetery. I'm not getting married. I'm dead. Why are you doing all of this? Just write the name and that's it. What's the use of born, died, and the place of birth and death and a copy of my ideas? Well, there's no need for that and Allah knows best."
