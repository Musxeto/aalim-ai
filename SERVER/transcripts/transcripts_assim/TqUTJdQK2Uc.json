  "transcript": "homina says is it true that if one wants to become a Muslim he or she should take a bath before taking the Shahada is it mandatory this is an issue of dispute there are a number of hadith that are Hassan and some authenticated where the companion came to the Prophet as I'm wanting to become a Muslim and the Prophet would say to him go take a bath and come but this is an incident or two the vast majority of people who accepted Islam we will never find the Prophet ordering them to go and perform Mosul which means that this is not a mandatory thing that must be accompanied with la ilaha illallah muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluh so it is a highly recommended thing to do but it is not mandatory and allah azzawajal knows best"
