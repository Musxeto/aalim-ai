  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Bangladesh so sheikh whats the ruling of giving someone the \nWi-Fi connection the password of the Wi-Fi if in   case of that person there is more possibility \nof misuse than good use of the internet we've   answered this question many times and said that it \nis not permissible to assist others on doing Haram   and this goes without saying my friend needs my \ncar why he says I'm gonna pick up my girlfriend   she's arriving and we're going to a motel it \nis totally prohibited to assist him but when   it but it's also prohibited upon me \nto doubt people so giving someone   a the password of my Wi-Fi router where I know \nthat using the internet is a sword with two blades   it's like giving someone a knife the majority \nwould use it to do good with it cut the meat cut   the bread cut the butter but some would use it to \ncut people's throats so can I assume that they're   going to do it they're going to use it for evil \npurposes this is doubting others and judging them   generally speaking I can give them the password   giving them the benefit of the doubt but if \nI'm 100 certain that they're going to use this   internet connection for Haram why do you want \nthe Wi-Fi password I'd like to get my uh renew   my membership in Netflix and I have to watch \nfew movies and few soap operas and few concerts   Etc don't give it to them because \nyou know the purpose and the reason and have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford \nit that's good for you if you cannot you're   entitled for one free session and this is for \neverybody if they can affirm by Allah that they   cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give \nthem one free session without a problem a full   half an hour so come to me and let's speak \nabout it inshallah within the following two   days or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for Allah"
