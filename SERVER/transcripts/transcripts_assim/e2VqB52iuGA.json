  "title": "Can I do ruqya after every fard prayer? #Assim #assimalhakeem #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "sh I had a question I was watching a Q&A from yours before and you mentioned a good point around Rya how some people they do it maybe once a day so I want I wanted to do Rya more often because I do it only like once a day I wanted to know if I can do it after my Salat just because it's a convenient time and I I want you to know if this is like bit or anything like that as long as you do the Ria after a f prayer due to its convenience though with all due respect I beg to differ you have 24 hours in the day and you don't find any time of convenience except after Salah that is a bit dodgy but Subhan Allah if you do it without believing that doing it after Salat is more rewarding or more beneficial then there's no problem in that what I said was and out of experience that people people who do R once a day is not sufficient is not beneficial as when it is repeated throughout the day like 5 10 15 20 times Allah knows how much because it's a form of Dua the more you do it the more likely it is to be answered and to be effective with the grace of Allah and Allah Knows Best"
