  "transcript": "Femi says my wife does cupping as a career so if someone books an appointment and pays for it can we stipulate a non-refundable deposit and if they cancel she can keep it this is known in a spiral or boon and what is bail or boon or wound is a down payment someone comes to my showroom sees a car and says I like this car how much that is cost and I say it costs you a hundred thousand reals he said this is five thousand reals tomorrow I'll come and bring the rest of the money the car is mine reserve it for me I said okay he does not come for a week so I sell the car and he comes later and says where is my car I said you stipulated one day and I waited an extra six days and he did not come so I sold it said okay give me back my money my down payment I said you have nothing so I said you're taking my money unlawfully I say no he's taking your money lawfully because you delayed him from selling the car and you harmed him by having him reserve the car for 24 hours where he could have sold it to someone else so there are a boon the downpayment is yours and if your wife stipulates a condition that you put it down payment or you pay the whole amount and you have to come on your appointment and if you miss this money is from allocating my time from 4 o'clock to 4:30 and you did not show up so I have lost money and this is in exchange for my loss"
