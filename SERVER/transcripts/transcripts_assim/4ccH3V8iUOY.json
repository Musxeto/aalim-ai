  "title": "Can we draw 2D or 3D objects like bugs, insects & other living creatures? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "[Music] ali from indonesia my question is uh i've heard the bad one that we can draw sentient beings by removing its life support like the whole face and things like that but what if we were to draw bugs or some for example it's ladybugs or butterflies which doesn't even really we can't even really recognize the face so is it permissible to draw their mouths like the wings or yeah stuff like attacks have okay from upper yeah okay i will answer inshallah the essence of the permissibility of drawing living creatures we know that one of the major sins is to draw living creatures and quote unquote underline bold italic living so if you deprive that creature from life then that would become permissible so if i have a mannequin without a head is it a live thing no without a head it's not a living creature so that's okay when we come to cellulites so someone draws a human body but without facial features without just the shade of it again there is no life in it because it's unrecognizable to have life in it and likewise when you draw butterflies without the head and the horns and the existence of it just the wings there's no problem in drawing it in 2d but there is a problem in drawing it or making it or sculpturing it in 3d what's the difference here in 3d it becomes like a sculpture like a statue so just having this in 3d you're giving it a body and the head is there it's haram but when it doesn't have this it just has the wings in 2d even if it has a head but you cannot see the facial features of it and you cannot identify it as a human uh that as a living creature insha allah this is permissible on allah's best you"
