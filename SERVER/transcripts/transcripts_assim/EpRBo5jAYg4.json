  "transcript": "foreign before going to bed is to recite ayatul kursi verse 255 chapter two allah [Music] we know that this beautiful ayah as we ex have had explained before protects an individual because it's the greatest ayah in the quran and that if you were to recite it allah azzawajal would protect you as stated in the hadith of the long hadith where a thief came over three continuous nights trying to steal some of the treasury of the muslims and whenever he was caught by abu hurayrah he pleaded that he was poor and his children needed food and in the last night he said that i will teach you an ayah if you recite it in the night allah would protect you from all devils and the prophet said allah he told you the truth and he's a liar and that was about ayatul kursi so this ayah with the grace of allah azzawajal would grant you protection until this is morning so the whole night you will be protected by ayatu al-kursiy hadith 101 is also regarding chapter 2 surat al-baqarah but it's about the last two verses of surat al-baqarah and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said whoever recites the last two ayahs of surat al-baqarah at night those two ayahs shall be sufficient for him um is beautiful to ayas what are they about these beautiful ayahs are about submitting your will to allah and about how allah the almighty would not put any burdens upon us and that allah has forgiven us if we were to er or to forget and a number of beautiful messages so the translation of the i as goes as follows the messenger muhammad ali believes in what has been revealed to him from his lord as do the believers each one of them believes in allah his angels his books and his messengers we make no distinction they say between uh one and another of his messengers and they say we hear and we obey and this is what the muslims say unlike the jews we hear and disobey so they say we hear and obey we seek your forgiveness o our lord and to you is the return of all on no soul does allah place a burden greater than it can bear and this is from allah's mercy it gets reward for the good that it earned and it is punished for the evil that it earns our lord punish us not if we forget or fall into error our lord lay not on us a burden like that which you did lay on those before us meaning the jews and the christians our lord lay not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear pardon us and grant us forgiveness have mercy on us you are our protector and give us victory over the unbelievers if you recite these two beautiful ayahs the prophet said allah they would suffice you scholars said one of two meanings they will suffice you so that they will protect you from any harm with the grace of allah or the second meaning they will suffice you so that you don't need to pray and offer night prayer or tahajjud either way this is a beautiful two ayahs that most muslims read before they go to bed what else part of the dua that the prophet used to make is to say [Music] in your name my lord i lie down and in your name i rise so if you should take my soul then have mercy upon it and if you should return my soul then protect it in the manner you do so with your righteous servants wow what does this tell you it tells me that while going to bed i'm asking allah azzawajal to have mercy upon my soul if i were to die how do you think my mentality would be going to bed going to rest knowing what i'd done in throughout my day knowing what i had done in my past and knowing that this might be my last encounter with this dunya i'm retiring i'm going to sleep i may not wake up so i say this dua do you think such an individual would be capable of sinning of course we're all sinful but do you think that he would do heinous things like we see lots of the people are doing today why are they doing this why are they falling in such sense the answer unfortunately is because they're negligent they're not thinking properly that they're about to meet allah azzawajal and that they will have to do something before they meet their maker these duas get us closer to allah azzawajal whether we like it or we don't the following dua which is ordikar which is 103. allah verily you have created my soul and you shall take its life again similar to the previous one acknowledging that i'm going to to sleep and i might die any moment to you belongs it's life and death if you should keep my soul alive then protect it and if you should take it life then forgive it o allah i ask you to grant me good health total dependence on allah every single thing in our lives and this is being a true muslim to submit your will to allah azzawajal to feel that everything is controlled by allah your life your death your destiny everything we need allah the almighty and we are expressing this to him so that he would guide us protect us and to give us a good life on earth and when we meet him on the day of judgment this is all the time we have until we meet next time i live in foreign [Music] i"
