  "transcript": "Mehwish from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Barakatuh. Sheikh I wanted to know if there's anything significant about those people who go to Umrah, they see people say that you know like there's something significant Allah chose them to go there and so forth and I don't know if I believe that I don't know because I saw people with my own eyes there you know that were in a group with us to do Umrah and Yanni they were missing prayers even in the Haram they were smoking and you know so forth so like Yanni are they really chosen or can anyone go to Umrah? First of all we are not judges, Allah did not send us to judge people and to label hmm this one is chosen, this one is cursed, this one is this, this one is that, this is not our job. Secondly when we spend time looking and scrutinizing others Shaytan will make us forget our own selves and our own sins and this is a catastrophe, this is a big big problem. Thirdly no doubt that Allah Azza wa Jal is the most generous, the most merciful and the most kind. He may guide people to go for Umrah yet such people are openly sinners, they sin openly and they do a lot of heinous and bad things. Does it mean hmm that Allah has chosen them to be the chosen ones? Of course not, yet Allah has blessed them as Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala blesses disbelievers. Don't we have disbelievers who are multi-billionaires? Yes. Why would Allah give them so much wealth when they're evil? This is Allah's wisdom but when Allah blesses them in this category it doesn't mean that they're the chosen ones because Allah gives the dunya, gives the health, gives the wealth to those whom He loves and those whom He does not love. Yet He only gives Iman, He only gives Islam to those whom He has selected and whom He loves. So something that is beyond our paycheck and pay grade. Allah selects these people and they make them come to the holy lands and they perform Umrah, they skip prayers, they smoke, they watch movies in their hotel rooms. Do I condemn them and label them as hypocrites or this it's none of my business. Yet Allah has favored them when He selected them to come for Umrah. Does this mean that everything is gone and they have a carte blanche to do whatever they want? Of course not. Yet again this is something between them and Allah azza wa jal. We pray for them to be guided. So many people went and came back and to us we don't see any benefit or value but they've benefited or they will benefit in couple of years time when Allah opens their heart and throws the light of guidance in it. We never know how Allah azza wa jal guides people. So again we have two concepts or two perspectives. Judging people and neglecting ourselves. We should not judge people. We judge people according to what we see. We don't say like the Americans do, hey don't judge me. No I'm gonna judge you. If you smoke pot, I'm gonna judge you. If you fornicate, I'm gonna judge you. If you don't pray on time, I'm gonna judge you. Because when someone asks me, I'm gonna say he does this these things. This is what I see. What I don't judge is your intention, what's in your heart, what will happen to you on the day of judgment. And putting this aside, I have to focus on myself. Shaytan is messing up with my head all the time. Judge people. Look at his garment below his ankle. Look at his shaven face. Look at this woman who's not wearing hijab. Look at this. Look at that. So I keep on resenting people, looking down at people, thinking highly of myself. This is what shaytan wants and Allah azza wa jal knows best."
