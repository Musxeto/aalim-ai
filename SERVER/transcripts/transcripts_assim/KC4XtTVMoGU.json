  "title": "Do Creams and Lotions have any effect on the validity of Wudu? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "his second question was about applying creams due to cold weather so if a person performs woudl and applies creams to his body and then breaks his Woodill and he wants to perform another ablution so what should he do with the creams it depends if these creams form a layer that prevents water from reaching the skin in this case you have to remove it and usually most creams that we people apply to their skin moisturizers and and the likes are absorbed by the skin in like a few minutes and there is no trace on it except this a greasy feeling but there is no layer so just washing it while rubbing it so if you put water in your arm and you rub it that does the job you don't have to wash it with soap or you don't have to scrub it really hard to ensure that it's removed but if you're talking about other types of creams that you can obviously see that the water is not reaching the skin and you're not feeling the temperature of the water due to the presence of such creams no you have to thoroughly remove that cream and a larger girl knows best up"
