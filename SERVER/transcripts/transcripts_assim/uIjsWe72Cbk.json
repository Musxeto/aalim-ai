  "transcript": "So the last question, Umar Farooq says, If I eat three times a day and say Bismillah and the dua after eating that we say and get our sins forgiven, would that day be better in terms of reward or the day I fast voluntarily? Farooq or Umar Farooq, you cannot calculate such things with a calculator. When you deal with Allah Azza Wa Jal, you don't go to such extents and hypothetically say, Okay, so if I say Bismillah and I eat and then say, Alhamdulillah lathee qaamani hadha wa razaqanihi min ghayriha hawli minni wa la quwa, Allah would forgive my sins. So if I eat five meals, this means that I've erased my sins five times. How about if I eat seven meals, small, small meals? These hypothetical questions are not beneficial. Fasting one single day takes your face far, 70 years away from hellfire. The distance of traveling 70 years, your face is kept away from hellfire. What can be more than that? Allah says all the deeds of the son of Adam are his, except fasting, it's for me and I reward for it. What can be better than this? So at the end of the day, definitely fasting is better than eating three days and saying the dua, because at the end of the day, when you break your fast, you're going to eat and you're going to make the dua. So it doesn't make any sense at all to compare this to that. And Allah, Azza wa Jalla, knows best."
