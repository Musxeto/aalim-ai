  "transcript": "Villanova him and hamdulillahi rabbil alameen sallallaahu Salaam Baalak Arab diversity I mean nabina muhammad alayhi wa sahbihi ajma'in assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh we begin a new chapter in our book on the to allah calm but also related to purity and Tahara and this chapter deals with menstruation and we all know that ministration only happens to females and it is something that allah azza wajal has created so don't ask for equality and say why do only women get this I'd like to have a portion of that and when women come and say we're equal no you're not you can conceive children I can't so Allah created men and women and Allah who knows whom he created gave all certain rules and regulations they all must follow we have a hadith with us hadith of Aisha may Allah be pleased with her and who will read that for us yes brother narrated aisha fatima bint ABI wish came to the prophet and said i am a woman whose blood keeps flowing and never purifying should i therefore abandon prayer he said not at all but this is only a way so leave prayer as much as the days you used to have your regular menses and then make goosal and pray in honor and generation this is not menstruation therefore don't pray once it's time is gone wash the blood okay the issue of menstruation is a topic among the most difficult topics in the books of firk and if you go and read books of 50 you will find great number of pages written on it though it's very simple it should be very simple because Allah Azza WA JAL has created women on this way the majority of women have a certain period of the month where they get this blood this blood comes out only when they're not pregnant because this blood is made to feed the fetus in their wombs so if it's they're not pregnant this blood comes out once they're pregnant all of this blood goes to feed the child or the whole nine months while he or it is in the womb now it is very simple when the women get their menstruation they stop their prayer and fasting when they're purified they resume their normal lives but if the bleeding is continuous throughout the whole month then we have to judge this to be an SD Harbor and what is is the harbor it is a continuation of the blood that makes it difficult if not impossible to recognize what is menses and what is not and this is why fatima bint ABI Hebei SH one of the Companions came and complained to the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam that she keeps on bleeding the whole year it never stops and she wasn't the only one the scholars say that there were 19 female companions who had the St Harbor this continuous blood so the Prophet said are Islam this is not your menses this is a vein meaning that this is an illness that causes the blood to continue to come out throughout the whole month or most of the time so what to do the Prophet told her are a historical Salam you have to leave prayer similar amount of the days that you get your menses before you got this bleeding did you have normal menses she said yes 6 to 7 days every month so the Prophet told her leave these days every month then take a shower take a whistle and pray and fast regularly even if the blood is coming out and consider the blood that's coming out other than the period we consider as menses to be a blood of vein told what you have to do is wash it and perform Moodle for every Paula now this is one hadith there are other hadith such as the hadith of Aisha number 42 I think it's a second hadith okay we need someone to read it for us yes under a man I shall the wife of the Prophet may peace be upon him narrated that M Habiba suffered from prolonged bleeding alice tijada between the monthly menses period for seven years she asked allah apostle about it he ordered her to take a bath after the termination of the actual periods and added that it was from a blood vessel so she used to take a bath for every prayer Aisha the wife of the Prophet may peace be upon him said whom Habiba vintage ash the spouse of Abdul Rahman min Alf made a complaint to the Messenger of Allah may peace be upon him about blood which flows beyond the menstrual period he said to her remain away from prayer equal to the length of time that your menstruation holds you back after this bathe yourself and she used to take about five every prayer very well now the first hadith was explained to us by the second hadith because o Habiba anyone would have thought that this was the wife of the Prophet irresolute Salaam there was a there is right was her name on Habiba who she bint ABI Sufyan Ramla bint ABI Sufyan the mother of the believers now this on Habiba ISM have you been Josh she is a companion of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam and she is the wife of a brahmin even out and the sister in of the Prophet because I'm happy women Josh Xena been Josh kameena been Josh there were three sisters and the three of them were the cousins of the Prophet and is assumed their mother is the maternal aunt of the prophet alayhi salatu salam so she complained of the same issue of menses being so for long that over the past seven years it never stopped and the Prophet told her I saw salaam to bathe she from herself used to bathe for every Salah and the scholars say that this is not mandatory at all to bathe for every Salah because the Prophet order her only to bathe once and that is when she believes and thinks that her menses is over from these two hadith we have another five or six or seven different hadith but they're not mentioned in this book why because this is a concise summary it is not as long as Buddha or Milan for example and it is not as long as Natan our par or a moon taka which is the origin is an moon taka so how to deal in the case of a woman who has Estacada which is not a general thing to have the general and the normal thing is to have height which is the menses a woman gets usually her menses six days seven days nine days 12 days a month there is no minimum some scholars say that the minimum period of height is one day if it's less than a day then it's not and this is not acceptable a woman may get her menses 12 hours a month this is how Allah created her why do you say no this is not allowed and they say the maximum can reach up to 15 days and again scholars say why if a woman gets her monthly period 17 days every month fix how do I say that no 15 days after one hour this becomes a stir harder there is no evidence on that so it depends on her period how it is now if the blood does not stop at all if it continues to flow then this woman we consider her to be in the set of St Harbor so now how can we differentiate when to pray and when not to pray there are three stages stage 1 what was mentioned in the hadith of party momentum equation and the hadith of whom have ever been Josh and that is you should stop praying the days your menses used to come meaning stage 1 is related to women who know the length of their period and when to start so usually a woman days 10 years and during these 10 years every lunar month from the first day till the seventh she gets her menses she knows that seven days in the beginning of every lunar month for 10 years she's been like this and all of a sudden it shifted Hamas she started getting the bleeding every single day either because she took conceptive either because she had an operation some reason or the other now she's complaining she says she I have my whole month the bleeding is continuous what to do what do I say to her what do I tell her I tell her your previous menses do you know the duration and the time she says yes I say every lunar month from day one till day seven you do not pray and you do not fast on the seventh day you'll make oasl you start to pray and fast and act normally and disregard the blood to be estaba it regards it as Estacada understood anyone has any questions ok we have a break after the break inshallah I will take your questions so stay tuned assalamu alaikum and welcome back so stage one is understood if the movement comes to me and says share I did have a fixed period of menses but I forgot how long I'm not sure if it's six or seven and I'm not sure if it's in the beginning or the middle or in the end in this case if she knows that period six seven days we tell her okay the seven days you always do it from the first of the month regardless whether you had it in the middle or at the end consider it to be from the beginning of the month if she says I don't know how many days and I don't know when in this case we go to stage two and stage two is to identify through observation and what does that mean scholars say that the blood of menses and the blood of a vein or normal blood differ one the blood of the menses is darker it's almost black and the blood of the vein is red two the blood of the menses smells has a bad smell the normal blood has no smell unless you're a werewolf three the blood of the menses usually comes but accompanied with aches in the back and the stomach while the normal bleeding does not have these characteristics and finally for the blood of the menses I don't know what is the medical term for it if a person bleeds the blood would turn into clot but the blood of the menses does never ever turn into clot it keeps on being in the state of fluid so I don't know what is medical term for that but you know what I mean in Charlotte so these are the four differences and that is why scholars say if a woman does not know the length of her period or when it begins she's instructed to observe if she notices that the color has changed and the aches are there with yellow colors this is the beginning of your menses once the color changed back into lighter and no smell and she has no pains we tell her take your bath and considered the rest to be the bleeding of a vein under sunni-shia stage to move on to stage three if a woman says the whole blood looks alike and I don't have aches or I'm always in ache and pain the whole month and I'm unable to differentiate what to do in this case the scholars say she has to follow her sisters her aunts her mother because usually in the same family those who have sisters they noticed that two or three of the sisters have their menses at the same time sometimes the whole the whole ladies the mother may be as well so in this case she is told to take or follow suit when both of her sisters or her mother and sister have their period she considered herself to be with them once they are purified she considered to be herself to be purified she take a whistle and that would end her menses now how does a woman know if she's purified or not there is what is known as the white discharge a thread white thread like discharge that women generally get after the instance is over they have or they see or they detect this white thread like discharge and some part of the women don't have this yet they know it through what is known as dryness once her menses is over I'm not talking about estecado now I'm talking about the regular menses of seven days and eight days how would she know that she is purified and she can take water and pray by either seeing the white thread like discharge or if she does not get this by the purity and the dryness the complete dryness where she does not see any traces or yellowish or brownish color at all so this insha'Allah is as a summary what is regarded to be related to the menstruation and to the field of St Harbor let's take your questions whether regarding this topic or any previous topic in the last what is you mentioned that prophets allah salam was sent for the whole of mankind and he clarified that he was also sent for the Jin's since the mankind have the law of the Sharia which has been given to us by the Prophet what Lord with the genes have to follow do they have to follow any laws most likely they follow the same law as we do because the Prophet was sent to them the Quran was revealed to him and conveyed to them as mentioned in the Quran that we revealed to you of prophet of Allah that there were a number of jinn listening to you and once they heard the message they went back to their people and gave them dower and then the Prophet as-salaam also met an invoice from the jinn no soybean and he spoke with them and he gave them what to eat and what not to eat they requested they requested halal meat and the Prophet told them that every single bone you will find that was mentioned the name of Allah which we eat and throw you will find it as much as full of meat for you and the dung of the animals would be the food for your animals the dunk we have from the animals you know from the cows ins etcetera it would be the food for the animals of the jinn so we believe that they have their own Sharia but is it exactly similar to us this is something we cannot verify and it is something that does not add value to us see always focus on the questions that get you closer to Allah when someone says the dog that was with the people in the cave was it a German Shepherd was it a Doberman was it a bulldog or a chihuahua one would say I think why are you asking these questions would this draw us closer to Allah when someone says that the star that Ibrahim saw was it Venus Mars or any other planet Allah did not tell us why should I pay any attention the straws that Zachariah and his people through so that they would take Mariam into their custody what was it made of was it made of wood was it made of this was it made of that all of this is irrelevant to us as Muslims it doesn't draw you closer to Allah therefore we refrain from asking questions that would not add value to us because this is the doing of the philosophers they sit and say imagine that this is not water it's tea but it is water no no imagine if is not so and imagine if the tea is not green it's black what should I imagine this I have enough problems to imagine so such questions we try our best to any focus on what benefits us most any more questions yes prophet once I share as well Raziel Anna there's my I sleeps but my heart doesn't sleep a section of the people they quote this this I think that the Prophet is still amongst us by referring to this this hadith was in a specific incident and that is when he sallallahu alayhi wa sallam went to sleep and then woke up and went to pray for without performing wooden and when I assure me Allah be pleased with her told him that any I heard you snore so how can you go and pray he said my heart does not sleep while my eyes sleep this is what he's alive but no one dares and say that the Prophet has some did not dying those who claim that the Prophet is alive in his grave and he hears us and he talks to us and not only that there go the extra mile they say he he comes out and he goes and roams the whole universe and the earth and he listens to people and those who make molded they have in their mullet glasses of water and food and when you ask him what is this they said this is a blessed food because the Prophet comes and his spirit comes over it so we cure the ill with this food and this water what is this if you tell them that the Prophet died no he's not dead he's alive in his grave if he's alive in his grave get him out if he's alive let's get him out can we get him out no no no no we can't why if he's alive he's not alive our life in the sense that he does not eat and drink and goes to the toilet and has intercourse with his wife because this is a life but he is in a transitional period known as Alberta and in Alberta he's alive he's enjoying paradise he is having all the favours and blessings of allah azza wajal he goes to the heavens he goes to his grave all of this is authentic and approved but we cannot say that he hears us or he knows what we're doing because he said in the highest degree and level of hadith which is known as muta wat I will be the first to come to the house to the pond and there will come people of my followers from my Ummah but the Angels would reject them and I would complain bravi almighty almighty and they would tell me our Allah would tell me you do not know underline you do not know what they have innovated after your death and this is the punchline you do not know meaning when you were in your grave you do not know what these people did why because you're dead allah says in the quran in naka may yet you are going to die and they are going to die as well therefore we should make this clear the Prophet died RA su sallam the Companions washed him the Companions prayed funeral prayer the Companions buried him so whoever claims that he is alive and he did not die is not a proper Muslim Allah knows best this is all the time we have until we meet next time via Manila assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
