  "transcript": "minhajj and it says is doing additional vicar after salat besides the prescribed vicar consider it as an innovation as we know that vicar is dividing the two types restricted and open so the restricted vicker is the one that we are prescribed to say at particular times predict particular locations at particular numbers without adding or missing any of it so such prescribed vicar this is limited this is restricted we have to stick to it and then there is the general type of dicker and this is highly encouraged and it has no specific time or place so i can say subhanallah alhamdulillah and these are the best words you can make zikr with and i can say them a hundred times thousand times a gazillion times in the morning in the evening in the afternoon while walking to the office from the masjid no problem in that now the dilemma is that if i say the prescribed diker ten times after prayer then i say subhanallah al hamdulillah 33 times etc i read i tell corsi the three calls etc then i'd like to say something every single salat so after every single salat or after every dohur salat or fajr would that be an innovation if you look at it being a dua said at a specific time and at a specific location after a specific a specific ritual which the prophet did not do allah by this definition is an innovation but if i finish my prescribed duas that is prescribed vicker and i'm sitting in the masjid or going back home and i want to say subhanallah a hundred times a thousand times no problem in that because i'm not doing that along with the prescribed vicar thinking it's part of the dicker it's a general vicar that i am making so it is a an open vicar i can make without any problem the issue is be careful of specifying a particular vicar after a particular fart or every fart and thinking that you have to say this every single time for example three times three times the dua the thicker itself is prescribed whoever asks allah three times hellfire would say o allah protect him from me paradise who say o allah admit admit him to me but to say it ever after every salah this becomes an innovation allah azzawajal knows best you"
