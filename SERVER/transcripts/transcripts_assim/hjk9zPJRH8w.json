  "title": "If a Hanafi girl gets married without her Wali, is her marriage valid? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "abdah from Bangladesh in hanfi maab a girl can get married without the consent of her guardian which is against prophet's Hadith correct so if a girl is a follower of hanfi maab and she gets married in this process will her marriage be valid if this is her conviction and she's a Layman and she doesn't have knowledge and she doesn't know whether the Hadith is authentic or not she follows the mainstream of her country and of the Islamic Court in her country like in the subcontinent for example then yes her marriage is valid because we cannot come to 200 plus million Muslims and invalidate their marriages in the subcontinent simply because they follow the hanafi maab yes it is wrong it is against the three major schools of thought it is against the clear Hadith it is against the Ayah of the Quran that in indicates clearly to anyone who knows Arabic that a woman has to be given away not to marry herself nevertheless because she's a Layman the man who married her is a Layman they don't have knowledge they follow their school of thought which they know to the best of their ability that this is the only thing we know we know nothing other than that then inshallah it is valid and Allah Knows Best"
