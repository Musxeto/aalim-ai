  "title": "Is working with Amazon permissible in islam? What's dropshipping? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um as we know are working on drop shipping is not common in the slums similarly it's working for drop shipping companies like amazon also haram because first of all to my knowledge amazon does not drop ship amazon either has the products in their warehouse with a price tag on it with the responsibility upon them if anything were to be defected or bad or they act as agents to the manufacturers or the suppliers so they have agreements with the suppliers that they will sell this mug for a xyz price which is displayed on their website the supplier knows the price they're selling it for and the commission amazon is taking from them with their agreement so this is not drop shot drop shipping drop shipping that is prohibited is when you don't have a product and you simply show them this mug and you tell them i can sell it for you for one dollar and you get orders you did not receive the money you get an order you purchase it from outside maybe you'll be successful in getting it for less than a dollar maybe you will not and then you bring it and ship it and then receive the money this is selling what you do not possess which is drop shipping that is prohibited but if you have the product and you sell it this is halal if the supplier or the manufacturer authorizes me to be his agent and he says sell it for a dollar and i'll give you 10 cents and i do that so i'm taking my wage i'm taking my fee 10 cents from the supplier i have nothing to do with the customer they will settle their own affairs together then this is permissible and inshallah this answers your question you"
