  "transcript": "uh question from a sister do the duties of the wife to a husband change in the current times in the western world where it's common for wives who also participate in earning the living and supporting the household I think I've answered this I think you touched upon it yes because the duties are duties me women are not obliged to chip in a penny in the expenses now the man huh listen it has a downfall to it the man has the right to order his wife to sit home and not to work why I don't want you to work why Simon says I married you to be a housewife yeah but I have a degree in medicine and I have this and I sit home I provide for you I put a roof on your head food on your table I take care of all your expenses I don't want you to work I don't want you to mix with men she's obliged to obey but if he says Ah listen it's boring I know you you need time out you need to help your family back home and they don't have any source of income you can work but I'd like 25% of your income no this is Haram why if she's not cooking or she's obliged to bring a maid yes you bring the food because this is your job you uh uh hire the mate and pay for her because this is your your job other than that no you're not allowed to ask her to chip otherwise we will change the roles of men in the west the roles of husbands because they change no the rules in Islam are the same all over the place"
