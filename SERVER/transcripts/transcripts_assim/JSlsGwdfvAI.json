  "transcript": "the fact that brother rush has problems with ocd now he's saying that i have a cat and i know that cats do their things in their litter box so then afterwards they don't take a shower they don't wash themselves they don't wipe themselves so they walk all over the sand and and the soiled area and then they walk on the carpet and they come to me and they sometimes lick themselves to clean themselves up and then they come and lick my hand so is this all involving in najasa and impurity and my whole house needs to be burnt down to the ground can we keep cats as pets don't be extreme and take things easy are cats permissible in islam to be pets the answer is yes the hadith if you had knowledge if you watched um or other beneficial books of phil you will learn this with knowledge you will have the weapon to fight shaytan so in the hadith the prophet sam saw a a cat coming he uh gave her a pot or a a a bowl and of water and had her drink of it and he did not render the water or the pot as najis so he explained that to his companions so that they would learn and they would know how to judge things he said this is among those uh wanderers upon you those animals these pets are mixing a lot with you in the homes they wander they wander around you so it would have been extremely difficult if not impossible to have things rendered as naja's najis naja's nudges if we were to to classify it as najis in everything it touches but the prophet hassan made things easy so this is one of the legal maxims in islam and it is explained in um the prophet the legal maxim is certainty is not removed or affected by doubt so the whole carpet the bed the the sofa my lap when my cat sits in uh on it or in it or whatever the default it is it's pure this is a certainty now but maybe sheikh the cat did this or did that maybe is it certain or doubtful he said no it's doubtful throw it in the dustbin get rid of it yes but but me no but i gave you the rule if you learn and implement this in your life say goodbye to wishwise and ocd with the grace of allah first of all so no there's nothing wrong in taking cats as such maryam from you"
