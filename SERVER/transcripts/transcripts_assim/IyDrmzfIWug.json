  "transcript": "Fatima sent an email and she says is it permissible for a Muslim to be a Bridal makeup artist avoiding the forbidden things like removing hair and all that also can hairdos be done for the bride first of all a woman by default is Allah as the Prophet stated in the authentic hadith Aylmer a to Allah and whenever she comes out Satan exposes her and uplifts her so that she draws attention as the Prophet said sallallahu alayhi wa sallam and therefore for you to contribute to facilitate and to be part of a sinful act means that you are sharing the sin with others and you will be partially or in general sharing it like the one who's committing the sin and this is why the Prophet erase a lot or some cursed 10 people in intoxications in wine and the likes those who make it those who buy it who sell it who carry it who serves it who pours it who drinks it etc which means that all of them join in the sin likewise in RIBA the Prophet tells us our Islam that Allah curses the one who consumes it and the one who feeds it and the one who testifies on such a contract he's not taking a penny he's just testifying and the one who's registering it the Prophet said assume they are all alike in being cursed so when you come to fixing a woman a bride being a makeup artist we have to look if you know for certain or most likely that the woman that you are fixing will go out and none muharram men will look at her in this case every prohibited gaze is registered in your account of sins because you took part of it and you made her look beautiful and you contributed to her sin but if you are in a conservative country or a Muslim country or the sister who is coming to you is a hijab a sister or a niqab a sister who would not wear such makeup in front of nan Muharram you fix her up you do your work and she wears the hijab and she goes and she only shows it to other women this is totally permissible inshallah so you have to be the judge whether to go ahead or not and your income would be halal or Haram accordingly"
