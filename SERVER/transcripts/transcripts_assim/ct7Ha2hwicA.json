  "transcript": "[Music] mam from among all the prophets muhamad was the last as his was a mission of the greatest task there was only moral degeneration people clung to Idol [Music] adoration for all nations [Music] may Allah be pleased with him was one of the toughest Companions of the Prophet Alat wasam but his toughness was not in being harsh in dealing with people because this is not a sign of a True Believer his toughness was at the side of Allah the almighty in enjoining virtue in forcing virtue and in Forbidden Vice and whatever is sinful and that is why the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam said by Allah oh Omar if Satan if the devil saw you walking a road he would take another road than the road you are walking on this indicates that Omar may Allah be pleased with him was on the true path and that he was firm but only in what pleases Allah the almighty Omar had a sound opinion that the prophet Alat wasam used to utilize and make use of and he says that I have said things that alhamdulillah the Quran came to prove they were right some say there were three locations some go and make it up to 20 locations in the Quran where Omar's opinion was exactly as the Quran came down with among this is the prisoners of War of Badr as we know that Badr was the major battle after the migration of the Prophet Alam to Medina and that was on the second year of Hijra the prophet alhat wasam when he heard of this Caravan coming with all the merchandise and trade of quray he asked his companions to go and attack it because he wanted wanted to hurt qur in its Financial aspects the most so whenever he heard of a caravan going to the North or coming from a sham he would attack it so that it would hurt them most and when they went to attack the Caravan they thought that they were going to attack a caravan that had only few guards not knowing that quray already sent its big fully armed Army to meet this group of Muslims and to annihilate them what happened was that Allah sent down his angels and the Muslims were victorious they managed to kill a lot of the pagans they defeated them miserably and they captured prisoners from this disbelieving Army now the prophet alisat wasam did not know what to do with these prisoners of War some companions among them Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him advise the prophet Alat wasam to take Ransom and to have those who are able to write and read to teach those among the Muslims who do not know how to read and write other companion such as Omar may Allah be pleased with him said no I advise you Prophet of Allah to give my brother who was captive to me and to give to Ali who is his brother and to give so and so to this man each one to his relative and have them behead them and kill them because they are enemies of Islam this would send a message to the pagans this would send a message to the disbelievers that we are not weak anymore so the prophet did not like Omar's advice and he chose to take Abu bakr's advice Omar may Allah be pleased with him says that the following day I went to see the prophet alhat wasam and I saw him along with Abu Bakr weeping and crying so I came and said either you tell me what is making You Weep and cry or I will weep and cry with you without even knowing the reason because he wants to join them in their happiness and in their grief as well so the prophet saidat that Allah revealed verses of the Quran to me and this reads as it is not for a prophet that he should have prisoners of war and free them with Ransom until he had made a a great Slaughter among the enemies in the land you Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam you desire the good of this world there is money of Ransom but Allah desires for you the Hereafter and Allah is Almighty and all wise and then Allah goes on to say were it not a previous ordainment from Allah a severe torment would have touched you for what you had taken this is from Allah blaming the prophet Alat wasam for accepting the ransom and telling him that he should not have accepted that and he should have slaughtered them so that the people would get the message would learn the lesson the prophet said to Omar may Allah be pleased with him he said by Allah Omar I saw the punishment beyond that tree had it not been for the mercy of Allah it would have befallen upon us and if the Wrath and Punishment of Allah would have come the only one to be spared was you Omar may Allah be pleased with him so this is one location where his advice came the approval of the Quran to say that this was a Sound Advice also in asking the the prophet Alat wasam to draw the hijab of his women the prophet alai at the beginning of Islam his wives would not cover as it was in Arabia they would show their faces and there would visit the prophet Alam those who were good and those who were bad the righteous and the Hypocrites they will all come and visit the prophet in his house and his wives would be serving them food and doing the hospitality thing and Omar did not like this it was reported that once he was eating with the prophet Alam with his wife AA and as they were eating from the pot his hand touched aa's hand and he was so depressed of this and he said oh prophet of Allah this is not right you should instruct and order your wives to completely cover and to stay away from the men because among them there are the Righteous and there are the bad there are the Believers and there are the Hypocrites so the prophet Alam did not respond to his request until Allah revealed the verses we recite inah where Allah says what translates to and when you ask his wives for anything you want ask ask them from behind the screen a veil that is purer for your hearts and for their hearts now this is the reason whenever you want to ask the wives of the Prophet Alat wasam do not talk to them face to face ask them from Beyond a screen and the reason because this is purer for your hearts or Companions of the prophet and for their hearts the wives of the prophet sallallahu alaihi alhi wasallam and some say it is mandatory to cover the face others say that it is voluntary no one of the scholars dare and say that it is not a Sunnah except those who are ignorant and those who do not know their shoes from what they're wearing on their heads this is the religion of Allah and Allah is justifying this reason he says that this hijab this Veil this screen is purer for your hearts the hearts of Abu Bakr Omar and Ali and purer for the hearts of the wives of the Prophet Z and so on we have a short break please stay tuned [Music] so Omar may Allah pleased with him advis the prophet of hijab of his wives and that is why Allah revealed this verse and if you or when you ask his wives for anything you want ask them from behind the screen that is purer for your hearts and for their hearts this is the reason and one may ask who is in need of the purity of the hearts more the companions of the Prophet Alam and the wives of the Prophet Alam or us in this world that lust and desire is everywhere who should we instruct to cover the face more the wives of the Prophet Alam who are our mothers or the women working in offices working in shops walking in the streets where people see them interact with them talk with them definitely they are more worthy of covering the faces than the mothers of the Believers the wives of the prophet sallallah and so it was the prophet instructed his wives to cover their faces and not to talk to others except from behind a screen and this was mentioned in the verse of 59 in Surah Al where Allah instructs the prophet Sall Ali wasallam to order his wives his daughters and the women of the Believers all the women on earth who believe in Allah in the day of judgment to lower their garments so that they would be recognized and hence not harassed if she covers her face no one knows her and no one would harass her and this is is basic if you see someone with a beautiful face a woman with a beautiful face and if you see someone who is veiled who will you harass who will you attack who will you feel the desire to see and expose more and more definitely the one with the beautiful face also the prophet when the chief of the Hypocrites the head of the Hypocrites Abdullah Sal when he died his son who was a Believer who was a True Companion of the Prophet Alat wasam and he gave a number of incidents that show his true Iman when Abdullah did what he did as the chief head of Hypocrites and he tried to undermine the efforts of Islam and of the Muslims his son came to the prophet alham and he said oh prophet of Allah the people of Medina know that there is no one treating his father better than I I am the best one in Medina to treat my father in respect and in obedience but because of what he had done I'm afraid that you will instruct someone to kill him and he deserved to be killed yet because I'm so loyal and loving to my father I'm afraid that if I see the killer or my father walking in Medina that rage would overtake me and I would kill him and then I would have killed the Muslim for a non-muslim and I will be in hell and this is a dilemma therefore prophet of Allah instruct me if you want my father to be killed instruct me and I will kill him look at this belief look at this position of Abdullah ABD he loves his father so much but he loves Islam more everyone knows that he respects and obeys his father more than anyone else in Medina yet he doesn't want to Enter Hell by killing a Muslim who fulfilled the instruction of the prophet and killed this enemy of Islam he doesn't want to do this so the only way out is for him personally to kill his father so he's seeking the per permission from the prophet Alam the prophet said Alam no we will be good companions to your father until he dies and when he died the head of hypocrisy the head of the enemies of Islam yet he did not say anything obvious to condemn him and that is an Islamic way of looking at things we do not judge people by their intentions cuz the intentions only Allah knows it we judge people by what we see from them so if we see something that is wrong we judge this but if someone is undermining Islam and he's working from behind the screens and from behind the curtains we cannot pinpoint that he is attacking Islam or undermining Islam so we treat him as a Muslim and Allah would punish him on the day of judgment so this is what the prophet did with abdah Sal he treated him as a Muslim and when he died his son came to the prophet Alam telling him that his father had passed away so the prophet came to himam and he took off his shirt and gave it to them so that they can wrap Abdullah with his shirt and when they buried him the prophet Alat sought the for forgiveness from Allah to this head of hypocrisy and Allah revealed the verses from the Quran if you seek forgiveness for them 70 times or more Allah will not forgive them ever and the prophet said Alam had I known that Allah would forgive him after 70 times I would have done it more than 70 times so Omar told the prophet Alam prophet of Allah he is a hip hypocrite he is the head of hypocrisy do not ask Allah for forgiveness and do not pray for him the funeral prayer and the prophet Alam insisted on asking Allah for forgiveness because he was a tolerant prophet he was a merciful prophet he was the mercy sent to mankind sallallahu alaihi wasallam so he told Omar that I will continue to ask Allah to forgive him until Allah denies me from doing this and Allah then revealed his verses saying and do not pray on any one of them died and do not stand on his grave seeking for forgiveness so the prophet Alam refrained so the Quran the verses came in accordance to what Omar may Allah be pleased with him advised Omar may Allah be pleased with him his passion was the Quran and the Sunnah he would never exceed he would never go beyond the Quran and the Sunnah may Allah be pleased with him he was humble but he was strong and his humbleness never conflicted with his strength he was proud but he was proud to be a Muslim not to be an Arab or to be an arrogant person from Arabia it was reported that was approached by his uncle and he said to Al was a young man with knowledge and it was the habit of Omar may Allah be pleased with him to gather in his court the youngsters who had knowledge and the people of knowledge so this man came to his nephew and said to and said why don't you ask to allow me to speak in his court I'd like to come and visit him his court was not open to all it was open only to those who had knowledge and who had Sound Advice to the leader of the Muslims so Al went to Omar and asked asked him if his uncle could come being one of the dignitaries of Arabia he allowed him to come though he had no knowledge and no influence or credit to allow him to attend so he allowed him in the minute the man walked in he said oh Omar and he said to him oh Omar you do not give generously and you do not rule fairly and Omar was outraged may Allah be pleased with him he was Furious because this is a plain lie this was nothing to relate to reality and to the truth so you could see Sparks coming from his eyes because of this rage and immediately Al may Allah have mercy on his soul he said oh Omar oh the Quran ordered the Prophet wasam by saying show forgiveness oh Muhammad show forgiveness and join what is good and turn away from the foolish the foolish people the ignorant people three instructions in one verse take or show forgiveness and enjoy what is good and turn away from the foolish from the ignorant this is what he recited to Omar and then he concluded by saying and this man my uncle is among the foolish that is it immediately once Omar heard this verse from the Quran he calmed down and he sat he sat down he complied with the instruction of Allah Asel he did not justify he did not go out of his way to explain Allah's words in his mind to suit his case and this is what's happening among a lot of the Muslims nowadays when you come to them and tells them that Allah says so and so the prophet Alat wasam says so and so they come come up with justifications they come up with excuses once I was approached by a sister and she's saying that I have a lot of money and I'd like to perform Hajj but I do not have a m I do not have a guardian to come and accompany me so I told her that you don't have to make Hajj and it's not allowed for you to make Hajj see she said but I'm wealthy I said this is the fatwa of the Prophet Alat wasam he said it is not lawful for a woman who believes in Allah and in the day of judgment to travel without a Mah she said but this scholar so and so says it's okay so I said Subhan Allah I tell you the prophet says and you reject his Hadith by a scholar and who is this scholar who is this man who has the ability to reject the instruction of the Prophet Alat are you a Muslim saying or you say this scholar is the scholar of Allah or whatever no scholar comes close to the words of the prophet alhat wasam and his instructions and this is a sign whether you are a True Believer a true follower of the Prophet Alam or you are a hypocrite following Scholars and abandoning the religion of Allah abandoning the Sunnah behind your back this should not come from a Muslim I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program so until we meet next time"
