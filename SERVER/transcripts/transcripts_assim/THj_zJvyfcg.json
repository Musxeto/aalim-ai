  "transcript": "Ammar from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh I hope you are doing well. May Allah bless you. Sheikh my question is I am trying to beautify my recitation of the Quran and so I go to the Quran classes and over there I was told that to make my recitation more beautiful and to make it more better I have to learn through maqamats so they told me to first hear the maqamat and implement that on the verses of the Quran I am not sure if this is permissible or should I go to these classes so I wanted your opinion on this and your advice JazakAllah Khair Maqamat are sort of patterns that people learn so that they would recite or they would sing according to these patterns they have Nahawand, Maqam, Sika, I don't know them personally Alhamdulillah but I hear people learning them if learning these maqamat does not include anything haram such as listening to music or to haram songs if it's just a pattern that you follow which makes your recitation sad or enthusiastic or motivational in this case there is no problem as long as your recitation fits under the recitation of the Quran and not singing but if your recitation is going to simulate and sound like a song following the pattern of currently followed by singers and songwriters in this case this is not permissible because this is disrespecting the Quran so I hope this answers your question Alhamdulillah"
