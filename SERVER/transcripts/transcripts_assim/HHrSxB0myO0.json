  "transcript": "should we start to wake up our children for fud prayer the answer is the prophet told you ordered them to pray when they're seven and spank them to pray when they're 10 so you have three years of waking your children for every single prayer to pray on time but you never reprimand them you never beat them you never um punish them for this you just order them so if your children sleep at normal time at 9:00 or 10:00 p.m. waking them at 4: or 5: is easy it's normal so you can wake them it will be a little bit of a struggle but eventually they'll wake up but if your child goes to bed at 1 or 2:00 as in some families who stay uh up late waking the child at this age after 2 or 3 hours of sleeping this is not uh uh logical so yes you try to wake that child if he doesn't wake up or she doesn't wake up then leave her but this is not on a daily basis this happens once every blue moon they have to sleep early so that they can be trained to wake up on time uh Zaki"
