  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Germany um Sheikh in the past I asked you about the ruling \neating stunned meat and here even though Germany   is a Christian country unfortunately it is \na mandate that the meat should be stunned   before slaughtered and there are Shuyookh here \nthat they prohibit eating meat here but there   are people I know personally they just of course \nyou don't care and they just want to insist going   to this restaurant like McDonald's and so so my \nquestion is are these people who don't care and   putting themselves at risk eating this this meat \nwhere it could be that meat be held accountable now the question is CD to you is when the \nanimal is stunned is it dead or only drowsy um drowsy then that this is the behind 100 \npercent because the slaughtering took place   while the animal was alive when does the animal \nbecome Haram when the stunning causes it to die   so after it's dead like you bang it on \nthe head with a hammer and you killed it   or you Electrify it and it's dead then you come \nand Slaughter it this is Haram this is dead meat   but if you stun the animal or the chicken and \nit becomes drowsy so that's easy to handle and   to slaughter this is halal without a problem in \nsha Allah and I hope this answers your question and have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford it \nthat's good for you if you cannot you're entitled   for one free session and this is for everybody \nif they can affirm by Allah that they cannot   afford it because they're poor I'll give them \none free session without a problem a full half   an hour so come to me and let's speak about \nit inshallah within the following two days   or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for All foreign"
