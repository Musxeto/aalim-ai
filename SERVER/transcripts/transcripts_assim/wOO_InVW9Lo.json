  "title": "Traveler prayed resident Imam but joined in last rakat, should he pray 2 or 4 rakat?",
  "transcript": "The next question is, a Musafir or traveller prayed Duhur behind a Muqeem Imam, but he joined at the last Raka. Should he pray two or four Raka? When a traveller prays behind a resident Imam, he must complete his prayer, even if he attained the last Raka only. He said, this is the Sunnah of the Prophet, Alayhis Salatu Wassalam. So he attributed this to the Prophet's Sunnah. He offers Salam, I stand up. Logically, I should pray the second, no, my second, and offer Salam, khalas, I'm a traveller. No, according to Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, I have to continue three Raka to complete four Raka as my Imam, the resident. And Allah knows best."
