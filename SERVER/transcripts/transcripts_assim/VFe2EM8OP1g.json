  "transcript": "[Questioner]. She says, someone told me that there \nis a hadith that says that we should not make dua   to Allah to grant us sabr. Is it true? The answer \nis no. The hadith is not authentic. However, is it   appropriate to ask Allah for patience, for sabr? \nThe scholars defined that not to be appropriate   before a calamity befalls upon you. So at \ntimes of ease, one should not ask Allah,   oh Allah grant me patience and tolerance and \nsabr. Rather, he should ask Allah for al-afiyah,   for the well-being and the prosperity in life \nand the hereafter. But after a calamity strikes,   and when a person is already being tested, this \nis recommended for you to ask Allah for patience   and for sabr. As Allah said in the Quran, [ \n]. This is when the calamity took place and   they were about to fight an army. So now they \nwant Allah to grant them patience. But when you   are at ease and in times of prosperity, that \nwouldn't be logical to ask Allah for patience   because as if you're asking Allah to already \ntest you, and Allah Azza wa Jal knows best."
