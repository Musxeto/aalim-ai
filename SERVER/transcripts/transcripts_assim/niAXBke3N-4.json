  "title": "Can we say Different prescribed dhikr in Sujood, Mix & Match",
  "transcript": "Aliza from Indonesia. My question is, is it permissible to say different supplication or zikr in a certain position in the same or even different raka'ah? For example, on the first sujood I'd say SubhanAllah wa bi'l-A'la but in the second sujood in the same raka'ah I'd say SubhanAllah wa bi'l-A'la wa bi'l-Hamdi. That's my question. Jazakallahu Khair. Jazakum. First of all, the minimum requirement in sujood is to say SubhanAllah wa bi'l-A'la. After that, the sky is the limit. So if you say once SubhanAllah wa bi'l-A'la and then say SubhanAllah wa bi'l-A'la wa bi'l-Hamdi and say Subhuhan Quddusu Rabbul Malaikati Wal Ruh and then say Allahumma alaka sajadtu bika amantu wa alika tawakkalt sajada wajhi alladhi khalaqahu wa sawarahu etc. No problem. If you say some in the first sajda, others in the second sajda, no problem as long as you say the minimum requirement in each and every sajda, SubhanAllah wa bi'l-A'la once. Then it's open. You don't have to mimic it throughout the whole prayer exactly what I said three times in the first sajda. I have to say three times in the second sajda and the third and the fourth and so on. No. The sky is the limit providing you say the minimum which is SubhanAllah wa bi'l-A'la once and I hope this answers your question. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi'idhnillah azza wa jal I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi'idhnillah."
