  "transcript": "down and to pick it up i have to bend down and if there's an idol in front of me so if i bend down so am i simple what is your intention when you're bending down making sujud no no suppose if i fall on my glasses so so my intention is to pick it up pick up the glasses and what up okay so what's the problem so [Music] to pick up the glasses we have to do kind of so means we have to bend down okay i will answer inshallah and from india um he asks a frequent question which indicates that a lot of the muslims have a problem in understanding the concept of shirk and kufur he says if i dropped my glasses and i bent down to pick them up and in front of me was an idol am i committing shirk the answer is of course you're committing shirk when you're saying subhanallah he said no no no i'm not praying i'm not saying anything i'm just picking the glasses so why are you wasting my time why don't you guys think with your logic with your head instead of allowing shaytan to mess up with your heads like this what's wrong in picking up your glasses what's your intention this is what counts not so if there's an idol in front of me and i dropped my keys and i just went down to look underneath it if my keys are there or not am i prostrating to it no i don't have the intention i'm not saying it what you see is your problem what is my intention sometimes i sit in the masjid and i read the quran and there is a sajdah so i placed the quran on the ground and i make my sajdah some of the elders and and the grumpy grandfathers come to me well i'm a grumpy grandfather as well but you know being in the business for too long you tend to forget how old you are some of them may come to you so what pick up the the mushaf from the ground the why he said this is disrespecting it said subhanallah you know what's in my heart i've been praying uh uh for allah for so long i've been reading quran for so long i've been memorizing parts of it for so long and i've been reading it for an hour out of what to get your credit to get your praising i'm doing it for allah azza so if i put it on the ground you don't know if i'm humiliating it or not and definitely not in a thousand years i would be humiliating it so please mind your own business likewise when someone extends and stretches his feet while sitting in the masjid towards the qibla people come say hey what are you doing gather your feet why this disrespecting allah azza says who i have utmost respect in my heart but it is not what you guys think or try to make it as a formality of the way you sit or the way you dress or the all of this is baloney you"
