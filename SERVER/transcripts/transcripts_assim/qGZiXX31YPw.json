  "title": "Is it permissible to make dua in sujood in FARD prayer after subhana rabbi al a'la? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question is is it permissible to say any Dua in during prayer after saying sub like saying this question most likely is coming to us because of the main misconception in the subcontinent where there say in F prayer you must not make any Dua Subhan Allah where did you guess get this ruling oh Simon says yeah but where did Simon get this ruling how would I believe you or follow you when you preventing preventing me from making Dua to my Lord who I have no other Lord to call upon and you say you don't make Dua how is that possible the prophet himself saidat in an authentic Hadith the closest a servant of Allah is to Allah when he is prostrating the prophet went on to sayat so call and ask Allah for whatever you need it is worthy that Allah would answer you so he did not segregate or differentiate between F prayer and voluntary prayer and he did not say that you should limit it only to na prayer therefore yes you can do as much Dua As You Wish whether it's from this world or for the Hereafter whether you want Allah to pay off your debts or to facilitate the marriage of your children or that Allah forgives you and grants you the highest level of paradise it's all the same"
