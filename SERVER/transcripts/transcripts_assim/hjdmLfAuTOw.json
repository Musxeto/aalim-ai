  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Sheikh is it better to do Khatam of Quran in Taraweeh or is it better to do Taraweeh with memorized small surah and do Khatam separately during day? First of all the issue of doing Khatam and for those who do not know what's the meaning of Khatam Khatam in Arabic means a seal and it's also refers to completing a book from cover to cover So when you do Khatam of the Quran means that you've read the whole entire Quran So a lot of the Muslims think that doing Khatam or reciting the whole Quran during Taraweeh and night prayer is a Sunnah which is not This is not true, there is not such a thing as being a Sunnah However, reciting the full Quran during Khatam every lunar month is a Sunnah As per the Hadith of Abu Darda with his friend Salman Al-Farisi and the Hadith of Abdullah Ibn Amr Ibn Al-As May Allah be pleased with them all The Prophet said recite the Quran once a month However, it had been the practice of Muslims to hear the Quran in its entirety during the month of Ramadan during Taraweeh But is it Sunnah? No it's not So you're asking me what's best? I would say to recite the Quran from your memory during Taraweeh as long as it's going to be long enough And at the same time completing the Quran during the month of Ramadan so that you would comply with the Sunnah without skipping a whole month without completing the Quran If this is not possible due to time, due to health reasons, in this case there is no problem in holding the Quran during Taraweeh And finishing the Quran during Taraweeh without thinking that it is a Sunnah"
