  "transcript": "and finally Samia says scholars say that even if the effect of the impurity disappears from a place it can be transferred if touched with wet hands but hands show no sign of impurity how is this possible yes if you have urine on this table and it dries out but the impurity is there it still exists if my hands are wet and I touch it my hands become nudges and impure because you did not wash the area even if there are no physical signs the impurity is still there and Allah so gel knows best this"
