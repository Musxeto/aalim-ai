  "transcript": "while watching the new moon sighting it felt like a good lighting this day is all right as the first start we here tonight with family around a nice meal we're making do on I feel how nice it is to be so near to those I love oh dear brothers and sisters in Islam Hadith number 4 48 in the book of that deals with the chapter of fasting may Allah be pleased with her narrated with the start of the last 10 days of Ramadan the messenger of Allah Sall alaihi wasallam used to tighten his waist belt that is keep away from his wives and used to stay up praying all night and he would also wake his wives up to pray and recite Quran Etc and this Hadith was agreed upon on now in this beautiful Hadith mother AA may Allah be pleased with her is describing what the prophet Alam used to do in the last 10 nights of Ramadan and what is the significance of the last 10 nights of Ramadan as Muslims know in this night there is the night of decree and and it is as Allah describes it in the Quran better than a thousand month and some Scholars go to the extent of multiplying deeds in that night by a thousand months and this is to my own opinion not what was meant but it is meant that the deeds and the actions done in that night are so favored and blessed by Allah more than the deeds in a thousand months other than that night so the prophet Alat wasam when these 10 nights come he would change his mood and he would excel in offering Good Deeds to allaha and this indicates that during these 10 nights it is permissible to stay all night to stay up all night and to pray night prayer why how was the night prayer of the Prophet Alam in other nights mother AA tells us that and and the prophet tells us as well that the best night prayer is the night prayer of prophet dud he used to sleep half of the night wake up to pray 1/3 of the night and then sleep one 16th of the night this was his routine peace be upon him and this as the prophet described Alam to be the best night prayer why because if you sleep at the beginning of the night half of it you wake up with lots of energy you're well rested you're well focused so you pray for one third of the night and then you sleep the remaining one sixth of the night so by this you've slept 2/3 of the nights and you've prayed onethird of the night so when you wake up for f because of that one sixth of the night that you had slept you wake up in a a very good mood and you are feeling well and comfortable and not tired in the last 10 nights of Ramadan this changes the prophet used to tighten his belt waist belt or his apron and this in Arabic has two meanings so if someone wants to start digging or working or pulling things or or or pushing things usually he would tighten his belt well so that his dress would not fall and he does not have to uh uh work with his dress or with his apron or his waist wrapper so this is an indication a metaphor used to indicate that it the time is getting tough so that's why we have to tighten our belts not literally but it's an indication the other meaning would be that when someone tightens his belt this means that he would not loosen up his uh waist wrapper for example which means that it is another metaphor for not having intercourse with your spouse so in the last 10 nights the prophet Alam did not have any intimacy with his spouses especially if we were to know as we will get to read in the following hadiths that he used to go into seclusion into so this is an indication that during the last 10 nights like the nights we are in uh uh at the moment it is recommended that you stay up the whole night of course not to watch TV not even Huda TV not not to watch soap opras or to waste your time in uh malls and and in the sus no you stay up wake the whole night to pray to read the Quran to invoke Allah to make vick so that you fill your time with what pleases Allah the almighty and from this Hadith we also learn that the prophet sallallahu alaihi Al wasallam used to work really hard in worshiping Allah Asel though Allah has forgiven all his past sins and the upcoming sins nevertheless he was never resting he used to pray night prayer until his feet were swollen and this is only to indicate to us that though he trusts Allah though Allah has favored him with forgiveness he does not sit back and relax life is not a place for relaxation it is not you're not created Allah do not did not create you to relax he created you to worship Him and after death you will relax for a thousand year a gazillion years you will relax for eternity in Paradise with things that would blow your mind away things you cannot even imagine but you trust Allah and his generosity from this Hadith we learn that it is also part of the Sunnah to work hard and to strive in doing what pleases Allah asael specifically on these nights and a lot of the people look for the night of decree and some of them are so lazy they only pray and worship Allah on the odd number of nights the even numbers they don't pay attention to it and this is wrong as we will get to know inshallah from this Hadith we learn that the prophet used to wake up his wives now is it mandatory for them to pray the answer is no but why did he then wake them up because it is part of his responsibility sallallahu alaih wasallam to guide them to what is beneficial for them it is part of his responsibility to protect them from Hellfire as Allah says oh you who believe protect yourselves and your families from Hellfire so it is part of your responsibility as a parent it is part of your responsibility as a husband to ensure that your household are all awake and making something that is utilizing their time in in reciting the Quran in invoking Allah repeat it as many times as you wish and from this this is what the prophet used to uh uh do the following Hadith is Hadith number 49 AA again may Allah be pleased with her said that the prophet of Allah s alai wasam used to perform during the last 10 days of Ramadan until he died then his wives used to perform after his death and this Hadith was also agreed upon now what do we look learn from this Hadith we learned from this Hadith that is a greatah okay what is translates to seclusion so is to get yourself secluded in a Masjid in a mosque where you spend the last 10 nights of Ramadan in that Masjid doing what what do people do in masjids reading the Quran offering prayers making invoking Allah doing something that pleases Allah the almighty the point of it is that you have these 10 nights and days of course because you'll be there for 10 full days to have them dedicated to Allah Asel like what we call quality time so it's a time in the year that you cleanse your heart that you revise what you had done in the past and what you would plan to do in the future it's a time of reflection and we know that before became a messenger he used to go to and he used to stay there for weeks contemplating on Allah's Great Signs and Creations so 10 nights every year the prophet Alam used to do that every single year and even when he missed it one year Alam he made it up in sha so mother AA tells us that he used to do this as a Sunnah every single year and this continued until he died which means that it was not abrogated so it was still there and it tells us how the prophet Alam was dedicated to doing things that would get him closer to Allah the almighty even if it was a bit difficult and tough on an individual because for us it is a little bit tough to be in confinement that is self Cho chosen you can find yourself to a spot in the Masjid most likely people would not get their mobiles with them so that they would not waste time by chitchatting but you can it's permissible but you should not spend your time chitchatting and imagine that there's no TV there's no uh uh Communication in a sense so you're dedicated no emails no um internet most of the time so you will not be browsing silly things and and and looking at things that may or must be sinful most likely in the Masjid there's nothing of such so you confine yourself to that position or to that location for what for seeking Allah's reward and for following the Sunnah of the Prophet Alat and it also shows us the greatness of the last 10 nights of Ramadan because in the beginning the prophet Alam made in the first 10 nights then he made it in the middle 10 nights then finally it remained to be only on in the last 10 nights and it Contin till he died sallam so this is the Sunnah now also we learn from this Hadith that the wives of the Prophet Alam used to perform or offer while he was alive and this is proven in authentic Hadith inkari and elsewhere but even after his death they contined to do this as mothers of the Believers which indicates to us as Muslims that women can make in the Masjid it is shocking to know that in countries like India and elsewhere as people tell me that there are no prayer halls or prayer sections in the Masjid for women and women are prevented from praying in the Masjid and this is totally prohibited this is Haram to do this the prophet says do not prevent women from attending the houses of Allah and he said also and praying in their homes is better for them but if a woman insists that this is her God god-given right however she has to obey her husband or father if they prevent her from doing this the sin is on them but she has to obey them nevertheless it is part of the Sunnah for women to make in the Masjid providing that the guardian approves of it one would say okay but the guard you just quoted a Hadith where the Prophet wasam do not prevent women from attending the houses of Allah yes this Hadith is in regards to mandatory prayers not in is longer mandate praise is like 10 15 minutes and and that's it is a is a longer thing and and it can be in some uh uh cases dangerous so if the mess is safe the vicinity is safe and if a woman goes into the Masjid she can stay there for 10 nights being safe No One harassing her or attacking her may Allah forbid in this case with the approval of her guardian it is permissible for her to make as the mothers of the Believers uh used to do ASA told us may Allah be uh pleased with her now the Hadith number 50 also narrated bya may Allah be pleased with her she said whenever the messenger of Allah sallallah alaihi wasallam intended to make he would pray the morning prayer and then he would enter the place of his that is the place which he had prepared for his inside the mosque and this was agreed upon this Hadith tells us about the timing and the scholars differ in this regard because the Hadith of mother AA states that he used to begin or let me rephrase that he used to enter the special place for his seclusion his after F prayer but we know that is for the 10 nights not for the 10 days though the days are included and Scholars had many interpretations some of them said yes it is the fuder of the 20th day of Ramadan and we know that the 10 nights begin after the sunset of the 20th day not before so they said yes because the prophet went there Al ahead of time so when the sun set he was already in the Masjid and in his special special place for seclusion so that he would complete the full 10 nights other Scholars say no this was on the 21st day of Ramadan because this is the first day of the last 10 days the answer is yes this is correct but he would have missed the previous night because the night precedes the day in Islamic calendar so for example today is Tuesday when the sun sets today after Sunset it would be Wednesday night though in the western calendar it is still still considered to be Tuesday night islamically no it this is considered to be following the following day it is the night of the following day and that is why if we site the moon today is the 30th of shaan or the 29th of Shaban for example if we site the Moon after M we pray though we didn't fast today yes because tonight is the night of tomorrow which is the first of Ramadan so I hope this makes sense therefore they said that if the prophet entered the Masjid his seclusion area on the 24st uh 21st of f prayer then he would have missed the night the first night of the last 10 nights of uh Ramadan and the most authentic opinion is that we can collect and combine all the narrations this would be that the prophet Alam enters the Masjid in the general capacity before the sunset of the 20th so once the sun sets and the night of the 21st begins he's already in the Masjid so he has started the night in his seclusion but in the m mid in general after F prayer he enters the special allocated place for his seclusion sallai wasam and by this uh um this is what we can combine all texts and EV evidences with bearing in mind that it was the Sunnah of the Prophet to have a special place a special Dome or a tent small tent to sit in and stay away from people he wasn't sitting among the people in the Masjid and and chitchatting with them no he had a special place to stay in not like what we see today where people are you know sleeping in the Haram or elsewhere there's no partition there's nothing and when they wake up they eat together they sit together they uh uh chitchat together this is not part of the Sunnah of the Prophet Alam that is why as reported in buari and Elsewhere One One um Ramadan says that the prophet Alam ordered them to erect him a small tent and she requested the prophet Alam to build one next to his for her seclusion so he agreed then ha may Allah be pleased with her the mother of the believer requested permission from AA to do the same and it shouldn't Bea's order but because H Anda were from the same party of the wives of the Prophet Alam and Z J and other wives were at the second party so AA approved and H got this small tent erected again when zanab saw this she got jealous and she also ordered her own uh uh tent to be erected so when the prophet went for f prayer and he saw these four small tents in the Masjid he exclaimed and asked his companions is good what they are intending is good what they are intending it is not good what they are intending meaning that they don't want to get closer to Allah asael by their action they want jealousy they want to boast one another by being close to me and the prophet ordered them to remove all these tents and he did not perform that only year but in sha he made up for the 10 days as we will get to discuss this inshallah so what is the most authentic opinion the most authentic opinion is that one should go into his seclusion after or before the sunset of the 20th which is the 21st night of the last uh uh 10 nights of Ramadan moving on to Hadith number 51 mother AA may Allah be pleased with her also narrated that the prophet of Allah sallallah alaihi wasallam used to put his head into the window of my house while he was in the mall performing and I would calm his hair when he was in he would not enter the house except for some need and this is agreed upon now mother AA is telling us about the dos and don'ts as we will also learn in the following Hadith of the Prophet Alat so many many times we hear that the prophet Alam had a lot of hair and his hair would probably reach his neck or his ears so it was quite long and usually when you have long hair it's untidy sometimes it's unclean but this was not the case with the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam who was always clean tidy and you would never smell any fragrance better than his fragrance sallallah alaihi wasallam so for this when he was in seclusion he used to take good care of his hair and the cleanliness of his head as well so the prophet Alat wasam used to get his head out of the Masjid for AA and we know that and we know that the houses of the Prophet Alam his wives were nine and they were surrounding the Masjid with a small door to the Masjid but the houses were outside of the fence of uh uh the Masjid and each woman had a separate house so they did not live in the same house they all had their own separate accommodation so during his the prophet would get his head out where mother AA would wash his hair would clean it would oil it probably and fix it up for him and this is an indication that unlike what a lot of the Muslims think when a person is in he should not change his clothes he should not put perfume he should not shower he should not clean himself all of this is baseless there's nothing wrong in you going and showering every day changing your clothes once or twice a day to be in a good shape and in a neat uh uh uh look this is part of the Sunnah wearing perfume is permissible you being in seclusion does not mean that you have to torture yourself or to humilate yourself or to look in a very uh uh distasteful way this was not the Sunnah of the prophet from this Hadith we learned that the prophet had long hairat and the issue of making your hair long prolonging your hair is it part of the Sunnah because when we look at some of the the brothers uh uh who are fighting in the cause of Allah we always find them having long hair and there are people who would prolong their hair and and wear it in a ponytail for example or a donkey tail or whatever and but this is not part of the Sunnah they just doing it because it looks cool so what is it is it permissible or prohibited it depends on the culture of the people see the Arabs culture at the time that all Arabs used to prolong their hair and braid their hair as well so if you are in a country if you are in uh uh the na native uh lands of the red Indians for example the Apaches or whatever and they are prolonging their hair and you are with them in that Community you follow suit because you are with the people you don't want to you know stand out in a crowd and if you are in a country or in an an environment where everybody shaves their hair or cut their hair in a normal way then you have to be like this because Islam tells you that you do not have to go against the flow unless your religion tells you to do so so growing your hair or cutting it short it's part of the culture not part of the religion so if you prolong your hair don't think that Allah would reward you for that because this is not a Sunnah this is part of the culture of the Customs likewise when the prophet used to ride a mule to go from one place to the other if someone rides a mule now going to work and he says this is Sunnah I would say no this is cultural has nothing to do with the Sunnah if the prophet had cars at the time he would have used it definitely so you have to differentiate between what is Sunnah and what is cultural now in this Hadith we also well before going to that so what's the ruling on me wearing my my Saudi attire when I'm in the US God forbids or uh uh uh in Europe well if this is an indication that I'm a Muslim and I'm from a foreign country there's no problem in that what about the ruling of UK citizens wearing this if this is the norm so if har Krishna followers wear their strange yellow or orange clothes and if uh Jehovah Witness have their own clothes and you wear your own clothes this is okay no problem but if it handers your da so when you call people to Islam they take a negative uh uh uh position or stand from you because you look weird in this case no it is advisable to wear the normal clothes that the people of that country we so that there would be some Harmony and they would accept what you say and it's a issue of Judgment of the individual whether the consequences are better or not in the Hadith we learn that it is permissible to use your wife other than issues of intimacy so the prophet ordered heram to uh clean and wash his hair and Comet and wives do this uh uh with pleasure with without saying no uh is married only for bed and I don't cook I don't clean the windows I don't do this and that no this is a mutual thing that they should care about together and finally we learn from this Hadith that it is not permissible for a person in to go out except for his needs and what are these needs this is inshallah what we will talk about briefly after the break so stay tuned their lives again for them happiness let us bring Ramadan Allah subhanahu wa taala commanded Us in the Quran saying hasten to the Forgiveness of your lord and to Paradise the width of which is the heavens and the Earth prepared for the righteous and Pious brothers and sisters in Islam especially in the month of Ramadan the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam tells us that when the first night of the month of Ramadan is here

to uh uh do or to uh leave his for mother AA said for his need so how can we explain this need Scholars say that these are the essential human needs that everyone needs so in order to answer the call of nature you cannot do that in the mid so you have to leave so this is permissible if someone wakes up in the state of major ritual impurity due to urnal emission definitely he has to leave and perform and come back his daily needs he eating and drinking and if he does not have someone to bring that over to him in this case it is permissible for him to go out to eat in a restaurant to buy food but of course not to exaggerate uh a lot on this issue not going to a five-star hotel which takes about half an hour drive and then you know have a good time and come back no you take what is essential from as close as possible and then go back for your seclusion because this is time that is counted for you I don't see any calls until now so I think we go to the following Hadith until we get some uh uh questions Hadith number 52 uh it's also about uh and it is from may Allah be pleased with her she said that it is Sunnah for the one performing not to visit the sick not to attend a funeral and not to touch his wife with sexual desire nor have sexual intercourse with her he should also not go out of the mosque except for an extreme necessity and no is accepted without fasting or without being in congregational in a congregational mosque where Friday prayer is performed and this was related by Abu daud with an acceptable chain of narrators but Scholars say that the last part starting of no is accepted this is most probably the saying of AA may Allah be pleased with her so uh we have to go through these uh um things that mother AA mentioned I know that a and and shamin are waiting so kindly you're wa calling from Saudi Arabia it's not going to cost you a lot do bear with me for four five minutes or call again later until I just go through this so the Sunnah when she says the Sunnah means that this is taken from the prophet Alam for a person in seclusion not to visit a sick person though it's a good deed but his is a priority and not to follow a funeral so if he prays janaza in the Masjid and they take to the graveyard he should not go out with them he should not have any types of intimacy nor sexual intercourse with his spouse and he should not leave the Masjid except for a specific need that he has to do this all of this are part of the previous Hadith where he must not leave unless he has a necessity for that and she says and this is her own op opinion as scholar say that there is no without fasting and the most authentic opinion is that yes there is without fasting and that it should be in a Masjid where congregational prayer is established especially Friday this is also correct and true uh a from Saudi Arabia thank you for waiting no no problem she uh shik this mobile number of yours is the same one now 05056 46504 no it's 94 a not 04 H 94 okay uh I have some questions which I want to ask you after Ramadan because they are little bit lengthy and I don't want to waste time of other people use it so please kindly guide me what is the

we after savings and uh everything it's in our hand now it's not it's not a debt it's not loan it's our money okay so and the second question is uh regarding uh car loan you know here in Saudia we have this like we we will go to car dealer like Abdul Latif Jam like if they have this scheme of like rent to own own is it okay for us to to get this one it's not mortgage because we are like like to own okay I will answer your question thank you you're welcome um brother Amin from bahin says that after finishing the Quran can I give the reward to my deceased mother the answer is no why I love my mother w we all love our mothers but we love the Sunnah more than our mothers the prophet did not ever indicate this to any of his companions he did didn't direct this to any of his companions though a lot of his companions died in his lifetime but he directed us to making Dua to give charity to make or so this is what you should do my friend uh we have sham from Saudi yeah sorry the question I want to ask is concerning okay first and foremost I want to know what is the standard Islamic on the percentage in which one has to give and for one living in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in terms of cash what is the amount to be given and in terms of um given food items what is the um um the kilogram okay I will answer you giving out yeah thank you so much you're welcome Amar from Saudi I want to know um about do can which one do we recite for in the wther there are two one is for the hanafi maab and one is for the um I think Malaki or Shafi okay I will answer your question which one and uh two uh the same about fana how much to pay and uh like we are six members so how much will we pay here in Saudi fana and what is Kisa also do we pay kiswa also okay I will answer you inshallah yeah and and the last question is like if you can tell me like someone one dies like uh after the death how do we mourn the disease like is it 3 days or we make um you know uh read Quran or like what are the things you're supposed to do okay I will answer your question inshallah uh we have okay this is it so um brother am me says that today he prayed Eid here and then he flew in the afternoon to India which he reached in the evening and it was the last day of e for them also so tomorrow they will pray Eid prayer can I pray it again the answer is yes you can pray two eids uh uh at the same month no problem with that insh Allah sham from Saudi Arabia says I'd like to know the percentage of Zak there isn't any percentage for Zak the percentage is for your Zak but Zak is something something else I'll take bash's from Nigeria and come back to youum listen to me from the phone please my question is is on N prayer if one make a mistake and he pray Ki and B to replace the the mistakes are in F or in okay I will answer you inshah and okay this is it so um Lea okay I went to shamad and I forgot Lea Lea from Saudi says that they have zakat Mal but they don't have a fixed how for it so they collect money this month and then they spend some of it and then the following month they have another salary so they don't know which is which well the answer for that is very simple the scholars say that you have to have 12 Pockets or wallets where you have these money in and you have to calculate every month from the next year and do the zakat of it which is impossible and it's something too hard for you to do so what to do when was the first day you started collecting money and it reached nisab let's assume it is on the fifth month of the lunar calendar so go and after 12 months on the first day of the fifth month from the following year look at whatever money you have whether it came couple of weeks ago couple of months ago a whole year ago whatever you have in your possession calculate 2.5% and give it in zakat and do the same process every single year and this way you have given your zakat on time and the money that did not finish a full year you preceded giving the zakat a year earlier with the grace of Allah do we have Fatima from Gambia yes may Allah reward you abundantly for the good job that you doing and you as well my question is please is the if you're reciting the Quran is the reward equal to listening to it because I cannot read the Quran myself but if I listen to it is the Lord equal to reciting it also I once lived in the United Kingdom and I'm back in The Gambia for7 years now I was deported back to the Gambia but the problem is when I while I was in the UK I took loan and the loan was based on interest I was paying for some time and I stopped but then I did not know that interest was and this and this other I now find out about it and I'm really worried about this situation I'm concerned because I cannot pay back the money now that I live in Gambia I cannot afford to pay that huge amount of loan in the UK so I don't know what to do with it are you going back to theuk no I'm I'm now permanently living in The Gambia because I was deported here in The Gambia seven years ago and now I find out about rer I did not know about okay I will answer you any more questions yeah yes please and can you say I love Prophet Muhammad sahu Al wasallam for the sake of Allah can you think about him um him being a good man and all the good things he's done and then you just say to yourself for the sake of Allah do you what for the sake of Allah like you say like to sit down and think about the prophet and say you love him only for the sake of Allah love him loving him for for the sake of Allah yes okay I will answer your question thank you very you're welcome and Leila's question about uh um buying a car on leas to own schemes from ABD J and and other um car companies is this permissible I personally believe that this is not permissible except if you were to actually lease it but see the problem is that it's a big game these guys usually car dealers don't fear Allah so they twist the Shar so it fits their needs and they go to Scholars asking them about general questions then then tailor making it to Suits their needs so they say uh to The Scholar what's the ruling on leasing a car the answer is okay this is permissible nobody disagrees with this so what's the uh ruling on after the 5 years period is finished I give the car as a gift to the one who uh uh rented it or I would you know sell it to him with a price that we would reach and agree upon said this is permissible so they collect all these generally asked questions and they tailor make it into this scheme of theirs you end up going to the shop what is my intention I want to buy a car what is the intention of the dealer we want to sell a car okay why don't you do this no the dealer says I'm not selling you a car I'm leasing you a car but you and I know that eventually I'm going to sell it to you so why are you doing this ah to ensure that you pay on time and that you don't uh um go bad on installments so you say okay let's go ahead for it you do it and you pay or you agree for 50 months to pay 2,000 r on the last month on the 49th month if you fail to pay the last installments some companies for 2 three months they wait if you don't they have a spare key they know where the car is they take the car and resell it and you've lost your 49 months of payment maybe I wasn't in in jail maybe I was hospitalized this is not not my business even worse for the four 49 months you've been paying on time on the spot not a single day delayed just before the last payment a big truck comes and runs over your car destroying it totally the car was parked in a nice and and good place everything was legal you go to the car dealer say the the car is destroyed don't worry it's insured the car insurance gave us a new brand new car you said alhamdulillah can I have my car I said no you don't have a car what do you mean I paid for 49 months yeah you were leasing okay I have one month left okay where is your car it's gone this is a brand new car it's all ours you'd like we make you another 50 months new contract this is not what Allah asael wants and this is a big time form of cheating we have Fel from the Emirates hello F yeah can you raise your voice a little bit please yeah uh I have one question yes yeah uh actually in India there's this uh practice is that uh when a new baby is born uh so you you say the aah in one year and theama in the other year is this right you you say you say what the the aan one year and theama in the other year so is this right okay I will answer you inshallah yes thank you you're welcome um shamen from Saudi Arabia was asking about the percentage on zakat there isn't anything as such uh as a percentage on on Zak the percentage is on the gold on the silver on the cash you have or on the Investments or on the crops that are being grown Etc now when we talk about zakat zakat is something allocated to make the poor not extend their hands in beg on the day ofid so it is a of grain of food what is it is for mud the mud is what you gather in the palms of your of your hand so you take a big scoop of rice this is one mood two three four whatever contains uh uh um in a container this is called s so the prophet tells usam you have to give One S of food per every individual man or woman child uh uh or slave or free as long as he's muslim okay so what kind of food Scholars say the food that the people eat so if you eat mainly rice like we do in Arabia then you do give rice if you eat dates then dates do the job corn barley whatever the people eat generally on uh on daily basis in their country now how much is that in kilograms it differs because the is means of measurement by size not by weight so what if I get a container a liter for example and I put rice in it and I put dates in it the weight would be different so in rice it's equivalent to 2.25 kg of rice so if you bring a container and fill it up with 2.25 grams of rice you can use the same container for weighing or measuring the S of corn or of beans or of whatever you uh want to give for zakat and um can we give cash the answer is no the prophet had cash at the time and he specifically indicated that they give food in uh the means of uh uh food not cash uh we have uh AR Ari from Saudi she I have two questions yes the first question is regarding is Salah that what is the last time like we till that we can offer Isa Salah like it's midnight orud or if we are not sleeping till F uh how long we can do that and my second question is it okay the first question yeah yeah yeah okay my second question is regarding like uh we have a relative and unfortunately he's indulged in the habit of drinking but they are poor and I'm I want to give them some money but I'm worried that if I'll give money they may he may use that in like in the same activity of drinking alcohol so I don't know what should I do I will answer you inshallah thank you so much from Saudi Arabia she says that which one of Kun is more correct the one of the long Dua we praising Allah at the very beginning or well to my uh uh knowledge that the Dua of this is the most authentic because it was taught by the prophet to but both inshallah are acceptable and one can do either one and she says that for six people what is their we've answered this when addressing Chin's question and K I've answered this yesterday and said that there isn't anything that is related to zakat as k K is buying dresses or or clothes to the poor this is not part of the Sunnah if you want to do it as Charity not related to Zak this is okay and permissible she says that mourning the dead how would we mourn the dead of course the prophet said Alam that it is not permissible to mourn a dead more than three days except for a wife mourning her husband so what to do in mourning someone who's not a husband you have 3 days morning by for example refusing to eat this is permissible for 3 days not wearing perfume not cleaning yourself not wearing nice clothes you can do that no problem but after the third day is over this is no more you have to go back to your normal life Fara from Saudi alikum Shah Shake I'm just going to ask hello yes I'm listening are I'm just going to our Shake because I am a single but then I went umra for how many times I think 10 times but then somebody told me one of my friend it's not maharam is it true or what Shake are you asking is it prohibited to make 10 umras or not yes Shake because I am single and then somebody told me it's not muharam it is it is muharam not not muharam okay okay no problem okay then we have Bash from Nigeria he says that if someone makes a mistake I think I understood his question this way if someone makes a mistake in NE prayer involuntary prayer does he have to make or forgetfulness prostration before or after Salam the answer is yes it is like the Salah the normal f f Salah when you make a mistake in mandatory things or adding things you have to offer the FMA from Gambia she says that she cannot read the Quran so can she listen to it and uh uh um listen to the Quran being recited would she get the same reward inshallah you will get the same reward uh with the grace of Allah she had a loan from the UK before she was deported and she didn't know that it was an interest based loan and now she is worried about it and I asked her are you going back to the UK she said no she was deported she would never go back most likely the loan is dead they cannot take it from you because you are in a different country and um they have bigger fish to fry your loan is not as big to send for the interpole to catch you so therefore the amount you borrowed let's say it's a th000 quid ,000 in this case there is interest like2 200 pound neglect the interest the, you have to collect because it's not yours and then give it in means of Charity in Gambia it is not yours you cannot just oh simply uh uh let's kiss and make up I took the loan and now I will not go back to the UK so I'll enjoy it and and and take it no this is not yours lawfully so you have to cleanse your wealth by giving it when you are able to afford it uh in means of Charity what's the ruling on loving the Prophet for the sake of Allah definitely this is one of the greatest uh forms of worship of Allah the more you love the prophet the more Allah loves you back because the prophet is the best of Allah's creation so you remember his s you read his biography you remember his Hadith you remember his plight and his hardship in delivering the dean to us and you have nothing and you cannot do anything more than to love him more and more peace and praise of Allah be upon him facal from the Emirates says that what's the ruling on giving aan in one ear of the newborn and in the other ear that this is not part of the Sunnah and all the hadiths in it are not authentic at all so you're not allowed to do this AR she says that what's the last time for Isa prayer it is midnight so if the sun sets at 7 and right and the break of dawn is at 4: from 7 to four uh to 12 this is 5 hours and 4 hours this is 9 hours half of 9 hours is 4 and a half add the 4 and a half hours to 7 which is sunset you get the 11:30 so 11:30 is the last time for you to pray after that it would not be accepted she has a relative who drinks uh wine who drinks intoxicants and unfortunately uh he's poor so she is afraid of giving him charity and he would use it to Haram means the answer don't give him cash money instead tell him I have cash I'm going to buy you food or if you have a a phone bill or electricity bill I'll pay that for you but do not give him cash and finally Fara says that someone told her that offering a lot of omra is Haram because she offered 10 Omas and she's single it has nothing to do being single or married as long as it's safe for you and it is not a traveling distance you don't need a m so you if you're from jida going to Mecca and with your Safe Company this is not traveling this is permissible but if you are traveling without a Mah then this is Haram do as manyas As You Wish 100 a thousand this is between you and Allah and the more you do the closer you get to Allah this is all the time we have until we meet next time while watching the new moon sighting it felt like a good in l in this day is so right as the first start our we here tonight with family around a nice meal we're making do our night feel how nice it is to be so near to those I love whenever we think of radan all the good things that we need to do and plan it's not always easy easy but we'll do the best we can"
