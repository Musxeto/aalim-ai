  "title": "Uncovering in front of non-Muslims women and children",
  "transcript": "I believe that her question was is it permissible for her to mix with non-muslim females and they would see her hair and and see her dressed as if she's in her home some of the scholars say this is not permissible but the authentic opinion is that it is permissible for non-muslim females to mix with Muslim females as long as they are trustworthy and we don't have any reason to doubt them but if I know that this particular individual even if she was a Muslim if she comes and sits with my wife or with my sister and then she goes to her uh uh brothers or husband and tells them about how my sister or my wife looks like and describes them to uh describes her to them no this is not permissible she has to uh uh cover is for the children the children are far less uh dangerous than women because children Muslims or non-muslims by default if they're children they're unable to recognize and and and and memorize the things that may interest men so inshallah there's nothing wrong in that"
