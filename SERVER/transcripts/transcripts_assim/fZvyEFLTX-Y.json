  "transcript": "I study in a code environment and this year my friends and I have asked for a prayer uh which is I think a prayer Hall my question is is is it all right for boys and girls to pray in the same room and to pray together well first of all I do not advise I do not advise in studying in uh uh a mixed environment unless the men and boys are completely segregated and they don't get in touch at all or socialize or communicate they have to have a a true and real barrier between them if this is the case inshallah especially in in countries of the West I hope that this is permissible because they have have no other alternative and they have to go to refer to their and they would give them the proper advice secondly it is not commended for women to pray in the Masjid as you all know the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam uh said to us that uh women praying in their homes is far better for their reward than praying in the Masjid of the prophet in Medina therefore if a woman is given the choice between praying in the home or praying in a prayer room in in the University or in at school then praying in her home is better unless she's afraid that if she waits until she reaches home the prayer time would be out in this case yes she has to pray and it is recommended that prays in a prayer room now would she pray in congregation with the other students or not again it is permissible for them to pray together in one room providing that they do not not mix in coming in and going out from that prayer room providing that it is not so close but if it's like a normal small room a normal room as in the rooms of the houses and three or four or five men are in the first draw and four or five women at at the back of the room it is too close in being in that room it is not proper at all it's it's a small room and just feeling that you are with the opposite nonaham in the same room doesn't give you a good feeling it's not like being in a Masjid a big Masjid or a big hole where men and women are so segregated even without a visor or a screen they're segregated they're away from each other but when it's a small room no there's no no need for me to pray in congregation with you you wait until the men finish from their prayer or the men wait until the women finish from their prayer or you can pray in anywhere else not necessarily in a prayer Hall any location that you find and you pray in it Allah will accept your prayer"
