  "transcript": "regarding dying the hair using commercial products as you know the general rule in Islam states that everything for us is permissible to do unless there is a specific evidence preventing us from doing so and dying the hair falls under this category therefore it is permissible for a person to dye his or her hair with which is natural coloring or Al which is also a natural herb that is used for dying the hair or even using commercial products and nowadays A lot of the people use highlights and especially women they highlight parts of their hair in a different color the usual thing is acceptable so if a woman dyes her hair or highlights her hair as in blonde this is acceptable because it adds a a natural look and there's nothing wrong in that inshallah but if a person Dy her hair uh or his hair in in in purple or in pink or in strange colors this is not permissible not because it's dying the hair or it's because using a second or third color but because it is not natural and it draws attention to people and in Islam we're not allowed to draw attention to ourselves just in uh uh just to be famous or to be no dying the eyebrows falls under the same category of dying the hair if of course I forgot to mention in the first question uh on on my first reply that dying the hair using black color this is not permissible this is forbidden and it's Haram because the prophet asked the people of Abu Bakr pleas with him to change the whiteness in Abu bakr's father that was Abu be pleased with him who embraced Islam and all of the hair he had was white pitch white so they he told them to change the color and he told them to avoid black so dying the eyebrows again fors under the same category do we have any evidence to make it haram no we do not so it is permissible to be di providing it is a color that does not draw attention and providing it is not black and Allah Knows Best"
