  "title": "My husband ignores me & gives silent treatment to my frustration, what to do? #Assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um the next question is my husband does not validate my emotions he gives me the silent treatment when I voice my frustration how do I deal with this book a counseling session no seriously this is a big problem lots of the men are not real men they're male but not men to be a real man you have to know how to treat a woman and I'm talking about communication respect how you like others to treat your sister and your daughter and always put this scenario at the back of your head would I like my son-in-law to raise his voice like I'm doing with my wife with my daughter of course not so always be careful of what you do what goes around comes around you're going to treat your wife in a bad way someone's going to treat your daughter or your sister in even a worse way so but again this really requires counseling when a woman comes and complains to me I wouldn't judge for her because she's concealing 90% of the picture I say let me speak to your husband and I speak to the man when I listen to the woman alone I say wo your husband needs to be hanged but when I listened to the man I said whoo your wife has to stand in front of a firing squad and when I put them together 70% of all what they said melt like butter Under the Sun not in Edmonton it doesn't melt anything this sun here so be fair you as a wife before complaining from your husband's Behavior take a good look at the mirror why is he doing this you'll find that so many things you do irritates him and they make him resent you you need to change your ways and it takes two to tangle of course with Nashid no doof no musical instruments but you cannot expect him to be the best of husbands when you are the worst of wives change your strategy if it is always nagging nagging nagging refrain from nagging and do something else that may make him feel that you've changed and again you need to book a counseling session"
