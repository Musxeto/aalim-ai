  "transcript": "and i have the questions in front of me but i thought of changing the pace a little bit and begin with something that is a little better than the questions and that is with the sunset of today in saudi arabia this inaugurates the beginning of an era of a season which the prophet allah indicated by saying there are no days better where allah loves whatever good deeds you give more than these 10 days nowadays that good deeds are more beloved to allah than these 10 days the companion said even jihad we know that jihad is the best the prophet said even jihad except a man who goes out in the cause of allah azzawajal with his soul and wealth and does not come back with either one so these days the coming nine days including the day of aid of course but it's exempted from fasting these ten days are the best days of the whole dunya of the whole world even better than ramadan according to the majority of people when allah says with them all say that these are the ten days of the hijjah allah swears by them in the quran and the prophet said himself allah the best days of this world are the 10 days of the hijjah therefore it is a call for me and you to do far greater than what we used to do in the last 10 nights of ramadan in ramadan especially in the last 10 nights everybody around you is fasting through the day worshiping allah through the night offering taraweeh reciting the quran anticipating the night of decree so worshiping allah is easy because everybody else is doing it these 10 days of the hijjah are quite difficult because ignorance is widely spread negligence among the muslims is very high therefore it's rare to find someone fasting in these days it's rare to find someone going out of his way to finish the quran twice or maybe three times in these blessed days and nights you won't find people going out of their way trying to connect their kinship which was severed due to any simple or silly reason you would not find people paying for orphanages or widows or poor people there are thousands of people who need medication for their diabetes heart problems dialysis and they can't afford it there are thousands of people who can't pay off their rents and they are threatened to be vacated there are people who don't have power because they could not pay the electricity bill this is your season and the prophet told the salazar that there is or there are no days righteous deeds are more beloved to allah than these days so if you want to do something allah loves this is your chance but if you want to be negligent like everybody else if you don't want to make up for your shortcomings during the last 10 nights of ramadan if you want to be like everybody else the thousands and the millions and the billions of humans living on earth if you want to be like them then this or these words will not penetrate your heart it would enter from one ear and exit from the other those whom allah loves will help them will encourage them will give them the enthusiasm to pursue the things that he loves knows best i pray to allah that he grants us this gift of his and to make us among those blessed to offer as many good deeds as we can in these blessed 10 days"
