  "transcript": "Mackenzie from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu. When it comes to the interview with the potential spouse for Nikah, does it need to be under the supervision of one of my mahrams or can someone else be there instead? My mahrams are not Muslims so I'm not sure if they're suitable to be there because they aren't aware of the qualities a Muslim man should have for marriage. The imam who previously agreed to be my wali said that a trusted female friend of mine could be there instead but I'm not sure if this is correct or not. The priority should be for your male mahram and your male mahram, even if they're not Muslims, they're not going to be involved in the conversation. They're just there as a protector so that shaytan would not intervene. Having a female acquaintance accompanying you is illogical because she may be hooked by the man or the man may like her more than you. That would be a great loss and having the imam present, the imam might be impressed by you and then he would have second thoughts. So no, have one of your male mahrams, even if they're not Muslims, just to sit and be there and Allah knows best. you"
