  "title": "Two Rakahs after Witr, is this a Sunnah? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Safa from Qatar she says that the to recur after Whittier is it sooner before I then it was reported that the prophetess of Salaam used to pray after concluding his night prayer the whitter two Rakas sitting down and scholars said that either this is a sunnah that is recommended or this is something that the prophet would not you do it occasionally because he said himself that make the last thing of your night prayer Wondrich i with her so this can be understood in the light that sometimes the Prophet tells us something and does the opposite to show us that what he ordered us to do was not mandatory so by praying to records and sitting down he is teaching his Ummah that these two sinners or two rakahs are permissible you can pray after whitter but it is highly recommended not to do so therefore yes you can pray them but it is not recommended to do it all the time in Allah knows"
