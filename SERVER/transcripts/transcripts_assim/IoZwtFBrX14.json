  "transcript": "from France Oram maybe I don't know uh I have a struggle understanding why having having to say Allah for for you to be accepted isn't well this is the same struggle that Satan had when Allah told him to prostrate to Adam and he refused do you guys go to the same school yes or no no so was he justified in refusing no are you justified in asking such a question that the prophet himself taught us how to say it and he told us that the Dua is blocked unless we offer salutation upon him and you say I think this is shik what should I say to you sevi so I hope this answers your question"
