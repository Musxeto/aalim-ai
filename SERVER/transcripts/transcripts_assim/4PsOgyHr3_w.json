  "title": "How does Allah descend to lowest heaven when 1/3rd night remains in different countries Assimalhakem",
  "transcript": "what is says regarding hadith which is said of Allah descending to the lowest heaven when one third of the night remains I'm a little confused about it the time when one third of the night remains varies from one place to the other there's a lot ascend to the lowest heaven multiple times because time varies in different parts of the world Moyes your question is quite disturbing the reason is that you are comparing allah azza wajal to us humans the hadith is authentic without any doubt allah azza wajal descends to the lower heaven when the last third of the night is due and Allah says is there anyone seeking forgiveness so I would forgive him is there anyone asking me so that I would give him is there anyone supplicating to me so that I would answer him this is authentic there's no doubt in that but the problem is that you're comparing a Las descent to ours and this is unacceptable because Allah says ladies a committal ehi Sheikh there is nothing like him and he is the most the more and he is the most hearing and seeing he is the all-hearing and seeing subhana WA Ta'ala so now if you look at Allah's attributes you would acknowledge that Allah is all-hearing all-seeing powerful knowledgeable merciful is the provider he is the giver of death and life now when we look at one of his attributes or any of his attributes does anyone on earth believe that as attributes are like ours Allah stayed in the Quran nothing is unlike to him nothing is like allah subhanaw taala or similar to allah azza wajal so we all know this let's look at the attribute of hearing as a human being we hear and we listen if there are four people talking in front of me and they're speaking the same language and they're addressing me with their problems would I be able to comprehend all of them at the same time definitely not at best I mean pick few words here or there from two of them and be able to figure out their problems but all for impossible he is Allah's hearing like us so can someone come and ask like humorous and says how I'm a bit confused when we know that there are 7 billion inhabitants of the human being of the human race on earth at the moment and they speak in thousands of languages and dialects and they speak at the same time and Allah hears each and every one of them and records all what they say allah azzawajal even knows what goes into their mind their minds without them speaking it not only that Allah hears and knows what animals in their billions talk about what birds what fish what insects what any living creature on earth is saying or doing or thinking of are you a bit confused definitely not you said yeah this is Allah so yet he he is capable of that and war okay why were you not confused because you acknowledged that Una's attribute of hearing is not like ours likewise with knowledge likewise with powers strength and ability now why did you not use the same method when it came to the attribute of descent why didn't you say to yourself unless descent to the lower heaven is not like us allah azza wa jal is nothing similar to what we can comprehend and think of because if you do that then you will be safe and your Eman will be intact you've got the full conviction and belief that Allah descends when the last third of the night is full stop without saying how show me you can't do that likewise in the hadith I think of as abu sa'id aha dream or a Buddha I forgot well the Prophet said RA salatu salam when the Sun sets it prostrates in front of the throne of allah azza wajal until until allah tells her tells it to rise again but we know that the Sun sets every single moment round the globe so how is this possible do you see the Sun itself do you know the universe how it is run we don't know but we believe it is not something that you apply your logic to this is something that logic has nothing to do with it has to do with belief how runa rashid one of the great caliphs of the Abasi period he had a son and this son used to give form to the tributes of Allah I seek refuge in Allah so he used to say Allah's hands is like this Allah has fingers like that and he simulates Allah is attributes to ours are we to believe in a Shaitaan of regime Dalai Lama who love Allah moon are doing our Vemma Imam Shafi Rhee heard of this and this is the son of the ruler he could behead him in any second like all tyrant rulers but her honor she was not like that so he went to him and said to him in a logical way my son have you heard of the hadith when the revelation was first given to the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam in the man and the boy said yes i did he said did you hear how the arc angel jibreel descended on his throne and the Prophet ala solid solemn saw him with 600 wings with pearls with rubies with emeralds and precious stones falling from his 600 wings and the boy said yes I've heard this so Imam Shafi said to him leave gibreel alone and his 600 wings I give you a bird and I ask you to place three wings on that bird can you do that so the guy started to think said they okay one on the right one on the left the third wing should it be on top or on the bottom or in the front or in the back it doesn't fit so he could not answer so if I'm sure I said my son a bird with three wings and you're unable to think and imagine what about 600 wings of the arc angel jibreel let alone Allah the Almighty the creator of the heaven and the earth this is something way beyond your paycheck way beyond your league allah azza wajal we do not contemplate or think or try to give form to his beautiful attributes we believe as they are we believe in the face of allah azza wajal we believe in the hands of allah azzawajal as mentioned in the quran but without crossing the line or trying to figure out your imagine how this is possible and allah knows best"
