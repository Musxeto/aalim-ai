  "title": "Wouldn't the women who show some of their neck or clevage also fall under thsoe who would go to hell",
  "transcript": "Mustafa from Canada she I want to ask like a followup or let's say a clarification to the answer you gave yesterday about the Hadith where the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said that from the people of hell would be women who wear clothes yet are naked you said this refers to women who wear skin tight clothing or see-through clothing correct does not refer to those women who do T like you know show their necks uh show their skin like their hair the neck their shoulders and the cleavage so my question was um if the punishment for those women who wear skin tight or see-through clothing is this that they're going to be from hell even though technically speaking it is still some form of clothing right wouldn't the punishment using the same line of thought for those women who wear no clothing at all to cover their shoulders their cleavage um their neck Etc be worse this is precisely my confusion it is not our duty Mustafa to judge people or to dictate or decide what their punishment is it's sufficient for us Muslims to know that this is Haram and they'll be punished why would I go out of my way to decide hm it is similar or even worse and be besides it's a difference there's a big difference between someone who's wearing completely seethrough where I can see everything underneath these clothes and someone who just shows her neck or hides her hair and shows her ears only or shows half of her hands there's no resemblance at all because that woman is showing everything in her body as if she's nud and that other woman is showing part of her body now if you were to say someone who's in and her bikini and someone who's wearing a seethrough would have the same punishment probably but again it is not our problem it is not our duty in Islam to decide what punishment they will get this is Allah's Duty and responsibility and job and his domain we should not interfere in this our part is limited to saying that this is Haram this is sinful what's the point what the punishment is this is in Allah's hands and Allah Knows Best"
