  "title": "Over Expiated for Broken Oaths, then learned this was wrong, should I redo it all? ðŸ¤”assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Rakib from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh my question is I broke many promises in the past of which I forgot the calculation so I estimated a number and started expiating according to that but recently I came across one of your videos regarding the ruling of expiating in case of promising over the same thing several times and so I found that there was an error in my previous estimation so what should I do now should I estimate again and start expiating according to that no you don't have to because you have overestimated so why would you repeat that again if you thought that you've made 10 oaths and you've expiated them and then you discovered later that five of them was on the same topic so all what you needed was six expiations maybe or five because five needed only one and the remaining five require five so this is six so this means that you've expiated four extra there's nothing for you to do just move on with your life"
