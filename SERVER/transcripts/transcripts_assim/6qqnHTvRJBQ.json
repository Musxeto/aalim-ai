  "transcript": "number seven neriman says please explain how to pray sitting as per the hadith of our prophet allah there's nothing much to explain either you're praying on a chair or you're praying on the ground if you're praying on the ground you usually sit like you sit in tishahud and if it's this is if this is too difficult for you you can sit cross-legged or in any way that is comfortable to you you start your prayer bit by takbir and normal when you come to record you put your hands on your knees and you bow a little bit like this then if you want to prostrate and you can prostrate on the ground then you go allahu akbar and prostrate normally if you're on a chair like i am on one now then you go for sujud and you make that a bit deeper than your recur so you bow a little bit more and that's it you continue your prayer as usual"
