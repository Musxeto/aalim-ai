  "transcript": "prayer and I found that people are about to start if I want to take ablution I'll use the prayer and I take 10 months it is totally prohibited to perform just because you're afraid of missing the congregation or missing the time of the prayer so even if I wake up late one minute Before Sunrise and I know if I go and make wudu I will be faced with the Sun rising so can I do tell your mom the answer is no time is a substitute is something that Allah has offered us in case there is no water available or we would encounter hardship or harm if we were to use water and neither cases apply for you for coming late so even if you come late and find out that you will miss the congregation there is no problem in that missing the congregation but as long as you fulfill the conditions make wudu and come back insha Allah"
