  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Bangladesh So Sheikh if a person enters the Masjid and finds \nthat the congregation has ended and there is no   one to perform the second congregation therefore \ncan he start the second congregation with   someone from among the participants of the \nfirst congregation because there was no   one to perform the second conversation \nwith that person. Barak Allahu Feekum. Wa Feekum Barak Allah. [Questioner] from Bangladesh says if I come to \na Masjid and the prayer and the congregation   is already over, is it permissible if I don't \nfind a second congregation to call upon one   of those who had already prayed to pray with \nme a second congregation, the answer is yes,   this is proven from the authentic hadith where \nthe Prophet ﷺ once prayed Fajr congregation   with the companions, and after they concluded \nthe prayer a loner companion came in,   but there was no one else to pray with \nhim, so the Prophet ﷺ addressed the   congregation who had just finished praying \nand said, who would give charity to this man   meaning who would go and pray with him so that \nboth would have a congregation, bearing in mind   that they've just prayed Fajr which means that it \nis time of restricting voluntary prayers, but this   is exempted because it has a reason, so one of the \ncompanions went and offered the prayer with him."
