  "transcript": "a question who is allah asking this question to and what is it about i know it's about the story about abu jahl preventing the prophet allah from praying in the haram so can you explain that who is allah asking and what okay as for the ayah in cathedral this is about abu jahl and abu jahl was one of the enemies the fierce enemies of islam and he used to abuse the muslims big time so once he was with his companions and was angry and said that how come prophet muhammad alayhi salatu comes to the masjid and prays without anyone of you forbidding him from doing that by god by the gods that we believe in if i see him i will step on his neck and i will teach him a lesson so the prophet came as usual started to pray once he was in prostration abu jahl came to do what he promised to do and then he retreated and went back frightened so his companion said what's wrong why aren't you doing what you said you were going to do i said between me and him there is a trench and fire in things that are so horrible and scary and when the companions of the prophet told him as some of what had happened he said if by allah if he got closer the angels would have taken him apart so allah azzawajal is not asking and allah does not ask yet in arabic there is a form of uh literature used when asking such a questions to show how weird this is or to show how disgust i am or that is a no-brainer but it's not a question that expects an answer it's like what people say it's a rhetorical question when you do something say do you think i'm crazy i'm not expecting you to say yes or no but this is what is happening it's a form of question to show the people how absurd this is do you see that person who forbids a man from praying allah is not asking do you see no this is look at what he's doing he's forbidding a person from doing what from doing righteous things from praying anyone on earth thinks that praying is bad and this is the same thing that's happening in europe and in the kafir world when they oppose muslims for abiding by their religion by not wearing the hijab they forbid them from wearing the hijab and in some countries they fight muslims who grow a beard and in some countries kafir countries they force the muslims force the muslims in concentration camps to eat pork and to drink wine during the daytime of ramadan and not to pray and they are claiming that they are rehabilitating them what kind of humility the muslims are in these days because there's nobody defending them there's nobody with kohitos to defend the muslims and to stand up and to say that this is not right and this is the same rhetoric question and allah knows best"
