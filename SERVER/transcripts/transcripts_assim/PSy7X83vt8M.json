  "transcript": "ask them this specific question who do you call when you are in need and they will all say the one in the heavens because this is going back to our first episode islam the religion of nature the religion of fitra this is the fitrah that allah has created us upon to worship only one god and that is him so this is part one the prophet islam used to disseminate anything related to god's worship other than allah and this was easy to prove it's not rocket science the prophet just opened their eyes as islam and they could see clearly the second part is to make them worship that there is no other god deity worthy of being worshipped but allah so cancel all gods and only worship the one true god who's worthy of being worshipped and that is allah and that is also easy to prove to them that he's the creator that he's a facilitator that he's a sustainer that he's the giver of life and death all of these things are with him the third aspect is to engage them in the concept of resurrection and life after death and the day of judgment because this was one of the main issues they did not believe in how is it possible when we are turned into dust when our bones are gone that we are resurrected and the quran speaks about this in a very logical and easy way to understand even for nomads and bedouins the one who created you from nothing it's easier in our calculations and logic to resurrect you from something wouldn't that be a fact of course so the concept of the belief of resurrection and accountability after death and the day of judgment this holds great value in making our lives as it is today because it defines us why wouldn't i cheat lie steal do things when there are no cctv cameras because i know that allah is watching and this by itself is a huge game changer in the life of a human being in the life of an individual after that the prophet focused allah on two main things on how miraculous the quran is which still date stands challenging and this is one of the basics and we will insha allah devote a an episode for the quran as being one of the basics in our religion that has been overlooked and ignored by many muslims so to prove to the to the to the whole world that this is miraculous this is allah's words allah's speech that you're reciting and listening and reading and this is challenging and there is nothing wrong with it it's infallible you cannot find a mistake in it so this was part of his dawah and finally it was essential in these 13 years to prove to them which was so obvious but it needed to be cemented as part of the foundation to prove to them that the prophet is the messenger of allah the final messenger and the servant of allah almighty they knew this from day one that he was the honest the trustworthy that the one who never lied the one who never cheated the one he they could not hold against him a single thing 63 years that the prophet lived alice islam not a single negative thing can be quoted against him he was the perfect man ever to work to walk on earth so this needed to be continuously preached and shown and proven for them that he is the servant and the messenger of allah azza virgin"
