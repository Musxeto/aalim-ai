  "title": "Can a Mother forgive her deceased son? Is Hadith authentic?",
  "transcript": "says can a mother forgive her deceased son because in the hadith as i remember the prophet alaih said to a woman to forgive her son if she doesn't want to see him in hell the son asked his mother for forgiveness uh for whatever wrong he may have done to her before he passed away first of all the hadith my boob is referring to is not authentic it's spaceless where one of the companions was on his dying bed and his friends were telling him and he could not say it so they went to the prophet haslam the prophet went to his mother and he asked her if she was mad at him she said yes i am mad at him so the prophet islam they claim to say okay gather a wood so that we would light a big fire and throw him in it so that he is burnt to the ground instead of being burnt in hell fire so the mother was so frightened said no no i forgive him and that then the man said and died this is totally baseless it's worth more worthy of being a bollywood film rather than hadith the prophet wouldn't do anything like this as hassan and any hadith of this sort would have been circulated widely by the scholars not by laymen so yes if a person dies and his mother forgives him before death or after his death this is a valid forgiveness and accepted be is"
