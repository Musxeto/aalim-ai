  "title": "Deceased father lent money to a man & wrote down in diary, now man claims it was a gift, what to do?",
  "transcript": "uh she uh I have a question that previously there was the person who borrowed money from my father and he thought it as it was like a favor for him but my father wrote this in his record book and now fast forward around five years or six years my father has passed away may Allah have mercy on him uh but when we approached this person and asked him for the money I understand your question because we have 10 seconds left the answer is if you don't have a tangible evidence that can be held uh um in a a court of law then you have no right in asking for this money because it's your father's writing against this man's word you go to the court and say this man borrowed ,000 from my father the evidence is my father wrote that this man borrowed ,000 from him the judge goes to him said did you borrow he said no I didn't borrow anything he gave me gave it to me as a gift so who will be the decisive word his or your father's your father did not take a paper from this man saying that I borrowed This Much from XY Z and therefore you cannot claim such a money unless he confesses that yes I borrowed it or you bring two witnesses or a written confession from him stating that I took this as a loone and Allah Knows Best"
