sisters in Islam Salaam alaikum welcome to la Hyo Boracay - and welcome to lessons in fit today we're going to start a new chapter and this chapter has the title of the conditions of salat the conditions of salat and there are people that argued these terminologies that we have nowadays and they say where did you get pillars of salat llamo Kamala whenever someone sneezes is not like when someone says assalamu alaikum when someone says as-salam-o-alaikum and there's a group of six one answering this and saying wa alaikum Salam is enough so it's fortifier but when someone sneezes it's obligatory upon each and every person that heard him say alhamdulillah to say ya arhamu Kamala so it's not enough that one says you're home Kamala providing that you heard him say alhamdulillah and it's not certain that to say bless you listen tight and so on all of this is not acceptable in Islam yet the question that we have to ask ourselves is that if he doesn't say alhamdulillah should we remind him just to open the floor for suggestions before we go into conditions of Salah Mustafa we should Fatih we should Muhammad nods his head yes you should know and Abba Mike and also well most stuff I decided to be on the safe side because whenever we have the consensus of the floor of the panel then I beg to differ and ambach too again now the the the where do we stem and get our knowledge from the karana from the sender and sometimes we get also our knowledge if not available in the person from the doing of the compare of the scholars a set of a study and if we read the law even and MOBOTIX biography we find out that a man sneezed once in his presence and look at this guy's smart thinking so abdullah mubarak asked him and told him do you reckon what does a person say when he sneezes so the man said he says it hamdulillah so I've got about access your how come Allah so he didn't ask him directly to say it but indirectly and with man said it he said there honk oh mama now if we refer to the sooner we find an authentic hadith where two men sneezed in the present and the presence of the Prophet SAW Allah one of them said that humble Allah and the other did not say anything so when the prophet sallallaahu our dealer sent him heard the man say alhamdulillah he said yeah hamako moola which means God has mercy on you may God have mercy on you so the other one you know felt angry because he missed this application this prayer from the Prophet so he said o prophet of Allah we both sneezed and you said this to this man your hammock Amala and we all have mercy on you and he did not say that to me why the Prophet said because he said alhamdulillah he said all praise be to Allah and you didn't that's why I said your home Kamala and I didn't tell it to you where's the catch know that he didn't for he didn't remind him to say that's the one because the profits are seldom heard this man sneeze and did not remind him means that we should not remind people in this particular point otherwise we would have done something that the prophets are salam did not do so he sneezed before he sneezed I was talking about the objection of some people some people say now this terminology you have conditions of Salah pillars of Salah obligatory things in Salah and new things that nullify Salah are these things mentioned in the Sunnah are they I'm asking yet I'm not receiving any answers do you have reception guys I think it's stuck up like they it's been read between are they there yes they established it from negative Anderson so it's not in the kitab and soon by saying that the Prophet said these are obligatory these are pillars and these are preferred some of them and some the shortest Allah conditions of Salah do we have any anywhere that it says conditions of Salah conditions of fasting conditions of pilgrimage no so wouldn't this be considered to be innovation and this is the allegation they brought up and the answer would be no it's not an innovation simply because you are not worshipping Allah through this these terminologies on the contrary you are organizing you're classifying knowledge through labeling them in this manner and this makes it easier for worshippers and for those seeking knowledge to acquire this knowledge through this means and way now conditions of prayer we have conditions and we have pillars of prayer any one of you think of pillars of Prayer I'll give you an example what's the difference between conditions and pillars conditions usually come before a worship so you have to prepare yourself so they come before a worship and sometimes they continue pillars do not exist exist except in the worship itself so can you think of examples of pillars of salat - Jude prostration there could be the first experience Allah will you inaugurate Salah with this takbir Fadi mustafa reading the fatiha standing position you have to stand when you are able to do this Malik bowing rock or Fadi taking your time and establishing okay Yeti's at rakhumai Nina come on Nina yes and come and also the whole prayer coming up throughout the whole prayer and so on these are all pillars of salat pillars of prayer which means that if you abandon them deliberately your prayer is void it's not accepted and if you forget or skip one of them because you forgot if you did not bring it and and performed it through the prayer and you left you went home your prayer is void again it has to be in prayer or otherwise it's gone it's not accepted so if someone leaves one is not accepted these are the pillars of Salah but what about the conditions there are number of conditions for salat for example Mustafa purity purity it's a condition and in Arabic I can explain this much easier but let me translate it and I hope it's not a rough translation condition they say that it's something that is a prerequisite for every worship but when it's there it does not mean necessarily that you will perform this worship but if it's not there then your worship cannot be performed meaning evolution is or Tahara in general is one of the conditions of Salah if I perform ablution does this mean that I have to pray no I may pray and I may not but if I do not perform ablution and I pray does this mean my prayer is accepted definitely it's not so if if I perform this condition there is a possibility that I pray or may not break but if I do not fulfill this condition then my prayer is invalid automatically so we have a Tahara which is both cleaning the body the clothings and the way the place I'm praying on and it means also performing ablution or total and obligatory bass-o-matic the present that's mature yes this these are the general they call it the general conditions for all forms of worship you would find that they always tell you that you have to be Muslim all fours worship because if you're now a Muslim this is a prerequisite and you have to be sane and you have to be either reaching the age of puberty or less which is you have to be able to recognize and distinguish they call it similar Tamizh the age of being able to distinguish things so these are the three prerequisites for any form of worship so we have Mahara what else brother mustafa facing the qibla facing the qibla is also one of the conditions of salat set to allow walk excellent which it means that you have to cover the awara the place or the area designated that you may not uncover it through the salaat and anything else we've just studied a couple of chapters ago the intention no mama near no the intention is one that the place is praying around there she's praying around is clean no this is included in Mahara two chapters ago we at the time of Prayer the time the time should be called for the whole and worked because if you pray before time the condition is not there then your prayer is invalid you can you may not pray at the heart until the call for door is made it's been made otherwise then your prayer is not accepted and so on now when we come to the conditions of of salat we have lots of hadith that governed this and we can stem and take these conditions by reading the Holy Quran and also by reading the sunnah of the prophet sala salam where we learn these conditions and we read the cell of how they classified it and listed it for us and we can cross-examine and whatever goes with the quran sooner we accept it and whatever is invented we reject it we have a short pause so stay with us J - al-haddad sheds light on the second best generation of this community the successors to the Companions these stories serve as guidelines for us covering all spheres of life political now let us understand how Islam deals with prisoners of war Ahmad Abdul Aziz told his son a very important policy that has been used now by so many jurists to address some contemporary issues worship he used to pray 1,000 raka 1000 maybe we wouldn't understand how they managed to pray 1000 raka there is an element of Baraka that Allah Allah Allah gives to certain people social who is going to allow me to marry their daughters I am a poor person I don't have money I only have two Durham's who would accept me to marry their daughters while I'm in that devastated situation Sayyidina Musa have said are you as well as economic and other aspects of our daily life then he gave his instructions that when they send something they should use either a piece of paper or a piece of his skin in proportional to what they have written you do you want to call this as caring about environment do you want to take to consider this as a matter of worrying about the wealth of music don't miss out on second best airing on Hoda TV may Allah bless you and your family similar of mana rahim at happylab so lots of cinemas will salamualikum' to LA and welcome back the hadith we have has a number of 160 the first hadith in the chapter that deals with the conditions of salat a hadith will be read by abemolik narrowed by Ali rhodiola on whom allah his messenger sallallaahu Salim said when one of you releases air meaning through his anus during salat meaning prayer he should break the salat meaning prayer then perform ablution and repeat the prayer now this hadith was regarded by some to be sound and by others to be not authentic and weak and in both cases it's the meaning is is correct that when if anyone were to pass wind during salat this means that his ablution has been nullified as you remember the things that nullify would do are can we just recap on that Mostafa nothing you don't know you don't think I know the things that nullifies with oh well major Beauty does not only nullify your would oh it's also notifies your purity manuals huh passing wind passing wind is one most of deep sleep is the other the call of nature urinating or defecating five and it discharged from which is falls on the answering the call of nature any thing that comes out from the private parts bleeding that's bleeding nullify wood oh no we said it does not hmm what else you guys have to remember because if we study it then we should be able to recall it and remember it eating camel meat eating camel's meat and the last and final one it has to do with touching one's private parts and we say that the authentic opinion of scholar is that it does notify would also these things nullify wouldl passing the wind is one of them the hadith is not authentic but the meaning is correct that whenever your mobile is notified during prayer you have to stop and go perform ablution and come back again know that some people for example have diseases that cause them that they have to have wind throughout prayer so does this mean that they have to leave prayer and perform although again and then come to meet the prayer what do you think what do you think that would be I think if it's uncontrollable it might take the hokum the the ruling as what is that a sailboat yeah you're making life difficult we barely can translate things to English now are you getting us terminologies and and medicine and like a person who always reader innate all the time drips of urine okay what he said is quite true if a person has this illness in him throughout the hour which means that he constantly passes wind or he constantly urinates he cannot control himself we cannot ask him to go and perform ablution come pray again because this is an endless process it will never end but Islam tells us that because it's beyond his control then allah azza wajal does not ask him to do something he cannot do so scholars say the he performs wood oh and then he comes to the prayer and he prays and regardless of what comes out of him now we're talking about the person that it doesn't happen that frequent you know or it doesn't happen at all except once in every blue moon or it he just you know flipped he couldn't control himself and it just escaped without him paying any notice to it until it was released so he should go and leave us a lot but wouldn't this be embarrassing you imagine yourself praying behind the imam the whole mosque is full and you are in the first second and then you pass when what do you do in order I have to how will you go the people are praying they're all praying in the congregation what we did do Muhammad and what the things that the people say your friends and Muslim there was one incident where one of the Sahaba pestilent and another other Sahaba laughed at him and the problem told them that this is natural and you shouldn't laugh at it it's true so so it should be normal that if you pass wind during a dream what would you do automatic leave it you know without causing fitna and problems between the Muslims some scholars from what I've read I remember exactly who said what but I'll mention what they said sometimes said follow with them without your intention date in the prayer and some of them say grab your mouth like you know you're bleeding out of your nose or something and leave the prayer make a coughing sound or walk out and some other scholar said just leave you know well those who said continue with them without an intention are definitely and grossly wrong because when you pretend that you're praying with them though you are not in the state of Pajaro or ablution who are you deceiving you're deceiving the people okay what are you doing on the surface you are praying so your prayer is not intended to Allah Azza WA JAL it is intended to the people and this is a major sin and this is found mainly in schools you know Muslim schools when the guys are in intermediate in high schools and they're forced to pray because prayer time between classes and the the the the headmaster and the teachers you know gather them all so that they can all pray in congregation you get people that don't want to pray and they don't they don't dare to say I don't want to pray because they know that this is a major sinister unacceptable so they pray but without performing Woodill and I've seen a lot of them you know praying pretending to pray with chewing gums and bubble gums in the making you know bubbles and so on and and this is a major sin now the second type that you've mentioned which is grabbing one's nose and moving out as if he's bleeding there's an authentic hadith which made by ali mahmoud al body which says that this is the way if someone passes went during salat he may put his hand over his nose as if something wrong happened and excused himself because if you see someone doing this you would not say ha ha ha I know he passed when you're not gonna fool me no they know they think that no person in the first straw a person seriously praying would not be pretending so this is just to save your face you would know that he might have passed wind and just like even probably but again it saves face because once you know that he passed wind and he is applying the hadith of the Prophet Allah so Sarah you respect him for this definitely not gonna go out to say I know what you did I've know what you done I've seen what you did know you would go in you know respect him because he's applying the sooner so this is the way that we are supposed to follow with this incident hadith again is a clear sign though it's weak on that one of the preconditions of salat is bahara to be in the state of purity the following hadith hadith number 161 narrated by Aisha the prophet salaallah alayhi assalam said that's a lot meaning pray of a woman who has reached puberty is not accepted unless she is wearing a human okay can you explain what she marries kumar's a piece of cloth that women wear over their heads and covers the head and the neck just showing the face okay now this is Tamar that Allah Sevilla will not accept her prayer unless she has the Hammar she's wearing the him are and by the way was the woman in America calling for the event was she wearing the Hammar she wasn't only when she prayed did she pray wearing a him are then her prayer is not accepted and she is ridiculing with prayer and there's a very big possibility that this might be something that nullifies her Islam so she has to repent and she has to ask Allah for forgiveness now this hadith points out the second condition of salat which is nor fair condition of Salah no no the second condition of Salah this hadith tells us about the second condition what is it we have to use hey man you don't have to use tomorrow I hope for for for us especially for women so women and general speaking this is called you know it talks about puberty no no no no it's talks about the hadith talks about the second condition the first the first hadees talked about a purity so ii hadith this talks about the second condition which is covering up the hour covering up the aura and for women to cover up during salah they have to wear the veil and this veil is covering their whole body with the exception of the face and the hands providing that no strange men are looking because the authentic opinion is that the face of a woman is our is something that strange men should not look at and this is an issue of dispute will not go through it as for the man his hour is known to be from his bellybutton to the knees this is during prayer and there's a difference between the hour for prayer and the hour to look at so it's it's a different thing all together and what about the foot what about the feet of women is it considered to be our if there are no strangers looking or not even Tamia says that the authentic opinion is that it's not considered to be our then it's okay for her to show the feet there are lots of issues that we have not discussed yet but I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program so inshallah until we meet next time via Manila was Salam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
