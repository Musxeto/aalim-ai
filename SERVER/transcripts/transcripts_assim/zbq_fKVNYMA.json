  "transcript": "um we have a question from a follower it says what acts of worship increase the love of Allah in my heart and make me beloved to him see the problem is not to love the problem and the biggest problem is to be loved everyone even the Jews and Christians claim that they love Allah so good luck the problem is does Allah love you or not so you can do so many things and you claim that you love Allah but does Allah love you this is the asset test that you have to yeah ask yourself all acts of worship gets you closer to Allah the most beloved is to recite the Quran to memorize the Quran to understand the meaning of the Quran the most noble science of all in Islam is is an elastic word is part of a Quran the Quran yeah but the most beloved science to Allah and the most noble of all is the knowledge of Allah's beautiful names and attributes because the value of the science relies entirely on what you're studying so if you're studying Allah what could be better and this is the Cornerstone of you can understand but without knowing who Allah is you have nothing so when you know Allah when you spend and devote your time and effort to know what are Allah's beautiful names and what all are Allah's attributes when you say Allah abbar it has a different meaning so many Muslims I ask them how many names does Allah have 99 this is what the Hadith says but Allah's names are unlimited they're far more but the the things that the prophet told us about 99 names if you count them memorize them Implement them know the meaning of them you will enter Jenna good then I ask my second question how many of these names do you memorize people say um 15 maybe 10 said no problem so you are 10% knowledgeable of Allah of these 10 names how many do you know the meaning of then I said one or two so why are you complaining that my prayer has no sweetness I'm an able to enjoy it sometimes I skip it I don't find the motive and the drive because you don't know Allah very simple if you knew Allah all these fitnas you're complaining of will disappear you'll have full trust in Allah because oh she I have to work in an interest based bank I have to sell Lea I have to deal with Haram I have to go to a synagogue or to a temple and pretend to be a Hindu I have to do why because if I don't I will not have salary I would not have money I will be kicked off the house if you had trust in Allah if you knew Allah none of this would have happened so people don't know Allah and this is how you increase your Iman number one know Allah beautiful names attributes number two a number three Quran how many times do you finish the Quran a month people say a month yeah I finish Quran about like in 2019 in in in Ramadan but I'm I'm I'm working on it I'm working the minimum you finish Quran is once a month this is the minimum one juu every day bare minimum I know people who memor who revise five ju a day every six from memory every six days they finish the Quran from memory just to keep it yeah steady six days so you come and tell me yeah but I'd like to make Hijra what have you done zero so start building the foundation before you think of and make Hijra what's your income what's your Finance so nothing she I'm a c driver so you're going to come and work in Mecca doing what H I have saved money yeah you live for six months deplete your money then start begging people then go back to Australia you don't have a job and then you start begging people over there then you resent Islam then you say maybe I should go back to my old ways yeah it's difficult it's a test so play your game well if you want Allah to take care of you"
