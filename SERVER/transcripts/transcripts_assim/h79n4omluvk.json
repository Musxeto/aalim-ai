  "title": "Slaughtering an animal when you shift into a new house - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "abdul majid says when we shift into a new home then do we need to make sacrifice that's a good question the answer is it depends on your intention when you make the sacrifice after you move into a new house what is your intention what does it matter oh it matters a lot all our deeds are judged by the intention and I'll give you example a lot of the Arabs and the non Arabs when they move into a new home they slaughter a sheep at the doorsteps and they smear and put the blood of that sheep on the steps some of them does this when they're building the house they put it at the pillars of the foundation before the house is built at the very beginning stages and if you ask them why do you do this they say we are offering this to the jinn and some of them don't say that clearly but they say we offer this so that the house would not be haunted and it would not be harmed it would be protected this is total jerk this takes an individual out of the fold of Islam however if someone moves into a new house and he gathers people and he offers some food or slaughters a sheep and cooks it and offers it to them this is known as what Hira and what Hira is derived from al wakil which is the home or the place and the majority of scholars say that this is recommended permissible is it part of the Sunnah I don't know of any authentic hadith relating it to the sooner but the scholars say that not everything needs a Sunnah to recommend it or to at least say that it is permissible because if your son passes the exam and you slaughter a sheep and call people to celebrate by eating from it this is hella this is permissible it's not a Sunnah so what Kira is one of the meals in Islam that the jurors and the scholars of Islam the majority of them say that this is recommended and there's nothing wrong in that insha Allah but one must not exaggerate or you refer to extravagance he must keep it simple"
