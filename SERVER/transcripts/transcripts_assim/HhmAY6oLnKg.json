  "transcript": "Mahwish from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh, if a person decides to move to a kafir country and lives there, has his kids there, and then the kids turn out messed up as a result of their surroundings because they didn't get fair preaching, how are the kids accountable? Is it okay to blame the parents for how misguided they have become? First of all, the parents are accountable for migrating to a kafir country. But this is all where it ends. We cannot cascade this to blame them for any wrongdoing the children may do because the children are adults. They chose to act in such a fashion. I know a lot of families that live in the U.S. and in Europe who are practicing, who are taking their kids to Sunday schools to learn the Qur'an, who takes them to jumu'ah and jama'at, and they try their level best to upbring them in an Islamic way, and they succeed big time. Their children are practicing, mashallah, and they're leading a good successful Islamic life. And I know of parents living in Muslim countries, miles away from Mecca or from Medina, and they fail big time in upbringing their children where their children are heedless, they don't know where the qibla is, they don't know what the haram looks like. So this is not a one size that fits all. Sometimes you do your level best with your children and Allah Azza wa Jal wills it otherwise. Yes, the environment does have an impact. So the chances of your children going astray in the U.S. is far higher and greater than them going astray in a Muslim country. So as long as the parents are doing their due diligence and trying their level best, then the fault would fall upon the children, not the parents."
