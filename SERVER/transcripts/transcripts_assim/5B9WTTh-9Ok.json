  "title": "Suffering from Urine incontinence, can I combine prayers? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "a brother says I'm suffering from urine incontinence and it's very difficult for me to wash my garments every time I get impure and main problem is I'm still studying and there is no mosque around me so is it permissible for me to combine my prayers like the hora Nasser orisha and maverick because I don't want to leave my prayers first of all the vast majority of brothers who have urine incontinence are delusional this is the whispers of Shaitaan Shaitaan is playing with them there are ground rules one you're not allowed to go every five minutes to check on yourself you're not allowed to squeeze your private part or to squeeze your muscles during or after urinating just to ensure that there is not a single drop left you're not allowed to jump in the bathroom as so many people do in the toilet after finishing urinating just to ensure that nothing is left and definitely you are not allowed to become obsessed by the issue of purity when people centers since the time of Adam peace be upon him urinate normally and answer the call of nature normally Satan is messing up with your mind sure but I have this feeling but this feeling is from Shaitaan he's laughing his head off because of what he is making you do so what to do generally speaking men and women once you go and answer the call of nature take your time meaning take your time by three minutes - five minutes max not half an hour or an hour and after you finish simply pour water on your private parts so you wash it this way and that's it no squeezing not nothing that is not natural and sprinkle some water on your underwear and then leave whenever you get this idea that I feel something is coming out I feel that is wetness tell yourself that this wetness is from what I had sprinkled on my underwear two to three days max you will not have this problem at all I have promise you now on the other hand if a person is medically sick then he will have this urine incontinence every couple of minutes and actually his dripping this due to an infection due to something else he has to go and see the doctor but 99.9 percent which is similar to the Arab elections results as usual 99.9 percent of those who complain of urine incontinence they don't have any problem they say themselves that I only suffer from it after five or ten minutes maybe 15 minutes after urinating after the Salah is over until like four or five hours later I have no problem I have no feelings of anything coming out which emphasizes what I had told you just now going back to the question of the brother so if someone of the second type has truly a continuous urine incontinence 24/7 can he combined answers no he says it's difficult for me to wash and change it's not difficult all what you have to do is to either wear grown-up diapers which is found in the market and once the time for prayer mother for example is do you just go and change it wash your private part and make woudl and pray and telesia you have no problem whatever comes out doesn't affect you or you simply wear your normal clothes and underwear but whenever you want to pray with a small bottle of water go to the toilet and wash your affected area of your underwear wash yourself your private part that is the affected area perform model and go to pray combining the prayer is not valid in such cases because there isn't a true or real hardship that obligates upon you to combine there is a way out and Hum Dil a the way out is easy but believe me my friend if you look into your case you'll find that you are one of the 99.9 percent take this whisper of Shaitaan out of your head listen to what I had said do exactly as I instructed you and insha'Allah two to three days send me an SMS or an email thanking me or better more just make dua and I'll take a rain check for that and this had helped literally thousands of people who come and ask me about this problem this is Shaitaan messing up with your head you have nothing wrong with you medically and it's just the way Shaitaan works if he sees that you are careful and strong in Deen he will make you a little bit extreme and if he sees that you are loose and easygoing he will make you far away from Islam neglecting obligations feeling easy with prohibitions and this is how he into things and he can control you accordingly"
