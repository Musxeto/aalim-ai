  "transcript": "Najwa from the UK. In school we have to get our equipment and we have to sign a form to get this equipment but in this paper it will say like benefits and tax and I don't know if my dad uses these home stuff so is it permissible for me to give the paper to my dad? So are you asking about paying for the equipment from your father's paycheck or from his credit card? No the school pays for it. So what's the problem? I don't know you have to highlight if my dad uses tax or not and I don't know if my dad does it. Okay I will answer inshallah. Najwa says that the school gives her equipment for studying but she doesn't know whether her father claims taxes for that or he may use haram money or benefit from it there is no problem with that even if he claims taxes and gets refunded for it there's no problem in that none whatsoever."
