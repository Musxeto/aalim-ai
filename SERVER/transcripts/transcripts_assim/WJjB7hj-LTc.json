  "transcript": "foreign I just wanted to know that sometimes we do teach in front of people so that they may learn from us for example if I see a person and he does not know that when you stand up from Ruku you have to say even so if that person is standing by my side so I just read it a bit aloud so that this person may think that or may ask me about these things or we do many things in front of people so that they may learn from us will this be considered as a form of Riya showing us this depends on your intention and only Allah knows your intention if you do something like reciting a Surah after the Fatiha with the intention that the people next to you know that this is part of the Sunnah or for example in the hanafi Masjid and they don't recite the Fatiha and you recite it a little bit a little bit louder so that they acknowledge that you're reciting the fatty huh they may be intrigued to ask you afterwards and you can teach them this is your intention what's your intention to show off most likely not most likely it is to show people and to teach them that is totally no problem in that and you rewarded for it inshallah"
