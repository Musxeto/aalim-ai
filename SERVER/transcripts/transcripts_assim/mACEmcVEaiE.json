  "transcript": "The next question is, are we allowed to deny the invitation of our relatives as a product of the invitation? There's no haram involved like free mixing or listening to music or the likes. Yes, you're obliged to obey and to answer. But if someone says, no, they just want us to have dinner. No, you're not obliged. Imagine how many invitations I get to dinner every night. Unfortunately, none. I hope we're having dinner tonight. So, but imagine as a Sheikh, Sheikh, please come and have dinner with me. Come have lunch. And I said, I have to answer this. I would be really, I mean, no, this is not mandatory. The Shari'ah invitation, Nikah, marriage or Aqeeqah. This is Shari'ah. You have to answer unless there is a legitimate reason not to answer it. Allah knows best."
