  "transcript": "[Music] one of the pillars of islam and their five pillars as you know is hajj the sacred pilgrimage it is the journey of a lifetime it is once in every muslim's life obligation and if he does more than that that's good but the minimal requirement is once in a lifetime in it you see the poor and the rich you see the old and the young you see the righteous and the sinful you see the black and the white all of them coming to this limited area this sanctuary you cannot tell who's who you cannot distinguish between them they're all wearing the haram shrouds and these are made of two pieces the lower garment and the upper garment and the vast majority of them if not all are clothed in white they all say the same talbiya bake they all say here i am proclaiming that they are responding to the call of allah the almighty azzawajal to perform hajj they come worshipping one lord not two they come believing in one religion not more there's no caste system between them there's no racism or any form of segregation they are dressed in white reminding you that this is what they will wear when they depart this world after they die they're shrouded in white cloth a beautiful sight to see a memorable journey to be involved in five maybe six days you spend in this journey but it gives you a lifetime experience when you meet people from all over the world coming for one simple cause they all have one common denominator and that is wanting to go to jannah they want to go to paradise and this is one of the conditions to enter paradise if you ponder upon the hajj you'll be amazed so many lessons to be learned so many prophecies that came to reality imagine the prophet alaihis once teaching his companions he appointed to them areas designated to them special places for whomever is coming to the holy shrines when he passes by these places he must assume so he said is for medina there's no problem in that madina is a muslim city but then he said yalemlam is the people of yemen for the people of yemen and the people of yemen were not muslims fully at the time and then he set al-juffa for the people of asham and egypt and these countries the 11th area alongside with egypt were a kafir country they were disbelievers muslims not had not set foot there yet yet the prophet allah is indicated to them that these areas are for the pilgrims when they come to the holy shrine they have to assume that from there though these areas were all kafir countries and areas which shows you that the prophet al-islam was giving a prophecy that all of these places will become muslim land and so it was they've all within few decades or if not less they all embraced islam reverted to islam and these countries still date after 15 centuries are still muslim lands no compulsion no force was used or is used and the people are muslims by choice and this shows you that the prophecies of the prophet saw all came to existence when he said that constanoble will become muslim we can see that when he said that rome will fall and will become muslim are anticipating that therefore there are so many things to learn about hajj as a pillar of islam however muslims know that it's a one in a lifetime journey but how soon should it be done can i wait until i'm 40. can i wait until i'm 60. it's an issue of dispute but the most authentic opinion among scholars it is mandatory asap as soon as possible if a an individual has the means financially and physically to go there so if you have the financial means to reach the holy shrines and you're physically fit it's mandatory to do it now you must not wait till your father and mother perform their hajj you must not wait until you get married or until the children grow up it's mandated upon you now if you can go it's not mandatory that you accompany your wife if she's unable she can wait but you have to do it now the prophet said alaihis allah whoever wants to do hajj let him hasten to do it for he may fall sick or be faced with some need and now we are at the comfort of our homes and the safety of our countries but there will come a time when such thing does not exist anymore may allah forbid the prophet said allah is enjoy this house referring to the kaaba so for us living close by we enjoy it we go once a month and we try to pray as much as we can because it's close by it's an hour drive the prophet says allah enjoy this house for it was demolished twice before and in the third time it will be uplifted it will be ascended to the heavens so it you will not have it anymore so this is a recommendation from the prophet alice islam to make use of this blessing that we have before it's too late what's the reward of hajj so i've done my hajj should i do it again of course you should do it again if you can definitely you should do it again the prophet said allah allah the almighty says in hadith a servant of mine whom i gave him a healthy body and i expanded his provision if he does not come to me meaning for pilgrimage or umrah every five years then he is deprived deprived of allah's mercy deprived of allah's forgiveness the pride of allah's provision every five years you have to try your level best to come and visit for hajj if not then for umrah and the prophet said alaihis whoever performs hajjan does not commit any obscenity or commit any evil will go back free of sins as on the day his mother bore him so you don't don't use any obscenity you're not obscene in what you say and you don't do any evil act and while you are in the state of iran there is no hanky-panky no intimacy with the misses until you get out of the state of israel if you succeed in doing that there's nothing more rewarding than to know allah has cleared your records of bad deeds and the prophet said alaihis al-salam an accepted hajj brings no reward but paradise it is essential for everyone who's going to hajj to learn the pillars the obligatory acts the recommended sunnah so that you perform your hajj correctly it's essential that you perform your hajj from earnings so any money that has dubious sources of income or haram such as riba or bribery or embezzlement you must not include that in your hajj it's not also recommended for you to borrow in order to go to hajj because allah forgives all the sins of a martyr except his debt and he's a martyr so definitely you should not do that and you have to try your level best to repent to allah azzawajal before going and setting off for hajj so if you borrowed some something from others try to give them back their loans if you oppress someone try to seek his forgiveness and give him back his rights so that you come to allah azzawajal with a clean heart a lot of us complain about the prices and the cost of hajj not knowing that one of the benefits of hajj is provision yes you're spending money but you're getting a lot in return the prophet says allah make the hajj and umrah follow each other closely so keep on repeating them closely why the prophet says allah for they remove poverty and sins as the bellows remove the dross of iron gold and silver so your hajjan umrah would bring you money don't worry about what you had spent allah would multiply that to you in this life and also in the here after there are so many things that can can be said about hajj but to know that you will be able to go back sinless and paradise is waiting for you i think this beats foreign [Music] foreign"
