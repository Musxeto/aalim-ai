  "transcript": "Nafim from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. Sheikh my question is that my younger brother is not very practicing. So sometimes in order to force him to take to the masjid I tell him that if you come and play with me then I will give you my phone and you can play with it or I will feed you a burger something like that. So my question is am I sinful for showing him such kind of breed? Jazak Allah Khairan. No inshallah there is no sin in that. Giving incentives to sinners and especially youngsters so that they would be encouraged to get this form of worship or these good deeds in their system is halal inshallah and you are rewarded for it bi-idhnillah as a charity. Amin."
