  "transcript": "next question is about strengthening one Zima and she's asking how do we drive away she says what's worse this is whispering I think she's especially speaking about the prayer how do you go about removing this unfortunately this is not a very easy topic to tackle in this program because it's a very long process that includes abandoning sin and the more sin you have the easier for the devil's and Satan to penetrate your concentration and to control you it has to do with performing forms of worship on time and the more you delay prayers or you do not pray them in the Masjid if you're a male or you have lots of shortcomings regarding forms of worship then the more the control they have on you it's quite helpful for a Muslim to concentrate on what he's reciting so if you contemplate on the verses of the Quran you're reciting when you bow when you say soup an Arab a Ravi and you think what you are talking about you start to imagine the great creatures of Allah the Almighty and Allah created created them so you start to praise Allah and to imagine his greatness subhanAllah when you prostrate likewise the almighty created all these universes and all of this for us to worship Him so this tends to reduce the amount of whispering of the devil there was wasps in a person but again this is not a very easy thing to do you have to concentrate you have to contemplate you have to supplicate to the Allah Almighty to help you and to prevent these whispering from coming to you and with the grace of Allah Allah so Allah will answer your prayers just like pleasure"
