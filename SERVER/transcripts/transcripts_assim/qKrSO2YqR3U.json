  "transcript": "Luqman from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Sheikh a person with urine incontinence has to change clothes, wash himself and do wudu when prayer time enters. But one day there was no leakage so he washed himself and did wudu half hour before prayer time and then prayer time entered but five ten minutes later he leaked again. So now does he has to do and wash again or is it okay if he doesn't do it because when the prayer time entered he was pure. Yes he was pure but he did not pray. If he prayed immediately after the time entered while he was pure I would say his prayer is valid but waiting 10 minutes and then leaking definitely that invalidates his wudu so he has to change and make wudu again."
