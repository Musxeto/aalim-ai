  "title": "Punishment for Bidah Innovations Don't look at the size of the sin! assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "So Sheikh, if a bid'ah doesn't lead to kufr, like du'a after prayer or sending sawab to deceased, will it be a minor sin? It is sinful. How big it is, this is dependent on a number of factors, whether there's a prescribed punishment, whether Allah Azza Wa Jal has cursed the individual who does it or kicked him out of his mercy or deprived him from entering Jannah and the likes. So don't look at the size of the sin, rather look at who you're committing the sin against. An innovation can take person out of the fold of Islam and can be an innovation that does not take a person out of the fold of Islam, as in the case of congregational du'a after prayers. Nevertheless, it's an innovation. Is it a major sin or a minor sin? It might be a minor sin, it might be something else, but again don't focus on technicalities, rather try to your level best to avoid all types of innovations."
