  "title": "Do we have to follow a Madhab",
  "transcript": "my question is what is the importance for Muslims okay this is a frequently Asked question do we have to follow a m now we know that the four schools of thought are the school of IM Abu hanifah IM Malik an IM Muhammad sha and IM Ahmed Muhammad may Allah have mercy on their souls now were they mentioned in the Quran no were they mentioned in the Sunnah no are they the only schools of thought in existence no there are many many schools of thought why are these the most prominent because they had students who served their school and spread it all over the world now what is my role must I follow a maab scholar say that people are of three categories category number one they are a handful and they are the scholars people who are Imam not celebrities no I'm talking about imams like IM like IM abdah like like abif the great great imams who have accomplished the highest levels of knowledge in all Sciences of Islam everything they have a huge amount of knowledge in such Scholars don't need to ask because they have the knowhow like a good good mechanic starts the car it doesn't start pops the hood plays around it works he knows what's going on because he has firsthand experience the second layer is the layer of the students of knowledge which inshallah I hope I'm one of them very bad one and a very lazy one but yeah it's still considered to be a stent what is the definition of a student of knowledge student of knowledge who knows Arabic knows knows knows but not as a scholar so I reach a corner or a hurdle then nope this is above my pay grade I have to go to the Sheikh scholar so and so what's the ruling on this he gives me a ruling I say okay scholar so and so what's the ruling on this I look into the four schools of thought I research I cross-examine with my knowledge I can reach a conclusion I said no Abu hanifah is right his opinion is the strongest Imam Ahmed IM Malik IM shaf in this their evidences are not as as solid due to the following reason 1 2 3 4 I already have my re research paper because I've done my due diligence and I have the experience and the knowledge to that enables me to do so now the third category is the vast majority of Muslims who do not know these sciences and they cannot determine which one of these different views is correct they can't they don't have the ability now me as a student of knowledge or even a scholar we're good at what we do but when it comes to mechanics it doesn't work I remember in 1980 that is in the last century this shows you how old I am I was attending a physics class 101 and I hated it I hate physics and while I was commuting down the um campus I went to the registar and I dropped this subject because I knew that I'm going to fail big time after dropping it I was on my motorcycle I saw the professor who was teaching us with his car in 1972 Plymouth you know American car popping the hood and he was from Pakistan and this is one of the reasons I left I could could not understand what he was teaching us soam alaykum Professor Ahmed or whatever what's happening you said I don't know the car is noted so I said okay let me look into it he said the gear is jammed the gear they had the gear in the top manual 1 2 3 4 so I went I had experience in mechanics at the time I reached down and there was a lever and I did tick and it was released so said try it so oh my J good it works so alhamdulillah it works he thanked me a lot I said now you thank me after I dropped my subject I can't register it back again the issue is he is a professor in quantum mechanics and physics and he's genius but in car mechanics he's a Layman to me I'm a layman in medicine I'm a layman in engineering I'm a layman in everything so you can be someone who is highly decorated doctor but in Islam you're a Layman as the majority what to do here is when people say you have to follow aab which is partially true but it is not fully true why you can't follow a mhab that is abstract books on the shelf and you just read I'm following maab of IM okay what do you know about I don't know it's gibberish to me but they say I have to follow this m no this doesn't work you have to follow a sheh who follows aab sha Mal whatever but this she has to have the following characteristics number one he's knowledgeable number two he's trustworthy number three you are fine with his moral conduct and you make him your protection from Hellfire on the day of judgment whatever he tells you you say fine on the day of judgment you will come Allah says why did you choose this said I did not know I'm a Layman I don't and by the way most of layman are like this they say uh it's an issue of dispute so I chose this opinion on what account well it sounded nice you know it doesn't sound nice this is not religion you have to worship Allah as he ordered you so you can't pick and choose or Sherry pick whatever you want you have to follow one Sheikh now the shik you trusted and chose he will protect you on the day of judgment I I don't know me as a Layman well if you tell me and I did this with one Saudi guy who was an atheist like 20 years ago he was talking to me and trying you know to make me convinced that we are fundamentalist and we are extremist and he's this is regarding Islam Quran and he's talking about politics and he's saying why is this happening you don't even know the basics of Islam let alone to speak about politics about economy about you're ignorant no no you guys want to have a monopoly you are you know like the monks and the priests considering everything is yours Islam is an easy religion I said he and he says Allah says I said very good which Surah huh I said which Surah I don't memorize the Quran but he said this is aith not an Ayah why nobody informed me you don't know the difference and you're an Arab you're a Saudi you don't know the difference between an ay and Hadith and you want to talk about politics about the economy about it this shows you that Layman must take someone to guide them to Allah but they cannot cherry pick ah she I watched the video of so and so and I'm following him but I follow you in other things you should follow Scholars Scholars like baz whatever BB says them with him alhamdulillah books and FAS are covering 95% of all what you need you don't have to reinvent the wheel but when you keep on choosing and selecting things you like and you you dislike according to your whims and desires this is when you are in deep deep trouble and Allah Knows Best"
