  "transcript": "after the death of mother Khadijah may Allah be pleased with her prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam was in mourning he was sad and he had so many things on his plate the Companions noticed that they noticed that he had girls in his home to take care of with no woman in the house he had so many obligations regarding his followers or an that is revealed to him idol worshippers that he is obliged to give Dawa and to call them to Islam how to protect those who followed him and believed in him so many things were occupying his mind with a touch of grief and sadness that no one can misses only then a suggestion for him to get married was proposed to the Prophet also salaam by hala bit Hakeem and she she was the wife of earth man even mother owned one of his close companions so she she suggested Oh prophet of Allah why don't you get married so the Prophet said to her Ali is a lot of Sturm who-who should I get married to what are the proposals that you have for me she said a virgin or someone who's not a virgin you pick so he asked her who was the virgin she said the daughter of your beloved companion the most beloved person on earth to your heart Abu Bakr Siddiq his daughter Aisha then the Prophet said Alice awesome who is the nun virgin and she said soda bent Zima and the Prophet Alice salatu salam praised her and complimented her when he heard her name so the Prophet said to her go and check them out ask whether there is acceptance or not how low went to Abu Bakr's house and this is something that we will talk about tomorrow insha'Allah and then she went to soda's house she met mother soda and she asked her or actually she gave her the glad tidings what blessings and goodness from Allah had come your way so she said what is that and she said to her the prophet alayhi salatu salam had sent me to ask for your hand soda was overwhelmed with joy this is something that had never ever crossed her mind not in her wildest dreams and she said to her I wish meaning that I'm more than happy to accept and I wish that this can materialize but I'm still not believing it please go and speak to my father and so this father was not a Muslim and her brother was not a Muslim as well and he was a staunch enemy of Islam but at the time he was at Hajj so hala went to meet this old frail man and she said to him Muhammad the son of Abdullah had sent me to ask for sodas hands this non-muslim although all the idol worshipers were at war and were at with a lot of enmity and hatred to the Prophet that is awesome and to the religion that he had brought to them when he heard his name he said he is an honorable worthy man this is the first thing that came into his mind and he said it and he asked Allah you proposed to me now what about your friend soda does she accept him as a suitor to her she said she loves that so the father said call her to me so they came he addressed his daughter Muhammad has sent a proposal to you and he's an honorable worthy person would you like me to marry you to him she said yes father so he said to her to holla call him and he came and he got her married to him so who is this soda may Allah be pleased with her and what is her story you see when a person is used to traveling first-class and in staying in five or seven stars hotels it would be difficult for him to go a little bit below his standard and we know the standard of hadiza may Allah be pleased with her so why did the Prophet Ali salatu salam marry after her this soda and who is she what does she have well sodas name is soda bent sama heaven applies a la Maria Alcor Ashiya and her mother's name was a shoe mousse been twice she's the first woman the Prophet married after the death of his late wife Khadijah been to Hawaii late may allah be pleased with her and the Prophet remained with soda for three years he was married to her alone for three years she had no other co wives so what is the story of soda soda was among the first to accept Islam among the Companions in Mecca she and her husband who was her cousin his name was a sacra nimnim they both accepted Islam suffered greatly on the hands of the idol worshippers in Mecca because they did not have that much power or influence and they did not have the backing of a strong tribe to defend them you see when Muslims accepted Islam in Mecca each person had one of the dignitaries of Mecca to protect him though that dignitary himself used to torture other Muslims and used to express enmity against Islam but due to a reason or the other that individual that went into his protection was safe from others soda and her husband did not have that protection so they fled Mecca and they migrated to Abyssinia they crossed the Red Sea and boats on the allah knows what kind of boats were they and they lived there under the protection of and nagashi who gave them safe haven and allowed them to worship allah as they wished they fled with their Eman with the religion they fled persecution all what they wanted was to worship allah azza wajal that's it nothing else let us worship our God and this is what Allah mentioned in surah al-buruj one Menachem omen whom Allah I you me noble Allah Aziz Allah meet the enemies of Islam the only thing that they do not like is that we worship Allah alone if Muslims were to worship other than Allah the non-muslims would be ok with that they will not prosecute them they would not fight them they would not kill them the main reason for their attacks their hatred their enmity their will to annihilate Muslims is because Muslims worship Allah alone and they submit their will to Allah alone no hidden agendas Muslims are like an open book you can tell exactly what they think what they're thinking about so they stayed in Abyssinia worshiping Allah though their hearts were still connected to Mecca to the Kaaba to their homeland and to their surprise rumors spread like wild fires it spread like wildfire in Abyssinia among the Muslims that all the idol worshipers have accepted Islam they were so happy they were so joyful because now they can see the light at the end of the tunnel they realized that this is the time for them to go back to their homeland only to discover after a treacherous journey across the raging sea in boats that only Allah knows what it was made of when they reached Jeddah and then moved on foot to Mecca in a journey that took them four or five days when they reached there exhausted and tired they were faced by the brutal reality that what they had heard about the idol worshipers accepting Islam was fake news it was a lie so each one of the migrants looked for one of the dignitaries to enter in his protection and they managed to do so except as a cron and his wife soda they had no one and after that long journey as a cron who was in his late 50s maybe early 60s fell ill and died leaving a widow who was Muslim among her family who were idol worshipers she had no one to turn to it she had no one to seek his protection so you can imagine the grief and sorrow she was in after all what she had suffered throughout the years and for what for just simply worshiping allah almighty here was the breakthrough he was the salvation when the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam proposed to her she accepted in a heartbeat she would not think twice who would think twice what we can learn from this is that the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam marriages were not based on his desire of women though that would have been totally acceptable and normal no one in his right mind would condemn a man for liking women this is human nature men like women and this is why they get married and this is what allah mentioned in the quran that it was beautified in men's hearts the love of women of children of gold and silver all of these things were made beautiful to us by Allah Azza WA JAL but what you should notice and pay attention to that the profit a little of Sam was not as they accused him of being a womanizer when he was 25 years of age in the prime of his youth and strength he married a woman 15 years older than him and stayed law lawful and loyal for 25 more years not having a second wife not having a concubine nothing totally devoted for her love when she died he could have chosen anyone from the Muslim companions around him anyone would have been honoured to give him his daughter or his sister he could have chosen Miss Universe if he was looking for lust and desire he remained unmarried for a while and when they the Companions proposed to him that he gets married he married a woman in her early 50s a woman described in the books of history as being huge and big in size that anyone could identify her those she though she is covered from head to toe but she can be identified by her size in an authentic hadith Rome are used to tell the prophet of Salaam why don't you cover your women and not let them go out and one day soda went out of the prophets house sorry so Sam fully covered and Omar saw her and say said to her o soda we recognize you we know that your soda so she went back immediately and complained to the Prophet erase a lot of what Rama had said and then Allah revealed to the Prophet Allah so Sam that it is permissible it's okay for them to leave their homes for necessities like at the time answering the call of nature which was done outside the city for everyone they didn't have any toilets in their homes at the time so she was a book a big woman in size and no one had ever said that she was beautiful or glamorous or wealthy or that she had anything special in her that would attract men and we don't say this male of a bid to discredit her or to look down upon her she's our mother no one disrespects his mother but it's just for you to contemplate is the Prophet Muhammad that is awesome a womanizer he chose a woman only for her religious commitment she's a widow she's alone and she needed someone to protect her the Prophet took it upon himself to be that someone he married her he opened her house for her she stayed with him for three years and the Prophet did not go and look for any other woman though he could have but he didn't and this is a practical lesson that the Prophet is giving us allahís alot was sallam giving men that when you get married is not the beauty that counts it's not the wealth it's the chemistry that you find with this woman who if she is Allah fearing she would make your house paradise three years the Prophet lived with her never ever alayhi salatu salam complained about her or said anything negative about her or the books of history reported a fight between them she was a good righteous pious woman and the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam loved her she was also a witty smart woman after the Prophet a little option I married different wives for many different reasons as we will come and discuss this inshallah she felt that she was too old for the prophet alayhi salatu salam to give him his marital rights so she took the initiative and said to the prophet alayhi salatu salam o prophet of allah i love what you love and on what I care about is your comfort and peace of mind and because you love Ayesha more than your other wives I grant and give willingly and happily my night to Aisha so every night you go to your wives when it's my night don't come to me go to Aisha and when sis has night you go to Aisha so you spent two nights with her rather than one night with her and one night with me the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam appreciated that for her mother Aisha herself she said there is no woman on earth I would like to be in her shoes I wish I can be like her except soda Benzema she is one heck of a woman when she got old she gave her night to the prophet alayhi salatu salam as a gift and she gave that night from herself to me so the Prophet used to give me aisha two nights and all the rest of his wives one night each she was a wise woman she did not have what we call possessive love nowadays women want to own their husbands he should not leave the house without telling me where he's going I would occupy his mobile phone with missed calls until he answers where are you what time are you coming back why don't you tell me and if he were to think of getting married again she would turn his life into a living hell this is possessive love this is not realistic no one says woman go and search for another wife or your husband no one says this but if it were inevitable if he is in need - getting to get married a woman has to be as smart as soda weighs the pros and cons and knows when to take a step back and let the ball rolling the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam said to the wives of the Prophet when they gathered once and they asked the Prophet Allah salatu salam o prophet of allah which one of us wives will be the first to die after you to catch up with you after death which one is the first to die so the Prophet said that in salatu salam the longest the one with the longest hand or longest are so they brought a measuring tool and they started measuring their arms to know which one of them was the longest arm and they found that Zeena Ben Josh was the one with the longest arm after the death of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam it was soda that died first only then they understood the meaning of the longest hand or the longest arm which means the most of you who gives charity the most and the most generous of them all was soda may Allah be pleased with her the mother of the poor and the needy she used to give all what she had to the poor Ahmad once sent her money and she looked at it and she said what is this it's like dates so many of them and within minutes she distributed the whole sack of gold and silver to the poor and the needy and she left nothing for herself this was soda bent Zima the mother of the believers a woman that had nothing to attract men there is normal men to get married to her yet she drew the attention of the prophet alayhi salatu salam with her Eman with her religious commitment and this is what qualified her to be the mother of the believers your mother and mine may allah azzawajal be pleased with her she died at the reign of Omaha table may Allah be pleased with him and some say that she died at the year of 54 Hedra and allah azzawajal knows best"
