  "transcript": "[Music] why is there difference of opinion uh behind the ruling of reciting the fact behind the imam because the hadith of abu hurairah and if you go back to suffolk the description of the prayer of the prophet which was compiled by a sheikh imam muhammad authenticated the hadith of where the prophet prayed allah once and it was a loud prayer and after he concluded he said to the people that something was pulling me inside the prayer and trying to fight over my recitation maybe you are reciting behind your imam meaning what he's reciting the prophet says do not do that except by reciting the fatiha so this hadith we all know and this hadith indicates that reciting the fatiha while the imam is reciting in loud prayers is okay abu hurairah says afterwards then the people were prohibited from doing that as well which means that even the fatiha and the recitation of it in us in a loud raqqa was abrogated and the people were told not to do it and this is the opinion of imam malik that in loud prayers you don't recite the fatiha because the imam's recitation is sufficient for you in silent prayers it's a pillar you must with the or the last two rakahs of isha it is mandatory it's a must it's a rukun for you to recite it and allah knows best you"
