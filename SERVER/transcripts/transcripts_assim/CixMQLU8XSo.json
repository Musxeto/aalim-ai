  "transcript": "um I live in a coastal city here in America I live in a Beach City here in America and the culture my city is heavily influenced by the sea in other words we have a very large Surfer boy culture here I'm a young man and a lot of friends that I have are you know they're Surfers and these Surfers like to wear shark tooth necklaces now I know most necklaces are Haram because you are essentially imitating women but shark tooth necklaces especially where I live are considered to be a very masculine accessory this house is wondering if it would be permissible or not for me to wear this thank you you're quite welcome okay a Muslim Prides on having his identity preserved so if you were to wear a shark tooth necklace like everybody else and I happen to come to your city and I see you what I say salaam alaikum thinking that you're a Muslim or most likely I would say hi thinking that you are one of them your identity has to be obvious to those who look at you who can recognize that you are a Muslim wearing such a necklace is either imitating the disbelievers which is a sign of as you said masculinity or imitating women who are known to wear necklaces and either choice is Haram for us as Muslims so there is nothing wrong in you surfing if it's safe and you're abiding by the Islamic attire and not exposing your aura that's a good sport you enjoy it you love the water you love the sun good for you but stay away from imitating the kuffar the disbelievers and have your own identity"
