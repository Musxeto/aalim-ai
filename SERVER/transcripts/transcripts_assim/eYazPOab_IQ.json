  "transcript": "well what do you need to know is that I've been to the state's own in my life only for five weeks alhamdulillah okay so I went for a month and then a couple of years later I went for a week okay so this is my experience with the US I don't know o know even how to get there because the last time I was there was like in 1984 okay my English with the grace of Allah so I never thought that I'm gonna use it for Dawa I come from a westernized family so my father my brothers my siblings my cousins we since God knows when we've been westernized so we were Muslims but not practicing Muslim like the masses right and with the grace of allah azzawajal with time Allah guided me to pursue knowledge more and then I found that people are benefiting from it in English in Arabic that is right and only 12 years ago I was introduced to the arena to make lectures in English which I didn't hesitate a lot because heck nobody knows what I'm gonna say in Arabic you get people come here this is wrong but in English whatever you say the people that's nice so I'm delighted when Tong and unfortunately now people are discovering these shortcomings and they're pointing it now no I think we've benefitted greatly from your efforts thank you sir"
