  "title": "Can women / females speak publicly on social media? #Assim #assimalhakeem #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh sir shik I have a question uh like on the social media what's happening right now is it allowed for the woman to speak publicly okay we've said this so many many times regardless of what's happening in the world women speaking public publicly whether it's politicians or for dawa or for a press release or for an interview this all defies the purpose of the hijab and if you were to go back to the time of the best of generations ever and that is the time of the prophet alham and the companions you would find that the most intellectual and smart and highly decorated women on earth such as mother AA mother ha and the wives of the Prophet Alam had never ever talked publicly though they far exceed in knowledge in intellect in uh eloquencer of men among the companions yet they've never delivered a lecture or a speech in the Masjid though they they are the mothers of all those attending they can never marry them they are the mothers of the Believers so how would it be possible for a woman putting makeup and foundation on her face and masar or they call mascara and the whole nine yards to come slight lipstick not not a lot to come in a lecture which is videotaped and the camera is on her face with a zoom in zoom out and she speaks and sometimes becomes emotional and sometimes she cracks jokes and the men are looking at that what kind of a DA is this so this is totally out of the question in Islam other religions it might be good but not in uh um our religion and Allah Knows Best"
