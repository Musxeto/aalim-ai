  "title": "Can we borrow money from someone who works in a  Bank",
  "transcript": "Asna from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh My question is, is it permissible to borrow money from a person who works in a bank? JazakAllah So borrowing money is permissible regardless of the source of this money. You see if I have a $10 banknote, this $10 banknote is not najis, it's not impure, it's not by itself something that has to be cleansed. It depends how it was earned. So if I work in selling drugs, may Allah forbid, may Allah forbid, or in dealing with riba, and I get this banknote and I give it to someone, I'm sinful for earning it from haram sources. But when I give it to someone in halal means, which is giving, lending, buying things of him, to that individual it is halal. So if you borrow from someone who deals in riba, such as people who work in banks, what you borrow is halal for you. And this is why the Prophet ï·º, before he died, borrowed from a Jew. And he pawned his own shield or his own armour in exchange for this amount of barley he borrowed from the Jew. When we know that the Jews depend entirely on extortion, embezzlement, and riba, yet when we borrow from them, this is halal for us and haram for them. And Allah Azzawajal knows best."
