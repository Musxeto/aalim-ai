  "transcript": "abu house from bangladesh he was asking about that dua which helps you to die on futra and i i don't know which dua he's me and he meant if it is where the prophet told him that whenever you want to go to bed perform abolution and then lie on your right hand side and say allahumma nislam fitrah on islam if this is a hadith i don't memorize it correctly and i hope it is this one see so he's asking that if i don't perform would i gain the same reward mentioned in the hadith it seems that it has to be a package so it's it's a package deal you perform and say the dua so if you perform dudu and did not say the dua you would not get the reward and likewise if you did not make wudu and what said this dua it seems that you won't get the reward and allah knows best"
