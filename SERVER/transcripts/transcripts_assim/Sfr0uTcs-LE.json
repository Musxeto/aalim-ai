  "title": "What is Fiqh and Sunnah According to Scholars of Fiqh",
  "transcript": "We talk about the scholars of Fiqh, the \nFiqh of Hanbali, Hanafi, Maliki, Shaafi,   schools of thought that deal with Halal \nand Haram, how to do forms of worship,   transactions, marriages etc, they refer to \nthe Sunnah as one of the categories of deeds. So we have Waajib, mandatory opposing \nHaram, prohibited, then we have   Sunnah or Mustahab in contrast to Makrooh \nor disliked or not recommended, then we have   permissible, so Sunnah here means something that \nis recommended, if you do it you're rewarded,   if you don't do it you are not sinful unlike \nmandatory or Waajib if you do it you're rewarded   if you don't do it you are sinful, \nand you'll get bad deeds for that."
