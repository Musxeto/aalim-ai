  "transcript": "Sabira from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Sheikh in my house, many times the running water from the tap usually has a bad smell but I don't know if the bad smell of the water is due to a pure substance or an impure substance sometimes the smell of the water goes away after some time, sometimes it stays for a long time once I made wudu with that bad smelling water and I'm not sure if my wudu was valid should I repeat the prayer? no need to repeat the prayer Alhamdulillah the default is the water is pure until proven otherwise as long as you don't have concrete proof and evidence that the smell is due to an impure substance because the bad smell can be due to any other thing but it's not impure it has nothing to do with najasa or nabak as you guys say so there is no problem inshaAllah as long as there is no proof you may continue and your prayer is valid inshaAllah"
