  "transcript": "djar from kovo sh there's a mid uh like 5 minutes away from me and like it's notoriously known for having a jamat that makes of others and one of the imams uh also sometimes ones did not let like the some Turks lead the prayer because they fear he feared of their AKA I don't know I know I don't know if this like a belief of the but my father tells me not to pray here and there is also like this message message is like 5 minutes away uh and there's another another message that is Sound a but like 30 minutes away so am I am I still obliged to bring this message even though it's like corrupting a the norm is that a Muslim should select an Imam with a sound a if the IM does innovation we know that Innovation is divided into two types one is non type such as celebrating the M congregational Dua and the likes the second is Tak Innovation that deals with things that takes a person out of the fold of Islam now praying behind some someone who does to others is a grave sin because this IM is part of the Deviant Cults and sects so you should not pray behind him but if you do your prayer is valid what I would have done is not to pray on time with the Imam and I wait until the prayer is over and I come just as the prayer is over so that I would start a new Jama with someone who's not and most likely I would be the one leading the second Jama rather than not pray at all or go to a 30 minute away Masjid which is not mandatory upon me and Allah Knows Best"
