  "transcript": "it is part of the recommendation that orator the one who gives the hood bah is the same one who leads the prayer but this is not mandatory which means that if I gave the hood ba and I finished the sermon and the Obama was given and I appoint someone else to lead the prayer this is totally legit and there is no problem in that insha'Allah"
