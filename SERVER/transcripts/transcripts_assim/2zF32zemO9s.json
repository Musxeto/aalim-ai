  "title": "Wants to study Arabic to gain more knowledge but parents won't accept, what to do? #assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Amar um I wanted some advice on a matter um I recently started gaining knowledge Al as much as I can in English but because the resources are really Limited in English and not much can be attained that compared to the resources that are available in Arabic so like jam Bayan and the great books by scholars in Arabic so I wanted to start learning Arabic but the issue is because I'm also currently studying in the university and gaining learning Arabic would require me to completely focus on it so that I could reach a level where I could read books which have such high Advanced Arabic but I'm scared that if I tell about this about my desire to learn Arabic to my parents they would be they would not accept it because they've already because I'm already studying something in the University so I wanted to ask like is it possible to reach that level of Arabic if I start right now so that I would be able to read such great books and maybe understand Arabic understand books of Islam in such a way that like gain more knowledge knowledge is not acquired overnight it takes time and learning Arabic with the grace of Allah is quite easy especially for those who have a great desire to it like yourself yes if someone was forced to learn it due to work requirements or because someone is forcing them to do so it won't be as easy as when someone is eager to learn it for a noble cause that he has nevertheless at the moment I would think and believe that you should focus and make your priority to graduate from uni and to get your degree this doesn't mean that you should stop your pursue of learning Arabic rather you should do that but on a scale that would not negatively impact your studies at the uni once you're over then you can have full blast with the grace of Allah and believe me that within a year or two you would be able inshallah to read books in Arabic on your own paste without rushing things and without jeopardizing your academic achievements and learning at Uni"
