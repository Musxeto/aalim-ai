  "title": "The Prophet’s ‎ﷺ trial with the slander of his wife Aisha | assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "To the others. We all know that the Prophet ﷺ was tested and tried by a huge and severe calamity when the hypocrites slandered his beloved wife Aisha and accused her of adultery with Safwan, one of the companions, may Allah be pleased with him. And they started spreading rumors and slandering her everywhere. The Prophet ﷺ was dismayed and for a whole month revelation did not come down to show her innocence or to reveal any of the truth. And the Prophet ﷺ could not judge an issue by mere feelings. He needed proof. So after a whole month and after this ordeal, Allah Azza Wa Jal revealed her innocence in Surah An-Nur in the Qur'an and the Prophet ﷺ was so happy it would show on his face and he would come to Aisha laughing and the first thing he said to her, O Aisha, Allah has proven your innocence. So he was jubilant and happy with such a relief from Allah Subhanahu wa Ta'ala."
