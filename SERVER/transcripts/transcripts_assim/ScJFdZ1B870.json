  "transcript": "next question from WhatsApp assalam alaykum I have a non-muslim friend asking me if God is Almighty why does he want someone to glorify him why does he want us to do that I don't know how to answer that this is a common question asked by non-muslims that if God is Almighty why does he want us to glorify him why does he want us to praise him and the reply to this is that Allah subhah wa ta'ala is already the greatest when we say Allah abbar Allah is the greatest it doesn't make Allah more great Allah is already the greatest whether we say one time or 10 time or 100 time or thousand time it will not make a difference to Allah subhana tala Allah is already the greatest whether you say it or not it will not make him more difference so then the question is then why does Allah want us to praise him to glorify him the reason is Allah subhana wa ta'ala knows the human psychology the human being normally any entity it glorifies the human being tends to follow the advice given by that human being for example if you know that there is a top heart specialist in the world and he know he's very famous he comes in the newspaper everyone knows he's number one and some suppose your mother has a heart attack so you will take the advice of the topmost heart specialist if some unknown doctor gives you an advice and a heart specialist gives who will you follow but naturally to save your mother who had a heart attack you will follow the advice of that heart specialist correct because he expert similarly if you want to learn something you'll go to a teacher who more famous if you want to learn mathematics you'll go to the teacher that is best in mathematics and when the teacher say something if you proven that he's the best then you follow him similarly when we say Allah abbar or when we say Subhan Allah allahar means Allah is the greatest Subhan Allah means glory be to Allah alhamdulillah means praise be to Allah when we say this we are agreeing that Allah is the greatest Allah should be glorified Allah should be praised we say alhim the most wise the most intelligent now when we say this then whatever advice Allah gives then we follow it because he's the most wise he's the most intelligent he's our creator he's the greatest so we are praising him and why does Allah want us to praise him so that we follow his advice and who can be a better entity to advise us than a Creator Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala is far superior to the best doctor in the world if all the best doctor in the world you get together Allah subhana wa ta'ala is far superior because he is a Creator he knows us better than the best doctors and best surgeons in the world so when you're going to follow the advice of the heart specialist for your mother who had heart attack will you follow the advice of Allah or not Allah as far superior to the heart specialist so the reason Allah is asking us to praise him so that when we praise him whatever advice he gives us in the Quran we follow it that the reason in our Salah we have to read compulsory is Sur fa reading Sur faat is a inah when we read Sur fat what does it say we start in the name of Allah most gra most merciful alhamdulillah praise be to Allah the lord of the world most gracious most merciful Malik the master of the day of judgment so first three verses of Surah fa is praising you is glorifying you alhamdulillah praise be to Allah the lord of the most merciful most gracious Malik Master of the day of stat then the fourth was they alone we worship they alone we ask for help so the first four three verses are praising him the fourth verse also they alone we worship they alone we ask for help then it goes ahead then we asking him show us the straight path the path of those who have earned that favor and not the path who have gone astray and the full after that whatever Surah we read is the reply so Surah fa is a Dua we are praising it first we are praising him and then we asking him show us the straight path the path of those who have earned th favor and not the path who have gone a straight and then after that you mayci 5 vers number 90 oh you believe most certain intoxic and gambling dedication of stone div vanish of arrows these are Satan's handw workk here Allah is guiding you don't have alcohol don't don't gamble don't do idol worship don't do fortune telling here we are being guided so when we praise him and when we acknowledge he's the greatest he is the lord of the worlds he is the master of the day of judgment then we have to follow his advice so Allah is asking us to praise him not to benefit him but to benefit us it will make no difference from him whether you praise him or don't praise him he's already the greatest Allah is asking you because he knows the psychology he knows the way we think so so that we follow his advice we know he's the ultimate no one is harder than him we follow his advice it will benefit us in this world and hope that answer the question"
