  "transcript": "a brother says what's the ruling for a person who is suffering from gas problems and who breaks his Woodill several times a day if there is a period of time where you know that the gas will cease and stop you must not pray except at that particular time so a person says when there that is given I keep on passing gas the Akama is given the gas is still passing after an hour it stops can I pray in the message the answer is no you have to wait until it stops make Waddell perform your prayer in complete pahala but if the guy says listen I have a serious leak and I keep on passing wind like every half a minute and I cannot control my Woodill in this case once that is given perform Moodle and pray and even if you pass went your prayer is valid that the problem is do I pray in the masjid or not if you're continuously passing wind then you must not go to the message because this harms and annoys other worshipers and you should not do that"
