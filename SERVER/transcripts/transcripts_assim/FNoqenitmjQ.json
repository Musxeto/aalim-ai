  "title": "Can we use toilet or tissue paper to clean our thighs or legs when outside?",
  "transcript": "Muhammad from Canada Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullah So Sheikh I know Allah has allowed us istajmar as well but sometimes when we are outside and we are going to the washroom sometimes the najis water splashes back onto our bodies so can we use tissue paper to clean our bodies like our thighs and legs and stuff? If there are no means of using water yes you can use these tissues though it's an issue of dispute because the scholar said that tissues and stones and the likes are only to remove the najasa from the private area or the things adjacent to it but not if it falls on your foot or on your hands and you use tissue to wash it or to wipe it off no that would not do but if you are in a kafir country or in a place where you have no water or access to water in this case it would do the job inshallah if it falls on your thighs and the buttocks and the likes"
