  "title": "How Prophet ï·º prayed while holding a child (movements in salah) #Assim #sunnah assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so if it's time for the prophet Alam hears thean and he's his in his house he repeats after the MU and then he prays four two by two and in the remaining time for the he would utilize it either to speak with his wife and to joke with her and to have a good time or to attend to his grandchildren and play with them and this was the norm because he loved his grandchildren and when B notified him that it is time for prayer he used to go to the Masjid directly sometimes the companions would find him coming to the Masjid with one of his grandchildren that was always the case in and there are so many hadiths one of the Hadith is uh uh of Umama B AB his granddaughter from Zab so he came to the Salat allahar he's carrying whenever he went for R and he placed her on the ground and whenever he stood up he picked her up how would you think or what would you do if you see the Imam do this nowadays you probably throw your Android phone if it's iPhone no you it's too expensive you throw your Android phone on him or your old Nokia why thinking oh it's inappropriate and some people are so ignorant they would make a fuzz of nothing it's inappropriate how does he bring his child to the Masjid and pray carrying this is a lot of movement his prayer is invalid the prophet did it uh maybe the child's nap is full with urine maybe there's njasa his prayer is invalid how do you know so people make assumptions and they make ideas of their own neglecting what the proof our master sallallahu alaihi wasallam did it so you were more Roman than the Romans it doesn't make any sense so don't judge things by your own whims and desires always before you judge look for the for an answer in the Quran and the Sunnah and follow and comply not the opposite don't come up with an opinion and then okay let me see what supports my opinion from the Quran and Sunnah because this is manipulating uh uh the religion"
