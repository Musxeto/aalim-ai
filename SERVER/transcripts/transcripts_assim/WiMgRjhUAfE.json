Muslim by law and by Divine decree has to be kind the prophet sallallahu alaih alaihi wasallam says whoever is deprived from kindness he is De deprived of goodness and which is a serious threat and warning if you are not kind then you've been deprived of goodness how is that prophet of Allah I pray I fast I offer charity yes all of this is good but if you do not have kindness in you if you do not have a then you've got a serious problem the prophet saidat that kindness is one of the attributes of Allah the almighty the prophet saysat wasam Allah is kind and loves kindness and he rewards for kindness in a way that he does not reward for harshness or violence or for anything else and this Hadith was narrated by Imam Muslim which grades it as the highest grade of authenticity so Allah is kind Almighty and he rewards on kindness and he does not reward on harshness or violence and this is one of the best definitions of kindness which is the opposite of harshness and violence and that is why violence is against the teachings of Islam the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam was asked which of the Muslims was best which of the Muslims was best the prophet saidat wasam the one from whose words and actions the Muslims are safe so not only the actions but even the words the rhetoric itself and this Hadith is a clear evidence that if you see a person who prays fasts offers zaka performs pilgrimage and he looks like a practicing Muslim but he is Harsh he is violent then definitely this is not a true practicing Muslim and he is on great Danger and this is how we evaluate people usually when we see someone we just look at him from the exterior point of view because we judge people by what appears not by what's in their hearts Allah judg the People by both but we have no power to know what goes under the hood but we know that we have to judge people through their actions and how they behave behave so if I look at someone and I see this woman wearing the veil covered up from head to toe mashallah I would say this is a good muslima the minute I learn that she is abusive and that she spanks and beats her children in an inhumane way the minute I learned that she swears and curses her husband and fights and nags him and her voice is always heard all over the neighborhood the minute I know that she is a violent person rude tough and does not forgive I know that she's not a practicing Muslim even she's wearing the hijab this has no value at that point because she is not a real practicing Muslim she is doing more harm than good to Islam and to her community likewise if I see a person who looks practicing mashallah with a big smile his beard is unshaven and he was wearing Islamic clothes but he is violent if someone opposes him he either smacks him down or ridicules him insults him curses him him I know that this person is not a proper Muslim and I have the evidence to back this up it was the prophet sallallahu alaihi alhi wasallam who said the one from whose words and actions the Muslims are safe this is the best Muslim and also from this I learned that those who do and execute terrorist attacks are not among the Muslims because this is indiscriminate killing this is harming people endangering lives and damaging property under what cause they claim the cause of Islam and this has nothing to relate to Islam we have our Prophet Alat wasam and his companions and none of them did anything similar to one tenth of what these people are doing the prophet Alat wasam instructed his army so did Abu Bakr Omar and Ali all of the companions they used to instruct their armies do not kill a woman a child or an elderly do not cut a fruitful tree and do not slaughter a camel a cow or a sheep unless it's for your consumption and for you to take as food do not demolish destroy or attack houses or places of worship so if you were encountered with monks with worshippers with priests leave them as they're praying and worshiping their Idols or their Lords it's not your job leave them as they are this is their religion and there's no compulsion in religion this is the Islam we know but to come and blow up houses or houses of worship or to kill people indiscriminately this is not part of the kindness that Islam promotes the prophet saidat when Allah Wills good for the members of a household he introduces kindness to them and Subhan Allah we find this in so many places people who are not considered to be Scholars or to be excellent Muslims mlims they are practicing Muslims in the sense that they pray they fast they're Muslims but there is so much love and care in them you find these members of that particular family they have this kindness in the house they're tolerant they're loving they're caring this is a clear sign that Allah loves this house or this family and that that Allah the almighty Wills good for them eventually they will improve on the religious part Allah Asel will guide them more and more to be a good practicing family but as they are they are definitely beloved by Allah and if you compare this to another household where the members of the family are violent they're harsh with one another then definitely even if they're practicing how they appear to be practicing on the appearance even if they appear to be practicing because Allah deprived them from this kindness this is an indication that Allah does not love them how is it possible for a person to be practicing and he is battering his children and he is torturing them and abusing his wife he this person is not a practicing Muslim I remember once seeing someone who was seemed to me to be practicing at the time I saw him torture his 11 months old child by burning this child with a light bulb why was that because that child who was 11 months plus or minine is couple of months old used to play with this belly button and he wanted the child to stop doing this so he burned the child with a light bulb and you could see the burn on her skin is this kind is this part of the household that Allah loves I I'm sure and certain that this is not the case we have a short break stay tuned and in we will be right back patient and welcome back kindness is not something that we only deal with other humans it is a way of life it Cascades down even to being kind with animals the prophet Alat wasam told us that Allah had forgiven the sins of a prostitute because she was kind to an animal The Story Goes or the Hadith goes that a a woman met a dog and she was a prostitute and the dog had its tongue dangling out of thirst and it was eating the soil because there were no place faces around with water the woman felt sorry for the dog she went down to the well in another narration there was another man with a similar situation and she put water in her shoe and could not climb up without having the shoe in her mouth for the sake of the dog and she climbed up and she gave the shoe to the dog to drink from and the dog was grateful Allah forgave her sins because she was kind to an animal and harshness leads to hell in theah the prophet sallahu alaih wasallam told us about a woman who was admitted to hell and the prophet tells us why he says that she held a cat in her house neither she fed the cat nor she let the cat go away go outside and eat on its own until the cat died so kindness in Islam Cascades down even to animals the prophet Alat wasam instructed us he ordered us to be kind to animals even when we are killing these animals the prophet says sallallahu alaihi wasallam if if you kill kill well and if you Slaughter Slaughter well let each one of you sharpen his blade and let him spare suffering to the animal he Slaughters what does that mean slaughtering is the least painful process of killing an animal it's less painful than stunning it electrifying it or banging it on the head this is the Divine instruction from Allah who knows his Creations these creatures no one know them best than Allah and he is the one who instructed us to slaughter in a certain manner that scientists agree that it eliminates the painful process that an animal goes through the minute you Slaughter the animal from where we told to slaughter it it doesn't feel anything the prophet tells usam if you want to slaughter an animal do it well and you have to sharpen your knife so that it would cut in the fastest way possible instead of torturing the Animal by trying to slaughter it and the knife is dull and is not penetrating it's not going through in another Hadith the Prophet Alam saw a man slaughtering an animal while the other animal was looking and the prophet was really angry with him and he saysat wouldn't you have done that elsewhere you're hurting the feelings of this other animal he saw someone sharpening his knife and the animal was looking and the prophet was angry again and he said you want to kill the the animal twice sharpen the knife elsewhere not in front of the animal So to that extent the kindness in Islam reaches the animals and cares for the feelings of such animals Islam promotes being kind to one's self by not allowing us to kill ourselves so it's forbidden for a Muslim to kill himself it's forbidden for a Muslim to torture himself and part of that torture is to inflict upon oneself things that make life difficult all in the name of religion and in the name of Allah this is not permissible the prophet Alat wasam says this religion is very very profound so approach it in a gentle manner you have to approach it with r now an ignorant person hears this Hadith and starts to abandon F prayer and shaves his beard maybe deals with interest and maybe mixes with the opposite sex and when we tell him and say that all of these are Haram things he says this religion is profound and we have to take it gently this is what the prophet instructed well this is wrong this is your misconception the prophet Alat wasam did not instruct us to abandon mandatory things or to fall into sin may God forbid this the prophet never orders such a thing the prophet is telling us not to to be extreme when we Embrace this religion not to go to extreme but fulfilling Allah's commands and staying away from forbidden things this is not extreme this is the middle path and this is what we should follow the prophet Alat wasam was once as the Hadith goes three of his companions questioned his wives about his conduct when he's in the houses what are the forms of worship he performs what are the ways that he does people are unaware of the things that he does so the wives of the Prophet Alam told them that he used to pray and sleep he fasts some days and he skips some days and that he works in his house he saws his dress and he fixes his shoes he helps his wives these men thought that listen this is not what we think a prophet should do but we believe that the prophet is like this Alat because Allah forgave his previous and cominging sins that's why he doesn't have to work hard but we as individuals you definitely should work harder than this that is why one of them said I will pray all night long and never sleep the night the second one says I will Fast all day long and never break my fast and the third one said I will abandon the desires and lust of this world I will never marry a woman I'll be like a monk when the prophet heard thisam he got angry and he advised the people and he said by Allah I am the most one among you who fears Allah and who has knowledge more than any one of you of him but I pray and sleep I fast and I break my fast and I marry women whoever chooses other than my Sunnah is not following me is not from me and this shows us that the this is what is meant by taking the religion gently because it's profound these companions went into the extreme Islam forbids this you have to fulfill Allah's Commandments you have to follow Allah's instructions and stay away from sin this is the middle path if you want to add something more that is voluntary then you have to follow the Sunnah and not go to the extreme kindness is also required when you make Daw when you call people to Islam the prophet was instructed by Allah invite mankind to the way of your Lord with wisdom and fair preaching and argue with them in the way that is best Allah the almighty also told us about the softness of the prophet's heart am when he calls people to Islam Allah says and by the mercy of Allah you dealt with them gently and had you been severe and harsh hearted they would have broken away from about you this was our Prophet alhat wasam a man comes and he urinates in the Masjid the people want to kill him the prophet says leave him until he finishes and then he instructs them to pour water on the place and he brings him forward and he tells him my nephew these places are places of worship they're not good for such filth and dirt they are places of prayer reciting the Quran and making VI this was the prophet pleased with her tells us the prophet was not ever given the choice between two things he would always choose the easiest among them unless it involved sin once it involved sin he was the furthest away from it and this Hadith we give to those new diis new people who preach Islam but tend to cut and clip the wings here and there to formulate a new religion that suits people this is not Islam the Quran and the Sunnah is what we call people for and not to tailor make it suitable for their whims and desires this is Islam you love it take it you don't leave it but we are not going to compromise our religion we're not going to give in because this is not part of the kindness that the prophet Alat wasam instructed us the prophet also told us about being kind to those who you are above to your subordinates to your subjects if you're a ruler if you're a manager if if you're a head of a department if you are a governor the prophet tells usat oh Allah whoever assumes a position overruling Muslims and he is Harsh on them oh Allah be harsh on him and if he's kind to them oh Allah be kind to them and look at this Hadith and compare it to what Muslims are suffering nowadays from Tyrant from people who oppressed them and deprived them from their own right of dignity and living on their lands as in the case in Palestine where the aggressors where the Jews are abusing them torturing them depriving them from the least that is considered to be human this is all the time we have for today's program so until we meet next time the patient always"
