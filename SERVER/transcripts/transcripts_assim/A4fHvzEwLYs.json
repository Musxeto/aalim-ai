  "transcript": "Che a lot of people in my family are not practicing when I don't freix they don't like it for example last time I went to visit my mom I didn't pay a visit to my mom's cousin because she's not my M and I know they freix and don't wear the proper hijab and she was mad at me she sent me some messages telling me if I become M to you your life will be difficult some same thing goes with my female cousin she sent me messages asking how I'm doing and I don't know what to do in these cases she please adise me this is part of the tests we obliged to go through in life and Allah stated this in the beginning of Surah anab the spider where he says Al do people think that they will be left alone to claim that they're Believers without being tested nay we have tested those before them and it will be proven to Allah it will be shown to Allah who's telling the truth from those who are telling lies so this is your test from Allah Allah ordered you only to obey him and never to disobey him and if your parents were to order you to disobey Allah or to commit shik Allah says do not obey them but be good companion to them and be dutiful and respectful so no matter what your mom says as long as you're abiding by the Shar and not free mixing and not doing something Haram if she curses you if she makes Dua from here till the day of judgment Allah will not adhere to that Allah would not listen to that or pay attention to it because Allah does not endorse such transgression and vice and evil so you are on the right path don't doubt yourself or look behind you every five minutes or over your shoulder what you're doing is right be dutiful be diplomatic be respectful and whoever doesn't like it who cares"
