  "transcript": "Qasim from America Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Masakallah Bil Khair Sheikh Masakallah Bil Rida Was Suruh I have a question Jazakum Yes Sir I have a question Jazakum Allahu Khair When is it exactly in effect? If I were to perform it unto my son for example that it ends at the beginning of the Masa and that of Fajr according to Adhkar Sabahul Masa Jazakum Allahu Khair Wa Jazak First of all we have to make a distinction we have to differentiate between the Adhkar and the Ruqya Adhkar is a collection of verses of the Quran or the Prophets' Hadiths that we say at specific times whether in the evening the morning before going to bed after every Fajr Salat before going out of our homes before entering the toilet after coming out from the toilet before eating after eating a number of situations in our lives we say these Adhkar and generally speaking these Adhkar are tailored made to protect us with the grace of Allah Azza wa Jal from different evils the Ruqya is a form of healing not of protection so I do not go to my son and perform Ruqya in the evening in the morning just to protect him no it doesn't work like this if my son if myself if my spouse are in agony in pain have a fever they have evil eye envy black magic jinn possession anything that's harmful I do Ruqya for them so I hope this makes the difference clear for you brother Qasim Al-Fatiha"
