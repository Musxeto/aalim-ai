  "title": "Are Deobandi part of Ahlus Sunnah? Are they within the folds of Islam? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "from the us uh i wanted to know what is the dio bandi sect and are they with alison okay i will answer would you wish first question is about deubandis what are the ubandis ubundis is a sect from the muslim ummah they i think originated in and they had a pivotal role in countering the british conquest of india and to end their reign there so they fought bravely against them and they tried their level best to preserve islam according to their knowledge by introducing their sect to the community and it was widely spread now having said that tabli rija marat usually is from the udubandian this is related also to brother um from bangladesh so what is wrong with dewbandis well they have a lot of good things but they have a lot of bad things and as muslims our allegiance is not to a group and it is not to a country and surely it is not to individuals so i would not go out of my way to express my allegiance to imam so and so or to share so and so and whoever speaks ill about him he's my enemy and whoever my imam or sheikh speaks ill about then i will take arms against him no no no this is not islam our allegiance is totally to allah azzawajal and to his messenger and this is why we are like a magnet of hate when we are in the communities everybody hate us why because we're muslims so non-muslims hate us for our commitment to our religion we are following the sunnah of the prophet so all those who innovate in islam and want it to be shoved in our throats down our throats hate us because we follow the quran and the sunnah and the favorite three generations of the type of the sahaba taberin and those who control the masses and they embezzle them and take their money by telling them simon says if you don't obey then you'll go to hell they hate us because we come to free people so that they only enslave themselves to allah no one else so as muslims we look at different sects and cults in accordance to the quran and the sunnah we do not have any beef with any sect or cult just for the color of their eyes and the color of their hairs and the tone of their skins no we have no beef with any sector called just because of their language that they speak or where which country they are originating from we are muslims whether you're from japan or from hawaii or from the of africa you're my brother we share a common thing that is islam so what's the problem the problem is when you come and introduce something that is not part of islam give me an example i'll give you an example i give you examples but i don't want to devote this segment to such things but i'd like you not to be biased i'd like you sort of to have a an out of body experience in the sense in the sense that i'd like you to listen to me with your intellect with your head not with your feelings don't look at me as a a an extremist wahhabis so so no no no listen to me and see if what i'm saying is logical in accordance with the quran if someone were to come and innovate in islam what's the ruling of innovation it's haram all muslims agree that buddha takes people astray this is what the prophet said as assam he said every bidah takes a person astray and everything that takes a person astray leads a person in hell um and every bidder takes you astray and everything astray takes you to hell fire this is what the prophet used to say are some in every major in uh uh congregation whether it's eid or whatever so you agree in this 100 percent okay if someone innovates in akida so the arcade of the dubandis and the tabliris they follow abu masur al-maturidi which is sort of a fine-tuned ashariakid it's almost the same so they have an issue with allah's beautiful attributes they have issues with where to or how to believe in certain aspects of things of iman and all of this is due to the sources of learning so they have a big issue here and that's one part but if you go to practices whether it is in salat whether they follow al-hanafi hanafi school of thought in but they have innovations whether it comes to atkar whether it comes to celebrating the maulid whether it comes to every aspect of life there is something here or there that you will find it creeping in and in their beliefs you find so many of them kissing their thumbs and wiping their eyes three times whenever they hear the name of the prophet claiming that this prevents their eyes from falling sick to trachoma or be blinded by any other disease where did you get this from so there's so many things therefore we tell them you're our brothers but there are certain things that we have to come to term and that is make our quran authentic sunnah the things that govern our relationship and then insha'allah we will be in good hands"
