  "transcript": "today we have a lineup of three esteemed speakers and we will begin with sheikh asim and hakeem from saudi arabia from usa and hassan yi from malaysia the topic at hand is taqwa and its importance and in the midst of time that does not wait for anyone technology that deceives everyone and so-called civilizations around us we tend to neglect and get confused though islam is a religion of basics islam is a religion of ease so one once we get into confusing things and leaving the basics we get all distorted confused distracted being unable to know what allah wants from us the universal fact allah azzawajal created the jinn and in the humans for a sole purpose except with the sole purpose of worshiping me so this is why allah created this simple as that and if allah created us to worship him then let it be known that it is a fact that all forms of worship leads to the level of taqwa allah says in the quran o mankind worship your lord who created you and those before you that you may become righteous that you become righteous that you may fear allah so what is the definition of taqwa there are so many definitions but in essence they all revolve around the same meaning iran rajab alhambali may allah have mercy on his soul said the origin of taqwa is to live between you and whatever you are afraid of a visor a barrier so when you have taqwa this means that you leave between you and allah what protects you from allah's wrath from allah's anger from allah's punishment and that can only be done by obeying allah and by refraining from sinning very easily is very understood evan says the name taqwa has under it everything that allah azzawajal ordered whether as mandatory or as recommended and to stay away from whatever allah has prohibited whether it is forbidden or not recommended and this incorporates allah's rights and rights of the humans among one another so this is taqwa to do what you're supposed to do and refrain from what you're told not to do now what are the importance or what is the importance of taqwa so many times we read in the quran so many mentioning of taqwa so what are the uh the fruits that we can obtain when we are in such a high level of state that allah loves there are many benefits of taqwa and again because it is so basic people are negligent people are ignorant they don't pay attention to it we seek solutions for world's problems while every problem has a solution in taco and i'll mention to you few because the time is quite limited and i don't want to bore you to death taqwa one of the biggest and most important fruits that a person attains from taqwa is that he gains allah's love and mercy in this life and in the hereafter allah says indeed allah loves those who fear him and this is in the quran allah loves those who have this character in them being righteous and feeling allah azzawajal secondly when you have taqwa this grants you the gift and blessing of allah azzawajal where you have this vision you can see things with and it also because of allah's forgiveness of your sins allah says in the quran o you who believe if you fear allah in allah this is if you fear allah what would happen he will grant you a criterion and will remove from you your misdeeds and forgive you subhanallah you have righteousness in your heart this is what will happen you get to see right from wrong you get to see fitna when it's coming while others are indulging in it and not seeing it thirdly taqwa is the key for your risk for your provision for asking for morg of goodness allah says in the quran answering all those who complain i've lost my job i have so much debt on me there is a credit crunch everybody is losing their businesses i had to close my business i gained a lot of losses well you want a solution you want a way out allah says in the quran and where it fears allah he will make for him a way out and will provide for him from where he does not expect from where he does not anticipate this is a promise from allah if you believe so allah is the provider yes but i have gained so much debts and i don't know how to pay them off subhanallah who grants the birds the animals the fish the insects on earth that provision without them even knowing it or having the credentials or degrees so do you think allah will deprive you from risk when he is giving it to animals of course not but this is something that is part of your test you want provision fear allah azza have taqwa in your heart but if you insist on doing what you're doing if you insist on being defiant and not humiliate yourself to allah not express your poverty to allah not show allah azza that you are sincere in asking him allah will not give you fourthly through taqwa allah will grant you victory over your enemies and will protect you from their evil acts allah says and we saved those who believed and used to fear allah so those who fear allah those who have taqwa allah will save them and not only that allah would make what outcome from whatever they're doing in their favor so allah says and the best outcome is for the righteous whatever you indulge in as long as it is in the cause of allah as long as it pleases allah this will be in your favor the outcome would be in your favor being righteous and fearing allah azzawajal is part of any muslims job description this is a must that a muslim becomes righteous and god fearing why because the ultimate objective in this life is to be one of allah's allies to be wali of allah a close ally of allah azzawajal and this cannot be attained unless you are one of allah's obedient servants who does everything he's told and stays away from everything he's denied allah says in the quran it is true its true guardians are not but righteous but most of them [Music] do not the only true guardians allies friends of allah are the righteous and in our world we make the common mistake of judging people so we label people according to their bank account according to their wealth a called according to their strength according to the credentials they have according to the knowledge they possess and nowadays it's not what you know it is who you know this is how we evaluate people by the car they ride by the house they live in by the watch they're wearing in islam this has no value what counts is how righteous you are allah says indeed the most noble of you in the sight of allah is the most righteous of you whoa so it doesn't matter which lineage you're from it doesn't matter if you are a descendant of the prophet islam or not this adds value but without righteousness without taqwa this has no value at all look at abu lahab the uncle of the prophet he is a paternal uncle did his lineage benefit him of course not look at the wealthy and the rich among the disbelievers if benefit them of course not the only thing that is noble in the sight of allah is your righteousness is your taqwa and why does taqwa have this great and huge status at the sight of allah well the answer is simple because all of your deeds all of your forms of worship cannot be accepted by allah do not benefit you unless you are among those who fear allah and those who are righteous now a man or a beggar came to even um with him and with his father so he was asking for money ibn umar like all righteous companions said to his son give him a dinar now dinar is equivalent to a hundred dollars maybe no a bit more 150 dollars you could buy a ram with it at that time so with inflation you can tell that adina is a lot so his son said may allah accept from you my father and this is a general way of dua we all ask allah azza to accept from us and we ask allah to accept from those who do well to others and they're kind to them even umar said my son if i were to know that allah accepted one prostration from me or the charity of one dirham one tenth of a dinar one if i were to know that allah accepts accepted that by allah nothing would be more dearer to my heart than death to come why he said to him my son do you know who allah accepts from allah azzawajal only accepts from those who are righteous and fearful of him allah says in the quran indeed allah only accepts from the righteous who fear him this is how the companions used to perceive taqwa it was of great importance because they knew that making it or breaking it depends entirely on the level of taqwa in their hearts and without taqwa you cannot survive you will not be saved on the day of judgment allah the almighty says and allah will save those who feared him those who feared him by their attainment no evil will touch them nor will they grieve then taqwa is not an easy thing to you know just go by and say alhamdulillah allah tells us that those who are righteous and fearful of him they will be the successors the winners and whoever obeys allah and his messenger and fears allah and is conscious of him is those who are the attainers those who are the winners the successful so if you want success in this life if you want success on the day of judgment you have to ask yourself am i among those who are righteous and fearful of allah can i be labeled as mutri or not because it is the only way to paradise those who fear allah those who are righteous will be in paradise allah says at the end of surat al-qamr the moon indeed the righteous will be among gardens and rivers in a seat of honor near a sovereign perfect inability near a king who's sovereign and perfect inability subhanahu wata so this seat is reserved for those who are among the muttaqien those who have righteousness and fearfulness of allah azzawajal and this is not a choice to make this is an order from allah so it's not something that you may pick and choose from no this is an order from allah azzawajal who says o you who have believed fear allah this is an order as he should be feared and do not die except as muslims in submission to him now this is a serious order fear allah as he should be feared so how would i know how allah should be feared well this was interpreted to us by abdullah and abdullah may allah be pleased with them all when they both said to fear allah as he should be to obey him and not disobey him to remember him and not to be neglectful or forget him and to thank him and show your gratitude without being ungrateful now if you go to the sunnah it is filled with topics related to that would take ages to just talk about them imagine a man coming to the prophet and asking him for advice the first word that the prophet says allah [Music] his companion to fear allah azzawajal now how is this possible how is it possible to fear allah wherever you are this is done only by doing what allah has told you to do and staying away from what allah has told you to stay away from but we are neglectful of this fact we fear allah azzawajal when we are among the community when we are among those who know us but the moment we travel alhamdulillah there is travel ban but still the moment we are in a strange place where nobody knows us this is where we show how fearful and righteous we are and people have indulged in sinning not only on land or in sea but even when they are airborne unfortunately and the prophet ali saw some has but nobody pays attention to it the prophet says this world is sweet and dazzling and allah has you put in charge of it so to see how you will do and what you will do so beware beware of this world and beware of women for the first fitna that is the trial that befell the children of israel was concerning women this is what's happening nowadays we see people indulging in free mixing sometimes you get this free mixing even in fields of dawah so you find a dawah organization where women and men mix freely that's awkward what are you guys doing said well we have a conference coming we have to sit and talk and organize yeah but you're a woman and he's a man yeah yeah but alhamdulillah we know our boundaries we know our limits you're not feeding allah you're not having taqwa of allah azzawajal is messing up with your mind the moment you compromise in taqwa evil things happen and i have loads of such evil things unfortunately not alhamdulillah but through counseling sessions through talking to peoples through meeting people involved and unfortunate things happen so when you hear the prophet allah saying in an authentic hadith what summarizes tawa and you try to look into how the people are acting upon it you know that there is something wrong the prophet says keep away from prohibited things and you will be the best of worshippers will you come and investigate people's lives are they keeping away from prohibited things unfortunately not we find that many so-called muslims may look to be practicing but the moment something happens that may compromise their well-being their financial income their peace of mind they are going to do anything even if they would have to cross all boundaries and fall in all kinds of sin i've been having so many counseling sessions and hearing the issues between separated spouses and unfortunately women who pretend to be muslims and practicing when divorce takes place they have have no problem in complement laws the kafir laws of the land to acquire half of the wealth of the man what kind of islam is this and they say no no this is okay because uh this is the law of the land we have to obey no you don't have to obey obey it you have to obey the law of the lord of the land azzawajal the almighty they reject the law of allah in the quran and they want to allow many laws to take a muslim's wealth unlawfully like this this is haram money it is like what you gain from prostitution and from selling intoxicants it's okay in the land laws to have these form of income so would you say that this is halal of course not however there is no taqwa there is no feeling of allah azzawajal we can see clearly that people are falling left right and center in haram whatever means of investment they can do no problem let's jump the wagon and try to make as much money as possible okay but there is river no problem there is bribing it's okay there is music and entertainment which is haram allah is most forgiving most merciful so they indulge in haram and whenever you speak to them and they say this was old school what you guys used to know about and haram and things etc all of this has changed time changed and they they neglect exactly and i have completed my favor upon you islam and i have accepted islam to be your religion do you think when allah azzawajal said all of this that there would come a time when people say yeah yeah yeah this was in the past at the time of the prophet but this is no longer applicable this is blasphemous so look in your selves look at your wives spouses and children look at your neighborhoods your families your relatives are you guys abiding by the shah of allah azzawajal are you doing what pleases allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala are you being aware of what's happening around you and trying your level best to obey allah and to avoid what allah is angered by if you are doing this then insha'allah you are on the right track and insha allah you will be among those saved on the day of judgment not only that allah will bless your risk and allah would make you his ally and allah would forgive your sins and allah would you give you the vision to know what decision to make all of these come when you abide by and you stay away from what allah has prohibited or in other ways in other words when you become among but when we as muslims see this division among us when we see muslims abandoning the quran behind their back and refuting and rejecting the sunnah with their own intellect and they think that they can afford to do that when they give priority to their logic and reason on the account of quran and sunnah the revelation we know that such people cannot be from among the righteous and the god feeling they cannot be among and those who are not among the mutter will severely suffer in this life and the hereafter therefore going back to what i started with we don't need a lot of talks we don't need a lot of books we need to go back to the basics we need to go back to the quran we need to go back to the prophet salam and to have this submission in our hearts to whatever tells us to do and stay away from whatever allah tells us not to do if we manage to do this which is something that nomads can do illiterate people can do shepherds can do you don't have to be a rocket scientist to do that but this is the manifestation of knowledge allah says in the quran verily those who fear allah azzawajal among his servants are truly the knowledgeable so the true knowledge is manifested in fearing allah in doing what you're supposed to do and staying away from what you are prohibited from doing and you don't need to be a rocket scientist you don't need to be a phd holder you can be anyone you can be even an illiterate person but in heaven your weight at the sight of allah is far far heavier than the weight of someone who is intellectual who is smart who is uh um but his heart is emptied from allah's taqwa i pray to allah azzawajal that he makes me and you among and that he grants us this privilege of being among them because all benefits in this life and in the hereafter can be attained for those who reach that level allah foreign"
