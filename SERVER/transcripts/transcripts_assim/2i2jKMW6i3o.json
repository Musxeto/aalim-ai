  "title": "Medical and Dental insurance in Canada permissible due to ridiculous prices? ￼￼assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Anas from Canada Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So from my university, Canada gives us an option where we can either opt in or opt out for a particular type of insurance. And what this insurance does is that it guarantees us, you know, discounts for different medical services that we may need. And they give us like kind of a big discount. So since I, so one of them is like dental, which kind of gives me like 75% discount. So opting in, so I can opt it and pays for some money. And since I use like dental cleaning regularly and it's quite very expensive, like about around $250, usually if I opt in for that insurance, they can guarantee me the discount whenever I come for the dental cleaning and it could, you know, make it much more affordable. Is it permissible for me to benefit from it? Aren't you in Canada? Anas? Anas? Yeah. Aren't you in Canada? Yeah. I heard that healthcare in Canada is free compared to America. Uh, free? Uh, no. Uh, well, not in, uh, for the dental cleaning, uh, they still charge us the money. Okay. So the answer is medical insurance, like any other type of insurance is haram because it involves two aspects of gambling and riba. The gambling aspect is very clear where you pay a premium hoping that it will cover you throughout the year to a particular limit. The downfall is if you don't use it or utilize it, the premium is gone, gone down the drain. So you pay a thousand dollars, you may not utilize it and you may utilize it to gain a hundred thousand dollars of benefits and services. So this is like opting for a lottery ticket. I go to a grocery shop and I buy a ticket for a dollar. It may go down the drain and I may hit the jackpot. And this is haram. And this is the fatwas of scholars throughout time and history. Recently, due to some countries imposing such insurance over their citizens, while letting the leash loose to hospitals to raise their prices beyond human ability. So now you are in a state of a necessity. If you don't have medical insurance, you'll be bankrupt. For anything you do, you are unable to pay for it. So in this case, in such countries where it is ridiculously over exaggerated beyond human ability to pay it off in normal cases, some scholars said that this is permissible due to necessity. In your case, as long as the whole concept of medical insurance or medical health, that is medical health, is free. And some people tell me people from the US go to Canada to avail from such services. Only the dental services are costly or you may need to pay money. This is once in a blue moon. And it's not called for or a necessity that requires you to opt for a medical insurance. And hence, I would say that this is not permissible."
