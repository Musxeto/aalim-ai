  "transcript": "Thuraya from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Sheikh I'm an OCD patient. For a few days I'm suffering from sudden whispers. Whenever I apply oil or lotion on my body, I have whispers due to masturbation. As I have read in Google that rubbing body parts is masturbation. What can I do? Do you apply this oil and cream to your body or to your private part? In my body. This has nothing to do with masturbation. Then what you've read is wrong, and this shows you how ignorant Muslims can be when they take and learn their knowledge from the internet. Do not Google things when it's related to Islam. Ask your imam, your scholar, your students of knowledge about the rulings. Don't ask Google. Masturbation is simulating and doing something to one's private part in order to have desire and a feeling of sensation that may lead to ejaculation. If someone rubs his hand, his arm, his shoulders, there's nothing wrong in that, none whatsoever."
