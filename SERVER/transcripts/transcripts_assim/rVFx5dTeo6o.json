  "transcript": "Our fourth question of [Questioner] says, \nIf I put on my socks in the state of Wudu,   and also put on my shoes, and later wipe over \nthe shoes, if I take off the shoes, can I then   wipe over the socks? Or is this not possible? \nBecause I initially wiped over the shoes, meaning,   is wiping only possible over the shoes, so we \nknow that in Islam when you perform ablution,   you wash your feet at the end of your ablution. \nWe have a concession where if you perform a full   Wudu, you wash your feet, and then you put on \nyour socks or your shoes in the state of Wudhu.   You have the concession to, whenever \nyou want to perform ablution again,   after answering the call of nature, after waking \nup from sleeping, etc. That instead of taking   off your shoes or your socks, to wash them in \nthis second Wudhu, you can simply wipe over it,   providing that you had them on after washing \nyour feet in a Wudhu, in an ablution, and you   did not take them off since. Secondly, that the \nshoes, or the shoe itself, cover the whole foot,   which you're obliged to wash. So if it is a short \ntype of socks that goes below the ankles, and you   can see the ankles, then this does not work. \nIt has to cover the whole foot and the ankles.   The brother [Questioner] is asking about \nwiping over the shoes. So I did the Wudhu,   washed my feet, wore my socks, and then put \non my shoes. I'm presuming that the shoes   have a high neck, which means that they do \ncover the ankles. So my whole foot is covered.   Can I wipe over them? No \nproblem. You can wipe over them.   So I prayed Zhuhr, by wiping, I prayed Asr, \nby wiping. Then I answered the call of nature,   I went home, I took off my shoes, but I had my \nsocks on. When I come to offer Wudhu, or ablution   for Maghreb, can I wipe over my socks because \nI did not take them since Fajr. When I made the   original Wudhu, where I washed my feet. So can \nI wipe over my socks? The answer is no. Why?   Because what you had wiped on were the shoes. And \nbecause you took off the shoes, the concession   of wiping has ended. And you need to perform a \nnew Wudhu with washing the feet. Not that your   Wudhu has broken by taking off the shoes. No. \nYou can still pray. If your Wudhu is intact, you can still pray Maghreb, Isha, ect. But if you broke your Wudhu and you took your shoes off, you cannot wipe over the socks. You have to take the socks off and wash your feet. And I hope this answers your question."
