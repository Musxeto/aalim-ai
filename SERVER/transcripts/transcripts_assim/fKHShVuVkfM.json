  "transcript": "uh Shake I tried calling you on the number that you had given uh but I do not get any response from that number so I would like to know is there an issue with that yeah for example if they've confiscated my number or if I was so poor I did not pay the bills or what no the number is still the same number I when I'm on uh my counseling sessions I put it on do not disturb this is why you get busy tone and alhamdulillah I'm on my counseling sessions most of the time so if you do this you have to wait maybe at the times of M and prayer where I go to pray and come back then there will be like a margin of 15 minutes you give it a try then or in the morning time and you have to be persistent you have to try over and over again but at the end of the day the number is the same I have only one number"
