  "transcript": "Omar from Germany I heard in some of your videos that uh many people calls and ask you about marriage and lot of them don't know where to find the spous so Sheik we know and you know better and Allah knows best that you are very busy at all all the day but would you be interested in creating your own app about this is a very uh intriguing and interesting question because in my counseling sessions I meet hundreds and hundreds of boys and girls who are looking to get married if I had the brains and the time I know that I would do an extremely excellent job in matchmaking with the grace of Allah because I have in a way way a gift from Allah to understanding people and knowing their personality that's Allah's gift alhamdulillah in addition to experience but the problem is that I don't have the time nor the brains and so many come to me and matchmaking is a responsibility it's not just oh okay this one is good for you y no this is a life that you are tying together which would would make it or break it so you need to do your due diligence and to make your checkups and uh uh make sure that all the boxes are checked and before you give the final verdict I cannot engage in something unless I am certain that I can excel in it or do a good job that's why I don't go on Shar board for companies that want my name only without being involved in the work because I just don't sign on what you say I have to see it myself and make sure because people trust me so if I say that this person is good then my neck is on the line if I say this company is good my neck is on the line I have to put my name there so likewise I can't put my name on an a matrimonial app without looking into the CV and whether they match and meet them and talk to them and I have enough on my plate unfortunately"
