  "title": "Made a Mistake in Prayer, Sujood As Sahu Behind an Imam",
  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Noorman, yes, Wa'alaykumussalam. Sheikh, I have a question that someone in the prayer, he make a mistake, but he is praying behind Imam, but he does not know how to do Sujood-ul-Sahoo. So he continues because he says that if I start from the, I do Assalamu Alaikum, Assalamu Alaikum, and start from the beginning, the people will say this is like a wassalaam. Okay, Akhi Noorman, if a person makes a mistake during prayer, and this mistake is not related to pillars, like neglecting a Raka'ah or not reciting the Fatiha or forgetting a Sujood, in this case the Imam takes over, so you don't have to perform any Sujood-ul-Sahoo, and your prayer is valid. And have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it Insha'Allah within the following two days or three days, and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
