  "transcript": "muhammad from the u.s says the masjid next to our home they prayed the jumu'ah twice they prayed twice we've mentioned before that the scholars say that it is not permissible to perform friday twice in the same machine and this is the vast majority of muslims and this is what the major council of scholars in saudi arabia give the fatwa upon so you should only pray with the first jamaa as for the eid it should take the same ruling and if not there is a lot of space for people to attend they can pray outside and it won't take more than five to ten minutes and allah knows best"
