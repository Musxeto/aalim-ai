  "transcript": "he's saying that his brother lives in Germany and around him there are only shower messages so can he pray there that says no you cannot pray in Shia iMessage generally speaking because the majority of the Shia in these areas or if not Sharia they are the descendants from Iran etc who slander mother Aisha and curse every prayer Abu Bakr Umar Uthman and the rest of the Companions so definitely you cannot pray in such messages or behind them the issue is is it possible that there are no cinemas  I do not believe this in Germany I do not believe that there are no Sunni Masjid there are thousands of Turkish messages Hanafy masjids there are part of the hallucinogen I prayed there myself in many of the areas whether in Dusseldorf or in Frankfurt or elsewhere so there are Islamic mesogens messages and centres according to the whole Sunnah wal Jamaa if you look you will find second of all hypothetically assuming that there are no sunni masjid tell your brother to feel proud of his religion get in touch with the muslim community he knows who are sunnis and let them establish prayer five times a day wherever they can in a house in a warehouse in a basement of a building so that they maintain their Islamic unity and can have a community but when they're on their own this is when Shaitaan gets the best of them and the Prophet said RA salatu salam that whenever three travel they must appoint one of them one of them one of these three to be their leader their Imam so that they would have a point of reference whenever there is a dispute or wherever they need consultation but everyone living on his own not knowing the other Muslim community going to his job from 9:00 to 5:00 all what he cares about is when am I going to buy the 50 inch LCD in my new home the new stereo the new car pay my mortgage or what you think of is this world this is problematic"
