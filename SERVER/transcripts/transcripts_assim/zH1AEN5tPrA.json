  "title": "Reward for praying the whole night if you pray Witr with the Imam, what if you miss a rakat or two?",
  "transcript": "Is Dayan from the UAE? So I actually wanted to ask regarding the reward of praying the whole night if you pray the Isha prayer with the Tarawih, is it okay if you like miss one or two rakah if the Sheikh starts a bit too early? The Hadith is crystal clear, whoever prays with the Imam until he's finished Allah would register to him as if he had prayed the whole night. So if you missed a rakah or more with your Imam unfortunately you don't fall under this Hadith. So you will be rewarded but not as if you have prayed the whole night. So the advice is that you go back home afterwards and you pray as much as you can and Inshallah Allah will reward you for that. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it that's good for you. If you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it Insha'Allah within the following two days or three days and I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all."
