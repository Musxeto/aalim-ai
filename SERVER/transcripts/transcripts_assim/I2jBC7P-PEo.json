  "transcript": "Emma from the Emirates Emma Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh, can you hear me? Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Yes, I can. Alhamdulillah. Sheikh, I am told to get a job so I can earn money and live on my own. My parents want me to pursue a worldly education, but I know it will be a waste of their money because I don't wish to work professionally, especially outside the home. I am prohibited from attending the masajids to seek Islamic knowledge. My parents do not want to provide or spend on me, so they want me to start paying them or leave the home soon. So what is most pleasing to Allah subhana wa ta'ala? This is dependent on your situation. If they're just bluffing and they will not kick you out of the home, you don't have to do anything. Stay home. But if you know that they're crazy and they don't have any shame when they ask their daughter to learn and work and earn, and they have no problem in kicking her out of the home, you have to start looking for plan B. Plan A is to listen to them and go to school and do your education while abiding by the hijab and utilizing your time staying away from this toxic environment, meeting other people and maybe get married ASAP. Plan B is to start earning so that you would leave them and find a good spouse and maybe live in an environment with other relatives or other Muslims who would enable you to worship Allah azza wa jal freely. But again, I can't say what's best for you in such circumstances because I don't know what's your parents' point of view. I don't know whether you're telling the truth fully or hiding few facts here and there. And Allah knows best."
