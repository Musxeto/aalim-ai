  "transcript": "a man from australia she says that her husband said something so basically speaking lots of the women do this they keep on nagging their husbands you're not a man you can't divorce me you do this and the guy is you know building up pressure he's not responding and after six or seven hours of nagging and banging the doors and throwing things over insulting him and cursing his parents and his loved ones he says okay i divorce you she breaks down and cry after all these years you divorce me damn if you do damn if you don't you've been nagging for the past 10 hours to divorce you now when i divorce you you cry this is how women are made and i'll wait for your hate mails accusing me of being a male chauvinist pig no problem but unfortunately this is how women react you keep on pushing you saying you want to divorce me don't you this is what you want you always wanted to divorce me you never loved me before at this end of the day he says yes ah you've divorced me how dare you i didn't divorce i didn't intend to so she sends him a message so she's opening a can of worms and then she's asking this is not how it works if he divorced you he goes to the islamic center and talks to the imam or to the muslim court and talks to the judge or to someone who would give him a fatwa after listening from him and acquiring the proper knowledge from him not from the woman ever because she's not in a position to state whether the divorce took place or not it's the man who asks you"
