  "title": "My husband says he can be mahram to his paternal & maternal uncles wives, is it true Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my husband is saying that he can be maharam of his maternal and paternal uncle's wives i just no no you don't need to to continue asking her husband is uh sorry i just got another call her husband is either delusional or ignorant imbecile or following his desires and whims his uncle's wife whether paternal or maternal uncle are none the moment his uncle divorces her or dies and and she's a widow he can marry her immediately as a second wife so definitely this is not permissible at all and no muslim with a glimpse of knowledge would ever say such a thing"
