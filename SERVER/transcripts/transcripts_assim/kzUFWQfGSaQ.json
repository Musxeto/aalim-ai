  "title": "Segregation in Restaurants to Prevent Dating & Free Mixing? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Adi Kunal from Nigeria Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh My question is, if one wants to open a restaurant that would abide by the Islamic rulings, is it important for one to say, okay, this restaurant, this section is for males only or for females only? Or how would one, you know, walk around things like that so that people don't use restaurants as a joint for maybe dating and so on? Jazakum Allah Khairan Wajazakum Would you be fine if you're walking with your wife and you enter a shop or a restaurant and someone asks you for proof that she's your wife or your sister or your aunt? The answer is no. And therefore, your job is to serve food. And the default is that people are entrusted for their religious commitment. If a person comes with a lady, we're not obliged to ask whether she's a mahram or a wife of his or not. And this is between him and Allah Azza Wa Jal. Now, if you can provide a special place for women to dine in so that they could have their privacy, that would be fine. But this is not mandatory for you as this is not something that is mandated neither by Islam nor by law. And so is it's not mandatory for you to go and check whether this woman is a mahram of his or not. And Allah Azza Wa Jal knows best."
