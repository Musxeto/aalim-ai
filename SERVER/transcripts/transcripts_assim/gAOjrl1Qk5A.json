  "transcript": "snarl mando Fahim al hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik island Marussia rahmatan lil economy Navi Ana Muhammadan voila le he wa sahbihi ajma'in a man our dear brothers sisters in islam assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh and welcome to this new episode of women around the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam our guest for tonight is a woman unlike other women a mother of the believers who is someone to stand on her own a companion that is known for things that other companions did not have a wife of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam whom allah azza wajal sent his ark angel jibreel peace be upon him to rule something of her destiny something that was ascension in her life gibreel who does not come down to earth except for mega things and important things came for this important issue and that is that the prophet alice of salam revokes her divorce reconciles with her for a reason that we will come to discuss later on Isha Allah she is our mother half sir may Allah be pleased with her her father is Roman and hubbub the second caliph and the second closest companion to the prophet alayhi salatu salam her mother is zeyneb bent mother owned Hafsa was born five years before the prophet alice of salaam was revealed to which means that when she migrated to Medina she was 18 years of age and she is the eldest of all modern hot pops children may Allah be pleased with him which indicates the falsehood of the story that so many people talk about when Roma allegedly said may Allah be pleased with him that he once buried one of his daughters alive and while burying her alive she was cleaning his beard from the dust that was coming from that grave and he used to cry whenever he remembers it having half son is a clear evidence that such a story is false and not befitting of someone such as Omar may Allah be pleased with him and hafsa was older than the other son of Rome are the great companion of Allah Abdullah Huebner Omar the great narrator the great scholar what we are to talk about women around the Prophet is awesome and not his companions Hafsah was very young when she got married to horn a signal whatever may Allah be pleased with them they both a accepted Islam together ranae's went to Abyssinia in the first migration and he was with earth madam na fan and the daughter of the prophet Alison rakia and there were about 12 men and four women then he came back with those who came back from Abyssinian then he took his wife and they both migrated to Medina so hafsa was among the first to migrate to Medina who dies may Allah be pleased with him was one of the great companions of the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam he fought by the side of the prophet alayhi salat wa sallam during the battle of better only to suffer serious injuries which led to his death and he became one of the martyrs of the Battle of Badr of course being a 20 year old young woman widowed at such an early age this brought a lot of sadness to her heart and no one can blame her for that this is only human romanovna pop her father whenever he saw her in such a state his heart was broken so he did what any wise man would do he started looking for a potential suitor for his daughter now being in his shoes one would feel proud how do I go around and look for a spouse for my own daughter they should come and this is partly true but here we have to weigh the pros and cons would you want to wait for 10 20 years without getting any proposals for your daughter and watching her become older and older just because of your pride Omar may Allah be pleased with him had the the the interests he has he had the interest of his daughter coming first so he went to earth man and earth man was recently widowed as well his wife ro aya had died while the Prophet Isis I'm was at the Battle of Badr and it would be more than logical to look for another wife so he approached her 'the man and said earth man how about marrying my daughter have some sort man told him give me a couple of days I need to think about it and few days later he said with a kind apology that I'm not interested in getting married I'm still mourning my beloved wife and this is a different issue it was a true love story known to all of Quraysh the marriage of earth man and the daughter of the prophetess and rakia may allah be pleased with them they were the most handsome and beautiful couple but this is Allah's destiny Allah willed it that she dies so he was depressed and he did not feel like getting married at that moment did the Omer give up nope he went to Abu Bakr now Abu Bakr was at the time about 51 years of age so he was much older than Earth man and he's older than Rama himself yet a father looks for a real man that can protect his daughter what do I as a father look for a rich person no someone with influence know someone who is an athlete no I look for all of this if possible I look for a real man who can be my daughter's Rock she can depend on him he can respect her love her and have mercy on her so Homer went to the second candidate that he thinks that would be best for his daughter he went to Abu Bakr and Abu Bakr was his best friend and he was the best friend of the Prophet I saw some at the same time so he went to his best friend and said to him a Booker what do you think of marrying hafsa would you consider that and to his shock abu bakar may allah be pleased with him did not even apologize did not even reply to him he just left him and went Omar may Allah be pleased with him said that I felt stabbed betrayed I felt so hurt more than what I felt with earth man because of man at least apologized and this is demand and supply I don't have any ill feeling towards the earth man if I proposed to you that doesn't mean that you have to accept my proposal its demand and supply but with Abu Bakr it was a different story Abu Bakr did not even reply to me few days later the prophet alayhi salatu salam proposed to omar so that he would marry Hafsah and of course Omar was more than happy to give his daughter to the prophet alayhi salaatu so who can be better than the prophet aerosol of Salaam then he met Abu Bakr so Abu Bakr started saying to him Omar did you feel bad towards me not replying to you Omar did not hold back he said yes by Allah I felt hurt then Abu Bakr explained to him what he could not understand at that time Abu Bakr said Oh Omar o my brother o my dear friend I heard the prophet alayhi salatu salam few days ago mentioning hafsa now remember Abu Bakr's daughter is married to the Prophet Alyce salatu salam aisha is married to the Prophet yet the Prophet was mentioning getting married to have saw in front of coat uncaught his father-in-law and that was normal to Abu Bakr because they know that marrying more than one wife when you're fair and just and when you are a real true man that this is your right there is nothing wrong in that so Abu Bakr said to Omar Omar I heard the Prophet as I'm mentioning hafsa and his interest in marrying her and then you proposed to me and by Allah I would not have disclosed the secret of the Prophet as a sinner how can I tell you that the Prophet has mentioned her how can I even say such a thing or apologize from such a thing without exposing what the Prophet Elias awesome has entrusted me with therefore when the Prophet Ali Saleh salam proposed now i'm telling you what had happened by allah if the prophet elisha rasoolum did not propose i would have accepted her to myself she's a good woman and you're a good friend and what can be better than us being bond by such marriage and subhanAllah the Prophet again married someone who was a widow was in need and married her to strengthen the bond between him and his companions so he married the daughter of Abu Bakr he married the daughter of Umar the second caliph he gave two of his daughters as we will come and see insha'Allah to earth man the third caliph and he gave his own daughter Fatima to the fourth caliph which was I leave now with Allah may Allah be pleased with them all all these marriages have a reason and a purpose marriage is not done just because she's beautiful or just because I have the money to get married again and again marriage is done for a purpose for a wisdom to have more in-laws which strengthens your position in the society and allows you to do good things and transmit these good things through your in-laws to know people to know the community you live in the prophet alayhi salat WA Salam married Hafsah after butter and some say he married her on the third year of hijra which is the year of the Battle of a hood now this is truly a magnificent lesson for us fathers if you have a daughter and she's in need of marriage but there's no one proposing there's nothing wrong in going and looking for a good proposal for her and it is extremely important to lower your bar many girls stay without marriage when she was 18 a man proposed who was 28 she said 10 years difference he's too old I want someone close to my age so she reached 23 and the one proposing now is 35 said no no no this is too much I don't want to get married and rejected so many proposals now she's 28 or 30 years of age all those who come are either widowed with children or wanting a second or a third wife or someone who's over 60 and looking for a nurse to take care of him don't raise the bar too much unless you are Miss Universe but if you are a normal person marriage is not about the looks marriage is not about the ability to go to Marbella or to go to code Azul every summer for a month vacation marriage is about respect about love about affection about protection even if he is poor even if he's not that handsome what counts is the life in the house the marriage itself unfortunately we were brainwashed all over the past years with movies TV series soap operas so our perception of life has different women may fight not to become a second wife they would rather stay unmarried rather than marrying someone who was divorced or has a wife or has children then what end up biting their hands and wishing they had accepted that it's too late so we have to be realistic and we have to weigh things according to their reality Hafsa was a knowledgeable woman among all the companions the female companions she was among the very very few who knew how to read and write and this is this was really rare among the women of Arabia at that time and she used to be involved in poetry and literature and whenever she spoke her words were few but profound deep throughout the years she lived in the prophet's house had a salat wa salam and she lived for eight years only she learned a lot from the prophet Isaiah saw - Salam and she conveyed to us how he lived his journey generosity the way he treated her she learned from the prophet alayhi salatu salam so many things that she told us that the Prophet used too fast the first three days of every month Monday Thursday and a Monday from the second week and she used to say that whenever the Prophet used to sleep he used to put his cheek on his right hand and say our ability NYADA Bakke Amitabha Authority baddack oh Allah protect me from your torment when you resurrect your servants she narrated more than 60 hadith and these are found in the sahi and also in the sunan and she conveyed to the Muslim Ummah a lot of great knowledge that all of us are benefiting from till date may Allah be pleased with her now mother aisha was known for her jealousy and so was mother Hafsah and so was mother Zeynep what is this when you married to one man all of them fight to be his favorite and to gain his love and attention more than the others and this is human nature this is natural that women become jealous and this is how allah azza wajal created them modern aisha told us that the wives of the Prophet Isis Sam were divided into two parties one party led by Aisha which included Hafsa soda Sophia and another party led by umm Salama which had Zeynep bent Josh on habiba etc so you can imagine the plotting the hidden diplomacy the strategies that these righteous pious practicing mothers of ours used to do and how the prophet alayhi salatu salam used to live amidst all of this it wasn't an easy right and the Prophet suffered Ali his salat WA Salam and he suffered willingly because he knows that this is the nature of women and we know that they had done so many things that we nowadays would not ever accept but the Prophet is awesome accepted it calmed the people and he said your mother have become jealous don't worry yes she broke the dish yes she made the food spread all over the floor it was her jealousy don't worry about that now for one reason or the other the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam divorced Hafsa and that was a huge shock to her father the close friend of the Prophet Isis Salam to her family Adam and Ruth man given him of her own her maternal uncles and to herself of course the prophets divorce irresolute Salam for Hafsah was not due to hatred he but it was to reprimand her for something we don't have knowledge of speculations are there maybe because she spread the secret that the Prophet told her is awesome not to tell anyone maybe it was because this it was because that this is none of our business but we have to acknowledge that it took place now due to who have saw was may Allah be pleased with her Allah sent down his arc angel jibreel peace be upon him and he told the Prophet are yourself Salam o Muhammad revoked the divorce and reconciled with Hafsa get her back as your wife for she is a woman that fasts all the time and prays night prayer every night and she is your wife in paradise full stop the directive came to the Prophet immediately I saw some complied look at the description for in the house of our Merton Kalama she is a woman who frequently fasts and frequently praised night prayer these attributes make her a gem that should be preserved so regardless of the reason that you had divorced her for get her back and the Prophet I assume complied with that command immediately and got her back now in this we can also learn that divorce can happen even among the pious even even among the righteous in practicing this is not something that is prohibited it is not something that the layman say often that the throne of allah azza wajal is shaken for divorce in that it is the worst halal thing to Allah this is not true sometimes divorce is mandatory if you don't do it your sinful depending on the scenario sometimes it's recommended sometimes it's permissible sometimes it's not recommended smack ooh and sometimes it's totally prohibited a wise man was contemplating on divorcing his wife so a man came to him and said why are you contemplating on divorcing your wife so he said Subhan Allah a gentleman is not asked about such things a gentleman does not tell how do you want me to expose my wife's shortcomings to you and after a few months or years after he divorced her the same man came to him and said why did you divorce your wife so the wise man said looking at him and this is none of my business she's someone's else wife now why would I tell you so concealing the secrets is very important and hence we don't know why he divorced her for but we know that divorce is something that is mentioned in the Quran Allah Azza made a whole surah a chapter by the title of divorce and the rules are mentioned in Surat al-baqarah and elsewhere to tell you that this is something which is part of religion such as marriage such as reconcile reconciliation after divorce now one of her greatest attributes that she was chosen to keep the copy the first copy of the Quran collected as we know at the time of abu bakr may allah be pleased with him a lot of those who memorize the quran were martyred in on the battlefield so it was suggested that they collect the quran and put it in one master copy so that they can go to it whenever there is any fear of error so that the Koran would be preserved Allah pledged to preserve it so they appointed Zaidan if Abbot may Allah be pleased with him and he started the mission of collecting the Quran and putting it in sewers I after I as they have all memorized all of them memorize the Quran so they just wanted to collect the written portions of it in a book as Allah described it in the Quran that it is a book and then one once it was completed they kept this copy with a mother hafsa may Allah be pleased with her and it stayed with her until the time of birth man even though I found me Allah be pleased with him when he made four copies from that master copy also appointing the mission Tuesday to inhabit may Allah be pleased with them all and she lived her life after the death of the Prophet al-islam worshipping Allah reviving her night with night prayer reciting the Quran revising a teaching knowledge to those who come and seek it until she died in 41 after the year for for a first after the Hegira and some say she died on the 45th of Hejira may allah azza wajal be pleased with her and may Allah Azza WA JAL make her and all of our mothers with the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam pleased with them and may Allah Azza WA JAL give our women a role model to follow like what they had lived and did Heather Allahu Alem when especially ill merely Aslam sallallahu sallim wa barik ala nabina muhammad why Ali he was happy humane [Music] assalamu alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatu today I'm gonna talk about the book interactions of the greatest leader Abu Huraira radi aallahu anhu said that a man came to the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam and said o Messenger of Allah poverty has struck me the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam sent a messenger to one of his wives to bring something for that man to eat but she said by the one who sent you with the truth I only have water he said allah alayhi wasallam sent to another one of his wives to bring something for the man to eat but she said the same until all of them said the same thing then Allah is missing just sallallahu alayhi wasallam said who will take this one as a guest in exchange for a loss mercy a man from the Unser said I will o Messenger of Allah so he took the man to his home and said to his wife treat the guest of messenger of allah well she said by allah we have nothing except the meal for my children he said get the food ready and light the lamp and put your children to sleep if they ask for dinner then when the guest enters dim the lamp and make it seem as if we are eating and when he reaches for the food to eat then stand up to the lantern and turn it off she got the food ready turned the lamp on and put the children to sleep she then went to the lamp as if she was fixing it and turned it off then they pretended as they were eating and they both went to sleep hungry in the morning the man from the on saw in to Allah as messenger sallallahu alayhi wa sallam who said Allah has loft implying his acceptance to the deed from your actions last night then Allah revealed his saying which means and they give them preference over themselves even though they were in need of that reported by al-bukhari and Muslim Salam aleikum welcome to LA and welcome back we have one question from brother Bilal and Bilal says we came across many audios and videos about Sharia celestial object or star which people are saying that it will appear in the second week of May and covered 19 will go away there is a reference also in Muslim am I met our question is how should we how should we understand all of this will the appearance of this star remove illness and pandemic though we don't believe in stars well Allah Azza WA JAL mentioned that the stars are signs in the heavens to know your directions through and also the stars are known to be signs of time so we know the seasons that they come when they appear or disappear and the hadith Bilal is referring to a lot of the people had made audios and videos about it and it speaks about the uplifting of any defect of any pandemic but it is referring to such defects in fruits so by the end of winter and the beginning of month which is made of May almost this shows that it is about summertime and most likely the fruits would blossom and it would not have any defect because the time of defect usually is during winter or a bit into spring so the hadith is referring to time that when the season changes then most likely the defects of fruits will not appear and hence you can sell it but some scholars or some people cascaded this to all pandemics and this is totally wrong this is not correct because pandemics have nothing to do with a star or a planet appearing or disappearing the prophet once alayhi salat wa sallam prayed fetcher with his congregation after a rainy night and a man and after that the prayer was over the Prophet Ali Saleh Sam said to the congregation allah azza wajal revealed to me that tonight this morning some of my servants has believed in me and disbelieved in the signs or the stars and some has have believed in the Stars and disbelieved in me then the Prophet explained those who said we were rained yesterday the rain fell yesterday because of the star so and so these people believe in the Stars and they disbelieve in me and whoever said that we were or we had the rain fall due to Allah is favor and grace then they believed in me and they disbelieve in the kawaki or in the stars or the whatever it is so this shows you that this hadith is not at all related to carbon 19 we're hopeful that allah azza wajal favor and blessing upon us would uplift it even before that and Allah knows best Nia's from Saudi Absalom alaikum her she said avocado like Allah see what can I do for you yes sir first question is we have some money saved money for to purchase the house is Licata pickable on this amount second question can we give interest amount which aired September to our close relatives okay I would answer barik alaa fee Nia's from Saudi Arabia says ok we have dual dhul Jalal will Jalil from Sudan how are you if the name is what Abdul Jalil a billionaire from Sudan is publisher yes sir this Avenue I am glad to join you on your program of course it is a very useful and enjoyable that Allah says it is our duty as Muslim to propagate islam in english and young people we use also facebook and also to call other people who non-muslim to Islam in English this is good service my my bad station is that here in young people and Lomb we are always affected by famous people like the layers in in europe and other figures but unfortunately we do not we are not affected by our Islamic leaders like holiday literally like Reina Quran and obvious this is one and the second things you say that about the religion behind behind marriages as a single why we we probably not propose marriage to our Hill and why we do not concentrate on thank you very much Julia I didn't get your second question about marriages money only on money okay okay okay the example of our college inshallah there callejero Baraka laughing so Nia's question was about saving money to buy a house if the money reached a threshold and which definitely for buying a house it must have reached and exceeded that and it stayed with you for a whole lunar year whether it is for marriage buying a house paying off debts doing anything with it you have to give 2.5 percent as the cut if you want to not give the cut before the lunar year is complete 11 months and 25 days go and buy the house but as long as it's kept with you for one lunar year you have to give the cut for that now the second question is interest money that people get especially in India where they don't have any lamech banks and they're compelled to take interest over their savings if your relatives are poor or needy you can give them the cut you can give them this interest money but if they're well off just because they're your relatives doesn't mean that you can give them this money because you're giving it out you're giving it away to cleanse your wealth from Haram money giving it to someone a neighbor or relative or someone who is well-off would not qualify to cleanse your money from that brother abdul jalil from sudan says that unfortunately nowadays the youth are connected more to celebrities whether sport men athletes or entertainers and they don't know anything about our great role models among the companions may allah be pleased with them brother abdul jalil they don't even know about our prophet alayhi salatu salam and if you tell anyone ask anyone when did Roswell hunt duck take place or when did Roswell Tabuk take place they don't know anything about it let alone when it was or when it took place so yes we have a responsibility to teach our children the people in charge of the media they are also responsible for educating the masses and hamdulillah in Zaid TV in hooda TV in peace TV we are trying to do that and to enlighten people about their heritage and history in that Academy they teach serie in four levels and I was blessed with the grace of Allah to teach all four levels four semesters of the sila of the Shamal so we have to encourage our students our children to enroll in such academies and such classes especially when they are free and it would occupy the time with something that is beneficial insha Allah Muhammad Muhammad says just for memorization purposes can I write Quran in my personal notebook in my own language now this is a bit tricky Muhammad if you mean that you want to write Quran in your own language to transliterate so instead of saying al-hamdu in Arabic Alif LAAM Meem that you say I'll hum do in English letters this is totally prohibited the scholars even said that writing the Quran in the must have other than the earth mannix script is prohibited because it is mandatory for us to preserve and protect the Quran and writing it in Arabic with a different script may introduce some mistakes in pronunciation and reading so it has to be preserved as it was written centuries ago so definitely writing the Quran in different languages in letters of different languages would distort the Quran now the English transliteration of the Quran is definitely not the Quran because so many letters they're not found in English so how would you pronounce the PHA they only have the tongue the tea bod rain all of these are Arabic letters that are not found in English alphabet so this is not permissible for you to write in your personal notebook in your own language you can try to learn Arabic as much as possible and Allah knows best Sarah says can my parents-in-law take the gold back they gave me on our wedding is it not my gold what is the ruling on gold gifts given to me by his family members such as his aunties grandmother on our wedding my parents in law do not want to give me my gold even to keep wood I still have to pay zakat on it if they keep the cat if they keep the gold you're gold with them and prevent you from acquiring it possessing it or doing whatever you want with it there's no zakat on you however I am uphold I am totally shocked with what is coming to me through emails and phone calls from sisters not mainly from the subcontinent we're her parents-in-law in association with her husband sees her own gold given to her by her parents sees her own dowry given to her by her husband and they seize the gold that they gave her on the wedding nights and all the gifts that were given to her and they lock it in their own room and they only permit her to take a necklace or some bracelets here and there when she has a wedding or the likes and they don't give her access to her own gold and some of the brothers call me and say that is this okay we're safe keeping it blah blah blah I say to them you there is the husband and your parents are crooks you are thieves you have to be ashamed of yourself how dare you take someone's money without his permission and keeping it and preventing them from doing whatever they want sure you might sell it she might do something wrong with it it's none of your business it is her gold she decides to give it all to her father this is her gold she decides to give it in charity to build a message it's none of your business you are thieves and crooks sure we gave her the gold on the wedding night as an investment so that we can utilize it later on for our granddaughters etc this is a big lie you know that I know that you gave her the gold as a gift but now you're keeping it with you the Prophet described you ali has taught Islam beautifully do you know what he said he said whoever gives a gift and retracts it takes it back he has the Cemil tooth he has the example of a dog vomiting then the dog comes and eats its vomit this is your example given by the Prophet Isis Salam how dare you give the gift and take it back or claim that no it wasn't a gift we're just lending her the money or lending her the gold how dare you take her dowdy and prevent her from using it or utilizing it as she wishes well I I feel sorry for such wives living among such crooks thieves who don't have shame in their face and then if you look at their daughter when they get their daughter married they tell her don't give your parents-in-law your gold keep it with us so subhanAllah it's hell are for their daughter and Haram for their in-laws daughter-in-law this is shocking this is genius and I I feel great resent to such people who claim to follow the Quran the Sunnah if they are from deviant sects if they don't believe in the Quran and the Sunnah this is maybe excusable because they have committed so many innovations and bida and they have problems in toe heat that this would be trivial but for people who claim to be Salafis or to claim to follow the Quran the Sunnah and they do such heinous things well la hey I don't know how to explain this so may allah azzawajal grant you the patience and may Allah restore your right to you you can as any oppressed make duaa against them this is the only thing you can do you can make duaa that Allah Azza WA JAL avenges you from such people who had taken your property unlawfully a sister says can parents and especially mothers beat their children if they do not obey is it permissible to hit them there is a difference between reprimanding and torturing if you hit your child to reprimand once every blue moon without leaving skaars without breaking a bone or shedding blood without physically harming him this is totally permissible are in our religion we're supposed to hit and beat children when they're 10 for not praying and this is not to express our anger or to vent no this is not to abuse or to or torture rather it is to reprimand junaid says can we keep the model of kaaba at home and is it permissible to hang it or use the combat design as a wallpaper wallpaper is something that was disliked and some scholars even prohibited because they considered that covering the walls with cloth would imitate the Kaaba but it is most likely not Haram but it is not recommended having a structure of the Kaaba in the house a lot of the scholars said that this is not permissible because it can be disrespected humilated and maybe someone would think of it as they do in some schools they build a structure similar to the Kaaba and they make Tawaf to train the people how to do ambra which is also not permissible and Allah knows best Irfan says what what must we recite during prostration of recitation prostration of forgetfulness and prostration of gratitude all of these prostrations the default is you have to say subhanAllah BL Allah minimum once you can add as many as you want and there are other voluntary as car which you can recite but they're not mandatory so the default is subhana rabbi Allah like what you do regularly in your salat you can check in your fortress of the Muslim and you'll find that insha'Allah Abdullah says I heard the hadith that we must not wipe our faces after wood because every drop that falls indicates that a sin is forgiven is that true the answer is no this is not true at all the shew of washing your face and your arms and the sins fall with the last drop that comes out from your face from your beard from your arms this is authentic but it doesn't say that if I wipe these organs that the sins will not go away no there's a hadith where the Prophet Isis unperformed little and one of the mothers of the believers came to him with a towel so he did this he rejected it this is one single hadith some scholar said that ah this is because it's best to have it dry by itself but there is no indication in the idea - none whatsoever it could have been that the Prophet was hot he didn't want to dry it he wanted to cool down it could have been that the towel given to him had something that repelled him and he did not feel good about it there can be a number of reasons but there is nothing at all wrong in wiping and drying your limbs after performing Moodle and the Lazo gel knows best this is all the time we have until we meet tomorrow same time I leave you free Manila was salam o alikum warahmatu allahi wa barakato"
