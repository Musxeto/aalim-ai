  "title": "Tolerating calamities: You can be one of two assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Then you will be rewarded, but the calamity will remain. And if you don't tolerate it, you will be sinful and the calamity will be the same. A man loses his son. He's one of two. Either he's going to be patient or not. Those who are patient would say, Inna lillah wa inna ilayhi raji'oon. Allahumma ajirni fi musibati wakhlufni khairan minha. And he's content. Oh Akhi, you lost your son. Alhamdulillah. Aren't you sad? Wallahi I am sad and I'm weeping, but I'm content. Allah chose the best for him. And Alhamdulillah he did not make many sins. So Inshallah he will await for me in Jannah and Allah will substitute me with something better. And this is Allah's decree and ordainment. So I'm happy with that. Is his son going to come back to life? No, but he's rewarded. The other one starts banging his head against the wall, tears his clothes, slaps his face, complains, objects, Why me? Why my son? Why not my neighbors? Why not my friends? What did he do to you? What did I do to you? And he keeps on complaining and objecting for a whole month. What happens after one month? He comes down, he forgets, business as usual. He goes to the gym, he eats, he drinks, he enjoys life as nothing has happened. Is his son coming back to life? No, but he's sinful and he will be punished for his way of behavior."
