  "transcript": "is some people think it's not obligatory to enjoy what is good and forbid what is evil they quote the verse from MAA Surah 5: 105 oh you who believe guard your own Souls if you follow the right guidance no hurt can come to you for those who are in error to support their claim is it the right interpretation or not as far as the interpretation of this verse of the Quran is concerned this verse says that oh you believe no harm will come to you if you follow the right guidance so the criteria of this verse is that you should follow the right guidance and if you read the commentary of this verse right guidance is what right guidance is enjoining what is good and forbiding what is wrong as Allah says in the Quran in Surah Al Imran chapter number three verse number 110 Muslims you are the best of people Evol for mankind enjoining what is good and forbidding what is wrong enjoying what is good and forbidding what is wrong and believing in Allah so if you have to be on the right guidance Allah says you have to enjoy what is good and forbid what is wrong and believe in Allah if you do not enjoin what is good and if you do not forbid what is wrong you're unfit to be called so even according to this verse you have to enjoy what is good and forbid what is wrong and the criteria for any Muslim to go to Jenna are given in Surah Al chapter number 103 verse number 1 to3 which says by the token of time man is really in a state of loss except those who have faith those have righteous deeds those who exalt people to tr and those who exalt people to patience and perseverance for any human being to go to Jenna he requires four things that IM number one righteous Deeds number two number three exalting people to tr and number four exalting people to patience and perseverance if any one of these four is missing you shall not enter Jenna you may be a very good Muslim you may be offering Salah you may have gone for Haj you may be paying zakat but if you don't do dawa if you don't enjoy what is good and forbid what is wrong you will not go to Jenna if Allah wants to forgive you and put you in Jenna that's a different question that's his prerogative as Allah says in N CH 4 48 and Sur CH 4 ver 116 if he wishes he may forgive any sin but the sin of shik he not forgive but in normal circumstances all four things are equally important Iman righteous Deeds exhorting people to truth that is Da and islah and exhorting people to patience and perseverance therefore dawa and islah is one of the criteria for any Muslim for any human being to go to jenah"
