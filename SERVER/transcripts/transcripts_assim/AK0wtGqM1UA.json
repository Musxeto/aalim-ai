  "transcript": "Before the test day and why is Allah testing us? First of all we have to know that tests are inevitable. Every single person on earth is being tested and this is a well universal fact but these tests vary. Allah may test us to erase the many sins we have and we have a backlog. We have plenty of sins or Allah may love us and test us to elevate our levels in Jannah. So instead of being in the first floor Allah puts us in the penthouse. May Allah make you and I among those who are in the penthouse. Allah says in the Quran and whatever of misfortune befalls you it is because of what your hands have earned and He pardons a lot. And the Prophet said Alayhis Salatu Wassalam no misfortune or disease befalls a Muslim. No worry or grief or harm or distress not even a thorn that pricks him but Allah will expiate for some of his sins because of that. Anything that befalls upon you what do you say? I'm not hearing. Or Alhamdulillah first of all. This is true but everything that befalls upon you you say Alhamdulillah there is good in it that I may not see."
