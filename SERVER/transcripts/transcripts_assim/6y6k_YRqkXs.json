  "transcript": "and logical comment that he noticed he noticed that a lot of the worshippers in Haram take Snapchats and selfies and videos of them doing om maybe commenting maybe uh uh um taking videos of the worshippers going around the Kaaba so he says this is annoying and it is distracting to a lot of us so is this permissible the answer is we cannot say it is prohibited in the sense that taking photography taking photographs is an issue of dispute so if we are inclined to the opinion that says that photo photography is not like drawing uh um living creatures in its Pro prohibition and hence it is permissible for men children to be uh photographed even if we say this but when it comes to exposing yourself and showing off your good deeds this is not permissible in the sense that the OM is For Whom the OM is for Allah the prophet Alat wasam when he set off to Hajj he said Allah this Hajj is for you with no boasting and no showing off this is how it should be your om your ha should be for the sake of Allah look at IM Malik and a number of great imams of the salaf whenever they used to recite the Quran an on their own and someone comes into the room they cover the Quran unlike us we tend to show off so today is Monday and I'm fasting I go and visit my friends at the office and I yawn and I show that I'm tired and when they say you have you'd like some coffee and I said no today Monday what what's wrong with you today's Monday as if it's something obvious that I fast every Monday I'm showing off I'm taking my good deeds and throwing it in the dust bin because Allah does not accept accept what is solely and sincerely for his sake tells us in may Allah have mercy in his soul a very beautiful concise book it's like a things that he he notices and he writes down he says that I went into a Masjid in Al kufa with a friend of mine late at night and I saw a man praying so I said to my friend look how beautiful and calm his prayer is apparently the man heard us so he concluded his prayer in a quick fashion and he came to us and he said if you think my prayer was calm and uh uh nice how would what would you say if you were to know that I've been fasting for the past 20 yearsi says look at this imbecile fool the Deeds of 20 years has been down the drain because he nullified it by exposing his good deeds in such a fashion asking and instructing or uh uh requesting praise from humans where he should have only requested it from Allah therefore taking a selfie some of the brothers even some of the diis go on to show what they're doing and this is the of the Prophet is smiling with this maybe women with him coming from America from Australia and he's snapping that as if it's normal in the Haram and this is totally absurd and not accordance to the Sala who would conceal and keep all of their Good Deeds between them and Allah the almighty and Allah knows best uh"
