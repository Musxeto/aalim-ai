  "title": "Are all the Prophets alive as they prayed together on the night of Meraj? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "sofyan says one of the speakers is saying that all the prophets are alive as they all prayed behind prophet muhammad sallallahoalyhiwasallam on the night of Miraj the night of the ascension to the seventh heaven and he says as prayer is prescribed only for the living now what is meant by this statement of this person or this speaker what is his intention because it's important to analyze what people say and trying to detect their intention so if he simply said that I would agree with him and I would say yes they are alive but and this but is extremely important because their lives are different than ours so ask this speaker is their lives similar to ours at the moment in the sense that we eat we drink and we visit the toilet so those prophets and those who are dead and you say that they are alive in their graves do they eat drink and visit the toilet do they age like we do do they get married and reproduce if he says yes then he may need psychiatric evaluation because we know that they don't and if he says no then we say why is that and he would say most likely because their life is in albariza and we know that we have three stages of lives the life of the dunya which we live in and which we die in there we move after death to the life of the byrsa which is a transitional period between this dunya and the Acheron and then we have the life of the Agora which is eternal without an end and this is where people go to paradise or go to hell may Allah protect us so if he acknowledges that they are alive in Alberta in this case we have no dispute but if his intention which is most likely is that they are alive hence we can call them and they can hear us and they can respond to us and they can benefit us and protect us from harm then this becomes a total different ballgame this is completely and takes a person out of the fold of Islam to believe in such being alive in the graves does not mean that they can respond to us when we call them as we know from the Quran and the Sunnah that we're not allowed to call anyone except allah azza wajal so all those who had died cannot know what we say to them and what we ask of them and they don't know what's happening to us and this is why in the motivated hadith the prophet alayhi salat was said when he mentioned the hadith of the pool on the day of judgment he said that there will come people from my home whom I recognized and they will be sent away and prevented from drinking from the pool and I would say they are my people why are you doing this and I will be answered by you O Muhammad don't know what they've innovated after you which means that you were dead and you did not look at them you did not see what they had innovated in Islam and this means that the Prophet doesn't know how to his salat WA Salam what is happening in our world after he had died so what this speaker had said is correct but it also dependent on his intention most deviant scholars or speakers who say said such a thing they do this to endorse the fact that you can call them and supplicate to them and seek refuge in them which is totally and nullifies a person's Islam"
