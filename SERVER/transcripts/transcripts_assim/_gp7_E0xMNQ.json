  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. There is a latest trend of online business going on, where I buy stuff from China for example, and then I have them imported to USA probably, and I sell them online there without possessing the item itself. Physically? Physically. But you possess it on paper? On paper, yeah, in the internet. No problem. It's okay, yeah? And someone comes and buys it from me, and I sell it to them, and I tell them ship it to XYZ, this is permissible without a problem. Inshallah."
