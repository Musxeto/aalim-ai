  "title": "Did Jews come to the Prophet and ask him to make a tree come out of a Burnt Seed of Date",
  "transcript": "Ammar from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh, I wanted to ask about a Hadith It says that during the time of the Prophet ﷺ A few of the Jews came to him with a date, a seed of the date, which was burnt And asked him to plant, if he was a prophet, to make a tree come out of it If he was a prophet, that's a miracle And the prophet did it, and the tree came out from that burnt date of seed And then they asked him to make a tree come out from the ground without a seed This Hadith has been quoted a lot, and I was not sure of the authenticity of it So I wanted to ask, is there any reference or is there any authenticity to this? JazakAllah Khair No Akhi, this is not authentic at all This is a fabrication, and we do not need such tales and fabrication And made up miracles to prove that the Prophet ﷺ was who he was And that he was a prophet and a messenger So all of this is bogus For more information visit www.fema.org"
