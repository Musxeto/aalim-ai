  "transcript": "sends a question or an objection and she says that I want to learn a sport and have a male teacher because there is no other option right now the problem is I don't know how a woman is to enter a male-dominated field if we can't learn from a man I think women teachers of sports and physical fitness are just as important as female doctors to deny women the education we let certain fields remain male-dominated stopping more women from learning now this objection of Amina is not a very sound objection because Sharia law the Islamic law is crystal clear the boundaries are there and found scholars have placed legal Maxim's or rules that governs the whole of what people need so if someone comes and says that men are dominating certain fields more than women the answer would be in the Quran Allah says in the Quran well they said the caracal antha male is not like a female so this is it period Allah so Jill had pointed out this scientific fact this global fact call it whatever you want but this is a fact men have their own fields women have their own fields now maybe you you will find some males coming in the future and saying that listen women have been dominating the field of pregnancy for so long now we male should move up to the task and maybe get pregnant or whatever is this logical a logic created men and women different and each were appointed with tasks and obligations different than the others so to come and say no I'd like to do what a man does for a woman to say that this is unacceptable now let's look at a male doctor serving females or treating female patients what is the ruling on that in the absence of female doctors this becomes permissible because Islam does not promote killing yourself so you have to get treatment and there's no other alternative except a male doctor in this case he may look at you he may touch you he may do what is necessary to cure your illness with what Allah has given him with knowledge only in that specific or designated area now is a male doctor equivalent in treating females to a coach training a female definitely not is sport something that is essential and if you don't learn it you want to die and you want to compete and enter such fields that are dominated by men you want to learn boxing for example you want to learn MMA is this something that a female would learn or you want to go pro football or soccer or basketball all of this is not the field of a woman it's not a necessity including that it has embedded in it a lot of evil sports for women is okay a woman can play sports a woman can do something to recreate herself providing that she's totally segregated and isolated for from men they cannot even look at her she is to be in an all-female situation no problem she goes to a club that is all females no problem in that but she has to be selective with the sports she's engaging in so she says I'd like to maybe swim in a swimming suit no this is exposing your hour you can't do this maybe if you wear proper clothes yes you can swim if she wants to do something that is haraam such as boxing it's haram for both men and women and so on so the fields are many and you can learn as much as you want but to make haram things halal and justifying this because we would like to enter a field that is dominated by men definitely this has nothing to do with Islam and it's totally prohibited"
