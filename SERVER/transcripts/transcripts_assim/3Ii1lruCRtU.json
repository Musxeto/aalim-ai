That's my question, JazakAllah Wa Jazakum So, if while listening to the Khutbah on a Friday and the Imam says and in an authentic Hadith the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam said So, he mentions the name of the Prophet and he offers salutation As a follower listening to the Khutbah I'm ordered not to speak not even to reply to Salam when someone comes and says Salam Alaikum I don't reply because the Imam is giving his Khutbah So, when I hear the name of the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam Should I offer salutation? The answer is yes, but you offer it in yourself So, you say you don't utter it out loud and Allah knows best"
