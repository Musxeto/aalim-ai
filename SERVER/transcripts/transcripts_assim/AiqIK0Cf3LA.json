  "title": "Can we put Marks on the (Mushaf) Quran while memorizing| Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "for those says can we put marks in the must have that is the copy of the Koran when we are memorizing Quran or learning tafseer this is an issue of dispute I have the Quran it's a book where all those words are printed on some scholars say that it is totally prohibited to put anything other than the word of Allah and this was reported by a beloved misrule and that they say that keep the Quran pure from any other marks except that which is related to the Quran some scholars say no it's totally permissible to write comentary so I passed by an ayah in Surat Yusuf Lola and to fan Li Doon what is the meaning of Tiffany I dunno I have no idea I'll look in the FCS and okay I write one two three four five six meanings of it so that next time I read it I can understand and relate to it and they say that there are so many copies of the Quran that has comentary on the edges and some of the Companions used to do this as well they used to write at the side of the pages which were usually written either on leaves of trees or on the shoulder blades of animals so it's an issue of dispute I personally am inclined to say that I do not like even putting a marker on a verse of the Quran or putting a mark or writing something on the side there are sticky notes there are pads where you can write there are books that are specialized for you to write your notes in and related to the Quran but I'd rather that you keep the Quran pure clean with nothing written because I've seen in the circles of the field a lot of abuse by the students young youngsters they write the names on the cover okay the cover is not the Quran and then if you find hearts with a narrow penetrating and you find marks you're within the pages of the Quran and maybe some of the ayahs are highlighted with pencils and it is a form of disrespect to the Quran not that it is how it can be done but my own personal view is that I would never ever do anything like this to the Quran and Allah knows best"
