  "transcript": "a man says why is it permissible for a person to take payment from people for teaching Quran or any other Islamic work if this is supposed to be a bada for the sake of allah azza wajal a man my friend when you perform a form of a bad very bad I don't know if the translation is correct or not I'm doing it out of I'm shooting out of the hip as as as they say i bada is dividing the two types transitive and intransitive what do we mean by transitive and intransitive we know that there are verbs that are intransitive when I say I sit I walk I don't need to have an object afterwards when I mentioned transitive I have to put a I write a letter so a letter is an object I don't know if the translation is right or wrong but sue me who cares coming back to a beta a bada is dividing the two types intransitive which means that I am the only one benefiting from it so I pray night prayer I fast Mondays and Thursdays I read the Quran nobody's benefiting from this except me taking money on such a bada would be shirk because I'm supposed to be doing it for the sake of allah azza wajal the second type of a bada is the transitive type which benefits others such as teaching knowledge to students so if I teach knowledge if I teach people how to recite the Quran I'm not charging on my recitation of the Quran I'm charging on my effort teaching others likewise if an imam of a message takes a salary from the government this is permissible because he is taking part of his time not to prey on his own but rather to lead the people to teach them etc the origin of this is the hadith of abu saeed al hadiri may allah be pleased with him when a group of the Companions were stranded hungry had no food asked a tribe of idol worshippers to host them and to give them what people give to their guests and they refused but later on came back to them asking them for help because the their tribes leader has been stung by a snake or by a scorpion so one of them said I can give rope here I can do healing through Quran but I will not do this until you give us food that we ask for so you have to compensate us so they gave them a number of sheep let's say 30 and the man went recited the Quran only surah al-fatihah and blue on that sick person kept on repeating it hamdulillahi rabbil aalameen ar-rahman rahim doing this and all of a sudden the guy stood up there's nothing wrong with him so they went back to the Prophet re sorcerer and they told him Oh prophet of Allah we improvised we were hungry and we didn't know what to do when they came to us seeking our help we had a transaction with them so what do you think the Prophet said Ras alot was Sarah said to them that the most worthy thing to charge wage and money for is Quran so he is telling them that what you had done is perfect it's crystal clear that it is legitimate from this hadith and so many other hadith the scholars concluded the majority the vast majority of scholars concluded that this is permissible but is note saying that if you do it for the sake of Allah without charging that would be even better and better for you at the side of Allah but it is totally legit and halal for you to take such money"
