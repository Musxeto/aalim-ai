  "title": "Can we give charity to poor instead of offering Udhiya, Qurbani (Coronavirus, Lockdown)Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "says in india people say that because we cannot slaughter the qurbani or the islamic word for it is so they want to give the money in cash to the poor so is this permissible the answer is no it is not permissible to shift a emphatic sunnah of the prophet with your own logic so for example we know that udhiya can only be offered from behemoth from livestock from cattle camels cows buffalos whatever sheep goats you can slaughter any of those if someone who's filthy rich and says listen i have a horse and this horse costs like fifty thousand dollars it's one of my most valuable possessions and i'd like to sacrifice it on the day of eid and distribute the meat to the poor i said okay but this doesn't have anything to do with audrey it is totally bogus it doesn't work another one says okay how much is the sheep it's a thousand and five hundred reals i'll pay ten thousand reals and i'll buy fish of the best type and give it to the poor good zakala this is nothing to do with authya so you have to do exactly what the prophet isam told you and exactly what allah has mentioned to us in the quran so either you slaughter your qurbani or or you don't there's nothing in between as okay i'll give them money okay i'll buy them biryani rice and whatever no this doesn't work either you slaughter or not and the funny thing is in the past five months or more with the cavite 19 nobody stopped eating meat people kept on slaughtering people kept on uh uh eating meat so why is it when we'd come when it comes to you say we we can't slaughter slaughter houses are working and they have no problem in that so yes you you have to do that and giving money doesn't do the job"
