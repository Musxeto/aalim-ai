  "title": "Hw cn I believe Sun will rise 4m West on DayOf Judgement when science says otherwise assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "As we know, one of the signs of the end of times is that the sun rises from the west. Now, from a scientific perspective, the earth's rotation makes it seem that the sun rises from the east and sets in the west. Now can you kindly explain how we as a sunnah should believe this future event or is this question of mine just another west that I should ignore belief and conviction is something in the heart whether you are a rocket scientist a nuclear physicist or a layman a shepherd a nomad a farmer whose illiterate Quran said or what the authentic Sunnah has due to my own weakness but I believe in the Quran. This conviction is what Muslims all over the world believe in. If you go to a farmer in Kashmir or a shepherd or a nomad in the desert, they have never read the Quran in their lives and they have never studied the Sunnah. But if you tell them that in the Quran, Allah tells us that one of the signs of the day of judgment that so and so will happen. The prophet told us the interpretation of this ayah, the signs of Allah that the sun will rise from the west. The nomad, the shepherd, the farmer, they would say, \"I believe.\" You say, \"How is it possible that the sun rises from the west? Come on. This is not nonsense. This is illogical. Said if you want me to kill you, keep on talking like this because my conviction is undoubtful, unconditional. I believe in whatever the Quran or the authentic sunnah says whether I understand it or not. So be careful on what you say to me. This is the belief. So whatever you're suffering from, it's Shayan. Now you believe what NASA says, what science says, and you are hesitating in believing in what the Quran or the authentic Sunnah is telling you. This is crazy. There's something wrong in your iman. What you should do is I believe how it's none of my business. Allah said it would happen. It would happen. And this is the logical answer. If Allah wants the sun to rise from the south or from the north or it does not rise at all, this is Allah's creation. Allah does whatever he wills. So I hope this answers your question. If"
