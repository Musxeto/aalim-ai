  "title": "Piercing the nose - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um sister Zab has a question um she wants to know if it's Halal if it's permissible for a woman to pierce her nose um and the reason why is for beautification well piercing the nose was not known uh in at the time of the Prophet Alat wasam and people know the Arabs only know that piercing of the ears and this is the majority worldwide and some Scholars say that piercing of the nose is not permissible because it's a form of Mutilation to the face so anything that is done to the face and that is why in Islam it is forbidden to strike or to hit the face so this is not permissible for a person to hit another person's face either by punishing or slapping him on the face even if this was your child your wife your enemy you do not hit the face and that is why a lot of the scholars say that it it is the majority of Scholars say that boxing is forbidden in Islam because it depends entirely on hitting the face mhm having said that some Scholars say that piercing the nose is a form of Mutilation because it changes the face and that is why it is not permissible others say it depends on the customs of the country if they consider this a form of beautification then it is okay personally I I I tend to go to the first opinion that it is a mutilation of the face and unfortunately this has no end if you go to the West you'd find people piercing their eyes their the lips and I've seen someone piercing their tongues and I don't know how they talk like this but this is all sat satanic and it has nothing to do with nature"
