  "title": "Is wearing pants above the ankles (ruling) for women as well? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "is a woman required to wear her pants above the ankles as well when at home or is she Exempted so the answer would be it is prohibited for men to wear their garments their trousers whatever they're wearing from waist downwards so that it would exceed their ankles this is prohibited it's a major sin it's punishable in Hellfire whether it's your trousers your waist wrapper whether it's your thob whatever garment men wear because the prophet said whatever exceeds the ankles is in Hellfire so one would say okay then why are women Exempted why aren't they included in this Hadith because there's another Hadith where the Prophet said Alam said to the companions that women must lower their garments by uh uh this much so one said maybe their feet would be exposed so then he allowed it to be um uh lowered and extended for a an arm fold so this is for women and they're obliged to cover their feet so they're Exempted from the Hadith of not exceeding the ankles and this is the consensus as Imam nawi has reported it may Allah be have mercy on him he said they all agree that women are not included in this Hadith and that they can lower their garments uh below the ankles and more and Allah Asel Knows Best"
