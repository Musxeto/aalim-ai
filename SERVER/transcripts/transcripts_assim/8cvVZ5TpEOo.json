  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] m [Music] alhamdulillah dear brothers and sisters in Islam we are still studying the of the Prophet the prophet and messenger of Allah the prophet of Islam Muhammad IB Abdullah we've reached the stage where the pagans of Mecca decided to assassinate the prophet Alat wasam and Allah the almighty has per permitted his servant and Messenger to migrate to Medina where the people of Medina were eagerly waiting to receive him sallallahu alaih wasallam and to live under his teachings the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam already has taken all the precautions needed he ensured the companionship of his best friend Abu Bakr who himself had two camels for them to ride the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam organized to have someone knowledgeable of the roads and routes to Medina to take them there his name was Abdullah arat Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him ordered his son Abdullah to cover their way and their traces and ordered his servant and slave to come with his sheep as a shepherd and make the Sheep walk on their traces so that people would not know or find or track them they hid for three days and nights in the cave of Thor so that people would come down and then they can go on and try travel to Medina because the pagans knew their destination so they will definitely know where to track them they were hiding in this cave to the extent that men stood just right in front of them and they could see their feet and Abu Bakr was terrified he said oh prophet of Allah if someone looked at their feet level they could see us so the prophet told himam Abu Bakr don't worry what do you think of two their third is Allah it's two of us but Allah is with us with his protection with his guidance the almighty Allah there are stories that claim that a spider put its web on that cave and that Allah sent a pigeon that built its nest and had its egg in it so that whenever someone looked would definitely know that this place has not been entered for at least three or four weeks because of the spider web and but all of these uh uh uh stories are not authentic and they're not true the prophet sallallah wasallam stayed there with Abu Bakr for three days and nights Abdullah used to come to them just after Nightfall tell them about what qur was talking about what the pagans were about to do and just before the break of dawn he would go back again to Mecca to his house and pretend to be sleeping Abu Bakr took in the strip all of his possessions it was about 5,000 to to to six th000 Dirhams and his father who was a Muslim abua was a blind man once he learned that his son migrated went to his grandsons and children he went to AA and to Asma and told them your father migrated and they said yes grandfather and he asked them did he leave you something and they said of course and they brought a sack filled with small stones and gave it to him and when he touched it he thought that these this was gold and he said alhamdulillah and he was at ease through this journey which took a whole week from Mecca to Medina because they had to go in hiding for three days and nights and they had to take a longer route to Medina not the usual one so that that no one would be able to trace them through this long journey Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him manifested the best behavior with the lovers of his life Muhammad he used to see holes in the cave and he used to put his hands his legs his feet just to cover them fearing that there might be a snake or a scorpion that might come out and sting the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and he himself Was Bitten and harmed by the insects and the beasts in these holes and when the prophet woke upat and so the hardship that he was in he told him why did you do this Abu Bakr Abu Bakr said with a very happy heart with a big smile on his face just for your sake just for your sake oh prophet of Allah sallallah alaih Al wasallam they went on and the story says that they met a Shepherd in the middle of the desert and the prophet Salli wasallam asked him if they had milk to drink and the man apologized by saying that all our sheep are pregnant in pregnant sheep do not carry milk so the prophet pointed at a a sheep that was not pregnant but at the same time was not approached by a male by a ram and the prophet Sall wasallam rubbed her belly and Subhan Allah a pot in seconds was filled with milk that made him drink Abu Bakr and also the shepherd who was taking care of the sheep the prophet Sall wasallam went on his way with his companion and with the leader their leader Abdullah back in one of the villages there was a man called sakb Malik Jam so he might in some books called be Malik or and both names are for the same man while he was there in a pub like in a club or in a bar drinking he saw a man coming in and saying to those who were in that club I saw the shadow of three men traveling on so and so location and everyone knew that the people are looking for these men and and there's a big bounty to whomever succeeds in bringing them dead or alive so Shaka wanted this bounty and he said no no no no these three men are friends of mine they are so and so and so and he gave three false names just to let everyone at ease and no one would go and pursue these three men after seconds minutes he went out from a back door he told his maid to prepare his ride with the food and Provisions and when it was night time he rode to the direction to the location that this man sow the three men as he was riding his only objective was to get the Bounty and it took him a while until he reached there but when he did did and he saw the prophet sallai wasallam he's telling us that I was so close to the extent that I read I heard the prophet wasallam reciting and reading the Quran and just as he was close to them the front legs of his horse or camel Subhan Allah went into the ground and he fell over his ride that that was strange he got his lots and it's sort of uh flipping the coin the Arabs used to do they have few uh arrows or pieces of wood and they put on them things to determine and decide for them what they will do he said I drew the lots and there was written you will not be able to harm him so one lot said you are going to capture him the other one said you're not going to harm him so he said damn it and he went again while he was on his way he drew the Lots again and it came you will not be able to harm him and just as he was getting close again the legs of his right went straight into the sand and he fell again he drew the lots and it said you'll not be able to harm him and he would not be convinced of that he rode again to the prophet am but when the legs of his ride dug into the sand he said oh Muhammad oh Muhammad wait by Allah I will not harm you just wait stop so Abu Bakr and the prophet wasallam stopped and the prophet asked Abu Bakr to tell him what does he want so the Abu Bakr shouted at him and told him what do you want and he said all what I want is a paper from you proving that I saw you so that whenever I want to come to Medina and embrace Islam I will do that so the prophet Sall wasallam asked Abu Bakr to write him this paper and so did Abu Bakr do this and then the prophet told him Malik how would you feel what would be of you when you wear the bracelets of the ruler of the empire of Persia kisra how would you feel when you wear his bracelets and and and Saka was is this guy's crazy everybody's on his back he cannot even have a safe place to stay everybody wants his blood and he's promising me me Saka to wear the bracelets of KRA the ruler of Persia this is insane the Abu Bakr gave him the message the prophet told him make the people miss our way or another translation blind them from seeing our root so Shaka went back to his people and told them that I believe I've seen these three men going in another Direction because I went in this direction ction and I could not see a thing we have a short break and inshallah we will be right back if you're 18 or if you're 18 if you've been Muslim for 50 years or 5 minutes this is a show for you you know when five times a day I our foreheads touch

TV so if you're looking for something different looking for something that will make you think maybe even touch your heart this is the show for [Music] you Salam alaykum and welcome back suraka Malik he was a bounty hunter he tried his very best to catch and Capt the prophet Sall wasallam and Abu Bakr yet he failed he sought the permission of his Gods whether he will be able to capture him or not and every time he drew the Lots it stated that you will not be able to harm him he did this three times and he was not convinced he followed the prophet Salli wasallam until he was really close to him to the extent that he could hear the prophet recite the Quran yet the legs of his R went through the sand and he felt he fell one and two third time he said this is real I cannot catch him he asked the prophet sallai wasallam to write something for him the prophet gave him the good and glad Tiding that he one day will wear the bracelets of the m emperor of Persia kisra and he thought to himself that this is insane this man is being followed and pursued there's money on his head and he's promising me to wear the bracelets of not the king of Arabia but the Emperor of Persia that the Romans themselves fear this is this is not not not true and not correct yet he took the paper and left the prophet Alam and Abu Bakr continued their way to Medina the people of Medina every single day of the past seven days used to go from Sunrise until sunset awaiting the presence and the coming the arrival of the prophet but as we know it took him a whole week to reach there they wanted to greet the prophet Alat wasam they wanted to meet him firsthand they knew that he was the mercy to all mankind so they went there waited Under the Sun until one day one of the Jews in his farm was farming and saw the shade of two men coming he knew that it was the prophet he immediately went to the Muslims and said oh Muslims it is the one who have you've been waiting for and they all went out to greet and uh uh receive the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam there are stories that say and claim that the the that the women kept on on singing and chanting saying that and all of this was unauthentic and it's not acceptable for a number of reasons one of them was is to the north of Medina and the prophet came from Mecca which is to the south of Medina so he did not take a whole turn round Medina to come from and secondly the companions of the Prophet Alat wasam were serious people they were honorable people they would not allow their women to sing and chant in the presence of foreign and strange men the companions received the prophet Alat wasam and His companion Abu Bakr they greeted him and as anas Malik said when the prophet Sall wasallam came to Med in everything lit for in Medina they felt that the joy was overwhelming in the people's hearts it was the greatest day in their lives when the prophet Al safe and sound teaching them leading them in prayer reciting Quran to them talking to them mixing with them shaking hands with them it was indeed the best moment in their lives the prophet Alat stayed two weeks at the outskirts of Medina he did not enter Medina he stayed in uh he he had a tent in state in B and he built the mosque of Masid the first mosque to be built in Medina and the prophet sallam used to pray there do you know the advantages of praying in Mas Kuba does anyone of you know that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said that whoever performs a prayer a prayer one prayer in the Masid of Kuba this is equivalent to in reward and of course you know what is the reward to those who pray in Medina mosque there's five 500 times 500 times more than any other prayer well that is for Masjid ala for Thea mosque it's 500 but the Medina mosque it's it is more 1,000 more than any other mosque with the exception of mam and you know what is the reward for praying in the Holy Mosque of mecah how many times the prayer is Multiplied so doubled no Medina if you pray one prayer it's equivalent to 1,000 prayer elsewhere if you pray in Mas in makah it is 100,000 times better and more than than any other Masjid so the reward is enormous to those who pray in Mecca and Medina the prophet stayed for two weeks in Ben and he managed to build the Masjid of Kuba and after two weeks the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam decided to enter Medina so B who are his uncles from his mother's side came in full armor to protect him and to give him a good uh Convoy with him so he went to Medina greeted by more than 500s of his followers the Muslims and this by itself was a nice way to receive the prophet Alam and it through the fear in the hearts of the Jews who knew that he was the messenger of Allah but refused to accept his call and his message the prophet while passing by every single house everyone would come out and say oh prophet of Allah let me host you it's an honor that is second to none but the prophet saidham no leave the camel and his camel's name was Al and the prophets it was it was the habit of Arabs to call their animals to call their belongings the the the the the sword has a name the camel has a name the mule has a name and the prophet alham kept on telling them leave the camel because this animal had has been ordered by Allah and the camel kept on walking slowly until it came to the house of Abu a Al Ansari where it stopped Abu Ansari was one of the companions of the Prophet Alam and his house was made of two stories so he told the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam oh prophet of Allah you stay on top and we'll take the ground floor the prophet said Noam let it h let us have it the other way around Abu said prophet of Allah I cannot imagine me being on top and you are on the bottom this cannot be you are the messenger of Allah you should always be on top this shows you the great love they had to the prophet alhat to the extent that the prophet told him no we will take the bottom uh floor the ground because people come in and out it will be difficult for people to come in and out if you were on the on the ground floor and we were on the top floor Abu says that we were so sensitive to the prophet being below us to the extent that if water was spilled on the floor we used to get all the garments to dry it so that not even one single drop would fall by mistake on our Prophet they're talking about water and they don't want one single drop of water to fall on the prophet the people of Medina used to come on in and out to visit the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam to give him the pledge of allegiance to accept Islam and to learn from him whatever he the prophet wasallam had to teach them in that error the prophet Alat wasam faced with the problem of those who migrated with him and they were called they were called Al that this is their name the one who migrated immigrated yes mun and the people of Medina who were known to be so we had the mun and an the problem am was faced with a problem the prophet Alam was faced with a problem and that problem was that those who migrated from Mecca left their properties behind them left their money they came with nothing except their garments so the people of Medina were farmers were Merchants we had lots of money lot lots of good things in them so the problem the prophet had to solve this problem and he did so by associating one muhajir to another ansar so one from those who migrated he made him a brother to one from the people of Medina the ansar and told him that that this boundage is something so strong to the extent that if one of them died the other inherited him so it was even stronger that than their blood brothers they were associated together they were made to be brothers in Islam and this is indeed the strongest uh uh Brotherhood uh available I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program so in until we meet next [Music] time [Music] h"
