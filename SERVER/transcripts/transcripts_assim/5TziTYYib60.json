  "transcript": "says he's got a friend who studies philosophy and he ended up uh um embracing Sufism and he asks how can I explain to him that what he's doing is wrong and that he's going astray I don't know your friend and I don't know how deep he's down in the in that swamp but all what I can tell you is that there is nothing that is equivalent to Quran and the Sunnah such people of innovation the moment you bring up the issue of b or the prophet did not do it or say it they get outraged I've spoken to many people who claim to be sufis not real sufis innovators and the moment you say the prophet Alam did not do this do you know more than him they explode in your face saying that not everything we do is according to what the prophet used to do and this shows you what's deep in their heart they claim to love the prophet Alam they claim to uh do a lot of Vick because they love the prophet but their actions state that they think that they can be better than the prophet wasam know better than the prophet and it's not a an issue to neglect his Sunnah and do something he didn't do so just show him Quran and the Sunnah and if there is any hope in him he will come back if not just uh uh dump him and look for some other righteous person following the Sunnah to hang out with"
