  "transcript": "we will begin with our honorable ships ships asakim inshallah from Saudi Arabia to shed some light on the mercy of allah subhanhu china soul of man over him and hamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa salaam wa barakaatuh i believe you wore a suit I mean nabina muhammad in matter and it was a train and I do assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh I believe that this is a challenge not only to myself or to the Honorable panel but to any speaker to be given five minutes and asked to talk about the mercy of Allah Azza WA JAL whom the prophet salallahu re who I do seldom described it by saying that Allah when he created mercy he created it into 100 parts he kept on earth one part and stored with him 99 parts for the day of judgment from this part that Allah has laid on earth is when a beast uplifts its hoof its leg from stepping on its own child all what we see around us on earth where a mother cares for her son when a spouse loves adores and cherishes his partner when a son cares for his parents and examples are endless all of this is a glimpse of a one over a hundred of Allah as mercy and of course this is a las creation which has nothing to do with a large beautiful attribute mercy which is what his attributes and which is not created this these are two different things so when you ask me to talk about Allah's mercy I would yeah any think that this is a challenge but in a nutshell we are approaching the month of mercy the month of Ramadan so many times a large mercy overwhelms us like the Sun overwhelms the whole world will its light but because it's so strong and powerful we're blinded by the light we fail to see Allah's mercy due to our ignorance due to our injustice due to our own failures and shortcomings so we complain and we say things without thinking or contemplating while if we were objective and fair we would have seen others mercy in everything around us and in ourselves isn't it sufficient that Allah made us human beings capable of breathing eating drinking communicating enjoying the life we are enjoying enjoying at the moment all what you hear from people is complaints complaints complaints and never ever hear from people the praise that allah azzawajal deserves never ever you hear people thanking allah azza wajal for all the blessings and favours that he bestows upon them all maybe this is because we are like a child driven to a surgeon to operate upon him looking at his father and the father is saying to the child it's okay it's going to be okay he's doing this for your own good and the child is wondering I believe my father I trust my father but the man has a knife in his hand and he's about to cut me open so if the child's confidence and trust and dependence upon his dad Ezra is true and genuine things will be alright and if not then there would be problems allah azzawajal has the highest of examples and the best of examples well Allah Hill method Allah we love Allah we trust Allah and we depend upon him hence we believe that this month is going to be the best month in our lives insha'Allah and it's going to be the best Ramadan of all Ramadan's just sit back relax and enjoy this journey of mercy great positivity there jaeseok a lot a"
