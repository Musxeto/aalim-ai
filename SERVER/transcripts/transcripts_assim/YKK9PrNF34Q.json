  "transcript": "Arham from Bangladesh Is traveling to non-Muslim countries Haram? First of all, Arham, did you say Salam? Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Salamutullah, yes sir Traveling to non-Muslim countries Haram? Traveling to non-Muslim countries, our scholars say, must be for a legitimate reason. So, Sheikh Ibn Baz, Ibn Uthaymeen, and the major scholars of Islam say, there has to be a legitimate reason for endangering oneself when going to such non-Muslim countries that is filled with disbelief, kufr, wrong aqeedah, fitna, lust and desires, and trials, and the likes that go all against our Islamic belief. So, if there is a legitimate reason, such as going for education that cannot be attained in Muslim countries, or going for medication that cannot be sought after in Muslim countries, they're highly more advanced than us, or for the purpose of businesses, buying and trading and selling, or for giving da'wah, like we do all the time, we travel there for a week or two to give da'wah and come back, this is a legitimate reason. But if someone goes for tourism and to enjoy the country and the scenery and to have a good time, this is totally prohibited and risking one's own religious practice and his levels of iman and faith would deteriorate. May Allah preserve us."
