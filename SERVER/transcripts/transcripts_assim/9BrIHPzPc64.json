  "transcript": "a ruse sent a question saying what is the ruling on drop shipping in Islam what is the ruling on drop shipping what is drop shipping usually drop shipping is a person who takes orders and he sells something from a third party and asks this third party to deliver it to the first party so someone is interested in a watch that I have displayed on my website on my Instagram on my whatever and I'm selling it for X euros so he places an order I go to a third party amazon.com Alibaba whatever or the agency of the company itself tell them after paying them the money to ship it to the first person who made the initial order so what's the ruling on this there are two restrictions here one of them is the hadith that Hakim of Nizam may Allah be pleased with him said the prophet sallallahu alaihi wa salam prohibited us prohibited me prohibited indefinitely from selling what we do not possess so it is prohibited in Islam to sell something that is not yours to sell something that you do not have in your possession and the second restriction is that the prophet alayhi salatu salam prohibited merchants from selling goods before acquiring it before its acquisition and taking it into their warehouses and this is an authentic hadith without any dispute and scholars have disputed upon such possession there are things that you cannot possess by taking it actually to your warehouse such buying a house a property so actual possession possessing it would be by having the deeds by having the key so that you own it by so these two restrictions make dropshipping prohibited there might be a possibility you sell something you cash the money and then you fail to deliver the original manufacturer raises the prices all of a sudden not to your knowledge something may happen on the way it's many reasons nevertheless this is not permissible what is permissible though is that you become an agent so you come in to me and say listen I'd like to buy a watch a tag or for example and I tell you ok the watch costs $5,000 and I'll take my commission 2% and he agrees for that and then there's no problem you may do this because now you are an agent to him you're not selling it directly and there is no risk involved in here and Allah social knows best"
