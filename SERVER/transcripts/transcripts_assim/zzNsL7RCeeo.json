  "transcript": "brother Abbas asked quite an important question and a lot of the Muslims in the West may have been in the same situation that is he wanted a house to live in and at the time of ignorance due to the fact that he did not have enough knowledge he bought a house through an interest-based loan a mortgage or something similar to that and after he paid off the money and now he owns the house and after going to Islamic centres and reading more about Islam hamdulillah Allah blessed him with more knowledge about Islam he came to know that he borrowed this money through Harlem means and he shouldn't have done that so so what is he supposed to do well what he paid for the house was his own money plus interest the interest is Haram the money that he paid for the house is Hallett therefore due to the fact that he did not know the house is his and he lives in it comfortably he asks Allah for forgiveness for what he had done without knowledge and Allah so L would accept his forgiveness with his repentance that is one other thing is someone may ask and say ok Sheikh he had bought the house and he's done with it what about me I'm still in my seventh year paying RIBA for my house what should i do should I just leave the house and give them the house back the answer is no there would be a lot of waste over you and a lot of harm over the money that you've paid them over the past six or seven years therefore scholars say that if you can borrow money without interest from friends and loved ones and give it to them where they would reduce a great amount of their RIBA of their interest because you've paying it at once then you should do this if not and most likely not a lot of people would be willing to give you money nowadays if not then you continue to give them the installments so that you can finish owning the house and having it in your name and you should also continue to ask Allah for forgiveness and you repent to Allah and Allah with the grace of Allah would accept your repentance"
