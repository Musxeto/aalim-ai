  "transcript": "Fuad from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So Sheikh, I am asking the question today on behalf of another brother. So the Ministry of Religious Affairs of our country deals with Islam as well as other religions. People of different religions live here such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity. In such a situation, will it be permissible to join the job as a computer data entry operator there since there is work on other religions as well as Islam? Jazak Allah Khairan. Wa Jazakum. The question is not clear. Now if you are asking about having co-workers in the workplace in the same company that you are working for and you work to make a program to manufacture a product to sell a commodity that is halal and everything is halal, there is no problem in that. The Prophet Alayhi Salaatu Wasalam hired a disbeliever guide when he migrated from Mecca to Medina. So he and Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with them, were accompanied by this non-Muslim guide who knew the routes that the disbelievers would not be able to catch them. And this shows us that working with disbelievers or non-Muslims on something that is halal is permissible. But if you are telling me that you are collaborating with them on work that would benefit their religion and make it prosper and flourish in supporting them in their religious activities, the answer is definitely that this is not permissible. We have nothing to do with other religions when it comes to such issues and Allah knows best. Al Fatiha."
