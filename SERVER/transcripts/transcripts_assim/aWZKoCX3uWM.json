  "transcript": "what are the conditions necessary for one to sit and pray can a perfectly healthy person sit and pray just because he or she is too tired I think we've answered this before and we stated that the Prophet said in an authentic hadith alayhi salat wa sallam the prayer of a person sitting down is half of that of a praying standing up and the consensus of scholars is that this is referring to the voluntary prayers forked prayers mandatory prayers must be offered standing up if you're able to do that so if a person is tired and he wants to pray for prayer we look at the amount of trouble that he's in if he says I'm totally wasted I'm totally confused I'm unable to concentrate I can't stand up if I stand up I'm gonna fall in this case we'd say okay sit down but if he says well I I'm tired I've been working for too many hours I've walked a lot and I just want to sit down said okay but if you go to that shop they'll give you a thousand euro compensation for your work really and he goes no this guy is not in need of sitting down he's just lazy so it depend Allah Allah is someone who's gonna hold you accountable Allah knows whether you can stand up or not so being tired is not a legitimate reason being sick being unable yes this is possible"
