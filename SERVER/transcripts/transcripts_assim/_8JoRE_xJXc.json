  "title": "Used to give Zakat to wrong receiver, do I have to give away that zakat amount again?- Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "in the past years I gave my as a car to cancer hospital now I come to know that it is not permissible so should I pay again all previous years are cut yes because the zakat is a debt to Allah and solution and you can only give them to the eight categories mentioned in surah at-taubah verse 60 chapter 9 so you cannot give it to someone who's not among these eight categories cancer patients can be rich can be poor can be Muslims can be non-muslims so definitely your zakat was not placed in the correct place however you will be rewarded for it as a charity as a sadhaka but not as zakat"
