  "transcript": "from bangladesh she says my father's name is abdu subhan and we know that subhan is one of allah's names this is not true subhan is not one of allah azzawajal's names is one of allah azzawajal's names so subhan is a verb subhan allah where you honor and exempt allah from any shortcomings and praise and glorify allah therefore subhan is not one of allah's names abdus subhan is totally prohibited and you must emit and take and take it out of your name so what's the ruling on keeping subhan the arabs would smile when they hear someone's name as subhan so it doesn't make any sense what is subhan it's like calling someone go or sit what's your name my name is sit that's funny it's a verb but nevertheless it is permissible to keep so if you can you have to omit the word abit because the subhan means nothing because subhana is not any of allah's names so it's prohibited to keep and you can keep the whole name without any problem"
