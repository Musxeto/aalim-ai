  "transcript": "knowledge that they learn scientology and become under this because for the new deviant cult and innovation it is necessary in our muslim society that we encourage i don't understand your question muhammad you've said about its necessity to do something against the deviant sects what is that thing again okay okay okay um brother muhammad is addressing an issue which is becoming a scholar of hadith first of all no one has the ability to set his calendar and say okay in six years times i'm going to be a scholar of hadith or a scholar or a scholar of this and that this is not something applicable it is something that you have to work for and hope for the best and if allah selects you you will become a scholar secondly is studying the sciences of hadith something that would help us fight off and refute the false allegations of deviant sex indeed and this is one of the great sciences of islam that no other religion on earth has it and this is a bold challenge and a statement no other religion on earth has it it's the only religion that has each and every detail of the hadith transferred to us where we can criticize it we can analyze it we can refute it or accept it and it's a science it's not something that people just shoot from the hip it's a science one plus one equals two so it is one of the great sciences of islam that people are encouraged to study but very rare and selective people can do this i remember 32 years ago i was found i was fond of uh um studying science of hadith and i bought like gazillion books of al-jarrah adil and rijal and hadith and i studied it like a bookworm and i even went in one of my attempts and i sat with sheikh al-bani and asked him a few questions and came to the conclusion that whoa man this is not an easy ride it's not for any person just to go and and and hop in and become a student it requires a lot of studying a lot of scrutinizing a lot of writing and detecting and patience i didn't have this in me so i decided that okay we love our scholars who devoted their lives to this we believe in them let them do the job let me do something easier i was a lazy man still is probably so this is a science that is great but only for those who have the guts to go all the way inshaallah [Music]"
