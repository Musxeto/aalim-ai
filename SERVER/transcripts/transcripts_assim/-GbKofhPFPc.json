  "title": "Imam said avoid Umm Al Qura timetable to prevent divisionâ€”follow athaan or timetable?",
  "transcript": "we have Heidi from France here for the lecture um I have a question so I live in France and I saw one of your videos where you recommended the method uh but in my local mosque like most of the mids here they used the 15 for f and MH and after some research I believe that the method is the most accurate and more closer to the true Asal time so I prefer to use it and when I asked the IM he told me that I should follow the musk to preserve the unity and avoid the division and I would do the fitna so is it permissible for me to stop fasting earlier than over based on and I'm really causing by doing so thank you this is an issue of dispute and to tell you the truth in my own opinion because I live in Saudi Arabia and is the most accurate timetable for Saudi Arabia there's no doubt in that with the exception of Isa Isa is totally bogus because they fixed it at 1 hour and 30 minutes after Sunset 11 months of the year and in Ramadan they upgraded into two hours which has no relationship to to Islam at all but they're persistent they're stubborn and they insist on doing it I can't help that Saudis and the regions around us is perfect for those living in Europe up North this is something that they have to go back to their own Scholars islamically speaking with this dilemma we as Muslims are told to believe in two things number one in your own Vision if I see the break of dawn separating the night the darkness of the night this I can see it with my own eyes I will pray F and refrain from eating and drinking whether the aan is given half an hour early earlier or later I don't care I can see it this is what Allah will hold me accountable uh uh to not to thean because I can see it when I see the sun sets I will eat it disappeared I will eat even if the Adan is called 10 15 minutes later I don't care Allah told me when you see the sun sets when the Night Comes you break your fast and you pray your m this is number one if I don't if I cannot see it visibly visually I'm in my home I can't distinguish between the break of dawn and the sunset in this case islamically I have to rely on the aan whether the aan calls early or late this is on him because the prophet told usat wasam that the person calling the aan is usted he's the one who's going to be questioned on the day of judgment it's not an easy job to take and say okay allahar Allah abbar no you'll be account held accountable and at the same time you can't just say uh because I'm accountable I'm going to give 10 minutes delay of sunset so that I would make sure that people would break their fast on time no this is wrong or I'll call the aan of f 15 minutes earlier so that people would stop eating and drinking and what about if someone stands up and prays F the moment you give the aan H I didn't think of that so you act according to the aan and that is what you'll be safe for and Allah Knows Best"
