  "transcript": "the prophet isalam set the foundation for a strong iman what did he do throughout these 13 years he gave dawa based on what based on a number of factors unlike what we do you see lots of us give dawah by being defensive so we start to defend what the enemies of islam criticize it off and that's not the right way of doing dawah yes it's one aspect it's one part of it someone comes to me and says why islam is so and so and so i have to have an answer in most cases i have answers but to devote my time and dawa solely for the purpose of why islam permits men to marry for why do women have to wear the hijab why do we have prescribed punishment in islam why do men get double the amount females get in inheritance why this why that i would be wasting a lot of time without setting the foundation because you will always find something to criticize if you fail to set the foundation what is the foundation allah stated in the quran say o people of the book come to a common term between us and you that we should not worship other than allah so this is the foundation that we should establish first before anything else why if you don't believe in islam if you don't believe in the existence of allah if you have doubts about allah azzawajal no matter what i say or quote from the quran or from the prophetic sunnah of the prophet alaihis no matter what evidences i give to you your logic would still say no no this is not logical so imagine if someone is interested interested in islam and he starts asking these questions why is wearing gold prohibited for men and it's permissible for women what would i say to this this person because it is uh it gives the looks of feminism to a man and this is not masculine and he says okay what's the ruling on wearing diamonds for men so the diamonds are okay diamonds are forever it says this is more feminine i never thought of that this is wrong this is not how you make da'wah when you tell people about fasting so someone comes to say why do muslims fast you say because islam wants the muslims to feel how the poor feel when they don't have food or a water a non-muslim would say duh this is not logical i could buy food and give it to them why would i starve and if i live in a country where daytime is eight hours or five hours and night time is 17 or i wouldn't feel hungry or thirsty so is my fast is invalid this doesn't make any sense and it doesn't make any sense this is why we have to set the foundation what is the foundation sheikh to worship allah alone do you know what the prophet assalam focused most on in these 13 years until hate"
