  "transcript": "Abdul Rafi' from Australia Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So my question is in regards to the concept of assisting people in Haram So sometimes I come into a situation where before providing a specific service I am 100% sure that this certain person will use it for a mix of Haram and Halal However I am inclined to say that they will use it for Halal purposes more due to my previous interactions with them So like for example in a similar video someone asked that if they give their brother their headphones But they know for a fact that he will use it to listen to music But he will probably use it more for his classes and other Halal purposes So you mentioned that we should let them know beforehand that they shouldn't use it for Haram But in some cases such as when providing a service to a business or client this may not be feasible And in fact we may even be certain that despite our advice they will go ahead and use it for the portion of Haram So to sum up if we know a certain person will use our service for a mix of Halal and Haram But there is more Halal involved in it, is it Halal to provide a service to such a person? The answer is yes, you are not his mother and you are not obliged to give him such an advice As long as he is buying a bottle of water which he can drink when he is thirsty And which he can turn into ice cubes and drink with his scotch You are not obliged to say ok this is a bottle of water, don't do anything I wouldn't do Don't use it to make ice cubes for your scotch No, it's a Halal item that you are selling, it's a Halal service that you are providing Whatever they use it for, this is their problem and not yours"
