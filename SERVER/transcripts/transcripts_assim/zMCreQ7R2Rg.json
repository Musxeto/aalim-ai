  "title": "Zebra, Domesticated Donkey, & Mule Meat Halal or Haram? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "among the things that are permissible to eat are the zebras now the zebras are not donkeys so what's prohibited for muslims to eat is the domestic donkeys and of course mules are also prohibited to eat because they are an example of the rule i've mentioned earlier whenever there are two conflicting rules one permits and one prohibits we give weight to the one that prohibits so as they say i don't know they say that a mule is a result of a domestic donkey mating with a horse and this what results from that i personally don't know i don't have uh enough or sufficient knowledge in zoology geology or whatever they call it in in the animal world but this is what i had read and feel free to correct me if i'm wrong even i remember some folks say that mules don't have offspring but i still don't know how authentic this is so mules because of the mixed parents of it and one of them is a domestic donkey it becomes also haram to consume and allah azzawajal knows best while zebras being wild donkeys are had and of course you cannot catch them you usually hunt them but if you were to catch one and you would like to eat it it has to be slaughtered properly"
