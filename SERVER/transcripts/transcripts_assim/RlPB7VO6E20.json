  "transcript": "foreign okay so there's I am what's the mother who's 23 years old and she has two children under the age of three she's separated from her husband and isn't likely to reunite with him and there might have been some domestic violence um she found out that she's pregnant and doesn't want her baby now she doesn't have good mental health and the problem is her two children have a health condition where they're not fed properly they're at risk of death and the child protection they wanted to her and if she doesn't meet the requirements of you know uh giving the children nourishment they might take the children away so her new child that she's pregnant with is likely to have the same condition and she doesn't think that she can cope with having another baby on her own and doesn't have good family support and if her children are taken away from her it's possible that they won't even be put with other Muslims like with other relatives of hers or other Muslims at all so the children can be given by today if they're taking away interesting strain to have good progress so basically under her circumstances would she be allowed to have an abortion how old is your pregnancy uh I'm not exactly sure unfortunately I don't have that information okay first of all these situations that he cannot be answered over the phone it there are so many details that need to be investigated but in a nutshell because we don't have the capacity to go into details and to talk to the sister and to see the uh background and the circumstances of of her situation it is not permissible to abort a pregnancy after it is 40 days of age because now it is the majority of Scholars say that this is Haram before the age of 40 days it's an issue of dispute I'm inclined to say that this is like taking the after pill so 40 days or less you can opt for abortion without any sinisha Allah after that this becomes prohibited unless there is proof that there is real potential genuine risk on the mother's life second year or thirdly I've lost count in her case I would highly recommend that she booked tickets and flee the country this country is known to be hostile towards Muslims like many other countries and they would do anything to abduct your children and in a heartbeat they would give them to Christian families and they would be happy and to challenge this you would probably take two or three years in their court and if you were to win the harm had already been done and I know cases that came to me for counseling alhamdulillah the brother one and he got his child back but after what after false accusation from the nurse that they were abusing their own child and they are practicing Muslims and I told this brother I don't know if he's watching or not to just flee the country don't stay there your capital is your Islam and then your family so I would highly recommend that she runs away from that country at least until she gets her things settled if this is not possible my second option would be as an advice is for her to give her own two children to Muslim families for temporarily adoption of five to ten years explaining her case and documenting it with the government so that they would not file any legal cases against her or do anything now their their hands are tight so legally they can't abduct her children anymore and trying to bear with her third child coming making Dua that Allah makes him healthy and not having that same disease Allah is capable of doing that and Allah Knows Best"
