  "title": "🆕🌟When with Muslims, he acts ❌ Anti-Islam, when with Atheists, he 💪🏻 defends Islam, is he KAFIR?",
  "transcript": "Fahim from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Sheikh, a bi-born Muslim man who went through many counselling in last one decade, his problem is whenever he talks with a Muslim about Islam, he starts arguing like an anti-Islamic. But when he talks with an atheist or a follower of another religion, he defends the superiority of Islam. He doesn't know why his mind behaves this way. He always tries to ignore every negativity and ponder upon Allah, praise Allah, read about the last-gen messengers, yet he fails. Now he's really frustrated with himself as he doesn't know how to recover. So Sheikh, is he a kafir? This is something that relates to conviction and belief. Now, I cannot assess this person until I speak with him. And if I speak with him and I discuss these issues, I can tell by the way he speaks to another Muslim, whether he's a hypocrite, whether he's delusional, or whether he is only having whispers of shaitan about things that may fog his vision and he's unable to see clearly. So he may need counselling. He may need to ask himself whether he is a hypocrite or he doesn't believe in Islam wholeheartedly. Or he does, but shaitan is trying to mess up with his head. And this is something I cannot tell until I speak to him personally. And Allah knows best."
