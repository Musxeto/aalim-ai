  "title": "Imitating disbelievers: Does using cars,internet,white wedding dress come under this - Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "so above the man from the UK had a number of questions question number one regarding the concept of imitating the disbelievers Haditha women may Allah be pleased with him and with his father where he the Prophet had a solution said in a long hadith at the conclusion of this hadith he said women toshiba have a common phenomenon whoever imitates a people he is considered one of them so the scholars looked into this phrase and said how would a person imitate a people so by wearing a watch and using a PDA by using cameras high def cameras and being in a studio which came to us from the disbelievers from a different people am i imitating the disbelievers when I'm riding my car scholar said no so we ask them how what is the criteria that we can judge they said if it is related to their religion if it is related to their customs if it is related to their own dress code that no one shares them in it among the Muslims so this is considered to be part of imitating the disbelievers and unfortunately the Muslims are being slowly but surely being diluted not them physically but their beliefs their convictions the traditions and the religion so it is sort of being put in a melting pot you wanna come to our country you have to be like us talk like us mix like us fornicate like us drink champagne in your weddings like us whether it's okay with your religion or not this is not our problem you have to be in the melting pot so they are trying only to strip us out of our religion now you see non-muslims wearing t-shirts wearing crosses having tattoos coming to Muslim lands and you see this and the youth are impressed they want to imitate I was once personally with someone who's a Muslim and a man fell on the ground fainted had a seizure what did this young man do he said bismillah alrahman alraheem what is this the guy did it unintentionally but this is what he sees and he thinks that oh this is a sign of praying to allah azza wajal though is a Muslim so we have to draw the line things that are related to their religion this is totally prohibited to pray like them for example if you go to a Masjid you would find people reciting the Quran doing this or doing this while reciting the Quran what are you doing is that I'm reciting the Quran this is the way that the Jews pray you're not allowed to do this or an was revealed so that you would it would fill you up with tranquility calmness and submissiveness you read it without movement without such crazy movement people that imitate the disbelievers in having a Christmas the birth of Jesus so they have their own Christmas the Mawlid of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam to shake this is wrong imitating the disbelievers and so on now imitating them and their customs so you find people in restaurants educated PhD holders or CEOs of companies and they're holding the fork with the left hand and the knife with the right and they're eating their steak with their left and this is totally against Islam what are you doing bro he says well people will laugh at me this is the etiquette of eating subhanAllah where the Islamic etiquette said it's not befitting in a five-star hotel and by the way utensils are made of gold or silver so mashallah so sin over sin total darkness imitating the disbelievers in their dress code so nowadays if I travel I put on my pair of jeans and a t-shirt share your imitating the Kafar no for a percent of the Muslim world are wearing this so it's okay so wearing Jesus is okay yes okay but a hundred and fifty years ago when no Muslim used to wear jeans and anyone who wears Jesus would be if they had jeans at the time I don't know I don't think so Levi's was not invented then but and never nevertheless if a Muslim wore jeans at that time he would have been sinful why because he's imitating the disbelievers now because wearing a suit wearing trousers wearing a jacket is done by Muslims and non-muslims alike riding a car wearing a watch using a fountain pen is being used by Muslims and non-muslims it has nothing to relate to their own religion or to their customs or tradition or dress code then this becomes permissible insha Allah so a wedding dress of a woman comes under this category because 99% of Muslim women wear these white gowns with the white wedding dress but we have to be careful with the cry the imitation that goes against our religion so if it just exposes her cleavage or her back totally this is nudity which is not permissible in Islam it's Haarlem if she wears something like two three meters with a tail that children can this is totally prohibited because this is Hara a normal wedding dress with a nice looking and decoration with the bride would they call it headdress or whatever they call it there's no problem in that what about wearing the flowers shake carrying the flowers inshallah is so cake what about giving them their back and throwing it so that any woman would catch it would probably as a good omen be next to be wedded or ha this is imitating the Crafar this is totally prohibited and likewise talking about the graduation dress and the hat they wear I personally would not ever do this I would not wear it because I'm still hesitant that this is becoming the norm it's still in Midway not all universities prior to practice this especially in in the Muslim world but some are picking up this imitation I don't know about the origin of it but I would not do it myself and allah azzawajal knows best"
