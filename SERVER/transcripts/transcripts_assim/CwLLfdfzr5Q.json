  "transcript": "how can we advise some family members who are involved in Innovations correct yeah okay the issue of advice it varies due to a number of factors number one who is who are you advising number two what are you advising them about number three what kind of knowledge do you possess so that would entitle you to advise them number four what is your relationship to them if you're someone who is way down and want to advise someone on the top that would be different between someone who's on top like a father advising his son it's a number of factors that may impact your advice your strategy and also what they're doing you can't come to someone who does not pray does not fast he is drinking intoxicants and you say fear Allah your fingernails are too long this is inappropriate unwise so you have to see how to advise them and before you do that you have to imagine the conclusion so yes I can advise people but I am almost certain that if I do advise them this would backfire this person would insult Allah azzawajal this person would make a chaotic scene we have a member in the congregation in the Masjid that everybody avoids to speak to he has the most rude behavior and bad attitude and he thinks that he owns the Masjid and whenever someone gives him an advice he blows his pipes in the middle of the Masjid he has a rage fit this guy is one of the worst people you could talk to don't give him advice he's not worthy he's local is lunatic he's something wrong with him because he's disrespecting the Masjid in the middle of the Masjid so you have to weigh the pros and cons of what you're doing so when you want to advise relatives about an innovation first of all how can you pave the way if you go directly to them some of them would not accept if you say this is Haram this is a Bida he would fight with you rather if you go indirectly and say subhanallah how beautiful the Sunnah is the prophet salallahu used to do this and that and this people love to hear stories of the prophet and of the syrup they will come to you and they will listen to you and they will reciprocate most likely then you may throw a hint here or there about people who innovate in Islam how would they meet the prophet saws how would they approach his pool al-kausar when we know that he rejected those of innovation and they would probably react and say yes this is bad and and then later on you may throw to them now they know the Danger and the severity and and of innovation that when you throw it to them and say that oh listen guys I saw people do this and that and this is an innovation we should be careful and you show them what the scholars say that would be something that they may accept you have to use a lot of wisdom and always consider the consequences so that so coming back to our question you have to weigh the pros and cons so that you can of evaluate how to approach them when to approach them and what to approach them with you cannot just bombard them and throw everything in their face and say okay this is innovation this is sinful this is this is this is your guys out of the full of Islam nobody's gonna accept this from you you have to be diplomatic you have to be wise you have to make them respect you and love you before you start giving them such um things in Allah Knows Best"
