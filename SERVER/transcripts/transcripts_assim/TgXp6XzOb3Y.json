  "transcript": "Abdul Rahman from Turkey. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. How are you Sheikh? Alhamdulillah. Okay Sheikh, my question was that actually my uncle, like my father's little brother, he's in UK and he's a liberal. And he asked us that he can't keep fast due to hard work. So he wanted to give money to some people who can keep fast inside of him. So that's permissible in Islam or not? No, it is not permissible in Islam for someone who's fit and has no obstacles in sharia to skip fasting Ramadan and feed poor people for that. A laborer is someone who is healthy, strong, and works for money. So when Allah tells him to fast Ramadan, he says, I can't. Well you are healthier than any of us. What do you mean you can't? No, you must. This is one of the pillars of Islam. You have to fast Ramadan. It's not a choice. It's an obligation and a fard. If you were unable due to age, someone who's 80 years and above, or due to a chronic illness, where doctors say you'll never be recovered from such an illness till the rest of your life, and you are prohibited from fasting because you'll die or your health will deteriorate, in this case, this is a legitimate reason to skip Ramadan. Other than that, laborers who work under the burning sun are obliged to fast. Yes, they fast until 10, 11 o'clock, and by 11 o'clock if they are dehydrated and feel that they will faint or die, they can break their fast only at that particular moment of time, and make up for that day, not feed. Make up when they get their annual vacation, make up when it's winter, make up whenever they have weekends, but they cannot just simply throw Ramadan and not fast it, and Allah knows best. you"
