  "transcript": "um there are videos where people are possessed by jinns and they go to arabi and the art plays reciting quran and these people there are screaming and they make like these movements and then there are cases like making conversation with the gin is this permissible to watch this video or should we avoid that no you should avoid avoid that because in many of such videos these are um made up and they're acting and some of these videos are real but you cannot tell which is right and which is wrong talking to the jinn also involves a lot of wrong things such as believing them and we know that the jinn by default are liars so when they say yes i possess this person because there was a black magic made by his uncle immediately he will accuse the uncle but the genie is a liar he's doing this on purpose to cause fitna and problems and and some people tell me that in these videos the rocky yani does karate or taekwondo or mma and he grabbles with the possessed p what is this sometimes it's from the opposite gender it's a woman it's a girl or so what when this is all not halal stay away from this i had counseling sessions with people thinking that they're possessed by jinn and their lives are destroyed and when i talked to them i discovered and convinced them that this was all bogus it's in their subconscious they saw such videos and their subconscious started playing games on them and then they thought that they were possessed and they started acting like the videos they saw and they said okay yeah i think miami you might be right so stay away from this because it's bad news"
