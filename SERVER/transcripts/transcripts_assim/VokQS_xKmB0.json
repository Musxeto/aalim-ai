  "transcript": "today we continue to talk about the chapter that deals with sutra or screen and we have with us hadith number 100 and eight and the brother would read it for us please reported i came riding on a female donkey and i was on the threshold of maturity and the messenger of allah who allah was leading people in prayer at meena not to a wall i passed in front of the row and got down and sent the donkey for grazing and joined the row and nobody made an objection to it okay the hadith is regarding an issue and that is even ambassador pleased with him who was about to reach the age of puberty which means that he's not a child that people would not talk to and say this is a sin sometimes we have children and they do wrong things they do sinful things but we do not talk to them because they are not at the age of puberty which must make us tell them to stop ibn abbas says i was not like this i was almost close to the age of puberty and i came on a donkey a female donkey and this would not matter to the situation whether it's a male or a female donkey and he passed in front of the worshippers while praying with the prophet of islam in congregation not only that he dismounted and left the donkey to go between the rows so imagine while you're praying the donkey passes in front of you then goes to the following row and passes in front of that and and no one ever spoken a word to ibn abbas imagine if someone next to you while in prayer his mobile goes on with music while you're praying and he keeps it for about 20 30 seconds before turning it off after he turns it off and you finish prayer what do you do surely would talk to him fear allah this is not permissible to have music in your mobile and to add to that you have it in the message this is a extra haram double haram even ambassador no one spoke to him about his donkey that was going through the roads why callers say because it was known to them that the sutra the screen in front of the imam is sufficient for them so nothing harms their prayer nothing affects their prayer because they're praying to an imam and we have hadith 109 and we need the brother to read it for us please aisha reported i used to sleep in the front of messenger of allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam with my legs between him and the qibla when he prostrated himself he pinched me and i drew up my legs and when we stood up i stretched them out she said at the time there was no lamps in the houses very well there are so many lessons to be learned from this great hadith and among them is that allah be pleased with her used to say may allah forgive you why she says you have made us women equivalent to the dogs and to the donkeys i used to sleep in front of the prophet and my legs would be extended between him and the qibla and whenever he once wanted to prostrate he would pinch me so that i would pull my legs and he would have enough space to prostrate and then when he stood up i stretched them as before why did she say such a thing because the companions of the prophet narrated the hadith where the prophet allah in case there is not before him there is the worshipper an object like the back of a saddle remember the height of the sutra should be about a foot high this is the back of a saddle the saddle you put on a camel it's different than the saddle you put on a horse you need a bigger saddle on a camel to protect your back so the prophet is saying that as in case that there is nothing before him or in front of him like the back of a saddle a muslim's prayer would be cut off would be nullified the word is cut off by the passing of a donkey a woman and a black dog and when he was asked what's the difference between a yellow dog and a black dog the prophet said allah a black dog is a devil so aisha may allah be pleased with her she objected to this hadith and her understanding was that this is not logical because i used to sleep in front of the prophet and this did not nullify this did not cut off his prayer so the hadith she rejected because she believed that it was not authentic hadith or at least it was not as they understood it the companions but this understanding of ishmael be pleased with her we consider it to be rejected why because the hadith was narrated by abu hurairah and abdullah and abu dharr may allah be pleased with them all so all of this means that the hadith is authentic and it's not a mistake of one man it was narrated by three companions so definitely is it is accepted and this is why if you add to this objection of aisha plus what abdullah abbas said regarding the donkey that was walking in front of people this is why scholars differed in understanding or accepting the hadith that i've mentioned to you about the three things that cut off the prayer some of them said i do not accept this hadith because the other hadiths seem to contradict with it only with the dog it's okay for example says that the dog cuts the prayer but women do not because hadith when she was sleeping and the donkey does not because when he made the the donkey go between the rows other scholars say and then the majority that the prayer is not nullified it is not cut off but it is reduced in reward meaning that if these three pass in front of you then your reward has been reduced however the most authentic opinion of scholars is that the hadith is correct and you cannot simply say that it is unjustifiable therefore i will not accept it and the scholars who accepted this hadith as it is answered the doubts casted by those who rejected the hadith by saying the hadith is clear the sutra of the imam is sutra to those who are behind him therefore it doesn't affect their prayer to have the donkey going between their rows as for passing of women the hadith of islam be pleased with her does not say that she passed on the country she was stationary she was there she did not pass and this is the difference scholars say if my wife my sister my daughter was sitting can i pray to her as a sutra they say yes you can because the hadith tells us what nullifies your prayer is not her being in front of you it's her passing in front of you so i can pray to my daughter when she's sitting in front of me as a sutra but if i'm praying and she comes and passes in front of me my prayer is nullified it's void why is that this is what the prophet said allah and this is the choice of ibn taymiyyah and abner and other great scholars of islam who say that this is the norm if these three things a woman who has reached puberty not a young girl a young girl does not affect your prayer a woman who has reached puberty whether she is so even if your wife passes in front of you even if your sister your daughter your mother this nullifies your prayer and a donkey any type of donkey so a donkey a mule male female does not change the fact and a dog providing that the dog is a black dog why because a black dog is a devil and scholars commented what is meant by a devil is it meant to be that he is from the jinn or anything else scholars say that devil is anything that has gone out of its way in evil and the most evil of all dogs are the usually uh those who are black and that is why due to their devilish character not because they are jinn due to their devilish character and evil that they have in them they nullify the prayer and some scholars say that nevertheless it is a possibility that the gin can go into these black dogs and they can't take the shape of black dogs we know that gin have or the devils and the generally speaking have the ability to change their form to transform from one being to the other they have the ability to adapt so it can also be that the black dog is a devil we have a short break stay tuned and inshaallah will be right back and welcome back so how about the donkeys scholars say that the authentic hadith of the prophet states that if you hear the donkey what is the sound of the donkey bark or bray barking is for dogs and brey is for donkeys and this is why you should be careful when you talk to non-muslims and tell them that we pray because one of the arabs wants to study english in one of the english countries and they told him speak to us about your religion so it did he told them that we believe in the existence of one god and the prophet muhammad is his messenger and we pray and the teacher was shocked you pray says yes i pray she says why he said because this is my religion allah tells us to pray and she understood the teacher she understood but she wanted to teach him a lesson and she said all muslims he said yes all muslims pray five times a day so then she explained to him pray is to worship allah which you should have said praying is the sound of a donkey and muslims don't pray so the prophet told us how islam when you hear the donkey brain this is because it saw a shaytan so seek refuge in allah likewise when we hear a rooster voice and this is usually in the early mornings what should we do the prophet tells us whenever you hear a rooster ask allah from his grace why the prophet says because it saw an angel and when you ask allah from his grace the angel would convey this to allah all of this shows you how muslims are interacting with the environment with everything even with the sound of animals because everything worships allah azzawajal and we either ask allah for what benefits us or asks allah azza to grant us refuge and protects us from what harms us as for the women scholars say that they cut off the prayer because of their beauty of their charm but this is not the only reason because if your mother passes in front of you you're not gonna be lured by her beauty and charm she's your mother and likewise if your daughter passes in front of you therefore this justification is not the most authentic or the the most accepted justification before mother aisha allah pleased with her in the hadith when she said that when the prophet pinched her scholars said that this is evidence that touching a woman does not nullify your wudu and this is in answering to what al-imam shafi may allah have mercy on his soul says when he said that if a man touches a woman even if she is his mother or sister or wife this nullifies his wudu the hadith here clearly states that this is not correct and the majority of scholars say touching your wife touching your sister is permissible it does not affect your wudu on the contrary be pleased with her said that the prophet salallahu sallam used to kiss one of his wives and go to prayer without wudu so this is not touching this is even more this is kissing and one of the narrators of the hadith most likely it is her nephew said i bet that you are the one who he used to kiss before going to prayer and she laughed meaning that this is the fact this is true therefore we learn from different sources what affects our religion so if someone went and followed the shafi medha in this aspect now he knows that it doesn't nullify wudu and he has to follow the hadith of the prophet salallahu salaam because the prophet used to kiss and pray without performing wudu also from this hadith we learn the standard of living of our prophet a man who lived with his nation with his followers for 23 years a man who conquered so many places and gained a lot of booty and distributed all of that keeping nothing for him the least he could have had was a big house to live in however what was his house like it was so small it was so narrow it was so low to the extent that the it had no space for him to prostrate while mother aisha was asleep so it was not even two by three meters it was probably two by one and a half meters just enough for people to spend their time sitting maybe sleeping it's sufficient for two to sleep but it was not at all enough for a man and his woman to one to sleep and want to pray and this shows us how hard our prophet's life was not because he could not afford it on the contrary he had money but it was not his money it was for the sake of the ummah and that is why he did not spend anything on himself one of the great signs of corruption is that when a person is corrupt you will see traces on his house he would have a big mansion and probably a number of cars and lots of costumes and jewelry and he would live the things that he had collected what's the point on collecting things and leaving it for your offspring to enjoy after your death you must enjoy it however with the prophet it was not allah the same thing he lived the life of a monk and in the morning he was a warrior at that night he was a monk in prayer he distributed anything that came to him to the poor to the extent that once he prayed the prayer and after he finished the prayer immediately after giving salam he went to his house in a manner on fashion that was the first for the companions to see and when he came back they told him prophet of allah you did something that scared us you never finished the prayer and stood up immediately he said while in prayer i remembered that i had few golden coins in some narration i had some raw material of gold timber which i did not distribute for salah and i was afraid to keep it so long and it wasn't his he wanted to give it to sadaqah but because it was in his home he immediately quickly finished the prayer and went and distributed it this shows us that our prophet was not a king and he was not someone who was interested in this dunya he lived like a messenger like a servant of allah azzawajal and died like a servant of allah and the only thing he left behind after his death was a small property in fadak in khaibar if i'm not mistaken and during which he used to get the income from that land to live the whole year and when he died abu bakr may allah be pleased with him took that land and put it back in the treasury of the muslims and fatima allah pleased with her was angered by that because she thought that she had right in it and he told her you know that i love you more than i love my daughters because you are the daughter of the prophet but you also know that the prophet salallahu salaam said that we messengers we prophets of allah we do not leave inheritance so whatever money the prophet had it had to go back to the treasury any rich person any tyrant any corrupt person would have made sure that all of his offspring and relatives and close uh loved ones would get a portion of that not our prophet why because he was the cream of allah's creation he was the elite and he was the messenger and prophet of allah that allah has sent him a mercy to mankind compare his life to our life compare the time he used to spend that night prayer to our times compare how he used to wake his wives to offer witter with him because he used to pray longer than they used to pray except when it's time for witter he used to wake aisha to pray with him with your prayer all of this gives us a clear message how the prophet's life was alex and it also gives us how far we are from practicing and following the prophet are way of living regarding the dogs we know that at the beginning dogs were instructed to be killed all over medina the prophet instructed them to kill all kind of dogs and after a while this was abrogated and he permitted them to keep the dogs in medina but to kill the dog that was black and he said and indicated that a black dog must be killed from this we learn those who have black dogs and they use them as guarding dogs they should get rid of them you can get dogs that guard your house your property or your sheep your cattle or your farm or the dogs that you use for hunting but avoid black dogs because this is the instruction of the prophet is salaam this is all the time we have until we meet next a"
