  "title": "Can I repeat the same Surah in all the rakahs of the Prayer? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "can the same surah be recited in all four records of sunnah prayer and can the same surah be recited in old raka of ford prayer as yes can you explain he didn't ask in the question so the answer is yes but I'll give you a bonus the prophet alayhi salaatu Sam was reported that he prayed fetcher I'm not recalling it wrongly inshallah I'm recalling it correctly he prayed fetcher in Mina and he prayed in the first record either as rule 0 till Aldo's in salah ha and in the second raka he repeated the same surah which means that there is no problem and at all in repeating the same surah in the whole prayer not only that in Buhari and elsewhere there was a companion of the prophet Isaiah who led his companions in prayer and in each raka he would recite all who Allahu Ahad in addition to a different surah so his companion said listen either you recite would who Allah had alone or recite a different surah alone but why combine them in each and every rakah he said this is the way are you going I'm going to pray you don't like this appoint someone else to lead you so that went to the Prophet I summon complaint that he's repeating who who Allah had in every rakah so the Prophet asked them to go and ask him why do you do that so the man answered because it is a description of Allah and I love this surah so the Prophet said at a solemn tell him that Allah loves him because he loves the surah so the Prophet did not tell him do not repeat the surah in every rakah he approved that which means that this is permissible but it is not sooner what do you mean it's permissible but this is not sooner the Prophet approved of it yes the Prophet approved of it to indicate that it was permissible but he had never done it himself which means that it is not sooner you can do it but it is not Sunnah of the Prophet Ali Saleh to sir so I hope this answers your question but before moving on to the following question it is important to know and acknowledge again and again and again that reciting surah after fatiha is not mandatory so whether you recite the fat hand the whole four records without anything with it prayers valid if you recite the fatiha with a surah in the first two rakahs and not in the last two Rakas correct and according to the Sunnah if you recite the surah in four records no problem in that at all"
