  "title": "Shake hands & say Taqabbalna minna wa minkum (May Allah accept..) after fard prayer? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": " is it an innovation to say and shake hands after false prayers so is it an innovation after every fourth prayer to shake hands and to say and he says or the likes to know we have to go a bit back in history and see whether the prophet Allah did this or not companions did this and this is a Sunnah if it was never reported that they shook hands with one another or congratulated one another then it is not part of the Sunnah at all and it is something that is considered to be an innovation and we have to refrain and stay away from it therefore to say this after every fourth prayer this is an innovation after every thought prayer if I see someone I hadn't seen in a very long time and I shake hands with him and I greet him there's no problem in that but the concept of making Dua that Allah accepts your prayer after every fault prayer this is a an innovation and it is not part of the Sunnah at all"
