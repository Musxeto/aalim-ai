  "title": "Last verses of Surah Al Imran revealed to the Prophet ‎ﷺ | assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "These verses are the last verses of Surat Al-Imran. The last ten verses beginning with Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day are signs for those of understanding who remember Allah while standing or sitting or lying on their sides and give thought to the creation of the heavens and the earth, saying, Our Lord, You did not create this aimlessly. Exalted are You above such a thing. Then protect us from the punishment of fire. What a beautiful set of ayat. The Prophet ﷺ reacted to such verses and his reaction was illustrated by his weeping, his fear of Allah, his appreciation to such huge and great creation of Allah Azza Wa Jal that the creator of all of this majesty and greatness is the creator of me and I have so many sins, I have so many shortcomings and flaws, yet I still have this arrogance in me, I still think of myself as something worthwhile. It means that I'm not comparing myself to the environment, to my country, to my continent, to earth, to this solar system we're in or this galaxy which contains millions of other solar systems or these millions of galaxies around the world. Who am I to have this arrogance and to refuse to worship Allah, to refuse to pray on time? Who am I to indulge in such filth and sins which Allah abhors and resents, yet I continue to do them knowing that Allah is watching me and Allah is listening to what I'm listening to. If I don't contemplate upon these things, what will I contemplate upon? We have a short break, stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back."
