  "title": "Is my prayer valid if my toes don't face the qiblah? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "if I pre-book my tools are not directly towards the couple other like about 20 degrees away is my career valid am I when I'm standing up there are things that are part of the Sunnah and if you don't do them this has no impact on your Salat so Scholars say that you have to stand ideally with your feet towards the Qibla however the normal posture is like this some people can't stay like this straight ahead but a lot of people would find pain in their knee joints when they stand like this so if you stand like this okay that's proper if you stand normally like this this is proper if you're like Donald Duck and you go a little bit too extreme to the right and left there's the prayer is valid but this is not the right posture and the right way to stand especially if you are next to people in Jamara some people even go this extreme and this is not from the Sunnah and Allah knows best but either way your prayer is valid inshallah"
