  "transcript": "[Music] one of my friend adopted lady friend adopted a girl and she want to give all her inheritance to her she did what she adopted a girl okay baby girl and can is she allowed to give her all inheritance to her okay i will answer allah tani from the u.s a woman adopted a girl and this girl she wants to leave all of her money for her is this permissible first of all adoption in islam is not permissible sponsoring an orphan or taking someone in your custody is permissible he's rewardable but to take someone who's not related to you and say that he's my son or my daughter and give them your name and your lineage and consider them to be part of your blood relations this is totally prohibited in islam as mentioned in surah 33 where allah abolished and stopped adoption of such nature but let's assume that this woman took this orphan whether a relation to her or not and took her under her wing considered her to be her daughter though she kept her real name and not called her after herself she has one of two options option number one to write a will giving her all of her property and wealth and this will is invalid because in islam a muslim cannot write a will donating more than one third of his wealth to someone who is not a heir so if i were to write a will saying that 50 of my wealth is to be given to message it so and so or to build a masjid or an orphanage or a school when i die this will is invalid only one third of my wealth can be allocated and dedicated to this masjid or to that individual or to that organization one third this is option one option two during her life this woman can simply go and transfer all of her wealth her money her uh states and property to the name of this girl which means that after doing this if the girl all of a sudden says hey mom thanks for the transfer i'm selling everything and i'm leaving in a cruise around the world with my boyfriend she can't do anything and that would not be a very smart move so these are the only two options either to write a will after her death to be executed regarding one-third of her wealth not more or to give whatever she wants to give to that girl in her life but this means that she has full possession and control over that which she had given her as a gift in her life you"
