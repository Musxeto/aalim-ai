  "transcript": "alaykum wa rahmatullah good evening and welcome to with the Prophet I am Ali Coleman our beer a host for today's show and our subject is the rich those who are endowed with material wealth in this material plane of our existence to open up and expand this conversation on this subject looking at how the Prophet peace and blessings be upon him deal with the rich during his lifetime is Sheikh Azam al-hakim assalamu alaikum and welcome Ronny come Saddam what Allah he of allocator and Zachman lucky for having me I pleasure to have you I'd like to open up by talking about an Algerian writer he was a medical doctor psychiatrist from Algeria France fedone he's very famous Algerian he wrote in the 1960s one of his most famous works was called the wretched of the earth and in this book as a psychiatrist he analyzed the colonized Arab in African peoples who were coming in the 60s emerging out of colonialism the era of national independence movements was sweeping across the continent both Africa and Asia and he said that the colonized peoples have a schizophrenia we suffer from a love-hate relationship with our colonizer we hate his oppression of us his occupation of our lands his control of our resources but at the same time we admire him for his wealth his great success so on and so forth and so he he diagnosed us in hole as saying that we had this schizophrenia my question is about the Islamic view what does Islam push in terms of valuing one or the other is he right should we does Islam provide the solution of this schizophrenia that France France for known diagnosed us with should we not be admiring the rich should we be focused more on a different perspective [Music] yeah I'm bad the prophet alayhi salatu salam told us in an authentic hadith whenever one of you wants to look at someone else he must look at those who are below his level this is worthy that you do not despise Allah blessings and favours upon you what does this hadith mean if i am blessed with so many things and i'd like to compare what i have with others the Prophet tells us look at those who are less privileged then you would appreciate the gifts of Allah Sojin upon you while if you look above you you'll hurt your neck and you will despise whatever you have so if you're driving a car look at those who are driving or riding a motorbike and if you have a motorbike look at those who have a bicycle to appreciate what you have if you have a bicycle look at those who walk and if you walk look at those who are sitting in a wheelchair and so on mmm now having said that this is regarding the worldly materialistic things if it if it were to be in religious practice it should be the other way around so if Allah favored you and blessed you with certain level of Eman when you want to look look above you do not look below you so for example if I pray my 5 prayers in the message it don't be happy and say or humble I'm better than those who don't pray in the masjid but rather say oh those above me pray 5 times and they offer night prayers so they're better than me and you try your level best to catch up to them now having said that what is best do we have to favor one over the other does Islam tell us yeah that this is better than this it's best to be wealthy than to be poor or it's best to be poor and patient than to be wealthy I've mentioned this in previously the book of ammonal idiom may Allah have mercy on him the student of heaven taymiyah and the book is called the red day - sabrine whether here - Shakir in which investigates who's better and who's best and there is a lot of info in this regards and scholars differed but the most authentic opinion would be that whoever is more in righteousness is better than the other so they came up with this answer saying that okay what if this person who's poor but patient is in the same level of righteousness as this wealthy who is grateful okay so who's best it seems Allahu Alem that the wealthy is better why because though the poor person is patient and doesn't have the money to do since yet the rich the wealthy who is grateful and is giving money in the cause of Allah his benefit far exceeds the benefits of the poor I see all right shake let me make sure I understand you're saying that what on one hand if we are to look around us at the people around us we should if anything looked down at those who are less fortunate and not up and be grateful for what little we have okay but on the other side when it comes to measuring the potential benefits to the Muslim Ummah both materially and spiritually there are more opportunities for those who are who are well-off than those who are in power first is is it did I get you correctly yes indeed see though Islam does not recommend poverty hmm it highly recommends that you benefit others and you cannot do that without the financial means and if you look at that 10 heaven-bound companions so these are the top 10 mm-hmm the top seeded in the Ummah of Islam you'll find that six or seven of them were wealthy not only well-off they were extremely wealthy mm-hmm now their wealth when you come and look at it you would find that it was never a form of hindrance it was never an obstacle from for them to get closer to Allah on the contrary they got closer to Allah by spending so I see I see because not everyone has that character it's about character some have the the means to destroy themselves with wealth and we've seen it many times and this is when the Prophet Allah saw some also used to seek refuge in Allah from the trial of or the fitna of wealth hmm so there is a fitna and a trial of poverty mm-hmm but also there is one for wealth yes in terms of physical appearances I've known and I'm sure you've known a few wealthy people and many might be surprised to know that they don't they're not as showy as the middle class or no class want to show everything you know I'm driving this car I've got new clothes I've got all this not so much with the wealthy they they're more quick to conceal their wealth and try to blend in what does the what about this subject of our physical appearance when it comes to being among those who are wealthy see we have to make a distinction in okay there is a difference between branding in and between showing what is not true okay why do I say this the companions or I just talked about the ten heaven-bound mm they didn't stand in a crowd with the way they looked or the things they were perceived by the others they blended in naturally and they wore normal clothes there's nothing wrong in that what is wrong is to give the impression that you poor that you needy I say so the hadith of Malik am NOT Allah may Allah be pleased with him he said then I came once to the Prophet Ali Saleh true son and the Prophet took a look at me and said do you have wealth I said yes or prophet of Allah I do say what kind of money and wealth you have said I have everything I've sheep I have cows I have camels and have a lot of money and then the Prophet said that is salat wa salam if Allah gives you wealth then show it let it be a parent on you okay now how do I do I understand this I understand this that Malik Mela be pleased with him went to meet the Prophet I saw to Salaam with torn clothes untidy hair and maybe signs that he was not at all well off mm-hmm and the Prophet corrected that hmm in contrast to what in contrast to showing off so showing off because of the wealth you have is something that is abhorred by allah azza wajal and it might even take that individual straight to hell so so even for whether we're talking about wealthy people who can truly afford or the middle class people who going into debt to get stuff to look like they're well off both are wrong both are wrong with me it might need a little bit of explanation mmm let's let's get to explanation we're ready for our break Sheikh will come back to continue Shola as-salaam-alaikum welcome back to with the profit we're continuing our conversation about the rich with Sheikh Azam lraqi before the break we had started to open up this thing about could what we call conspicuous consumption people want to buy the symbolic products of status to show off to the world that they are better off and the Prophet spoke directly to that long muscle salamati the prophet sallallaahu seldom prohibited the wealthy from overdoing it hmm so usually if you're wealthy you tend to make that show in the sense that you may cross the line in the end for example like a person who drags his garment behind him when it is lower than your ankles it's a sinful the Prophet told us how they saw to him that there was an incident when a man was so arrogant and proud of himself walking happy with his way his hair is done dragging his garment when allah azza wajal made him drop deep down in the earth in an earthquake like or something of the sort so this is totally prohibited those who cannot afford it also are prevented from imitating and trying to go out of the way to look like the rich so many times people ask me what's the ruling on wearing fake brands and I tell them fake brands are for fake people if you're not original if you don't have the money mm-hmm don't sweat it don't don't try to do something or to be someone who you are not now when we come to making all those favors and blessing appear upon us meaning that you wear clean clothes and not necessarily brand it you wear something that smells good and you do not portray the picture of someone who is poor and needy and as if you're rejecting all those favors and blessings upon you all right it brings to mind my grandparents they lived during the Great Depression in the United States and before she passed away she she to her dying day my grandmother used to always tell us because it really made a deep impression on her going through the Depression era no matter what your circumstance there's no reason for you to always keep your clothes clean even if it's holy keep them clean and pressed and that what that was her thing for us we're talking about deceiving people by making them trying at least to make them think that we're better off than we really are through conspicuous consumption this deception is also it also features when it comes to business transactions the Prophet peace be upon him was careful to instruct business persons not to deceive people in the marketplace can you address that please the most famous incident which all Muslims know by heart man rashanna Felice Amina the Prophet went to the market wants a lease awesome and he saw a pile of wheat barley whatever and he inserted his hand inside this pile its grain so he found wetness anyway no you know when when grain has wetness and it makes it trot hmm so he said Oh owner of the shop what is this wetness I'm finding he's it Oh prophet of Allah last night it rained so the rain got into the surface of it so I turned it over so only the dry part is apparent mm-hmm said the Prophet said I some why didn't you leave it as it is so that people could see it right whoever cheats the Muslims is not among us he wanted us to believe that perhaps if somebody had been dealt with wrongly at his shop that it was not his intention and so the Prophet peace be upon him is correcting that whether it's intentional or not you have to show the people the defects I cannot sell you a car without telling you that the engine is broken or it had an accident that is serious and will affect your decision whether to buy or not the Prophet used to array his salat WA Salam go to the marketplace and roam around checking on people telling them this is halal this is haram teaching them and he used to address them and he says to them all merchants on the day of judgment the merchants will be resurrected as sinful as people of hellfire except those who fear allah who are righteous and who speak the truth by far businessmen are one of the greatest liars maybe second to politicians and why is that I want to make the deal successful so I make light to you and I tell you look my car is beautiful this brand new is couple of years old you love it and if you ask me straight questions I may lie and I tell you yeah yeah yeah that in auctions where I come from in Saudi those who make the auctions when they get they just want to sell so they get a car you know on display and the people interested in buying our listening so the guy holds up the microphone and says this car is a piece of trash it doesn't go forward it doesn't go backwards it doesn't have oil and the engine then windows cannot be rolled down it's broken and you see the car is Exim yeah so when you buy the car and find a defect is it okay you told me a set of lies so this is why those who deal in selling and buying they lie a lot they cheat a lot they want to make a bargain even if it causes them to enter - important for Muslims to take their money their revenues from halal sources I'd like to bring up this subject as well and and there's this whole Halal industry that has come up the economists Islamic finance persons put the Halal industry in the trillions of dollars at least approaching two trillion dollars halal food allow cosmetics halau clothing allow tourism packages for whatever this is a subject of halal sources of money is important for Muslims to be careful of very much like buying you know showing defects in the things when you're selling them we have to know the roots of where our monies are coming from the Prophet told us allahís a lot o Salaam that any flesh that grows out of Haram income Hellfire is more worthy of it hmm the issue of halal is like the Pandora Box if you open it you will find yourself flooded with issues not that it is difficult on the contrary it's very straightforward the issue of halal in Islam it's straightforward transactions when it comes to food when it comes to everything else it is easily made unfortunately it's the wealth that corrupts people see why would I lie to you and try to sell you something when it is not halal I would just stick the label on it considering it to be halong so I'd tell you fish and I'd say it's halal fish mm-hmm well any ignorant notes that all seafood is halal you don't have to slaughter it I'll make a movie and consider it to be allowed at the end of the day you have belly dancers pretending to be dancing in her lap what is this they are abusing the terminology yeah when it comes to wealth the prophet alayhi salat wa sallam told us in a beautiful hadith there are four things in another hadith 5 that the feet of the sons of Adam would not move an inch on the day of judgement and there until they are questioned about mm-hmm one of them is your wealth where you gained it from and where you spent it in so this hadith is scary to those who have wealth there is a big problem of the source of your income where did it come from is it is it enough to spend with the right intention or are you saying that we also have to be careful about whoever we're investing in what products we're buying isn't is not just enough to declare a good intention and then to spend the money the intention has great deal in it but also the means share the exact portion so in order for your deeds to be accepted you have to have two conditions one the good intention the sincerity yeah - that the deed is in accordance to the Quran and Sunnah okay so if someone wants to give dower that's a good intention but if you go to a nightclub and dance with a girl who's none Muharram to give her that WA this is the bad means of doing it likewise when making money if you make money with the good intention but through the wrong means no it's like a prostitute working she's a working girl working woman so she claims and she gains money I want to put myself through college to be a medical doctor and help people while by doing this this is this is even better no there is a prostitute who works the night and whatever she gets she feeds the orphans what are you doing she says I'm doing good deeds yes but the means were wrong so do not feed the orphans and do not fornicate so again to gain money is a good thing but where did it come from is most important and not only that what did you spend it in okay the five did you want to complete the five where we're almost out of time I'm not sure if you want to end on that note or we got about a minute and a half left okay did you want to go through all five you said we won't go through judgment unless we asked about wealth okay the Prophet said as I said I'm Lent Azula Kodama evening Adam had to say Allah and Abba until he's asked about four or five mmm and Shah Baba he FEMA Ofner about his youth what did he use that youth about his age his life not only the period of youth even when he grows old and or AHIMA of na and Shah Baba he FEMA habla and Malley he about his wealth where he gained it and when he had spent it and about his knowledge what did he do about it so all of these things I can learn I can read I can memorize but what did I do with the knowledge that I have received and there are forms of wealth it's someone can be wealthy and knowledge with with vibrant energy we help with with health with wealth correct all of them are great resources that we can use true to benefit ourselves and those who depend on us and they'll may at large check thank you so much for being with us and we look forward to more episodes insha'Allah I'm hoping to do that as well that ends our episode for today with our discussion about the rich we look forward to more episodes with Sheikh Azam inshallah until then assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullahu apricot"
