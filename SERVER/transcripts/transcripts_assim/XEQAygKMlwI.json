  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] can dear brothers and sisters in Islam and we will talk today about another beautiful Hadith that the prophet Alat teaches us in it what is happening to our hearts Abu Hur may Allah be pleased with him says the prophet sallallahu alaih Ali wasallam said when a servant when a slave of Allah commits a sin a black spot appears on his heart if he gives it up seeks forgiveness and repents his heart heart will be cleansed it will be polished however if he repeats it the Blackness will spread until it overtakes his heart and seals it this is the Ron covering of the sins and evil Deeds that Allah mentioned in the Quran Allah says no rather the stain has covered their hearts of that which they were earning this Hadith indicates clearly the impact of sins over our hearts and that it is that is these sin the main cause of the darkness of the hearts and the pro and the prophet Alam gives us in this Hadith the remedy of such an illness and that is to leave the sins and to repent to Allah from it Allah says or the prophet says if he gives it up seeks forgiveness and repents his heart will be cleansed and Polished so this means that quitting the sin repenting asking Allah for forgiveness Allah is telling us that man has been created ated and in his DNA signs of weakness flaws flaw and a lot of shortcomings and that it is inevitable that man by nature would make sins so he is instructed whenever he falls weak and he commits such sins he's ordered to ask Allah for forgiveness and we all need to seek Allah's forgiveness because by day and night we sin frequently Allah Asel has mentioned in the Quran multiple times that we must repent that we must seek Allah's forgiveness the prophet saidat all son of Adam All Sons of Adams are sinners and the best of Sinners are those who frequently repent so it's not an issue to sin yes it's something that Allah abhor and is it's something that Allah ordered us to stay away from but no matter how big your sin is it's not an issue the issue is when you abandon repentance so Allah has taken into consideration the nature of the humans and ordered them with what they can bear and made a cure for such illnesses when we say that the problem is in abandoning repentance this is what Shan is focusing on so Shan acts in levels and layers the first layer the most important layer is that you fall into sin mission accomplished if you do so now reaching the top is difficult maintaining the peak is the hardest of all so shaan doesn't want you only to commit a sin he wants you to maintain committing that sin over and over and adding things to it without repentance because if you repent you will go back to where you started from Iman doing good deeds and being a servant of Allah he doesn't want that so he wants you to abandon repentance and look around your siblings your relatives your friends rather look in the mirror how often do you sin this is not an issue how often do you repent this this is the issue because if you repent quit the sin ask Allah for forgiveness Allah will polish your heart and it will become brand new Shan doesn't want you to do this the students of alhassan Al basri came to him with a gloomy face complaining that we commit sins and we repent and ask Allah for forgiveness then we fall back into these sins and we repent and ask Allah for forgiveness then we fall back and do these things sins again then we are ashamed of Allah so we stop repenting and asking Allah for forgiveness alassan albas said this is exactly what Shan wants instead the more you do sins the more you repent the fine lining here is that as humans we know this theoretically the more you sin the more you should repent and ask Allah for forgiveness however we will come to a crossroad where we would think that okay I'm encouraged to do sins let me do sins and I'll repent here is when your repentance is not accepted why because it's not genuine repentance means that you have to quit the sin intend not to do it and to be remorseful this remorse is the essence of repentance but because you've engaged in so many sins there is no remorse in the heart anymore so I just say when are we going to do it again tomorrow or next week or next month so you're planning to it there's no remorse and this is a very dangerous trick that Satan plays with our heads when we repent we have to be remorseful and we have to ask Allah sincerely and genuinely for forgiveness because we know Allah's wrath and torment the prophet saysat however if he repeats it that is the sin then the Blackness will spread until it overtakes his heart and seals it this is what is known as Aran is the covering of sins and evil Deeds that covers the heart Allah mentioned this in the Quran when he said subhah no rather the stain has covered their hearts of that which they were earning and in this is a real serious dire warning that you keep on insisting on doing these sins and abandoning Toba abandoning repentance Allah is telling us that these sins darkens the heart and extinguishes its light Iman is the light of the heart and these heinous sins take it away or reduces it so good deeds increase in illuminating your heart bad deeds and sins will would extinguish that light and this Hadith is an explanation of the r that covers the heart Imam says those people of tap said that ran is a sin over a sin over a sin until the whole heart it becomes black IM mujah said it is the man committing a sin and the sin overwhelms his heart then he commits another sin and it keeps on overwhelming his heart as Allah mentioned inah Bak yes on the contrary whoever earns evil and his sins has encompassed him those are the companions of the fire and the Hadith illustrates the impact sins have on our hearts and there are many many places in the Quran where Allah tells us that Allah has cursed and doomed the Hypocrites due to their earnings what earnings are we talking about financial earnings rather their sins Allah says what is the matter with you that is addressing the Hypocrites that you are two groups concerning the Hypocrites Allah is telling the companions why are you differing regarding the Hypocrites while Allah has made them fall back into error and disbelief for what they earned so Allah punished them by falling back into error and disbelief due to their earning due to their sins and also Allah tells us that breaking their your Covenant with Allah and with the people this is one of the greatest reasons for your hearts to be stiff and hard Allah says so for their breaking of the Covenant we cursed them and made their hearts hardened this is the second punishment or the first punishment because of their breaking of the Covenant they their hearts became hard what else due also to they distort the words from their proper places so because of changing the scripture Allah hardened their hearts and have forgotten a portion of that which they were reminded and they've neglected the knowledge that they've been given all of these led to their hearts to be hardened and this exactly fits us like a glove if we keep on sinning and not paying attention to what we're committing most of the Muslims are oblivious I'm not talking about major major sins this would be the ultimate goal of Shan but he starts small watching movies listening to music free mixing not caring about your if you're a woman not caring about wearing the hijab theab wearing makeups uh uh adorning yourself if you're a man not caring about exposing your thighs and being nude or whatever taking inappropriate pictures start small then you go up to lying cheating go to bribes dealing with uh ribba and interest and stealing and the and the likes then you have your heart filled with a lot of sins that would tarnish it skipping Salat skipping fasting engaging in things that Hypocrites would be more than happy to give a helping hand all of these are sins that would fill the heart with illnesses and weaken the heart so a human being who's healthy and strong once he's affected by fever and illness he will would soon collapse and becomes weaker and weaker by the day this illness and fever to the heart are the sins that overwhelms the heart and covers it before you know it you are dead meat before you know it you are ruined in this life in your grave and in the Hereafter this is why we have no other choice but to reflect on our lives wake up what are you doing how many years have passed and you've been ignorant negligent and oblivious how many prayers you've missed how many days you've skipped how many times you've missed the opportunity that Allah has given you to get closer to him and to enter paradise and you rejected it and you're still doing it what are you waiting for when are you going to quit repent ask Allah for forgiveness so that Allah would polish your heart and make it clean aren't you sad that you hear the verses of the Quran you're not able to contemplate you're not able to find the sweetness you're unable to weep when you hear the mentioning of Hellfire in the day of judgment and the torment of Allah and his wrath you're not you're not afraid and all of this because of your sins that have tarnished and covered Ed and hardened and blackened your heart this Hadith is something that we have to and must reflect upon so that Allah hopefully would guide our hearts to return back to him to repent and ask him for forgiveness and never to despair from his mercy so many people are despairing of Allah's mercy and think that Allah will never forgive me Allah will put me in Hell there's no hope for me at all this is insane Allah's beautiful names include Alman Al Al Al Al Alim Al all these beautiful names the most merciful the most compassionate the one who forgives the frequently forgiver the one who accepts repentance from people and guides them to repent the forbearer the kind the most generous all of this you put aside and insist that Allah would punish you why why don't you acknowledge Allah's mercy and come to him but if you don't come to him Allah will seal your heart will darken your heart will make it stiff and hard until it is dead may Allah protect us all"
