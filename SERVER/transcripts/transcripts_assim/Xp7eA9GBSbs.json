  "title": "Wiswas / OCD with wiping or cleaning impurity from Objects | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "from india he says he has a problem with wiping solid objects and brothers and sisters the issue of with is prevailing as i always say in my counseling sessions to the brothers shaytaan focuses on how you think if you are inclined to religion you fear allah you feel hellfire you fear impurity you love quran salat et cetera he increases in this viswas i'm not going to talk about the other part and this is why you're getting these whispers people spend half an hour in the toilet answering the call of nature how many people are on earth eight billion does anyone else suffer the same that you do say no i'm the only one so subhanallah yeah and you the chosen one the shaitaan is messing up with your mind so now to us muslims what renders this to be pure or impure this tablet is it pure or impure this pad is it pure impure what makes it pure and pure is it my inclination is it my gut feeling no it is the quran the sunnah that tells us if there is an impurity it's nj's if there's no impurity it's not nudges how do i know if there is purity or not impurity or not well by evidence evidences that can stand in a court of law your gut feeling doesn't do so this pen the cameraman gave it to me before i started the show now i don't know if the cameraman touched it with impure hands or not because he just came out of the toilet before coming to the studio and giving it to me so now i'm having my doubts because i wrote with it and i scratched no no let the camera come back to my face don't i scratch my beard with my hands so my hand is not just my bead is not just my thumb is not just where did you get these weird ideas from oh because the cameraman came out of the toilet okay and he touched the pen okay and there is a probability wait there is a what probability oh it's is it certainty or doubtful no it's doubtful if it's doubtful throw it in the dustpan oh i can't share why because i have these doubts i said listen you were born out of wedlock your mom did not marry your father before she conceived you they were boyfriend and girlfriend i'm shocked  how dare you say such such a thing said why were you there when they got married you weren't there you didn't see anything so you were a bastard excuse my french you were born out of wedlock so no they were married check you don't know no no i'm certain how are you certain everybody knows about the check i have a marriage contract i have a birth certificate ah you have evidences that can stand in a court of law said yes prove to me that the pen is impure how can i do that sheikh by seeing visible traces of feces there's nothing on that by smelling it or tasting it i wouldn't advise you to do that but these are the evidences that take such whispers and manipulation of shaytan out of your head otherwise you're going to be stuck till the end of your life and it's gonna cascade to all aspects of your life even to marriage and divorce by the way because i've i'm doing such counseling for couples that have these weird ideas that they might be divorced and i have to spend so many hours with them convincing them that they're not so it's a rule in islam it's one of the legal maxims certainty is not affected by doubt so now let us hypothetically assume there is traces of thesis on your mobile what to do bring a tissue and wipe it until there are no traces okay the tissue is dirty throw it and bring something else if there are other traces but you don't wash it because soft and surfaces that are not hard see this wood is hard there are small spots in it if there is an impurity wiping it would not remove it because it's there's still some particles of it on a mobile phone when it has a glass surface or a metal surface that is so polished and so straightforward wiping it does the job like a blade like a knife like a sword if you wipe it and there are no traces of impurity on it it is totally pure and allah knows best but to think that oh sheikh i washed or i wiped it and then it transferred to my hand and to from my hand it transferred to the whole house what is this coronavirus what is this this is insane a small drop of urine or muddy you think that it penetrates your underwear and then it penetrates your genes and then penetrates the blanket and then it spreads all over the the floor it's the blop it's it's this monstrous thing that goes and creeps and and eats everything consumes everything this is not islam you're not following islam you're following shaytan so be careful and wake up"
