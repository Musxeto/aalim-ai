  "title": "Postponing the Burial to wait for relatives to come - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "his second question was about a woman who died in India and they've washed her they offered Janaza prayer and they postponed the burial for two to three hours until her daughter's or children come from the UK to see their mother for the last time so is that permissible if the delay is minimal there's no problem delaying the barrier for a day or two for a legitimate reason such as for the children to come and see their mother or their father or the loved one this seems permissible providing that the body does not change and providing that the period is short but processing the burial and doing it as soon as possible is far greater and better for the deceased because if it's a good soul it will tell the mourners the family quickly take me to what awaits for me and if it's a bad soul they should get rid of it and bury it and be done with that so insha'Allah a few hours is not a problem"
