  "title": "The Role Model (Prophet ﷺ‎) (11) - Things he forgot - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I'm about dear brothers and sisters in Islam assalamu alaikum warahmatullah the prophets of Allah azzawajal are human beings things that happen to human beings do happen to them as well they starve they feel thirsty they get sick and they become healthy and also they remember things as usual and sometimes they may forget our prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was not an exception he also sometimes forgot things and he said as reported in bukhari and Muslim I am a human being like you I forget like you forget and this shows us that our role model forgets therefore if our loved ones our friends our colleagues are subordinates forgot something we shouldn't consider this to be the end of time things like this happen we all forget and this is part of Being Human and this is why the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said Allah has uplifted the burden upon my ummah whenever they make an error or forget or they are forced and oppressed to do something against their will it's part of human nature and this is why Abdullah may Allah be pleased with a man with his father said that a human being is called a human being an Arabic is called insan due to the fact that he was given a pledge and he forgot Nessie so the word in Arabic in sand is similar similar to the verb to forget which is Nessie and no one among the human beings is Exempted from forgetting things because this is a human nature Allah the almighty does not forget because this is a Divine attribute of him your lord does not forget but humans they tend to forget it was reported in the authentic Hadith that when Allah azzawajal created Adam and wiped over his back there fell from his back every single soul that Allah would create until the day of judgment and they were displayed to Adam and enlar them saw them and said what is this so Allah told him these are your offspring and he saw a man with sparkling eyes and he liked how he looked and he said oh Allah who is this so Allah said this is one of your sons peace be upon him the prophet of Allah and he will come at the end of time at the last of the Nations So Adam said and how Is He To Live how long is he to live said 60 years and in another narration Adam asked and how long will I live and Allah said a thousand years so he said give him some years of my age narration said 20 narration says 40 and when Adam's time was up and the angel of death came to claim his soul he said to him don't I have like 40 years left in my lifespan and the angel of death said didn't you give it to your son dawood the prophet says Allah Adam denied in his offspring denied like him meaning this has become in their DNA and Adam forgot and his offspring also forgets and Adam sinned while eating from The Forbidden tree and so would his offspring and this denial is not due to rejecting what is truth because we know that prophets don't lie but he forgot so many times people say give me some money he said well I don't have any money and I swear thinking that I don't and then when I put my hand in my pocket and I find that there are money or there is money so I didn't lie I thought I did not have and this is a form of denial uh denying something and forgetting something his forgetfulness is not related to laws of sharia unless Allah wills it so that it becomes a role model to his ummah Allah says in the Quran we will make you recite o Muhammad and you will not forget except what Allah should will so the norm is that the prophet does not forget especially verses of the Quran except when Allah wills it once heard the man reciting the Quran in the Masjid and he listened to him and then said may Allah have mercy on him he reminded me of a verse so and so I had forgotten it from Surah so and so and this is normal Allah has mentioned this in the Quran when he said we do not abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten except that we bring forth one better than it or similar to it so the verses of the Quran can be abrogated and can be made forgotten to the prophet Allah but Allah pledged to replace it with something better or similar to it and we've spoken about abrogation in the Quran so many times and this is related to Allah's Divine will he decrease something because that is the best for the time and for the people and then after the need is gone Allah abrogates it and the abrogation can be by uplifting the ruling and the verse remains in the Quran we recite it but the ruling is not applicable or by abrogating the verse itself it's not in the Quran but the ruling remains or by abrogating both the verse is taken out of the Quran and the ruling is not applicable any more the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam in a handful of incidents maybe one or two forgotten Ayah during prayer may Allah be pleased with him says that the prophet salallahu once skipped an Ayah in Fajr and when he concluded the prayer he didn't feel right so he asked is among the worshipers who are praying with us is one of the four Great companions whom the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam ordered us to learn the Quran from them because they perfected memorizing and studying it said o prophet of Allah is verse so and so was Versa and so abrogated or you were made to forget it and the prophet said no I was made to forget it and this is a polite way of relating forgetfulness to the Quran it is inappropriate to say I forgot Aya so and so I forgot the Surah of so-and-so I forgot a portion of the Quran this is inappropriate and inadequate the prophet said don't say that rather say I was made to forget it don't attribute forgetfulness to yourself as if you've done it deliberately and you're boasting about it rather you were made to forget it sometimes forgot things in Salat so once he prayed meaning he added the fifth tracker and of course when he was notified afterwards and it was brought to his attention he offered the two prostrations of sahu as we all know that there are two prostrations of sahu of forgetfulness we compensate whatever we either neglect forgetfully or ADD out of mistake to our prayers and this is not the time to explain you can find that on YouTube insha Allah on my channel so once he prayed five francaise and the companions didn't know what to do because he was the legislator he would say that or foreign but after he finished they brought this to his attention that o prophet of Allah has the prayer been increased in rakas instead of four or five he said no they said to him you prayed five francas so immediately he faced the Qibla over to prostrations of forgetfulness of course they followed him and offered salaam afterwards and he said that I'm merely a human being like you I forget like you forget so whenever someone of you forget and does something similar to this he should compensate that by prostrating uh two prostrations or forgetfulness now if you're praying behind any Imam and the Imam stands up for an additional raka that was not intended it is not permissible for you to follow him so for example in Tel Aviv many times the Imam prays two rakas and instead of offering the sitting position in the salutation upon the prophet in the salaam he stands up for the Third raka so the followers don't know what to do no you should remain seated and say subhanallah subhanallah repeatedly so that you would notify him of him of his mistakes so that he can come back and sit down you must not follow the Imam if he shortens the prayer or prolongs a prayer instead of praying Asar for he sat on the third raka you should say subhanallah if he doesn't listen you stand up and pray on your own also the prophet once prayed us Salaam and the companions again brought this to his attention and he came down and prayed the third and the fourth raka and then offered salaam then offered two prostrations of forgetfulness and offered another Salam once he prayed Maghrib turakas and Alfred Salaam and once he did not sit in the first prayer so he stood immediately to the third raka and when they said subhanallah to bring that to his attention he uh signaled to them to stand up and he offered sujuda sahu before the Salam and this shows us that the forgetfulness prostrations should be done either before salaam or after Salam depending on the mistake and in order to know how to identify this you can go back to my YouTube channel and when you'll find these incidents and situations and scenarios explained to you even before Salah the prophet may forget once the iqama was given and the prophet came to lead the prayer and he's telling the congregation and all of a sudden he went to his home telling them as you are and in a couple of minutes he came back with his head dripping water so he prayed with him they he prayed and they prayed with him and he explained to them that I came to the Salat forgetting that I was in the state of major impurity and I just remembered so I went and performed Russell and came back and this indicates that the prophets the prophet Allah can't forget can't forget and also it tells us that his Russell was only a couple of minutes not like those people with OCD and with mental illness would probably spend half an hour taking Russell and washing themselves and scrubbing themselves like crazy until they have a rash or they develop some skin disease this is not from the Sunnah this is not from Islam don't ever claim that I'm practicing Islam what by what I'm doing this is a different religion go back to the basics and follow the Sunnah of the Prophet Allah you relieve yourself from such OCD and you will please Allah azzawajal the prophet once also forgot to pray the Sunnah of the which comes after the prayer and he made it up after Asar prayer as per the Hadith please with her and he told us not to do this after Asura but this is something special for him he was engaged with convoys who came to give the Pledge of Allegiance and was preoccupied until though her time was up and he did not remember to pray this Sunnah also the prophet Allah was made to forget when was so in the beginning the prophet knew exactly when was but then due to two of the companions arguing and raising their voices in the Masjid the prophets blamed that on them and he said because of their argument and raising their voices in the Masjid I was made to forget it and likewise he forgot the hour on a Friday when Allah azzawajal answers your Dua for certain and we know that there are different views of the scholars the most authentic is that it's the last hour of the day meaning the few moments Before Sunset of a Friday but the prophet knew Italian before but was made to forget it likewise the prophet once Allah forgot that he had some charity gold in his house so immediately after remembering it after a prayer he went and quickly after the conclusion of the conclusion of the prayer he went to his house and came back and told them because they were frightened what what had happened so he calmed them down and said I remembered that I had some raw gold nuggets in My House of Charity and I did not spend it where it should be and I was terrified because of that so immediately I went and distributed it and finally things of Natural Things in our daily lives the prophet can't forget those as well so things you see you may forget it happens where you place your keys whether you did this or you did not do it it happens the prophet Allah after the miraculous night Journey where he went to Jerusalem and then to the seventh heaven or he went to the seventh heaven then to Jerusalem and came back to Mecca in the same night the idol worshipers challenged him to describe to them the mosque of Jerusalem so he started describing it to them and then they asked him about things that he did not pay attention to so he was a little bit depressed and saddened like he had never been because now it's the the moment of truth and they're asking him so that they believe him or say that he's a liar so Allah azzawajal and this Hadith was reported in Muslim Allah raised this for me to see and I started telling them exactly Brick by Brick whatever they had asked me about and Allah azzawajal made me truthful in front of them so we have to cut each other some slack if we were to forget something if your wife forgot something if your husband forgot to bring something back home it happens it happens with the best of people it happened with the prophet so let's not jump the gun and let's pardon one another and find excuses for one another and this is how we would find the sweetness of life with the grace of Allah"
