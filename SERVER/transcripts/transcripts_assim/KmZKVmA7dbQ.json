  "transcript": "aa's first question is what is the relationship between Islam and tradition well Islam rules and it controls everything else so when it comes to a community or to a society it prevails over everything and that is why we have to always look at our Traditions our cult cultures or uh Customs through the spectrum of Islam what Islam approves alhamdulillah what Islam does not approve we refrain and stop and what Islam does not comment on then we accept it as it is without any problem so Islam is the governing entity that controls everything else so if it's part of our customs to for example kneel or bow or prostrate in front of the elders or in front of the prince or the king or the president or whoever we look at it from the uh Point View of Islam and we know that this is totally prohibited in its shik so no one can stand up and say listen this is not a form of worship we're not worshiping them but this is our culture said no your culture is a no go you have to stop because Islam is the prevailing factor that you should govern everything else through it here"
