  "transcript": "question is that which is a preferred way of doing the thus B should we do it on the prayer breeds or on the fingertips of both the hands or on the fingertips of only the right hand this one nice to do it only on the right hand the prophet Allah recommended doing this be on your fingertips and said that they will talk on the day of judgment to testify so this is only to do on the right hand if someone does it on both hands this is permissible but it's not part of the Sunnah so the Sunnah is to say subhanallah subhanallah subhanallah subhanallah subhanallah you can hold this to count that I've just done a set of five and another one and this this is not this be has done on the right and this one is just to keep the score if you don't want to do neither and you want to use the prayer beat this is also permissible but it is not as rewarding"
