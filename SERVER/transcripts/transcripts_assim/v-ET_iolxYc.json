  "transcript": "her second question it was her parents are deceased and she gives if I heard her correctly may Allah have mercy on them and if they're not deceased may Allah have mercy on all of us so she gives money in charity building a Masjid digging a well so would this be considered as a sadhaka Hajj area what does sadaqa jariya mean actually sadaqa jariya means continuous charity a poor person comes chair give me some money to eat I give him five reels ten Brielle's he buys a sandwich he eats it it's gone I'm a credited for ten reals as a charity good for me I take the ten reals and I put it in building a Masjid and they build the message and the message is still existing people come every day five times and they pray they go in Ramadan did Prophet taraweeh they sit and recite the Quran the ten Brielle is generating deeds as long as the Masjid is still existing I take the ten reals and I give it to one of the poor people who goes and attends or his child attends a circle of toffee the Quran and he memorizes the Quran and he pursues his career in learning Islamic studies and he becomes an imam he becomes a dye and he goes and teaches people and people are coming to him he teaches them how to memorize a Koran he teaches them how to pray the ten Brielle is generating because this is an ongoing continuous sadaqa so this is a difference between a one-shot and a continuous generation of sadaqa and of good deeds one shot can in paying the rent buying medication it's good it's essential the guy is going to die so no no no no you can die out of cancer I'm gonna look for something that is continuous no you have to do this now but if you have the luxury of doing a little bit more in this case yes for example if you support an Islamic satellite TV channel if you support a channel that propagates Islam how many people watch this program five thousand fifty thousand five hundred thousand in one of the Islamic satellite channels I was talking to their owner he says she has some your program of particular nature is being watched daily by 60 million people people around the globe 60 million so if you support this channel or any other Islamic channel if you support a program that people would benefit truly from your money generates good deeds and this is continuous when it goes to YouTube when it's on Facebook when it's on social media and people continue to learn and benefit from it but this does not make us underestimate giving direct charity to the poor to the needy to those who are homeless to those who cannot afford medical treatment etc"
