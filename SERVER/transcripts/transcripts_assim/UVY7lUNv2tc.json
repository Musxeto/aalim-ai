  "transcript": "Sarah from the USA Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So what is it that I can do? No No So he's generous and he has everything in his hand, the whole universe belongs to him So when I believe in Allah, when I love Allah, when I know his beautiful names and attributes And I keep on calling him and he's not giving me what I want And this is my belief in Allah Azza Wa Jal As for answering your call, Allah has answered it Shaykh I've been asking Allah for six months and he didn't answer me No, no, he answered you but you are unable to see Number one, he gives you what you want Number three, he does not give you what you want He does not deflect harm that was coming your way equivalent to what you're asking him for Rather, he stores it for you on the Day of Judgment So you come on the Day of Judgment and you find so many huge mountains of good deeds and say Whoa, there's a mistake, I didn't do these things, I don't deserve these good deeds Remember finally that Prophet Ayyub, peace be upon him, mentioned in the Qur'an and also mentioned in the Sunnah And he lost his children and wealth, only his wife stayed beside him 18 years and he's not any Tom, Dick or Harry, he's a Prophet of Allah The closest a person could reach to be to Allah Azza wa Jal is a Prophet or a Messenger Yet Allah kept this illness and calamity with all its trauma for 18 years Did he despair? Did he feel discontent? Never And after 18 years Allah gave him the whole world Locusts made of gold and silver fell over him that filled barns and barns to substitute him for his wealth Gold and silver, not nuggets, locusts coming in the millions So Allah substituted him with offspring, with wealth for his patience So be patient and Allah Azza wa Jal will soon insha'Allah answer your prayers"
