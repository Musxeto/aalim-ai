  "transcript": "don't after accounting after congregational prayer in the Masjid and after finishing the zikr if I like get up to get out when I get up I see that everyone behind me is praying so there's no way to me move from my spot so can I just so can I just start praying the Sunnah prayer at the same same spot however I pray the third player and also like what is the other for this cause I have heard this a lot of time that it's Haram to start a start soon up here right after like praying for a prayer but like I I have never heard of any Dali for this can you please mention the evidence there are a number of hadiths the most Yani famous one is the Hadith of may Allah be pleased with a man with his father where the Prophet Allah prohibited people from offering their Sunnah prayer after the fourth specifically the Friday until they speak to someone else or change their position and another narration if I'm not mistaken by in the Hadith of Venice may Allah be pleased with them that the prophet said is it difficult for you after your fought prayer to move a little front or back or to the right or to the left before offering the or Sunnah and many other hadiths and they all tell you that the Sunnah is to segregate between the fourth and what comes afterwards mainly because this is the Sunnah and probably so that people would not think that you're adding rakas to the fourth prayer so instead of praying for for it seems that you praying six and they would think negatively of you so this is an authentic issue that you have to change your position or speak so if there is someone next to you just say him you can't stand in your position and pray without a problem insha Allah"
