  "transcript": "brother raul from the us my question is regarding salah okay so i never used to have this problem before but now i feel like whenever i'm reading and saying all the words i'm saying it louder and i'm trying to like articulate it to a point like where i feel like i miss articulating everything and so i'm repeating a lot of words i'm saying louder not like whispering in in silent prayers or in loud prayers like i could say it better when i'm saying it out loud excuse me are you saying it loudly when reciting in a loud prayer or in a silent prayer just in regular silent prayers like when you're supposed to okay okay i was not saying it loudly just like whispering okay any more questions just that and that are you supposed to say it like very quietly okay well you can't hear yourself i will answer you inshallah so brother raul's question unfortunately it has been reoccurring and most of the people suffer from this as they suffer from with swas and this develops into being an obsessive compulsive disorder ocd and before they know it it's damaging their lives and it is impacting it negatively so why are they having this number one you look at it from a chopper's view and look at yourself and what's happening to you what is happening you are departing away from allah you are drifting away from the straight path you are losing your connection with the salah with the prayer so you tell me now as an outsider who's benefiting the most satan who's suffering the most you what's the remedy this is in your hands there's no secret or magical pill i can give it to you and voila you have no problem this is something you have to work really hard on you can't watch bodybuilders flicks their muscles and say hmm very nice very symmetric i'd like to be like this where can i get these pills or injections even if you get anabolic steroids without going to the gym and spending four to five hours a day you'll never develop anything likewise in salat to concentrate you have to work and this is not a private and special coach could help you you need to do that on your own first of all acknowledge the cause of the illness and this is 50 of your journey for healing so what is the cause shaytaan 50 is gone now you know who's making you do this shaytan i can't help but sheikh it's above my ability there's nothing i can do no there is lot you can do you keep on putting obstacles in front of yourself so whenever i say why don't you continue to pursue your higher education i have so many things to do i don't have time i can't concentrate the family needs me i need to work i'm too the the university is too far you keep on putting obstacles you'll never move from your seat whenever there's a will there's a way say bismillah so now you know it's shaytan why is shaytan doing this i don't know sheikh i want to perfect my prayer good that's a good reason but tell me did the prophet allah salaam and his companions and the taberean and the tabi it tabi'in and the rest of the muslim ummah living on earth today 2 billion muslims do they suffer as you do no are you more righteous and pious than them definitely not so then what's the catch the catch is that shaytan is dragging your feet to his traps and you're listening what to do sheikh number one ignore it when you recite silently and this is a lot of the people with ocd suffer from they say i have to utter it loudly so that i can differentiate between the letters i feel when i recite the fatiha that i've mispronounced it are you crazy if i recite the whole quran silently in front of you you will not be able to distinguish whether i recited all of these letters cannot be recognized until there is airflow passing over your vocal chords touching certain areas in the tongue and the mouth where the sound can be articulated otherwise they're all the same i'm going to recite the fatiha silently and there is a raw there is a board there is scene there is sod there is off so don't adjust the volume on your tv screens because it's a silent so you try and watch am i pronouncing it correctly or not so oh sure you didn't say the ball lean correctly how did you know ah i didn't know i was just bluffing you can't so don't let shaytan say to you when you say allahu akbar um maybe i did not say the calf correctly maybe i should not say the ba or the raw so let me see this in prayer with some people wacko people say allah all [Music] what are you doing he repeats it like 50 times and he thinks that oh i'm doing well because now it's perfect it's right no you are digging yourself deep down in the ground in a rabbit hole and it will never end you never know how to get out of it so my uh advice to your raul never i repeat ever repeat a word or an ayah or a statement in the quran in in the salat again block all means of shaytaan inshallah you'll be good you"
