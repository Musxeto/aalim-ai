  "transcript": "um shf the next question is are steroids hello I'm not a doctor I can't tell I know that it is taken sometimes to cure some illnesses and to fix some infections and but if you mean do I take steroids or anabolic steroids I've never taken anything that that's not natural in my life with the grace of Allah so I don't do this stuff and I see sincerely and seriously feel sorry for those who take it why are you taking it to buff yourself this is not natural eat natural food and work out and exercise and why do you do it so many people do it and they go to the gym and they become so huge and one small evil eye well and the guy is is on the ground so what's the point I think but I can't say if it's or this requires a medical profession professional to come and and say when to be taken when not to be taken and the reasons for that and Allah Knows Best"
