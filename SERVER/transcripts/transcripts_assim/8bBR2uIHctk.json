  "transcript": "caller for today is ISA from the UK my question for today is um we know that that the D of the oppressed is accepted does this mean that the oppress has to live in a state of fear and carry the burden of any Dua made against them as they oppress their person even if the oppress remot true remot and has repented to Allah if the oppressor repents to Allah he has to clear his oppression with the victim and this is clearly mentioned in the Hadith where the Prophet sallallah alai wasallam said whoever transgresses and he has this transgression against his brother he has to seek his forgiveness before the day of judgment when there is no Dirham or dinar there is only good deeds and and and bad Deeds so you have to go to the person you transgressed against and ask him for forgiveness if he forgives you alhamdulillah if he doesn't and he demands financial compensation you have to do that so so that you clear your conscience from such a sin that you've committed in the right of one of your Muslim Brothers if he doesn't accept in this case I pray that your remorse alongside with your repentance and seeking Allah's forgiveness would block any Dua that he makes against you inshallah and Allah Knows Best"
