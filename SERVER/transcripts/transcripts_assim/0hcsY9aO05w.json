know atoms and so on and what should a Muslim do when when he or she comes to know of an adultery by a married person's confession what advice should the Muslim give the friend the the Muslim should advise this friend to repent to Allah and this is advice goes to everybody whoever you know that is committing a sin or committed a sin and he's asking you for advice or he wants to purify himself by uh publicly being you know punished we tell him conceal yourself hide yourself Allah does not want you to expose yourself and if you seek Allah's forgiveness Allah is most forgiving the prophet said remorse is repentance if you feel remorse if you're sad and you regret it Allah will forgive you and the prophet is not trigger happy you know what's Trigger Happy when you have a Gun there's there are people who are very happy they just want to shoot anything the prophet does not enjoy punishing people this woman from the tribe of she came to the prophet after was executed the man we just spoke after he was stoned she came to the prophet Alat and said oh prophet of Allah Purify Me for I have sinned so the prophet went into the same EX size he looked the other way around and she didn't want to go through the process she said prophet of Allah you want to reject me like you rejected M you want to do this don't I'm pregnant this is end of story there's nothing to to conceal or to hide so the prophet said go and come after you have given birth so let's assume she's in the second month third month six second month most likely so so she went 7 months nobody knew about her anything nobody asked they did not have jails so she went she could have easily tell you what 7 months nobody knows let's Hush Hush about it she gave birth she came to the prophet Alam oh prophet of Allah Purify Me she could not live the prophet looked at him and said go feed the child until he finishes the suckling period until he can depend and rely on eating she went and let's assume she went for 2 years yeah sh make it 20 year and she came with a child holding a piece of bread in his hand oh prophet of Allah Purify Me See she is insistent because she cannot live with this sin and the prophet is giving her excuses just go leave change your mind I can forgive it's something between you and Allah so the prophet instructed the companions to Stone her to death and they dug a hole in the ground they wrapped her so that she would not expose herself or in a in a in a way but with all the stoning something had to happen and it is reported in one of the narrations of a Hadith that while they were stoning her threw her with a jaw of a camel a big jaw of a camel either it came back to him or splashed some of the blood to him so he cursed her and the prophet heard thisam and the prophet said do not curs her khid because by Allah she repented a repentance that if were to be distributed over 70 houses in Medina it Allah would have forgiven them by this repentance of her so what brought us to this point yes so we advise people to communicate with Allah depent to Allah Allah is most forgiving Allah in opens and extends his hand hand in the morning so that those who sinned in the night could come and ask for forgiveness and he extends his hand in the evening so that those who sinned in the morning could come and seek his forgiveness Allah is most forgiving don't expose people don't go and backbite people if they did something between them and Allah keep it give them advice give them and it's between them and Allah but if a person is a deviant person and he is affecting others then you have to expose him if I know that this brother mallah is a drug dealer he deals with drug drugs he sells it and he buys it and but Mah his long beard and I have to expose him I have to go to the authorities and report him if I know someone is trying to do something evil even if he's a good Muslim mallah I have to expose him because he's a effect will come to the community and to all the Muslims I have to expose this and I have to prevent his evil but if it's between him and Allah if I know that this brother is uh watching pornography I advise him fear Allah don't do this this is Haram I keep on nagging him but I don't go the second morning if he doesn't listen to me I go to brother this guy is naughty huh don't he does this and this and this and I go to someone else this exposure Allah will punish me for because the brother is doing it between him and Allah leave it between him and his Lord some people non-muslims uh while talking about the of the Quran claim that even the Quran has versions how to answer this provide us with the version how many versions do we have we have one Quran we've agreed that this is the Quran we have it is unchangeable but the dialect it's the same Quran it's the way you recite it whether you say tomato or you say tomato huh this is the Arabic way of it and and that is why it's unaccepted from them and The Virgins if we say we have virgins the meaning is the same the dos and the don'ts are the same it's not like when they say he had 24,000 or 240,000 when you read the uh genealogy of in one book different grandfathers and different families so which one is right one of them is definitely wrong so this is a clear difference of versions in Islam in the Quran we don't have this at all alhamdulillah there are benefits of Kat and but but isn't not the Quran open to a lot of interpretation because of them no not a lot there aren't a lot of interpretations because it adds value the adds value so it's e whether to wash your feet or to on your socks this is an addition it's not a different interpretation when you interpret it to say right is different than left this is something that raises question marks but these are nothing similar or even close to that they are all 100% the same meaning the difference is that it may add a little bit of value but it is not different in any sense or any form you said that the women should be house arrested ay has not all women ayat was abrogated by the ayat they should be lashed then what about the ayat which tells women should be jailed at home when it will be applicable it won't it won't we said that it was abated the ruling was obligated was removed completely but what remains was is the recitation the text so I don't know where the confusion comes if there is still confusion you may ask the obligation is three types the removal of the recitation and the ruling the removal of the recitation while the ruling Remains the removal of the uh ruling while the recitation remains how do we understand get the aah that tells us to give 100 lashes for adultery and be stoning to death as in the Sunnah how do I understand between the number one Ayah that tells us give 100 lashes for or tree and be stoning to death as in the Sunnah you understand it as it is the lashes in the Quran in the verse of the Quran is understood for the unmarried who had never previously married so if a person had never ever married and he fornicates he falls in the act of adultery he is to be lashed 100 lashes but if this person married for one night and then divorced or was widowed and he fornicates he is to be stoned to death so I don't see the question any I don't understand the question if you can is it same I'm not I'm not a native speaker fornication adultery is the same inter uh course the the same action of yeah well you know if you understand alhamdulillah uh can you please throw some light on the abrogation of mut the temporary marriage of mut okay the mut is a form of marriage that was permitted at the beginning of uh the time of the Prophet due to necessity marriage is a long-term commitment and not everyone can have a house and be responsible for providing for that house so in the beginning the prophet when he saw the hardship that the companions were passing by he gave them permission for a period of time to marry or the marriage of mut and what is this it's actually a contract where a man sets a time limit and by the end of this time limit the marriage is over there is no consequences none whatsoever and this was permitted for a very short period of time and then it was made forbidden and it remained to be forbidden and the consensus of all the scholars in of all the companions including Abbas on this so what is it who is pra practicing it now only the Shia so we as considered this to be Z because it was permitted at the time of the Prophet it was a marriage because Allah is the one who says so it was made Hal for a period of time now if someone goes to a woman and says sister can you marry me for one night I give you 10,000 rupees says okay alhamdulillah they're married night is over marriage is over says listen can we extend this no no no contract is over it's immediately abolished you cannot extend it so this is exactly what Zena is and in Islam it was abated and it clearly stated by all the companions in the beginning IB Abbas may Allah be pleased with him had confusion and all the companions told him that this was oated and then he came back to uh uh the consensus of the scholars and he agreed with them and he also said that this is not permissible so the lot of other questions were out of the topic that's why I didn't uh read out maybe inshallah in the Forum they can post it and Sh might answer because we want to benefit on the topic so that we ask the questions on the topic many people will be benefited on the topic so please restrain your questions to the topic I request again"
