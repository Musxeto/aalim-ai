  "transcript": "rule from India music my question is is it permissible to apply perfumes that contains alcohol and will our prayers be valid if we pray after applying it is so basically speaking we've answered this before perfumes that have alcohol are totally prohibited to drink because this intoxicates you would drink it so you tell me applying it externally is totally permissible oh but it contains alcohol so what I'm not drinking it don't I use sanitizers before I take my shot don't I use alcohol uh swaps I think they call it or waps or whatever there's nothing wrong in using alcohol externally whether in perfume or in your clothes or in your body there is no problem in that none whatsoever but don't drink it"
