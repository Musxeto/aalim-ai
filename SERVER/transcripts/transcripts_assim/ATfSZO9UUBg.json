  "transcript": "ban says I see that the disbelievers have improved their standard of living and we the Muslims have not I want to know if our religion asks us not to be rich or wealthy I don't want to be poor and also I don't want to leave the Islamic values cabal I thing you have a problem because it seems that you need to clean the lenses of your glasses you're not seeing things clearly when you say that the disbelievers have improved their standard of living while the Muslims have not question number one hypothetically speaking that this is true though it's not are you accusing Islam that Islam is pulling its subjects down and preventing them from excelling improving progressing in their standards of living definitely not is it the disbelievers religion that tells them to excel definitely not we know of the dark ages and what the church did to Europe and how they prosecuted science and scientists in Salaam we don't have this thing at all on the contrary Islam promotes encourages and asks scientists to excel and to progress secondly what disbelievers are you talking about go to Burma go to Nepal go to India go to China go to a Africa and look at the disbelievers there are you happy with their standards of living don't be fooled by only Europe and America in thinking that this is their standard of living the Arabs the Muslims all over the place are also wealthy they have universities they're progressing they're developing they're trying the level best to restore some of their old glory three four centuries ago and they're succeeding they're doing a good job so why are you looking only at the poor part of the Muslims thirdly if you look at the sealer we know how the Arabs were once they accepted Islam once the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam migrated to Medina ten heaven-bound were the highest in rank to the Prophet Allah so Sam and in Islam Abu Bakr Omar Othman aliaga great about obey the Ahmadiyya have the romanov suddenly webcast or web development alam thought happen already lesser items a demon a merman fate allah the wheel crushing of them and if you look at each one of them you'll find that five or six of them were multimillionaires so when you talk about a drop madman off he was the millionaire when you talk about harassment Amina fan knew and claim came close to him when you talk about Abu Bakr he freed half of the slaves who were Muslims and set them free for the sake of Allah he gave his money and wealth to the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam if you look at sad amenable cars if you look at a zoo Balaam who when he died had more than four million in his wealth and they were that best and the cream of the cream so they were not poor and never ever the Prophet as salam told them not to work or not to make money on the contrary he said to earth man once back in Baja Mareth men do whatever he wants after he donated some wealth to finance the army of Tabuk on the Battle of Tabuk or when he bought the well of rumah or when he did this when he did that so many things he had done and the product of Prophet as some gave him a cart of carte blanche do whatever you want so your observation of cabal by is totally bogus not true Islam tells you that the upper hand is better than the lower hand so when you give which means that your wealthy is better than you when you you bank in take so Islam tells you yes work make money through halal means make money and spend it in handle means make money but don't let this be your priority your priority is the Hereafter this is your target this is your objective but if making money would distract you from going to Jannah to paradise then you have to balance because this is your priority what use is it if I have my private air jet when I don't professor in the Masjid when I deal in RIBA interest usually when I cheat when I bribe when I lie what use is my mansion my cars my airplane my bank account all of this would me be means of torment and punishment for me in my grave and in hellfire may Allah protect us"
