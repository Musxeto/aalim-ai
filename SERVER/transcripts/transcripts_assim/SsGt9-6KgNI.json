  "transcript": "Misbah from India. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. In my locality there is two Muslim groups. The first Muslim group rejects Sahih Hadith. Sahih Hadith are like denying the existence of black magic and they even reinterpret Quranic verses to fit their logic. The other group goes to Dargah and may even commit shirk. So if I hear the call to the prayer from these mosques, can I attend or can I pray at home? Also there is noâ€¦ Okay, first of all, first of all, listen, listen Misbah. Masjids that believe in Dargahs and the imam, see what counts is not the community or the locality, what counts is the imam. If the imam believes in Dargahs and going to piers and to graves and worshipping the graves and the likes and doing shirk, you cannot attend the prayer there behind such an imam and your prayer is invalid. As for those who reject black magic which is in the Quran, mentioned in the Sahih Hadith, such people have gone out of the fold of Islam. Because magic is mentioned in Surah Al-Baqarah, chapter 2, in verse 102. And Allah said that they learn from Harut and Marut what they divide and separate between a man and his wife. And they say we teach kufr, so don't come and learn from us. This is sihr. And they come and have the audacity to reject it, this is totally unacceptable. So my advice is don't pray behind such people. And if you don't have any Muslim masjid that you can pray, go to the masjid, the second, the latter one, after the prayer is over and look for one or two people to pray with you, jama'ah, and your jama'ah is valid insha'Allah. you"
