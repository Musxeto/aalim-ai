  "transcript": "now people among the Muslims are divided into three categories in how they deal with their parents so category number one is the premium one is the best these are those who do all what they can to respect obey please their parents they go out of the way to help them financially to make them smile to make them happy to make them comfortable they really literally go out of their way so this category they are rewarded by Allah asael and they are true Muslims category number two are those who do not go out of their way rather they do what they're supposed to do nothing more and nothing less and such people though to us they're doing their obligations they seem to be fine but unfortunately they're not they are sinful and they will be punished for their shortcomings with their parents but I did what I am supposed to do yes but you did not do the extra Edge you don't you did not take the extra mile as they say and the third category are those who have combined leaving kindness and being dutiful two being rude disrespectful and sometimes even making them sad and depressed so it's a combination of both and such people are doomed in hell because they've committed one of their most heus and major sins in Islam imagine it is one of the most heinous and major sins in Islam to look at your mom's face and Shout at her to talk back to your father when he's advising you say don't judge me and this is something a lot of those in America always say and do whenever I have counseling sessions with them and I speak to them I tend to judge them they already paid money kalas they cannot refund it so and I say oh you do this you do this you do this and they're offended said you want to cry huh you want to say don't judge me I'm going to judge you I'm an old mided not mid-aged old aged geizer grandfather grumpy I judge you and I judge your father as well what you're doing is wrong this culture from people coming from Canada and America don't judge me why don't judge you you do bad I judge you you do good I see mallah you're good you have to be judged according to what you do and this is what's going to happen to you in your grave and on the day of judgment so the prophet said shall I not tell you about the most major sins ever everybody wants to know so the prophet said number one to associate others with Allah to do shik to do kufur this is the most major sin number two to be disrespectful and disobedient to your parents allahar he did not mention Zena he did not mention doing drugs he did not mention stealing this is the second ranking major sin in Islam to be disrespectful disobedient undutiful to your parents who had spent all their lives their savings their efforts making you who you are"
