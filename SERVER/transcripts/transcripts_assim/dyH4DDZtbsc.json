  "transcript": "some people have thought that how can we preserve our sexual private part from ourselves and this is the same it is where the Prophet saw one man will touch his private part and Prophet not that anything from it said it is his foreign authorization of masturbation is not directly mentioned anniversary these these Bush on this topic and give a neat evidence that masturbation is around first of all this is not an issue where people laymen should address because as you were talking from what I understood from your question or your presentation you mentioned the Hadith where the Prophet Allah was asked about the ruling of someone touching his private part would that impact his wudu so this was not related to masturbation definitely it was over a specific issue which is to deal with the issue of whether it impacts the widow or not and definitely the the prophet's answer Allah was crystal clear and that it does not impact the wudu masturbation there is no Crystal Clear Hadith prohibiting it but the scholars looked at the general tendency such as the verses in Surah and the verse in Surat um a marriage and Allah said that those who preserve their Chastity their private parts except from their wives and their right hand possessions meaning that they do not transgress in seeking sexual pleasure except with these two and Allah said and whoever does other than that would be considered to be transgressing and the scholars looked at this Ayah and this is why they're Scholars because they understand their understanding of the Quran the Sunnah is complete unlike laymen who don't even speak Arabic who don't even know how to probably wash themselves after answering the call of Nature and then they want to give subhanallah verdicts on masturbation and big issues of Islamic without the proper knowledge how is this possible you don't even know Arabic so these Scholars considered masturbation a form of transgression medically it is harmful islamically the majority of Scholars say it's Haram so what else do you want us to say now people who are looking for a loophole to justify their sins they'll find what justifies their sins even if it is doing crack or meth or drugs they will say there's nothing in the Quran or in the Sunnah prohibiting it on the contrary whatever is grown on the ground it's from Allah we can consume it sick analogy because they're following their whims and desires we can't help such people actually at the end of the day"
