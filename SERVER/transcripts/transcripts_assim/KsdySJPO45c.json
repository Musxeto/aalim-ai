  "title": "Is the Dog's Body & Hair Najis? My parents have a dog & spread impurity everywhere , how to live?",
  "transcript": "Afzaan from India Assalamu Alaikum Walaikumussalam I am 15 years old and my parents have a dog. I told my mom to get rid of the dog but she refused. There is a specific towel for the dog with which she sometimes plays. The towel is impure. Whenever she takes bath, the dog in the bathroom, my mom dries her with the towel. So now dog hair and the floor is impure in the bucket. I'm 100% sure. My mom doesn't care about the impurity of the dog. If the dog licks her hand, she just washes it for 3-4 seconds. And she cooks with the same hand and washes the clothes and utensils. Now, can I use that? No problem in using it. What is najis in the dog is its saliva, not the hair, not the body. So if she washes the dog and there is traces of the water and there is hair of the dog, this is pure. There is no problem in that. You have to avoid having the dog lick you or lick your clothes or lick the utensils you eat in and Allah knows best."
