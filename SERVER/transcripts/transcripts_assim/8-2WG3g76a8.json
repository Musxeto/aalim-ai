  "title": "Are there animals in Paradise (Jannah) - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "are the animals in paradise and this is a bit ambiguous if she's asking about the animals of today when they die will they go to paradise like humans and the answer is no they will not and the most authentic opinion is that Allah Azza WA JAL would hold them accountable and would take the aggressor the one who transgressed against another animal and they Allah would make them even one way or the other and then Allah would turn them all into dust and this is what the last ayah of Surat and never that the kafir the disbeliever when he sees this he says one of the three interpretations of the eighth any come to Taba one of the three interpretations is that he wishes that he was an animal so that he would be turned into dust and have no punishment in hell no more but if you are referring to will there be animals in paradise that Allah would create for the people of paradise and says yes the Prophet hasn't told us in a number of hadith about for example a horse that flies you anywhere made of a red ruby or emerald we know this and we just can imagine it but we can't imagine how beautiful how sleek how fast it is also the people who would like to graze their sheep and cattle Allah Allah would grant them this because whatever you wish Allah makes it happen you have all the time in the world actually at the time the word time does not exist anymore its eternity so you keep on enjoying a trauma so JAL creates certain types of birds that you look at them they fall fried or cooked in the way you like it Allah Azza WA JAL creates certain [Music] birds that have necks like camel that they are so beautiful so huge and their meat is so tender as narrated and different hadith and a large audience knows best"
