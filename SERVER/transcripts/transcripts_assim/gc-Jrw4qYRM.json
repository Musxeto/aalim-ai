  "transcript": "scholars say that if a parent instructs you to disobey allah azza wajal it is mandatory that you disobey your parent how is that because in obeying your parent you will be disobeying allah azzawajal who's more important you've answered yourself so my father tells me go and fetch me a bottle of scotch this is an instruction and an order and I have to obey my father but when I look at the other side of the equation I'd find that buying alcohol or intoxicants is cursed those who carry it are cursed so doing so will get me the curse of allah azzawajal and it's prohibited I have to disobey my father no questions asked"
