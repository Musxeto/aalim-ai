  "title": "Is it permissible to eat Prasad offered by Non-Muslims? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "safe he says in our country people offer Prasad that is sweets that are ascribed to the idols and then distributed is that allowed can't they give the Delisle meaning the evidence as the native Indian sheiks and various speakers say that it is haram and should not be taken first of all is the food that we consume affected by what people do meaning if there is an apple on a tree does it matter who picks it up whether he is a Muslim or a nun Muslim or an idol worshipper or not if he takes this Apple and puts it in front of his idol and he recites his prayers will there be anything affecting that Apple the answer is no for food that we consume is divided into two types veg and non-veg as they call it today for us Muslims it's considered to be meat of animals that live on land or other than that what do you mean by other than and that meat that is of animals that live on the ground on earth that are halal to us such as cattle livestock so cows camels sheep goats all of these are hollande things that we hunt such as deers rabbits also birds that we slaughter chicken goose ducks whatever these are meat that are halal for us and they live on earth there are other creatures that live in sea in water and these are halal all together regardless of the nature or their names so sea dog sea cork or pig or whatever sea lion always had on you don't slaughter it anything that lives in water you can eat it once it's dead sharks are halal to eat whales it's etcetera pardon me so the sky is the limit these are the meat also there are animals that are prohibited for us to eat such as animals that have claws and our predators like lions tigers all these predators that hunt and also birds that have the same such as larks hawks eagles etc so this is meat other than that it's vegetables fruits or food prepared from such vegetables or or grain or whatever is available in our religion what is affected by what you do is the meat so if I slaughter a dog I cannot eat that even if I say bismillah Allahu Akbar if I find a cow that fell off the cliff and died I cannot eat that because it's not slaughtered and the name of Allah was not mentioned so we have two conditions for slaughtering and that is we say bismillah the name of Allah is mentioned and it is slaughtered the throat the passage of the air and the two main veins this is Islamic there is another condition which is which is regarded to the person executing this task and that is the person who is actually slaughtering he has to be either a Muslim a Jew or a Christian we cannot eat anything else slaughtered by any person now let's move on to other veg food so again back to the example of the apple if a person puts an apple in front of his idols he does his prayers he prostrates and barrels to it and then takes the apple the Apple itself is hada nothing has changed oh sure he did his prayers he worshiped other than Allah okay this is his problem the Apple is still an apple so having said that if a non-muslim sends us food and it is veg food its vegetables fruits sweets anything that does not have animal ingredients in it and whether they brought it out of their temples or they had special prayers offered on their feasts or AIDS or a holy days and they present it to us scholars have disputed some said Haram as Asif or Saif said other scholars said no the food is halal itself but there are a number of preferred conditions so if accepting it is for the sake of being good to the one who's good to you this is recommended if the food is halal then there is no problem if you're not participating in their feasts and festival not even by congratulating them so you don't even say happy Diwali or happy Independence Day or happy Christmas if you don't say this you don't participate in their gatherings and their festivals there is nothing wrong in accepting it because accepting a gift from a non-muslim is something permissible Allah so Allah did not prevent us from being good to the non-muslims on the contrary Allah Aziz Allah asks us to be good to those who do not have any form of aggression against the Muslims do not expel us out of our homes do not prosecute us in a religion we have to be kind to them we have to be nice to them this is part of a religion and this is what was done by the Companions and I leave me allah be pleased with him and he's the fourth fourth caliph and he's the cousin of the Prophet Ali system and he's married to this daughter of the Prophet Harry Sinatra 7 was brought once with sweets that the fire worshippers prepared on their day of feast which is a neus and he accepted it he ate it and he liked it and he said there's no problem in bringing such food every now and then for us knowing that it was prepared for their fire and on the day of their 8th Shammi allah be pleased with her also was asked about the gifts given to us by disbelievers on their days of feast she said as long as it is fruit there's no problem meaning that it is not meat and this is the choice of shia islam iemon tamiya may allah have mercy on his soul and it is something that if you apply your common sense with your logic in accordance to the evidence is from Emily may Allah be pleased with them and from our mother Aisha and other many different evidences you will find that it is clear insha allah azza wajal"
