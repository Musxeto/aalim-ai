  "title": "Can we do Itekaf at home (Coronavirus Lockdown) - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "is your opinion about aitikaf during the covert nineteen coronavirus can we do this at home and what about women can women observe ehtekaf at home during normal times the answer is no anta cough is a ritual that can only be done in messages so covet 19 is not a reason to change the religion meaning if someone says oh sure you can see now due to the covered 19 we are unable to make Remora said yes a good observation so can we make Amara in our homes there is definitely not so likewise what was prescribed to be performed in the Masjid has to be done as such until allah azza wajal uplifts this crisis and catastrophe that we are all suffering from ehtekaf can only be performed in messages some scholars even limited that to the three major message in Islam which is the Masjid al-haram in Mecca and Masjid in never in Medina and in Masjid al-aqsa in Alpert's in Jerusalem but the most authentic opinion is that it is open to all messages that are full-fledged messages which means that a prayer hall in a mall does not qualify for ehtekaf a prayer hall in your company or in your residential building these are all do not qualify as messages because any second the owner can change the location or turn it into a shop or a warehouse but a full-fledged message it this is what this is for allah azza wajal no one can sell it no one can inherit it no one can give it as a gift so I hope this answers your question"
