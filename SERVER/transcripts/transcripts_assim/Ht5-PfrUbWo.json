  "transcript": "are you excited for part two inshallah let's get it over with enough of the pain today is like Saturday night let's go to the nightclub let's party let's uh have fun and get wasted Allah is yes now this is out of context alayum guys I'm muhim from one I who are we here with today we're here joined once again with Chef he's touched down once again here in Canada anything to say to our one I viewers are you excited for part two inshallah let's get it over with enough with the pain last time we had you on the podcast we actually asked you if you can come in the summer it was unlikely but alhamdulillah now we have you so I know make your whole tour successful your time here well spent and we're praying for you and we're always happy to see you same here all right so M uh yes do we want to talk about our sponsor first we have a very dear sponsor today our dear brothers at Suns uh they sponsored this episode of one aah so please be sure to check their website in the link below they have wonderful products all according to the Sunnah it's black seed and honey I can advocate for it muhab you can advocate for it and this is a wonderful product please do check it out and be sure to show them a love and support inshallah yes so sh the last time we had you we discussed some major issues that are happening with the youth in this Western World now we want to talk about the afterlife so with your perspective and your knowledge to someone that does not know what heaven in Hell is What is it it is one of the six articles of IM and this may come as a surprise to a lot of the Muslims and I always have fun discussing this with them in counseling sessions so when I say to them so do you know the six pillars of Iman he said of course shahada praying said no this is these are the five pillars of Islam so there was an upgrade yep there are six pillars of IM and unfortunately a lot of the Muslims are totally ignorant oblivious of these six pillars of IM mentioned in the Quran mentioned in the Sunnah and elsewhere so these are to believe in Allah to believe in the day of judgment to believe in the angels and The Messengers in the scriptures and to believe in the Divine decree whether good or B now when we say to believe in the day of judgment this means that there is a day of judgment A Day of Reckoning a day of accountability and this is what gives us salus and comfort because when we are oppressed when we are wronged and we are unable to get even what gives us Comfort is that there will come a time of accountability course and this is the day of judgment and when we worship Allah and when we do good things and we don't see the fruit of it at present believing that there is a Day of Reckoning a day of accountability gives us a lot of comfort that okay is we're going to get our reward a little bit later so what is the day of judgment the day of judgment depends on your belief in the existence of Allah we Muslims have no problem and this is the beauty of Islam if you ask a child where did you come from why were you created where are you headed what is going to happen after death what are you supposed to do while living he gives you all the answers if you go to someone else he would say I don't know who created you I don't know it's maybe nature I was just created like this it was a fluke I wasn't supposed to be here I was supposed to be in some other universe but Muslims have everything clear for them and the the the the the fun part is that is all backed by evidence logical uh uh Divine scriptures the whole nine yards you just sit there be objective no bias No Agenda just come if you like what you hear if you like what you see Follow Your Instinct and you will become a Muslim in a heartbeat so we believe in the existence of Allah Muslims believe in that a lot of the humans living on Earth believe in that one way or the other okay this supreme power in this universe who is Allah who created everything no one ever challenged Allah no one ever challenged God in his creation not even Jesus Christ peace be upon him he never said I created the universe nowh even pharaoh who said I'm your lord never dared to say I created the universe so the creation only lies in the hands of God of Allah this supreme power would definitely tell us what to do you can't expect the manufacturer of iPhone or amjed would be angry if we say iPhone so Samsung to produce something that is sophisticated without telling us how to operate it so Allah created this universe created us in this Perfection and then he doesn't tell us what to do he has to tell us what to do he sent us his Messengers he sent us the scriptures now we know that there is a lot of things for us to do and there are things expected from us and there will be accountability when some in this world but the major accountability is going to be on the day of judgment this is why we have to believe in the day of judgment so okay we judged we're held accountable then what then it is either Heaven For Eternity what is heaven oh don't ask yes or it's hell for eternity oh sh I'm married it's been like so many years so I know what hell is but tell me about what heaven is it's unlike whatever you can think of Heaven Paradise e Ed Eden the The Gardens of Eden all of these are mentioned in the scriptures all prophets and messengers of Allah Adam Noah Abraham Ishmael David Solomon Moses Jesus Muhammad peace be upon them all talk about the same thing about the same belief so there is heaven and there is hell and Allah prepared those for those who are held accountable Allah said Paradise is my Mercy I give to Those whom I love and hellfire is my wrath I give to those who go against my will and we can expand over that but no amazing and the fact that you gave this whole sequence and I think as Muslims we get caught up right away in heaven and hell and it's sometimes there are non-muslims even Muslims will say oh it's harsh how can you just somebody who's good but Allah of course is in a judgment accordingly and the fact that there's a process to it there's the day there's the accountability that we have in this life so that's I think something very you know powerful for the Youth or even people who are non Muslim to understand as beautiful okay now something even myself I think I struggle with we hear about the description of Jenna Allah we hear about you know Paradise how beautiful it is how do we understand and balance our comparison between jenam Hellfire and Paradise CU we hear like uh you know the details about both but how do we find a balance to understand there's no need to find a balance when you say that lots of people talk about the punishment in hell to be harsh mhm don't do bad Deeds yes and you won't even face it but to counter that why don't you look how wonderful and mindblowing Paradise is so now you are terrified because oh there's so much pain there's so much suffering and for eternity and hellfire yeah but there is a lot of enjoyment and fun in Paradise that is more mindblowing and for eternity so it's up to you you want to do good or proper English you don't want to do well yes you end up in Paradise you want to do bad you're going to pay the price it's like driving a fast car a Porsche 911s okay good taste good taste it's it's my dream card I can't afford it I'm thinking now of an F Type uh s Jaguar jagar yeah it's convertible but you'll be in the mechanic shop over and over they buy it secondhand you pay peanuts but you will never get a monkey you get a gorilla the sound of it in front of your home you just switch it on and just listen to the symphony and Riv it and then turn it off and go back yeah the neighbors would complain about and and and and the price is like the secondhand peut anyhow so what brought me this you said you want an F1 uh no cuz you're saying that you're comparing Porche 11 911 I forgot you see it's all because of you my um so you're talking about the comparison of uh the description of they saying Janam is Harsh and Jenna is very like beautiful okay so driving a fast car a rodster now I'm driving down the highway and I'm tempted to do 160 mph yes if I do it and someone gives me a ticket or suspends my license I shouldn't be complaining yes you take it on the Chain put on yourself I I did it so so everything you do has consequences so you can't blame anyone for the wrongs you've done you have to pay the price likewise good Muslims believe if you do well you get well and we believe we are rewarded for what we do in this life before the day of judgment so the good life that we're having the Tranquility the Peace of mind the content that fills our hearts with no matter what is happening to us is one of the greatest reward of Allah so should we always walk around with okay I cannot do this bad deed because I'm going to go to hell constantly being scared of Hell living life of being scared of Hell or being happy of okay if I do this I'm going to go to Jenna and constantly do good like just just in your head you know like the balance of that I have a lecture I did in Peis Malaysia about a year and a half half ago and it's the balance between hope and fear see a Muslim has to strike the balance there are three things each and every Muslim must have and believe in the love of Allah the fear of Allah and the Hope in Allah so the love of Allah is like the head of a bird if you chop it off the bird is dead and the fear and hope in Allah are the wings if one of them there is an an imbalance the way the bird flies is going to be tilted and it's going to fall eventually so you have to balance between the fear and between the Hope in Allah in the sense may Allah be pleased with him used to and someone says that this is attribute to Abu Bakr it doesn't make a difference both of them are the best Companions of the prophet he used to say if someone were to shout all people of Earth all of you are in Paradise except one I would have feared I might be the one and if someone shouted oh people of Earth all of you are in Hell except one meaning going to Paradise I would have hoped I'm not that one so this is the balance and this gives you check and balance so whenever I do something I'm fearful would Allah accept it is it for the sake of Allah is it going to be in my good deeds or bad deeds and likewise if I do something wrong am I going to be punished for it and so it gives me time to repent reflect and ask Allah for forgiveness I feel like you already kind of answered my next question but it's regarding the similar concept how we balance Allah's you know the mercy and but he's also know he's harsh in his punishment um there's some that we wanted to you know recite and we want you to give your insights on um there's he says can you explain that for the viewers may not understand this this this goes exactly as we have discussed earlier inform my servants o Pro of prophet of Allah that my Mercy is overwhelming and my punishment is severe so this is the balance that we should strike the prophet mentioned in so many hadiths the Beauty and the vastness of Allah's mercy and also in so many hadiths he mentioned to us how afraid and terrified he is from Allah's wrath yes though he was given a card blanch all of his current previous and upcoming sins are forgiven yet he's still fearful of Allah not because of his own sins rather because who Allah is so this Allah is not your friend your colleague he's not your CEO he's not the president he's not something that you could deal with like you deal with others he is the Supreme creator of the heavens and the Earth subhah wa tala yes he was there in the beginning and nothing was with him he's the first without the beginning and he's the last without end and subhanahu wa ta'ala created this whole universe only for the purpose that we worship him so Allah doesn't as have any responsibility ities toward us we belong to him he owns us if he throws us all in Hellfire nobody could object yes and if he grants us Paradise nobody could complain yes so we have to have this balance and inshallah we win also in Allah says um to explain it have a follow you who so all my people and correct me if I'm wrong don't despair from the mercy of Allah he forgives all the sins in full all of them it does not there's a difference in between the different types of sins um of course is we know this is unforgivable um it is forgivable if you repent repent before you die so yeah this ay people take out of context a lot finished and he indeed is the most restful all forgiving um the reason I'm bringing this up is any Western Muslims we in Canada of course I think at times they take it out of context because we always look at we have mercy we have hope let's always use that as our foundation for our Islam which is fine and it's true of course right but now we don't look at the flip side and then we become so uh normalized that okay everything I do every action it just I'm going to follow this trend how dangerous is that for our society and our people maybe you misrepresented your presentation because what you said is actually true Allah is most forgiving most merciful and we have to base our dealings with Allah on this uh uh on basis right but not to make this a justification for our up s yes so this is not acceptable if I say okay today is like Saturday night let's go to the nightclub let's party let's uh have fun and get wasted Allah is yes now this is out of context but to always be optimistic thinking positive that Allah is most forgiving most merciful never despair even if find in the midst and the depth of all what is happening I should always be optimistic this is true this Ayah by the way was um given um or the cause it was revealed is that the one who killed Hamza and he would he killed Hamza to get fre right yes as as a reward when he did so and he assassinated Hamza yes and Hamza may Allah be pleased with him the uncle of the Prophet wasn't aware of it he felt bad and then he accepted Islam but he had this thought that Allah has not done to forgive me I killed the lion of Allah and the uncle of the Prophet no way I'm going to be forgiven so it was sad that this ay was revealed to comfort him and said no no matter what you've done just come don't despair don't despair of Allah's Mercy Allah is most forgiving most Merc so this is a good opportunity Chef to put you on the hot seat we have a couple scenario hot a little bit you want it's it's uh the scenarios that we have um you don't have to answer them feel free if you want to but uh the first one is um relatable things that to you know to our people and our Environ take a sip of water pleas it's not it's open here this is for you you no security of course of course still this is open as well I open it for you use mine I'm fine yep okay a young man smokes weed to focus and says Allah is the most forgiving the most understanding I know the same example you use for the nightclub situation but what do you have to say for the scenario this is how Satan messes up with people's head so if someone came to this brother who's doing weed to focus and Allah is most forgiving most merciful and said to him listen I'd like to hook up with your sister so that we could have good time and we could focus together and and work uh uh late at night uh on our project at school so you okay with that he said definitely not of course so so to we have sh we have rules and regulations and dos and don'ts follow this and you're safe the more the moment you get off track and follow Satan uh whispering and do sinful acts Allah will punish you for that regardless unless you repent and you feel remorseful and you quit and you pledge not to go back to the sin and you do do good deeds and ask Allah for forgiveness then Allah will forgive you but you don't say this upfront and say yeah I'm I'm going to indulge in in Haram and in sins and then ask Allah for forgiveness yes cuz they almost I think the issue is like why even the point of saying he Allah will understand it's almost do to you mentally that I need this and the Shan plays with me he almost create this image in your head that I need it so therefore it becomes okay if you needed something it has to fit within the Shar boundaries exactly in fact during fasting Ramadan I need to eat I need to drink it goes back to the basic but I have to refrain from that until the sun sets in Canada Mah you have little time uh very short days like in 19 hours or 18 hours so I have a great need to eat and drink but Allah says watch out so actually some people in uh like admon so up North they take the timings of a different city because of how long the days are sometimes 22 hours 21 hours this is not permissible it's like praying while the sun in the middle of the sky and saying well I have to pray because that's interesting point so if let's say the timing is 3 or 4 hours for is there not an opinion that you can go to a different city no because you have day and night the opinion of getting the closest city to you and applying it is when you don't have a day or night so you have 24 hours of sunlight this is when you measure the day end with the closest city that has day and night but when you have 1 hour of night this is what Allah mentioned in the Quran so refrain from eating and drinking until Nightfall I have Nightfall how could I Break My fasting in the middle of the day adant people they can't do this don't put me in trouble with admitt people when I go there I talk with them so he said something's okay if it goes with sh there's some people that actually are prescribed weed for their health so does that make it okay yeah okay doing weed for health purposes there are conditions you just don't go to uh uh a doctor and get prescription for marijuana and call the guys Saturday night said let's go and meet some weed and get high and you know we have a prescription drug and and we we're legit first of all it has to be prescribed by a Muslim practicing Muslim doctor okay second of all it has to really have a necessity No Other Drug can substitute for that so there is no other prescription drug that is not intoxicating that would relieve you from this specific illness that you have other than recreational marijuana thirdly it must not be in quantities that would make you addicted to it opot for example we know the lawsuits and the problems and the many deaths it caused among other uh um reasons so it's not that easy so dark listen I'm depressed and my wife left me and the dog is dead so I I I don't know what to do said okay he goes marijuana said can I have some hash a little bit they said no no marijuana is said okay this is not yeah who you fooling yes Allah lot is going we have Day of Reckoning day of accountability Judgment Day this is where you're going to see things for its reality of course yeah so the next scenario is uh again I think it's common in a way and of course there's circumstances that change it but a woman says I talk soci socialize with men at my workplace I don't see anything wrong with it because we're co-workers or we're just friends how would you respond to this statement there is an imbalance of hormones maybe she wants to get out of the closet because if she claims that it's okay then I'm afraid she's you know going places yes there is no such thing as relationship Sorry by the chef just to clarify I hope you it's even for the opposite gender it's not just to the same is that what you assume of course okay I didn't understand no no when you say when a girl says that I have a good relationship with my men co-workers and there's nothing wrong with it so she may coming out of the closet now she's going to make a a surgery and she's going to switch sexes in the sense but no when you put fuel next to fire don't say Ya Allah it doesn't explode it's going to burn and the the funny thing is that even in the west they say I have like 10 15 girls in my workplace and we've been friends you've been friends because you didn't find the right one and each and every one of us is looking for the right moment and Satan is waiting he's not in a rush you know take your time in the US the president of the US the highest uh uh position who has a gorgeous wife and a successful life what did he do with an in Monica yeah and what happened it almost derailed his office and career and and and maral life now what would happen in Normal case he waited for the right moment this is what Satan does so Allah when he commands that we segregate between men and women it's not for no reason is not just for the sake of segregation because it is dangerous and no man would say oh no I'm not affected so the interesting thing she is that like we we hear this you know conversation a lot and it it goes back to I see them as a brother I see them as a sister I don't see them in that way it's the circumstances that like how do we what's as you mentioned you answer the question perfectly but now they bring up these you know points that don't have any backing but it's almost as a copout to still continue these don't quote me I'm a I'm a I'm a she I'm a fundamentalist I'm a wahabi extremist Steve Harvey mhm Family Feud yes the wellknown comedian standup comedian and and a celebrity he was asked the same question why don't you have friends that are female that are females he said there are no such friendship because men are waiting for you to open the door so that they can put their foot in it's an opportunity so don't ever be dece y SE and this is words of wisdom and I pray to Allah that he guides you into Islam he's he's a good person he's has a good heart and all what he misses is to convert to to accept the word of of of of of the truth but this is a guy from the United States of America always been there lived there and he knows because he's human being he's he knows what nature tells him to do go ahead so here's the next scenario I emotionally cheat on my wife because she doesn't satisfy my needs and I can have a second wife so she could be be a potential this is not me by the way this just so he he he what does he do did he get married or he's fantasizing or having it's excuse it's an excuse that I can emotionally cheat I can have a conversation with another woman because she could be a second wife it could be a potential and they frame it as that no this is called dating this is cheating this is sinful it's the same thing as if your wife were to do such a thing and she says that that maybe in a year time I'm I'm opting for divorce so I want to explore my options he would not accept that yes even if marrying a second for the second time is halal but she's still married and if he wants to get married to a second wife he should man up and do it properly through the Islamic way not by dating and by uh flirting with other women condition to it yes okay there's a quick fire questions I always said this last time and you you wanted to explain more but I think these should be more simple my bulletproof is Insurance yes very general yes can you elaborate on that question sorry this is a shun this is this is my personal lotion I would love to hear your perspective on this insurance is gambling and rer combined gambling and Rib okay so let's assume that I go down uh Town Toronto M and a guy comes it says would you like to buy a lottery ticket for a dollar right and I said what's a jackpot he said a million dollar oh that's fine I'll take one okay what are my chances one in a million I may definitely I will not win but if I do I get a million dollars in return insurance is the same thing I give them $1,500 as a premium for my policy whether it's a car insurance house insurance life insurance and throughout the year nothing happens my 1500 goes down the drain okay but if I encounter an accident then you can they will cover me for 100,000 or 200,000 so this is Haram this is called logical yes of course but now how do we like let's say the Western Society is built on this I did don't ask me how to uh uh go around it I have Halal andam this is the religion of Allah of course we can change that yes now if we then this is this is not fire rapid fire 50 caliber this is being selfish I please forgive me guys but this is just I would love and want your perspective next one to be get a counseling session you can't afford it so listen listen now alhamdulillah Islam is a flexible religion yes I live in the west I need a car M and authorities would say if you don't have insurance will sus spend your license will confiscate your car and will find you m Islam says this is a necessity okay choose the least amount of insurance possible that would take you off the hook yes and move on okay so when there is a necessity Islam can adapt to that but you can't just go for the yeah you have fun and take the highest premium possible and get all the benefits for the uh fun of it and me then if somebody could uh maybe have car insurance but avoid life insurance let's say yeah life insurance is no way how yes of course cuz you're depending on something of course out of necessity I have a wife and kids I have to get a house with interest cuz it's out of necessity no this is not a necessity you can pay rent for the rest of your life like I've been doing for 45 41 years now alhamdulillah I've been paying rent for two houses wow the counseling session Allah is a provider never ever doubt Allah he created you he provides for you% but you have to be with him and you have to seek and he grants you everything is in his hand don't ever look at what you have and say uh what if this happens what if that happens trust Allah and you're safe yes and the reason this question is uh very important is cuz people will and bring this up as uh it becomes a conversation I think this might be in one met specifically um but they'll say in a country that's not our country we're here we justify getting house on interest because we need at least one house I always you know I'm shocked and astonished and Amazed by this allegation when people come and say you want to justify and usually because you're living in the land land of war with these imbecile disbelievers and infidels you should move out migrate back no no no I would like to sit in this not wage war not kill anyone but reap the fruit of the American dream or the Canadian dream this is pathetic this is illogical that's true uh next one is how can one some people somebody was asking how can one justify Shar punishment it's not applicable to this day and age but how do that how did that how would that happen what do you mean by it's not applicable in this day and age from my limited knowledge that's what I know or I think at least okay elaborate please and in the heads okay is it applicable nowadays not not everywhere let's say very specific area when you say applicable do you mean that if you steal I'll chop your hand off yes so we can't do this now that's what I mean yeah yeah but it's doable in Islamic countries of course oh yes yes of course I'm saying applicable SI too at least let me say Canada then okay this is a different game no no no no no see prescribed punishment yes is prescribed by whom a judge and a witness a little bit higher the leader or the a little bit higher so it's not for you and me to decide but who is to implement it ah anywhere in the world a prescribed punishment given for a crime committed this prescribed punishment should be uh uh put into effect by The Authority only so the Muslim ruler is the one qualified to do this no one else not the father not even the Holy Ghost not the father not the uh brother not Tom Dick or Harry only by the Muslim ruler of the countries so if we have a Muslim ruler that governs and rules a country right and he implements Shar law it's implemented but no one in his right mind would say okay we are in Canada let's chop someone's hand or let's uh uh flog someone no you can't yes this is totally unacceptable it's against the law and you should be thrown into jail if you do this this is common sense if you guys made it this far into the video make sure you guys like And subscribe we'll be right back this is honey and this is also honey but black seed honey the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said black seed cures every disease except death black seed is healthy for your immune system gives you rich and essential nutrients and enhances your overall body health and you know what the best thing about sness seeds is it comes in two different forms black seed and black seed powder form are you going to try it or what bro I was going to do you want to try it allahar this is the bomb bro you can't say that man all right so one final question uh very a prominent question what is the punishment for not praying your five Salah there is a punishment in the Hereafter yes prescribed punishment in this dun is not there because it is something up to the Judgment of the Muslim ruler or the Muslim judge if your case was brought in front of them and you still refuse to pray see theoretically a person who doesn't pray at all is not a Muslim so can you clarify that is it at all as if they abandon all the Sal or is it one Sal the pro this is not rapid fire sorry I again forgive me the prophet said between a an individual and a A shik or disbelief is abandonment of Salat in another narration he said whoever abandons Salat is a cafer is a disbeliever yes now this is theoretical because in practice I could come and say okay Le doesn't pray how you know I worked with him 20 years in the office I never seen him pray and his wife comes and says Le doesn't pray how you know and he never prays MH so can I label you as a cafir the answer is no because you could pray on your own in a place that's secluded nobody sees you it's between you how in practice would I label you as a cafir if I bring you in front a trial buer or a a judge and he say pray and you say nope I don't want to pray why so I don't believe in prayer yeah and I show you listen this is in the Quran this is in the Sunnah if you don't pray you're a CF it no I'm not a cafir I believe in Allah but I don't want to pray okay here's the Executioner he's got that sword we're going to take you chop your head off said I believe in prayer but I'm not going to pray now you're a cafir so in practice it's pretty difficult to label someone as a cafir however if this is done in a Muslim country that's ruled by Shar and proven in front of a Muslim judge who's authorized to take such punishment he can sentence a person to death okay but 99.99% this is not there's no prescribed punishment worldwide and it's not never been practiced because no one comes to facing death and says says no no I'd rather be killed ra rather than pray now in the after it's different but this is to Allah's judgment not to you and me to me I would throw them have but to Allah he knows subh he has all account so he is the most merciful but who was severe in his wrath and anger and he would know whether this guy is legit or he is a phony so if you miss and it's time are you still going to uh does that invalidate the Salah if you miss prayer without a legitimate reason then you cannot pray it if it's time so let's assume is at 1:20 and is at 5:00 there is a good 3 hours and 40 minutes and I'm preoccupied in my meetings in my meals in my school and um yeah I know it's time I don't want to PR out well let me you delay it delay it until the time runs out this whoops it's time let me pray my no it's not accepted even if you pray 100 it's not going to be accepted from you why because the prophet sallallah Al wasallam said whoever oversleeps a prayer or forgets it must pray it as soon as he remembers it there is no experation for that other than doing so now oversleeping and forgetfulness are forgiven by Allah these are legitimate reasons yet the prophet said there is no experation meaning that yes okay you're forgiven but to expiate such a thing you have to pray it immediately the moment you wake up or you remember Scholars like may Allah have mercy on his soul and said this Hadith indicates that if you have a third reason which is not legitimate then even if you pray it it is not going be accepted because the prophet made two excuses over sleeping and forgetfulness and and one last followup question because that is very important topic uh again so you mentioned abandonment is that's where you can classify somebody who's rejecting to pray the Sal let's say somebody this is common a lot of people miss one Sal consistently let's say it's let's say it's or whatever it is they missed that one Salah consistently does that fall under imaginate or is that no there are major uh they've committed a major sin big time okay and they're in great great danger but they're still labeled as M worshippers okay so if they miss fjer deliberately yes they're committing a major sin but they're still considered to be in the F of Islam okay yes that's what I want to clarify and brothers and sisters be very careful of this you know this is not something I uh to joke about as you know she discussed yes so she you're here on one Ayah and there's always a tradition in one what a did he use last podcast I remember that that was your what you mentioned as one ay that you know resonates with you can you share a different Ayah that touches your heart or something that comes to mind uh if when you're asked about it I would like to say no okay but yeah seriously the the whole Quran of course is uh uh something that has touched my life and everyone's life in different ways so the AY of is a huge beautiful Ayah and when you come to it is wonderful when we come to the last two ay of Allah does not burden his soul beyond what it can bear and you go through this Ayah and how Allah AB gated the ruling you know these intr intrusive thoughts that we have when we see a bombshell crossing the street and whoa this intrusive thought in the beginning Allah held us accountable for yes but then Allah abrogated it and said as long as you don't act upon it you don't follow the woman and say Hey listen it's a good day isn't it this is acting upon it and you did not speak about it oh man I saw this bomb sh well is a terrorist by the way well how do you know she's a bombshell man so if you don't talk about it Allah forgives it so this Ayah we should you know be grateful to Allah that he's our Allah amazing amazing is there anything you would like to say to our viewers that are tuning into the one a may Allah promote you to a chapter maybe
