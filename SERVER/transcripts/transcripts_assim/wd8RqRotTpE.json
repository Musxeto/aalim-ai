  "transcript": "that Nadim says in our society whenever people want to look for a girl for marriage they want to see the picture first especially the mother or sister of the guy because people coming to see the girl is not feasible cost involved uh to Feast them and psychological aspects of people coming to the house and rejecting the girl so sending the picture based on their reply we proceed or not is this allowed in such situations where only the females can see the picture the answer is no this is not permissible for a number of reasons number one taking a photograph of a woman for such a reason defies the purpose of hijab we do not know if the picture would fall in the wrong hands or it would be hacked or someone else would see it like so many times and this is prevalent and quite popular in the subcontinent the father of the groom wants to get involved and I've seen this with some people of respect and knowledge when they insist on interviewing the woman his son is about to marry said how is this possible said I'm his father said yes but you're you want to sit with the girl you want to look at her you want to check check her out might as well marry her this is not permissible in Islam totally and likewise another question that was similar is when the mother of the girl wants to participate in the interview of the sutor this is not permissible this is free mixing she said she's my daughter I'd like to know the man who's coming to marry her no your husband does the job no my husband doesn't know how to interview people this is not permissible yes you may pause a question or two but to sit with the boy and to communicate with him this is unheard of so these are all things that are un that are not normal in societies but unfortunately it's coming to the surface and we've seen seeing a lot of things so the picture can be seen by people not intended to see it and this is exposing a number two You' all agree that there are people who are who are photogenic and there are people who are not sometimes you look at a pictures whoa what an ugly cow or a bull I'll wait for your hate mail so what the heck I'm not referring to the girl it might be a boy but if you see the person in real life they're beautiful they're handsome they're Charming so the picture doesn't do you right as in real life so many people you see the picture oh they're short and fat if you see them in real life whoa they're tall and quite handsome quite musculine quite this quite muscular or or or the likes you never know so the picture does not do you right and there's nothing like face tof face meeting so how to avoid this only the mother and the sister are going to look at it my advice Go for Skype or Zoom not a picture but rather a video call where you can see the Expressions on her face when she looks right and left you get a full idea rather than a still picture that does not portray the truth and Allah knows best if"
