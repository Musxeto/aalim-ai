  "transcript": "sohe says what are the Islamic benefits of cupping and when are the days when it is recommended and prohibited to do cupping copying is part of the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam he recommended it and he told us in an authentic hadith that if cure was in anything it is in one of three either a taste of honey or a slash of a couple person who's doing the cupping or by future ization what is copying copying is extracting blood from the body from certain areas generally speaking speaking at the back of the head and neck these are the areas most likely that coppers use to suck the blood out before in the beginning they used to use a razor cut slashes and place a mug or a special device and then suck the blood out the nature of the blood is different than the normal blood you get from a wound or from an artery and this blood is usually dark very very thick and people are relieved afterwards it is beneficial for those who have migraines high blood blood pressure it's good for the eyesight so many benefits of it not only in Islam even in nations before Islam he was known and the Prophet himself is all salam performed cupping he asked someone to perform cupping to him and gave him one full dinner which is a lot of money now cupping is part of the Sunnah especially for healing and curing but is it permissible to do all the times or there are certain times it's an issue of dispute among scholars and EEMA Malik Imam yeah I mean great Imams of hadith they say that all the hadith regarding the timings of cupping and naming of the dates are not authentic and the vast majority of scholar say that according to medical reports cupping on the 17th 19th or the 21st of the lunar month is more beneficial than any other days of the month and even I am spoke about the benefits of it after having the full moon etc these are things that medical doctors support and there are hadith though weak yet the Salaf used to implement them now mmm malik says nothing is authentic in regards to the dates to make or not to make cupping and he says there isn't any day that I have not made cupping in so if a malik says it's all open in Mohammed as we know from his school of thought that whenever there isn't any sound hadith backing it up he would take weak hadith and implement it rather than implementing self reasoning like the school of Abu Hanifah for example he would say that no weak hadith is better for me than the sayings of Abraham and Nahor Sofia an authority or Tom Dick or Harry and he used to dislike cupping on Saturdays and Wednesdays but again it is not authentic though in intermediate entik ated some of its Cheryl Barney or authenticated some of it but the general trend among the predecessors of scholars of Imams of hadith that all of this is not authentic and Allah Azza WA JAL knows best so it is best to limit your cupping to 17th 19th and 21st and if you kind of avoid Saturdays and Wednesdays that would be great if not there's no problem having said this this is related to cupping which is a form of Avada there's no medical reason for that if you have a medical reason for cupping there is no problem at all among scholars to do it anytime of the day or any time of the night any day of the week any day of the month there's no problem in that none whatsoever"
