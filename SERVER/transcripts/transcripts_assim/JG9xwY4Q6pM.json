  "title": "Virtual Currency in Video Games? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "this question uh is about virtual currency it goes like this i play a cricket game on my phone when i play alone i have to give an entry fee of virtual coins to play the match suppose i spend 50 in the game coins and after winning a match i receive 100 coins is this gambling since i'm playing alone and it's virtual currency i don't like commenting on games simply because it involves a lot of haram and people are so involved in it if this game is virtual meaning these 50 coins i did not pay anything to actually get them and they require an entry fee which in real life such an entry fee would be gambling and i may lose my 50 coins which will be definitely regenerated in the following game by itself and i may not lose it but rather win a hundred coins if i win the game this is not gambling because actually there is no real loss here gambling like lottery ticket you buy a ticket for a dollar and you may hit the jackpot of a million and you may lose your dollar there is a physical loss of a dollar but here this is virtual i didn't pay anything the 50 coins that i paid to enter this competition will be regenerated once i lose and i will get it again so it seems to me that this is permissible allah azzawajal knows best you"
