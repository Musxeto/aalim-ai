  "title": "Are seniors / elderly exempt from praying in the Masjid during Covid-19 | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "abusive second question was about what if a person is senior so if a person is 70 years of age is he exempted from attending salat in the Masjid again this is an issue that is dependent on a number of factors one is it legal for him to pray in the masjid some countries prohibit this and ban it so if they ban it then hamdulillah he can pray home - if it's allowed for him to pray in the masjid is he among those truly afraid for their safety if he says yes chef I have asthma I have respiratory problems I'm diabetic high blood pressure I have heart problems and I'm very fragile and my immune system is zero I know that if I go out even the normal flu would harm me I said no a key for you stay home but when I say stay home I don't want to see you in the market in the fish market or in the vegetable market mixing with people and exchanging and breathing in their faces and their breathing in your face and you're saying well I have to buy food no this is different if you're doing this then you can might as well go to the Masjid where there is what they call social distancing and they have masks and they have PPE but if you are genuinely afraid for your safety and you don't go out then you have the permission to pray home insha'Allah"
