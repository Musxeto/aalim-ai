  "transcript": "and in siram from australia um if we made the intention before praying one of our sunnah prayers that we would also make it salatu for example but then at the time of actually saying that the beard and starting the prayer we only remembered afterwards that we wanted to pray this is still valid you after taking you remembered what that that you wanted to actually pray this as a tawba as well as the sunnah so when did you have this intention after before the original intention was before but it was like maybe like half an hour hour before and then at the actual time of making the prayer you only remembered it after starting the prayer okay i will answer inshallah uh instagram from australia he says i had an intention to pray salatu tawba prayer of repentance combined with the sunnah of lahore for example but i had this intention half an hour ago so when i stood up to pray i offered takbir being neglectful of my second intention so i was offering the sunnah of the would it be sufficient for the tawba the answer is no actually the tawba has to be prayed immediately after wanting to repent not to be postponed for half an hour and this shows how lazy we are so many people do this same mistake he said oh i've done a great mistake i want to repent okay but i'll pray the two raka's of repentance after maghrib inshallah so that i would hit two birds with one stone but this is like an hour from now or two or maybe less or maybe more if you are sincere in your repentance immediately stand up and offer this to raka's not delaying it like this in alano's mask"
