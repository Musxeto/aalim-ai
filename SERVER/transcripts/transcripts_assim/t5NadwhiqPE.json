  "transcript": "yep and she says is it obligatory to say sallallahu alaihi wasallam whenever we read or hear the prophet's name or is it a Sunnah this is an issue of dispute among Scholars Allah says in chapter 33 Surah all you who believe I praise him and offer him Salaam so this is in an order some Scholars said it's mandated once in a lifetime but it is highly recommended some Scholars say no it is mandatory to offer salutation upon the prophet Allah whenever you hear his name or whatever you mention his name why because the prophet Allah when he was stepping the steps when he was climbing the steps of the pulpit he was hurt to say I mean I mean I mean so the companion said what are you saying I mean to and he explained to them that jibril was addressing him with three supplications one of them o Muhammad whoever your name is mentioned in his presence and he doesn't offer salutation upon you may Allah further him away may Allah take him away meaning from his Mercy from his forgiveness and this is a great sin so the prophet said I mean therefore the scholars say that it is mandatory whenever you hear his name to offer salutation those best"
