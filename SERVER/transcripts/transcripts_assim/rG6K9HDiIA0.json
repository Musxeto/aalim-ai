  "transcript": "Adrian from Serbia. Assalamu Alaikum. Wa Alaikumussalam. So what is your opinion on the Arab Revolt in the First World War? I wasn't there so I am not qualified to judge or say or talk about these things. Besides it's like a gazillion years ago. Why would anyone in his sound mind would ask about the ruling of something that would not get him closer to Allah? What we know is at the moment revolting against the Muslim rulers is totally prohibited by the Qur'an, by the Sunnah, by the consensus of the trusted scholars, shall we say. Because we've seen what it resulted in the past 15 years. Devastation, chaos, people cannot travel, cannot go to school, cannot live, they're displaced all over the country and their passports have no value. What benefit did they gain? Show me one country that benefited from such revolt and rebellion. So this is what the Sunnah tells us not to do and whoever defies it will find and face the consequences. May Allah protect us."
