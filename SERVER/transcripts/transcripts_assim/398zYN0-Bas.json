  "title": "Can men be shirtless around other men? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "so harun says what's the ruling on being shirtless amongst your buddies we live in a dorm and go to the gym together and most guys just don't wear shirts and are usually only in their track pants is that okay first of all we have to identify that there are two types of aura related to salat so without covering that aura your prayer is invalid and the aura in salat is from your navel to your knees this is the aura of men in prayer now there is another type of aura known as looking at not in prayer tonight as they call it in arabic and this is related to what a muslim should conceal and not show without any legitimate reason so when we say that the aura in prayer is from your navel to your knee does not mean or endorse by no means that men can just walk shirtless in the streets in the malls between their mahrams between themselves their buddies without any legitimacy without any real proper reason why because this goes against bashfulness among men this goes against what is known as things that are known through the community to be part of the etiquettes so it is something that people look down at and could not consider it to be appropriate you don't expect an imam of a masjid to come shirtless to the masjid for example or to appear shirtless in front of the viewers or in front of people that wouldn't be at all acceptable though it's not our so he's not doing any sin no covering the body is part of nature it is part of allah's favors and blessing who allowed us to cover ourselves with feathers with leather with clothes and on top of all of that allah said that and dressed in virtue and righteousness is even better so it's not only black and white where is your aura above that is okay no it is a little bit more so one says okay so what's wrong if we go to the gym and we flex our muscles and we look at our abs and enjoy what we see first of all there are so many bad influence over one another firstly there are the whisperings of shaytan we are in an era where shaytan beautifies the same gender to the other and that's why we have homosexuality widely spreading alhamdulillah in the disbelieving world so as muslims you have to protect ourselves we have lgbt calls from all over the world we have this systematic endorsement of such homosexuality at schools at early age of children being like uh uh in in their fourth grade or fifth grade till the extent that the authorities legitimizes boys asking girls for their nude pictures providing they have 11 requests requests per day or something like that this is outrageous but this is where the communities and societies are headed to so islam builds a very high wall that prevents people from penetrating that wall or climbing over it to protect the community so feelings of mutual liking among homosexuals would be prevented also you when you expose your body like this definitely you will attract evil eye envy people who like what they see and say whoa and this by the way happened at the time of the prophet when one of the companions looked at another and he saw his skin was so soft and clean he gave him an evil eye which made that companion salim hadif fall immediately on the ground sick this happens nowadays when we are not immuned because we don't observe our car religiously we don't take precautions etc and thirdly this makes a person boasts about himself throws arrogance in himself look at my abs look at my chest look at my uh symmetric body and he may it makes him feel proud of himself and this type of arrogance is also a major sin among other reasons and allah azza knows best"
