  "transcript": "so Shake um I learned the supplication a while back which has been circulating online for a while now and it goes like this and both are to be said three times after completing each mandatory prayer and before going to bed it is said that the reward of reciting the supplication is that these words will illuminate your grave and that these words will also illuminate a muslim's path on the Sarat now these are very big rewards just for reciting these words but I'm not sure if this Hadith is authentic may you please shed some light on this thank you I wish it were uh authentic because it's so little with great reward but unfortunately it's not if it were authentic we would have circulated it and highlighted it and encouraged people to say it because the meaning is fine but it's not in accordance to the authentic Sunnah so it's not uh verified and hence we should not say such things because the authentic hadithkar are many and we can it can suffice us with Nilla"
