  "transcript": "Suleiha from India. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. My question is my mom forbids me to talk to my uncle and aunt. If I do, she fights with them. My mom is Peron type. She does not want me to maintain kinship with my uncle and aunt because they did wrong with her and also hit my mother. But my mom is the one who says bad words and always initiate fighting with them. Should I maintain kinship with them? And sometimes my mom forbid me to talk to my sister and also to my dad. And if I talk to them, then she says bad words to them also. JazakAllahu Khairan. First of all, there is a rule in Islam which states that there is no obedience of anyone while disobeying Allah Azza Wa Jal. Whether it's your dad, it's your mom, it's your husband, anyone who tells you to do haram, you must not obey them. So if your mom tells you not to speak to your dad or to your sister or to your uncles and aunts, you must ignore her. Even if she becomes mad at you, even if she curses you, even if she curses them, they are adults. They can handle themselves. They can curse her back. Of course you can't. And she will be held accountable on the day of judgment. But you have no excuse in severing your ties of kinship because of your mom's instructions. If she prohibits you to wear clothes, would you come out nude in front of everybody? You said of course not Sheikh. SubhanAllah. Why not? This is a major sin that she's ordering you to do, so you must not obey her. However, if you can contact them behind her back, that would be a win-win. But if not, then no problem her getting angry and getting mad and cursing whomever she wants. But because you're obeying Allah, and she's the one who's disobeying Allah Azza wa Jal."
