  "title": "I used to steal fruits, should I apologize or give money to charity? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Jassim from Bahrain Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh, back in the days, I used to steal fruits like mangoes and these things from people's houses. What should I do now? Should I go one by one to their home, ask them for forgiveness, forbear them, or I should give money to charity organization? If a person steals something, this is haram for him to benefit from, to utilize, to sell, or to give. So he has to evaluate approximately, assess maybe, give an assessment of X amount of money, of the price, of the value of the things he's stolen, and return it back to those who originally own it. If he knows them very well, and he knows how kind they are, he would say to them, listen, when I was young, I did heinous things, I stole some of your mangoes or your fruits, so forgive me, I'd like to give you a gift in compensation, what would you like? If they say, may Allah forgive you, it's gone. Alhamdulillah, if they say that you give us this and that, and they're happy with that, this is sufficient insha'Allah."
