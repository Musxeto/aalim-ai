  "transcript": "and his second question would be about the means of attaining taqwa taqwa is to leave a barrier between you and hellfire this barrier can be a number of things so one of the things that would make you reach the level of taqwa is worshiping allah allah says in the beginning of surat al-baqara all people worship allah who created he on those who before you so that you may reach the level of taqwa the level of righteousness the level of fearing allah azza wajal and allah told us that fasting was legislated upon us as it was legislated upon those before us the people of the book the other religions so you may reach the level of taqwa so what increases your taqwa there are a list of things on top of them doing what Allah told you to do your prayer in the message it increases your taqwa fasting ramadan actual fasting of ramadan because you may refrain from food and drinking but you're not fasting the Prophet said Ali solution in an authentic hadith whoever does not abandon saying falsehood or acting upon it then Allah does not need him to abandon and refrain from eating and drinking which means that the essence of fasting is not only to starve and to feel thirsty this is just what everyone shares but the essence of fasting is to refrain from Haram I was talking to them some non-muslims few hours ago and I was telling them that the beauty of fasting is that it uplifts you from any addiction you have so we're addicted to drinking and eating allah azza wajal wants to free our will so that we only worship Him by not worshipping our food and drinks even though it's halal refrain from it for 17 or 18 hours why just so that you express your slavery to allah azza wajal to the Almighty not only that it frees you from your addiction to watching movies listening to music gossiping backbiting laundering watching something that is Haram you must lower your gaze when you are in the state of fasting there's a whole new person not the one you know total transformation into righteousness and piety because of fasting so in order for you to reach the level of taqwa you have to do what Allah tells you to do stay more in the Masjid spend quality time with the Quran instead of spending half an hour a day reading the Quran usually you spend 3 hours a day reading the Quran finish it every week just reciting it pondering upon it your vicar is increased and staying away from Haram the Prophet said Allah salatu salam avoid prohibited things you become the best of allah's servants it took Almohad mtech on our bitterness so if you manage to do these seemingly two simple things though they're not at all simple because imagine if you in Ramadan cut off your connection with what's up what's up app no more YouTube no more Facebook Instagram Twitter no more just the Quran just praying in the message waiting from one prayer to the other after fajar I wait until sunrise I pray 2 rakaats this is Hajj and Umrah I finished the Quran every 7 days or every 5 days I try my level best to to attend the circles of knowledge after taraweeh after us or learn take notes go back and research pray taraweeh with an open mind and an open heart asking allah forgiveness repeating alum and accountable offer for an me be kind to your parents be kind to your spouse be kind to your children give them love give them respect be kind to your neighbor something sending them foods and food to the Masjid for F par donate like crazy this is the month of donation give to the poor and those who are needy those who are homeless those who are oppressed because they are Muslims all of this would definitely make us Allah among the righteous"
