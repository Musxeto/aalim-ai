  "transcript": "oh so I had asked this question on your website but it I missed out some details I'll ask it here again uh so my friend um she's married to a man who has this who does what he does is he marries other women outside of the country where they are from Maldives and he doesn't register it in their courts so his family doesn't know people don't know that they are married basically and then um he and then if he wants he divorces them so in one such marriage he met this girl they got married and then he divorced her and then that woman she um the woman she married um another man before her waiting period could get over and now she has a son who looks exactly like her ex husband uh so is that will that son be attributed to her uh current husband who by the way likes her current husband managed to her current husband is invalid right I answered you namira I answered you this question a few days ago and you sent your question again last night and I answered it today so it should be in your mailbox in few hours in sha Allah and I said to you that the first marriage which you forgot to mention in your question now was done without the consent of her father you did not mention this but you mentioned it in your email which I still remember alhamdulillah I don't remember what I had for lunch but I can still remember these things alhamdulillah so you said that the marriage is invalid As We Know yes it is invalid now she got divorced from her husband and she married the second man before her head there was over and it's happened that she gave birth after the marriage to a boy who looks exactly like the first husband though we are not certain the resemblance is there we cannot act upon the resemblance we act upon the facts so I told you that the second marriage is invalid and they have to renew the marriage contract the child that was born we do not consider it born as a out of wedlock if the second husband claims him and says yes this is my son he was born in uh my house or on my bed and whether the marriage was valid or invalid due to our ignorance we will rectify the marriage and no harms done this is what I said to you and the answer is Still Remains the Same"
