  "transcript": "what cost says what is the reward of sitting in a decaf demonstrate for 10 days in Ramadan I've come across some weak hadith which mentions specific rewards but as these are weak I refer to you for something which is authentic please first of all Alcala here for your trust unfortunately there is no specific reward to my knowledge for ehtekaf yet this does not belittle it isn't it sufficient for you that the Prophet himself had in his salat wa sallam offered it every single year isn't it sufficient for you that no matter what other people do while you are in aitikaf you come first regardless of what they had done because you secluded yourself for the sake of allah azza wajal 24 hours for 10 nights 10 days so you pray to had should you recite the Quran you read it you engage in the care you confine yourself to the Masjid you can find yourself to the message which means that every single moment is written to you as a form of worship even when you sleep so you don't need a lot of those all to tell you that if you spend 10 days in ehtekaf in seclusion in the message I'll give you so many mansions and I'll grow for you so much trees and I'll give you this and that of gold and silver and treasures and you don't need this the amount of Eman that grows in your heart it's much more important than what you are rewarded with on the hereafter analyze Oh gel knows best"
