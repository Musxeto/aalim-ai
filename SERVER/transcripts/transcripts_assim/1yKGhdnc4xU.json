  "transcript": "Abdul Rahman from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum While I was urinating a few drops fell on my jeans pant, so I'm at office so I can't change it. So I poured a little water on the place of urine where it fell, but it's more than than this. And then I prayed the three for the prayer because Allah said fear Allah to the best of your ability. In this situation what I need to do Sheikh, do I do anything wrong, any remedy Sheikh? You should have taken off your pants, your trousers, your jeans, and pinched the area that had urine, poured water on it, squeezed it, poured water and squeezed it and that's it. Pouring water while still wearing it, if you've overwhelmed it, then this is okay. Why? The Prophet Alayhi Salatu Wassalam told the companions to pour a bucket of water over the urine area where the nomad came into the masjid and urinated. The urine of such an individual would be like maybe 150 to 200 milliliters. So it's this much. And the bucket most likely would be like 2 liters in average. So the ratio is 10 to 1. If we have one drop of urine and we put 10 drops of water, it dilutes it, it makes it pure. So if the ratio of the water you poured on your trousers or your jeans was 10 to 1 or more, inshaAllah this purifies it, but don't do that next time inshaAllah."
