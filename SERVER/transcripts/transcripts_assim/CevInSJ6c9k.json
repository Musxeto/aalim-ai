  "title": "If he did kufr, says Shahada, does Ghusl and then prays, is he Muslim again?",
  "transcript": "If someone who has stopped praying completely and has also said words of kufr, they want to re-enter Islam, I understand that someone who does not pray, their shahada is invalid. So no matter how much you say shahada, you're still not Muslim. So if they say shahada, make qasul, and go pray, will they be Muslim? Any person who commits an act of kufr or shirk has to say the shahada in order to revert to Islam. Performing ghusl is an issue of dispute. I'm inclined that it is not a condition for accepting Islam. So your Islam is valid, you just have to repent and say the shahada, and Allah knows best."
