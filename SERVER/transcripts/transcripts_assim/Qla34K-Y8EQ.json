  "title": "A Questioner Questions the Quran Scientifically - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "assalam allum Dr Zak nikum I am kushum from chatak gr Bangladesh I'm working as a senior officer in a government owned financial institution in Bangladesh I have four questions the first question Quran says that sun and moon moves in their own orbit but why Quran does not say anywh that Earth also moves around the Sun question number two you said in your lectures that Quran mentions about the expansion of the universe but Quran actually uses the word heaven and says about expansion of Heavens instead of using the word universe and also Quran uses the word sky everywhere instead of Universe for example Quran says Heaven and Earth were joined together and Allah made them separate how it can be indication of creation of universe and big bang why Quran uses word Sky instead of universe question number three why the Quran doesn't mention about solar system question number four various scientific facts in Quran have been mentioned earlier by various civilizations and Scholars and in some religious scriptures also then how could you demand that those Sciences have been first mentioned in the Quran please help me Dr Zakir N I want to be fully devoted to Islam but because of some questions in my mind I doubt doubt whether the Quran is really from Allah the sister kusam from Chong has asked the question and she has basically asked four question and all of them are related to science and I'll answer one question at a time the first question is that Quran says that sun and moon moves around in their own orbit but why Quran does not say anywhere that Earth also moves around the Sun let me remind you and I've mentioned this in the beginning of my talk on the Quran and modern science compatible or incompatible and I said this that the Quran is not a book of science SC i e n c e but it's a book of signs it's a book of ayats s i g NS and in the Quran there are more than 6,000 signs there are more than 6,000 ayats out of which more than a thousand speak about signs s c i n c so let me remind you that the Quran is not a book of signs s c i n c but it's a book of signs s i g NS so you asked in the first question that the Quran mentions that the Sun and the Moon it revolves what you're referring to is the ver of the Quran ofia chapter number 21 verse number 33 where it says that it's Allah who has created the night and the day the Sun and the Moon each one traveling in the obit with its own motion here the Arabic word yes bahun refers to the motion of a moving body so when it's talking about the celestial body it does not mean that it is just flying it means it is rotating about its own excess Allah has created the night and the day the Sun and the Moon each one traveling in orbit with its own motion so the first motion is talking about the revolution talking about that the sun and the moon are revolving and bahun means it is rotating about the own axis so in this verse the Quran says the sun besides revolving even rotates about its own access and this science has proved recently when I was in school when I passed my school in the 1982 I did not know about this we were not taught but now we know that the sun beside is revolving even rotate about own access the question poses that why doesn't the Quran say that the Earth revolves around the Sun that the Earth moves around the son as I told you that Quran is not a book of science so everything of science is not mentioned in the Quran tomorrow you'll ask me that why doesn't the Quran says 2 plus 2 is equal to 4 everyone knows any child who passes from school or even is in the second grade or third grade he knows very well that 2+ 2 is equal to 4 so if he ask me why doesn't the Quran say 2+ 2 is equal to four because Quran is not a book of mathematics Quran is not a book of science so it's an absurd question you ask asking that imagine if the Quran had to mention every scientific fact it would have been a voluminous or rather a library which would require I don't know hundreds of flaws only to mention the scientific facts because there are millions of scientific facts what I see in my talk that there is not a single verse in the Quran which goes against established scientific fact so that makes it the word of God whereas the other scriptures if you put the test of science to it there may be some verses which may match with scientific fact but there are many verses which are against science so what I say in this talk of mine Quran and modern science compatible or incompatible I say that more than a thousand vers of the Quran speak about science and there is not a single verse in the Quran which goes against established science I never claim that every scientific fact is mentioned in the Quran otherwise it would be a book so voluminous it would be like you know this book most of the human being don't read it because they think it's vast imagine if all scientific facts were mentioned in the Quran it would be hundreds of time more voluminous the second question you said in your lectures that Quran mentions about the expansion of the universe but Quran actually uses the word heaven and says about expansion of Heavens instead of using the word universe and also Quran uses the word sky everywhere instead of Universe for example Quran says Heaven and Earth were joined together and Allah made them separate how can it be indication of creation of the universe and big bang why Quran uses the word Sky instead of universe sister you're asking me the question in English there's nowhere in the Quran mentioned sky or universe or Heaven what the Arabic word used in the Quran is samaat and samawat can be translated as Universe it can be translated as Sky it can also be translated heavens and many times all these meanings they oap for example what is the meaning of Heaven if you check the dictionary if you use the word Heaven religiously it means an aboard of God or maybe where Pious people go after they die it is somewhat similar to Paradise but the lit meaning of Heaven it means sky it means you know like part of the universe so Heaven has various meaning when you use singular it talks about the paradise and there can be more than one paradise like Quran refers to Paradise as jna the literal translation of jna is Garden but when the Translator translate jna we say it is Paradise it can be Garden again Garden can be a type which you see in the world with roses Etc and the other is talking about the garden in the yearafter talking about jna talking about Paradise so yeah Heaven one of the meaning of Heaven is Paradise but when the word samaat is used in the Quran it doesn't refer to that heaven it refers to the celestial Heaven samaat can also be translated as Universe it can also be translated as Heavens talking about the celestial space or can also be translated as sky so in the Quran uses in the Quran in the darat chapter number 51 verse number 47 saying that we have created the vastness of space here the word s the Arabic word ed is meaning vastness of space so here the correct translation would be Universe the Arabic word is the same s that Allah created s and the vness word is so here the more correct word would be the expanding universe but even if you say expanding Heavens it's not wrong this Heaven is talking about the celestial so I don't know that how come you don't understand maybe your knowledge of science may be weak and in Arabic the word samat can be translated either into Universe into heaven into Sky depending upon how it is placed and what context is talking about now coming to another example when Quran speaks about the Big Bang you're referring to the ver of the Quran inia chapter number 21 verse number 30 where Allah says that do not the unbeliever see again the word that the Heaven and the Earth will join together and we clothe them aund and we clothe them aund that the Quran here talks about the and S the Heaven and the Earth were joined together so you heard the word it's talking about the universe because the universe is complete it contains Heaven it contains the Earth it contains the planet and everything and when you talk about Heavens it can also refer only to the sky it can also refer to Sky and planets for example for a better understanding when I use the English word day what is the meaning of day if I say that I spend three days in London it's talking about 324 days or three days and three nights but if I say that I spent a day in London from morning 6:00 to evening 6:00 so your day refers only to the daytime not the night or if I say I spent a day from 8 evening till 4: in the morning it's talking about only the night so in English language the day can include day and night 24 hours it can mean only the day the daytime from morning till just before Sunset it can also also mean only the night after Sunset till Before Dawn so the day depending upon how it is used when I say I spend three days in London it's talking about 3:24 a day if I say I spend the day from morning 6:00 till evening 6:00 it's talking only about the day so depending upon the context in English language many times the words depending upon how it's used in the sentence we can translate it similarly the Arabic word used in all the places what you're talking about ISAT which can be translated as Universe can be translated as Heaven can also be translated as sky so hope this answer the second part of your question the third part of your question why the Quran doesn't mention about solar system for you to say that Quran doesn't mentionable solar system means that your knowledge of Quran is very weak the Quran talks about Earth Earth is part of the solar system the Quran talks about the sun means Earth talks about Shams s the Sun the sun is part of solar system Quran talks about K moon it's part of solar system if you are referring to does it talk about all details of solar system I said no answer is the same the Quran is not a book of signs s c i n c it's a book of signs s i gns whatever the Quran speaks about solar system alhamdulillah not a single verse is against established signs coming to your fourth part of the question various scientific facts in the Quran have have been mentioned earlier by various civilizations and Scholars and in some religious scriptures also then how could you demand that Sciences have been first mentioned in the Quran never ever did I demand that everything what is mentioned in the Quran about science Quran has mentioned the first time yes there are many things when Quran mentioned about science no one knew about it before for example about embryology when I mentioned that the first two vers to be revealed that we have been created from a like substance no one knew about this when the students of the Quran went to Pro the he said I don't know whether the earlier stages of emo looks like a leech he went and saw in a microscope and then astonished at the Striking resemblance of the initial stages of the embryo with that of a so there are certain facts which are mentioned in the Quran related to science which has been mentioned the first time and no one knew about it there are many facts which were already mentioned earlier the beauty of the Quran that I say is that Quran is the only religious book on the face of the Earth in which there is not a single verse which is against established science what I see that there are marious Scholars who have come in the past there are various civilizations there are various scriptures in the past which talk about scientific facts but with it there are unscientific facts mentioned so if it says 100 things maybe few things are scientifically correct but the majority are wrong or maybe majority are correct but quite a few also wrong so the beauty of the Quran is not a single verse of the Quran is against established Signs Now coming to example I do agree with you that there are many scholars there are many civilization there are many scriptures we talk about scientific facts and they have even spoken before the Quran mentions for example the Greeks the Greeks have mentioned since the fth century BC fifth century BC means about 2 and a half th 500 and about 5 Century BC would be about th years before the Quran was revealed the Greeks in fifth century BC they said that they are thical even the Quran says the Earth is spherical I never ever said that Quran was the first book to mention that the Earth was spherical yes what I said before it became an established fact that the Earth is cical the first person who proved that the Earth was spherical when they sailed around the Earth in 1597 and proved the Earth was spherical but the Greek philosophers they said the Earth was spherical but there had no scientific proof proof for their claim but at the same time toy in the 2 Century BC who was again a Greek philosopher he said they believed in the theory known as geocentrism geocentrism means that the Earth is the center of the universe and this was believed for many years for many centuries later on when Copernicus in the 16th century he said that the Earth is not the center of the universe but for many many centuries what the Greek believed in they believed that the Earth was the center of the universe and Quran doesn't say that so if you analyze there are many things the Greeks said were correct but there were many things what they said is wrong so you cannot expect same way there are points in the scriptures like you read the Bible there may be some scientific facts but there are many scientific errors in the Bible for example the Bible says that almighty God on the first day he created light and on the third day he created the Sun how can the source of light the Sun be created on the third day when the light was created on the first day then the Bible says in the Book of Genesis chapter number one verse number 16 178 that God created the Sun the bigger light on the third day and the moon the Lesser light on the fourth day we know very well that the light of the moon is not its own light to say that the Sun that the Moon has its own light is a scientific error the Quran refers to the moonl as n or meaning a reflected light or borrowed light so all these mistakes which are there in the Bible are not there in the Quran similarly the Quran says the sun was created on the third I mean sorry the Bible in the Book of Genesis chapter number one verse number 1617 says the sun was created on the third day and the Earth was created on the fourth day now how is it possible we know from The Big Bang the Earth and the Sun were created simultaneous so there are many scientific errors in the Bible so just because there are few scientific facts which are correct but there are empty number of scientific errors in the Bible we cannot agree that Bible is a word of God so there is no religious scripture on the face of the today which has got hundreds of scientific facts and not a single scientific error except the Glorious Quran so Quran is the only book and that's what makes it unique so when you are seeing that after hearing all these things your faith then it difficult for you to believe that Quran is a word of Allah the problem is that your knowledge of science is weak and you start thinking that Quran is a book of ss Quran is not a book of sence s c i n c it's a book of signs s i gns so if you keep this in mind you will not deviate then you will not ask why doesn't the Quran say that the Earth Earth revolves around the Sun why doesn't the Quran speaks about facts about solar system because Quran is not a book about science it's a book of signs ayats Quran is a guidance for Humanity so if you keep this in mind and if you really focus on the true scientific facts your Iman in the Quran will increase so if you have therefore little knowledge of science according to sanis Breakin according to sanis bin he said that little knowledge of science makes you an atheist but the in-depth knowledge of science makes you're a believer in God so if you have good knowledge of Science and of the Quran inshallah your IM in the Quran will increase and your faith in Allah subhana tala will increase so if you hear my lecture again on the topic Quran and modern science and the other lecture is the Quran God's word inshallah inshallah your faith in Allah subhana wa ta'ala and your faith in Quran will increase hope that answer the question"
