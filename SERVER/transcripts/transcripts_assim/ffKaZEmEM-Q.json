  "title": "Can a woman travel with a NONMUSLIM Mahram? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Medina from Germany. Assalamu Alaikum. Wa'alaykumussalam wa Rahmatullah. I apologize as my question yesterday wasn't as clear. I wanted to know about traveling in times of needs with my mahrams who aren't Muslim. So they're not Muslim but are trustworthy. For example someone wants to overgo an eye surgery or wants to leave the country for religious reasons. Can she travel with a mahram who is for example atheistic or Christian? The answer is yes. A woman may travel with a mahram who is not Muslim whether he's Christian or agnostic or atheist as long as he's trustworthy because being a man is what the Prophet ï·º set as a condition and he did not say anything about the belief or the religious of such a person and Allah knows best."
