  "title": "Can I combine prayers if I commute for work or school? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "a lot of the people take joining prayers easily so people who commute from the city to the suburbs on work assignment or this is their job their routine they travel like 30 or 40 kilometers on and off they combine and this is wrong you have to pray on time you don't have the permission to combine because you're not a traveler and there's no hardship what is meant by hardship I could be residing in my own hometown but I have a placement test or an exam that happens once a year and I'll go into the exam at 11 o'clock a.m. before Lahore and won't be allowed out until 4 o'clock which is after a sir event so what to do they will not allow me to pray in this case you have the excuse to delay the and pray it with the AUSA likewise someone who's a doctor who is a surgeon or a patient undergoing surgery and he will miss once a lot due to his surgery he can combine there's no problem in that but to do it frequently in every single day this is not permissible"
