  "title": "Is using cartoons characters as profile pictures permissible? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "from hussein he says if i'm not wrong it's not permissible to draw living creations like faces of people in cartoons etc but what if what is the ruling on using such drawings and cartoons as profile pictures is it permissible again this is inappropriate these drawings are imitation of allah's creation and those who did it are severely punished on the day of judgment the prophet alice assalam refrained from entering mother aisha's house when he came back from a journey and he stood at the door with anger on his face mother aisha says i ask allah for forgiveness what i have done what have i done and previously while the prophet was away she put or installed a curtain over a door that she had and this curtain had drawings of living creatures animals fish birds whatever like any drawing so the prophet pointed at it and said didn't you know aisha that though owners of such drawings are the most tormented people on the day of judgement she immediately took it down ripped it into pieces and filled pillows with it so there are no more pictures apparent in it this is what aisha did as a reaction now for you to come and put your profile picture like many of the youth things that are not even permissible like naruto or whatever they call them uh or you put characters from an enemy or from here or there all of these are not appropriate at all if not prohibited so it is best for a muslim to avoid these things and to focus on what benefits him instead of giving and portraying such an image to the people you"
