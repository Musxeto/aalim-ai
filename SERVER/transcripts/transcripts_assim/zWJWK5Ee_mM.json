  "title": "How do we know if Allah has accepted our Dua? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "he says how would you know that Allah has accepted your dua accepted your prayer the answer is you don't as simple as that and this is why the Muslim is between two things between his fear of allah azza wajal his fear that his forms of worship will be rejected and not accepted by allah his fear that his repentance is invalid and between hoping in Allah's mercy and endless forgiveness having positive thoughts that allowed as the whadja would change his situation from bad to good and from evil to righteous etc while having this balance whatever you do you never know that is this sincere in am I doing this program for the sake of Allah or to be famous am i doing it to get rewards from Allah Allah or to get praise from the people I don't know will Allah accept it from me or not I don't know I do it and I pray to Allah that my deeds are sincere for his sake and I'm fearful that maybe I'll come on the day of judgment Allah says all of this is not valid and it's void because you did not do it for my sake but at the same time I would not sit back and say Allah Allah Allah is gonna throw me in hell there's no use no I tried to change my intention I try to make it for the sake of Allah and to help people etc and by this balance inshallah you'll be in good hands"
