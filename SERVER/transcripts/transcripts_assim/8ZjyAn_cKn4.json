  "transcript": "brother mandu from Lana says if someone is intimate with his spouse and the call for prayer is given should he interrupt and go and pray and come back of course he's asking about a situation other than fasting and Ramadan and the answer is no you should continue and then have your oasl and then pray because this is more need there is more need for that than your need for food and the Prophet told us a let's assume that there is no prayer in the presence of food meaning that if someone is hungry and the food is served and the prayer is called whether Mallory Boresha if he goes without eating he will be distracted so the Prophet said no sit and eat even if this leads to missing the prayer and it is even further more important and the urges there for intimacy rather than the food"
