  "title": "Ruling on masturbation in Islam - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh sufana from Algeria she says am I allowed to masturbate in case I'm sexually excited masturbation is a sin an individual cannot sexually entertain himself unless it's with his wife or with what his H right hand possesses and which is not available at the present time so a person can only entertain himself sexually with his wife she could do whatever she wants with him and he can do whatever he wants with her providing that the Islamic uh boundaries are followed which is not the proper place to discuss them now masturbation Allah asael described it as a form of transgression because he told us that the Believers preserve their private parts except from their wives and what their right hand possesses and whoever seeks his pleasure other than these two then he would be committing a form of transgression therefore when you come to such a question If a person is sexually excited is it per ible for him to masturbate the answer is no because during the day and the night with present day's media internet chatting phone calls sms's magazines newspapers Billboards what Etc people are constantly excited sexually because they're not lowering their gaze they're not following the Quran and the Sunnah that is why they're always so does this mean that this sin becomes permissible the answer is no it is forbidden to commit such an evil when a person is excited if he is excited then he should do what Allah or the prophet Alam commanded him to do and that is to get married so if you have a wife or if you have a husband then go and satisfy yourself with your spouse if you don't and you're still excited then you have to fast because this shortens your temper and makes this urge of having a a sexual desire far lesser uh an extent with the grace of Allah"
