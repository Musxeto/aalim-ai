  "transcript": "My principle is a Christian, how do I resign him? You cannot resign your principle because you work under him but you have to obey him as long as this is in accordance to the law of the country. When I say that we should not appoint non-Muslims to rule Muslims, what happens if they happen to rule Muslims? Should we disobey them? Of course not. This is a country. This is a unity that we have to work all together even if there are mistakes. Even if there are things that we do not approve of but we have to be one hand. So yes, he's your principle and he's Christian. Obey him. Be respectful. Be dutiful and try to give him dawah. Maybe he will become Muslim and invite him to United Muslim United."
