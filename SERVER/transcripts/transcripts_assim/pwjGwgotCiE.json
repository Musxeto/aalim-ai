  "title": "Ruling on leaving the Mushaf (Quran) open after reading it - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "he says that some of the people may leave the Quran open for a while and some folks would come up and say close it because if you keep it open for too long Satan may come and read it is this logical would he read it for the sake of Allah and then maybe pray two Ras and and and ask for forgiveness he is doomed in hell he is not going to ask Allah for forgiveness until until the day of judgment he is adamant he will not repent so do you think he needs you to open the Quran for you so that he could read it he is part of the Jin he can do whatever he is capable of doing by the will of Allah penetrating walls going through doors knowing things that normal people don't know so this is a misconception it has nothing to do with the Jin or with the Satan reading it if the Jin are able to read it and they may be guided so be it let them read it maybe Allah would guide them and you would be the cause of that but but Satan coming and and reciting it this is preposterous and it is baseless it has no uh uh authenticity to it"
