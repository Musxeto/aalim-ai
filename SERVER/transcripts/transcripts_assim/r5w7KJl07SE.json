  "transcript": "time but never give up no giving even when success seems out of sight the patient was turned to we would like to discuss one of the great moral conducts in islam one of the good manners that people are appraised by whether it's in islam or in any other religion that is generosity in arabic the word is al-qaram and this word by itself has a number of meanings that fall under it so being generous can be part of it also honorable and being with dignity can also fall under it and that is why the prophet islam was once asked by his companions who among the people is generous honorable with the best levels of dignity it's all combined so the prophet said allah is the righteous amongst them this is the most honorable person the righteous one among them so they said we do not ask you about this this is not the type of honor and generosity we are asking you so the prophet said then joseph allah's prophet the son of allah's prophet the son of allah's prophet and the son of allah and that is ibrahim so now the prophet is looking at the type of honor which prophet yusuf has prophet joseph the son of prophet yahoo the son of prophet isaac is hack the son of khalillah ibrahim abraham peace and blessing of allah be upon them all so they again said we do not want to ask about this neither so the prophet said that islam then you want to ask about the decent of the arabs the most honorable ones among them those who were the best in the pre-islamic period of ignorance will be the best in islam provided they comprehend the religious knowledge which is part of the glad tidings if you were before islam before practicing among the decent people among the honorable people and allah almighty guided you to islam it is very simple for you to maintain this honor and dignity this level of generosity providing that you acquire the knowledge in religion in islam so generosity has under it a number of beautiful great conducts and ethics honor dignity and the will and power to spend money in means of charity and it used to be defined that generosity is to give when you don't have and to prevent those who ask you from humiliation and this if we look deep into the meaning we find that it has a profound meaning to give when you don't have because people when they have money when they're able to give away when they are able to afford charity it is not something that's difficult for you to do it's difficult when you do not have a lot when you're afraid of poverty when you're afraid that you will not have something to substitute what you have given away and also generosity is to prevent those who ask you from humiliation and one of the best ways of doing this is to give before someone asks you so a real muslim identifies those who are in need and he approaches them by giving them charity in secret not in the public some people when they give charity they make a scene out of it they say i'll give this 100 euros or whatever to this poor person and he wants everyone to watch and acknowledge of this so he is boasting he is bragging about a form of worship that allah does not need and at the same time he is hurting this poor person who probably people did not know that he was in need and to be generous has two ways the first way is through the following of the teachings of islam that recommends that encourages us to be generous and this is found in so many verses of the quran and a number of hadiths of the prophet sallallahu salaam which indicates that you have to be generous in order to be a good believer if you look at the verses of the quran where allah the almighty describes the ansar the people of medina who with their generosity accepted the migrants from quraish from mecca and they shared their wealth and their property with without asking them anything for return allah prays that for them that is why they are always mentioned when allah mentions those who migrated he always mentioned them with al-ansar may allah be pleased with them all so one way of being generous is to follow the teachings of the quran and of the sunnah and the other way of being generous is a gift from allah that allah gives to muslims and non-muslims alike so you would probably find someone who is extremely rich yet he is giving away for the cause of humanity to help people to get people out of trouble though he's not a muslim and this is something that allah azzawajal is pleased with and if you add to that that this person becomes a muslim then this person would definitely be among the best and righteous people on earth we have a very well known generous arab who was not a muslim unfortunately and this would not help him on the day of judgment because he does not believe and he did not at the time believe in the existence of allah he did not worship allah alone he associated others with him his name was and there are tales and stories about his generosity that arabs usually mention to show that this type of generosity is something that we should all have they used to talk about him and say poetry but we have one who is a muslim that we look up to and we do not have to go and look at other examples for example our messenger and prophet ibrahim peace and praise be upon him abraham was among the most generous people on earth allah tells us about his story when the three angels came to his house at night before they went to put and inflict the anger and wrath of allah the punishment of allah on the people of lot who used to be engaged in sodomy which is a major sin homosexuality does not exist in islam and it is a major sin that is not something to tolerate or to take easy it is a major sin allah tells us in surat avariat in a number of verses signs of the generosity of abraham peace and praise of allah be upon him where these three strangers barge into his house and say salama and he says which is a better form of giving the greetings in arabic and he welcomes them in and he immediately goes and the quran describes us precisely that there is no time interval he immediately goes and brings a cow that is already cooked nice meat and presented to them which means that he had this animal cooked every night he had an animal slotted prepared and cooked for any guest that might come without him anticipating this or knowing this so he cooks the food for any guest that comes in whether he knows them or he does not know them we have a short break stay tuned and inshaallah we will be right back so this was the habit of ibrahim peace and praise be upon him he did this for the sake of allah any guest he always had the fire lit he had the food ready any guest that comes in he gives him this food and not any food not a sandwich but a whole animal that was slaughtered and cooked and prepared so he brings this animal he brings the food this great meal and he doesn't put it on the floor like we do and say to the guests please come and eat you're welcome he goes a bit further by taking the food to them where they're sitting and he gets it as close as possible to them and asks them to eat he does not eat himself he waits until his guests eat first not like we do we start the eating and the guest self-service these signs of generosity was very common among those who came before us though they had little means of being generous our prophet muhammad peace and praise of allah be upon him he used to be among the most generous people ever ana malik may allah be pleased with him tells us tales and tales of his generosity we must wrote me allah be pleased with him and with his father tells us that the prophet was more generous than the wind when it comes with the goodness in it and he was mostly generous in ramadan when jibril used to recite and revise the quran with him and this shows us that generosity is connected with islam with reciting the quran so the more you closer to allah the more generous and giving you are he was described by his companions that he gives away as a person who does not fear poverty at all and he would never ever reject anyone and if you read if you go through his biography you would blow your mind away because he was so generous one would expect that he was a multi-millionaire that he was living in a very luxurious mansion that he had like a dozen of cars and he had a number of servants and he did this and he did that but when you go through his biography you would find that he was one of those people who worshipped allah did not allow this worldly matters to go into his heart he had it all in his hands and nothing stopped him from giving away for the sake of allah it was reported in the authentic hadith that after the name when the prophet allah is on the eighth year managed to beat the army of the people of taif and he gathered like ten thousand of their camels and tens of thousands of the sheep and cows and herds and so on it was reported that the prophet isaiah was once looking at a herd of sheep that filled the valley so you're talking about four or five thousand sheep and there was a nomad standing next to him and this was not one of the great companions of the prophet islam or someone who was close to him he was a nomad he was someone not even from medina from mecca someone living in the wilderness in the deserts and he was standing next to the prophet looking at these sheep with his jaw almost touching the ground out of astonishment and the prophet looked at him salallahu with a smile and said do you like this and the man you know said uh-huh could not even answer the prophet he was shocked with the number of sheep and he was doing the math he was calculating how many little sheep they would have how many lambs how he would sell the fern or the wool and get the milk and whatever he was just daydreaming so the prophet isaiah do you like it said to him and then i said yes the prophet easily sallallahu said it's yours remember the prophet alaihis himself as a ishmael appears with her told us that two months would pass and we would not light fire in the prophet's houses they would never cook for two months so the companion her nephew arwa may allah be pleased with him says then what did you eat how did you live and she said the only thing that we used to eat was dates and water this is the only thing that they used to consume for two months no food no eating and yet the prophet sallam is giving this hurt for this nomad because he liked it look at the type of generosity of the prophet sallam it was also reported that a woman made a nice garment for the prophet alison because she saw that he did not have enough clothes to receive as a leader of the muslim community the muslim country the muslim state he did not have proper clothes to wear sallallahu salem so she made him this beautiful garment and as soon as he put it on sallallahu alaihi wasallam and he came to his companions one of them stood up and said by allah prophet of allah this is a beautiful garment give it to me so the prophet isam immediately went to his house took it off wrapped it and gave it to his companion and after the prophet i saw him left his companions started talking to him and said saying to him don't you fear allah how dare you ask this from the prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam when you see and you can see that that he needs it and you ask him to give it to you knowing that he never rejects anyone who asks him how do you do such a thing so the man confessed to them and he said that by allah i do not want to wear it and i would like to justify what i have done by saying that i need this so that it will be the clothes that they wrap me with after i die and before they bury me and so he wanted the blessing of allah through the prophet sallallahu sallam's garment so that when he is buried it would be the shrouds that they wrap him in and they bury him with them and we have to know that there are reasons for people to be generous and among them all among the very high and top reasons is the fact that you believe that it is allah who provides if you believe that the provisions you have are from allah then you have no problem in being generous when do we become misery and stingy when we know that we have this amount of money and we calculate every penny coming out of it being afraid that it will shrink and go small and maybe it will run out well if you believe that it is allah who provided it to you in the first place and allah can provide you with lots more and more of it then this makes you feel safe and comfortable in giving away in means of charity and that is why um pleased with him tells us that the prophet once called people to give charity so i went and took fifty percent of what i have and i went to the prophet sallallahu salaam and i gave him my wealth and he said what did you leave for your family so i told him the prophet of allah i left exactly the same amount so he prayed for allah azzawajal that he would bless what i have left and then came abu bakr may allah be pleased with him and abu bakr may allah be pleased with him brought a big bundle of things and he put it forward to the prophet and the prophet said allah what did you leave for your family said i left them allah and his prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam meaning that he did not leave a thing so the prophet salallahu salaam prayed to allah that he would bless abu bakr and his family may allah be pleased with them all this is an indication abu bakr did not do this once he did this three times imagine signing off all your belongings for the cause of allah for the sake of allah you keep nothing left not a single dollar or euro nothing you give everything for the sake of allah anyone who would do this immediately would label him as insane this guy is crazy he doesn't know what he's doing we should be protective and prevent him from wasting his money in islam this is not wasting your money this is investing your money why is that because we believe that our lives are to come to an end on this earth this is beyond doubt no one doubts this how long will you live 60 years 70 years 100 years and then what it's death but after death there is eternity there is life that has no ending so when you spend something in the cause of allah in charity when you do good deeds and you spend your money you're not wasting it you are actually investing because if you put your money in an interest-based bank he gives you probably at most 10 annually as a percentage as riba which is a major sin again but when you do something in the cause of allah allah the almighty multiplies it 10 folds so if you give a thousand you'll get in return ten thousand and these are even multiplied and multiplied until they reach seven hundred folds and allah gave us an example in chapter 2 surat al-baqarah so one seed or one grain of wheat gave you 700 and this is equivalent to what allah azzawajal will multiply the good deeds that you do and subhanallah this is what earth with the grace of allah gives you 700 for one then what do you imagine allah the creator of the heavens and the earth would give you when you offer something to his sake this is all the time we have for today's program until we meet next time the patient wounds oh"
