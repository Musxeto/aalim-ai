  "transcript": "fatima says my question is what is the role uh the ruling not rolling what is the ruling of keep moving the finger while at the shahood hope that anyone can answer me i don't think anyone can answer you except me because the question is addressing addressed to me the sunnah is when you sit for is to wiggle your index finger like this so my middle finger and my thumb touch and my two pinky and the one next to it is a fist-like and i'm pointing the index finger like this and wiggling it in its place i'm not going up and down i'm not rotating it like some of the brothers do rather i'm just pointing and saying and wiggling it in its place etc from the beginning till the end and why do i say till the end because even if i finish my tashahud and the imam is still sitting in the first sitting i will not sit idle rather i would say allah mohammed if he's in the second sitting and i finished the rotation upon the prophet saw but he still did not conclude the salat i will go into the dua mode allah you do not sit idle just doing nothing you"
