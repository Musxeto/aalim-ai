  "title": "Can I pray in a moving car or bus if my family (driver) does not stop for prayer? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "what am i supposed to do when i'm out with my family in a car and it's time for prayer and they refuse to stop do i pray in the moving car or combine prayers after reaching my destination first of all we have to acknowledge a basic fact in our religion this basic fact is that our lives revolve around islam and not the other way around so the priority is islam and our lives must fit our religion and be compatible with it not the other way around and unfortunately the vast majority of muslims don't do that on the contrary they work they study they go for their errands they do whatever they want with the prayer at the bottom of their priority list so if there's time to pray we will pray if there isn't time to pray allah is most forgiving most merciful that is not the right thing to do our schedules should be revolving around prayer times so if it's gonna if we're gonna find the conflict between prayers and our schedules we give priority to our prayers if this was the case we would not have such questions you're going out with the family it is time for us in 10 15 minutes and you know that they will not stop until the sun sets so you will not have time to pray asar you should stop here and say i'm not going either we pray and go or you give me your word and commitment that i will be able to stop at a gas station or at the park and pray or at a masjid and if they don't give you their commitment don't go with them however hypothetically speaking you found yourself in such a position you're in the car you're in a bus your father your brother your driver who's driving the bus is refusing to stop what to do you have to do your best to make them stop if they don't if they refuse in this case we look at the prayer at stake if it can be combined to the prayer after it for example if the prayer time is and you won't be able to pray it on time but it can be combined to the prayer after which is asar so be it if it's maghrib and you won't be able to pray maghrib on time but you can't combine it to rishi so be it combine it to russia because this is a necessity and you are forced to do that thing what to do if it is not if it's fajr can't be combined if it's asar can't be combined because maghrib follows or it's isha there's nothing to combine it with in this case if there is no possibility for you to combine it in this case due to necessity allah says fear allah to the best of your ability in this case only when there is no other escape you may pray to the best of your ability meaning if you can stand up and face the qibla you must do that as standing up is a pillar facing the qibla is a condition if you're unable you're not in a bus you're in a car so you may pray while sitting down if you're able to face the qibla which is most likely not possible because the car is driving somewhere in this case you pray as you are sitting down because this is the best you can do and allah knows best"
