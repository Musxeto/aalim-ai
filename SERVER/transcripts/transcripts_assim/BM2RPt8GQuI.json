  "title": "Story of the Sinner who Changed from Bani Israel Authentic (forgiveness for whole ummah)?",
  "transcript": "forgive me for startling when I'm asking questions uh so my question today is Sheikh um so I came across a video on YouTube of a story of a person from um bunny Israel he was a person who was banished and chased away from the city and because he was an extreme sinner so then eventually the person had left the city and he went to a place and he was left alone and it was like a deserted place and the person had turned back to Allah and he repented and he had said like our life you forgive me Your Majesty and your highness will not decrease nor will it increase so please do forgive me and the person died in that state so after that uh it was ordered to that Prophet to go and praise the NASA on that person and all the people of the city went and prayed janaza on him and uh Allah had revealed to that prophet of that period that if uh if that person who repented was had repented for all of my Uma then all of my Uma would have been forgiven because of his sincerity in his repentance so is this authentic Sheikh like this bunny style Story the answer is no this is not authentic this is not a Hadith that is authentic or known to be authentic from our Prophet Allah however the general rule is that tales and such stories that come to us from Beni Israel we do not falsify it nor accept it and believe it and we just take it as general information if it does not go against our Sharia so does it go against our Sharia no if a person's repentance is true and sincere and there is a greater amount of remorse and he sought Allah's forgiveness and he did all what he can seeking Allah's forgiveness Allah forgives his sins and if it's highly appreciated by Allah can Cascade this to the whole ummah to signify and show that how strong and sincere his repentance was so there's nothing going against our Sharia in the story that you have narrated but is it authentic that our Prophet said no it's not authentic and I hope this answers your question [Music] and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for Allah foreign"
