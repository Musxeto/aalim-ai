  "transcript": "Ayan from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh, I'm going to tell you two scenarios. Can you tell me if they're kuffar or shubik or not? In the first scenario in my class, they were doing some musical performance. So I just went to the bathroom, but I could still hear a little bit, so I covered my ears for most of the time. But while I was doing this, I had a thought that I could ask someone for a better spot, but I was too afraid to. So I just stayed in the bathroom for the whole time. And the second scenario in my class, they made us analyze some Christmas songs. So they asked me what my favorite line was. I tried to choose a line that wasn't related to Christmas. And the line went like, love makes our problems diminish. So can you tell me if these are kuffar or shirk or not? None of those are kuffar or shirk. The first one is okay. The second one is sinful. You should not have participated in this, but there is no kuffar or shirk, none whatsoever."
