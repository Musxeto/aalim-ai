  "transcript": "Zan from Pakistan K so uh these days on internet everybody is trying to spread negativity towards Islam uh on social media so when Muslim pages and Muslim influencers try to refute these kind of person who try to disrespect Islam or you know try to disrespect Prophet Muhammad sahu alaihi wasam so I tend to I tend to skip these kind of people because I know I can't do anything about the people that are trying to disrespect the Islam so it would only make me sad so I skipped the these videos and don't share it is it okay for me to skip these kind of videos that are basically to educate the um about what is happening around or is it not okay sometimes or most of the times it would be trivial and pointless to reply to these attempts to tarnish the reputation of Islam simply because when a dog barks at you it's illogical for you to fall on your hands and knees and bark back it's a dog and you're a human being simply shrug your shoulders and move on let the dog bark it's it's not going to going to impact you and when you stop to try to defend and to refute you will find that 10 more are collaborating against you and they're making it even worse so you're publicizing what they're doing and you're giving them some weight and people are getting attention of what they're saying rather if you just ignore it and move on like Allah said the one oh Muhammad who hates you and holds a grudge against you is the one who's cut off and that no one will ever mention and this is the actual fact look at the haters of our religion and of our Prophet Alat wasam they're nothing they're the scum of the earth no matter how influential they are politically whether they're politicians or uh um billionaires or influencers they're nothing they're mentioning is dead nobody knows them yeah they might Shine for some time and that's it our Prophet has been mentioned for the past 15 centuries five times a day with the name of Allah around the globe wherever there is a country that calls the aan around the globe 24 hours 7 days a week 30 days a month 360 days a year all the time his name is mentioned whenever it is the name of Allah you hear it's always there so look at the haters look at the enemies where are they they're six feet under and whenever they're mentioned people curse them spit on their graves and nobody even knows who they are so don't waste your time and focus on learning your religion"
