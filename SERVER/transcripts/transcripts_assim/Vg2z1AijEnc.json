  "transcript": "Allah says in the Quran in Surah Bak chapter number two verse number 143 that we have made you an um a middl most Community a justly balanced community so that you may be a witness over the Nations and the Messenger will be witness over you since the messenger Muhammad sallah wasallam the last and fin messenger gave us Muslims the message and we accepted it now it's our job it's our duty that we should convey to the rest of the world during the last of the last pilgrimage of VI the Beloved Prophet peace be upon Him asked the SAS they 124,000 saas he asked them did I deliver the message to you and all of them said yes B you delivered the message to us the prophet said all those are present here deliver to those who are not present here it's our duty to convey the message of of Islam to those who are unaware of it I would like to ask you a simple question one day suppose you go out of your house to the office and your neighbor without any reason he abuses your mother he uses foul language against your mother when you come back home in the evening and you come to know that your neighbor he has abused your mother use foul language against your mother what will you do when you get back home and you come to know that your neighbor without any reason without any cause he is using foul language against your mother he's abusing your mother calling her with bad names when you get back home what will you do hit him what will you do what will you do fight him what will you do if your neighbor abuses your mother without any reason uses foul language against your mother when you get back home what will you do kill him fight him break his neck someone is saying we should fight him we should kill him we should break his neck we should hit him Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala is telling us in the Quran in suram chapter number 19 verse number 88 to92 they the Christian they are using foul language against Allah subhana wa ta'ala they say Allah is begotten a son it is the biggest abuse you can give to Allah it is the most Hest thing you can say to Allah Allah is saying suram chapter number 19 verse number 88 to92 that they the non-muslims the Christians the other non-muslims they are saying that Allah has begotten a son it is the most hideous thing you can say to Allah if the sky had feelings the sky would have burst open the Earth would have split aunder the mountain would have fallen on to water ruin Allah says that if anyone says Allah has begotten a son it is the biggest abuse you can give to Allah if the sky had feelings the sky would have burst open the Earth would have split asunder the mountains would have fallen down to utter ruin but to us Muslim nothing is happening we are sitting on our backside doing nothing every day our non-muslim friends our non-muslim colleagues our non-muslim people at work our Christian brothers and sisters our Hindu brothers and sisters they are saying Allah has begotten a son and we can't even open our mouth when someone abuses my mother I want to fight it I want to hit him I want to kill him every day our non-muslim friends our non-muslim neighbors our non-muslim colleagues our non-muslim people at work our Christian brothers and sisters our Hindu brothers and sisters they are abusing Allah and they are saying Allah has begotten a [Music] son and we don't even open our mouth what are you afraid of we say we love Allah more than our mother more than our father someone abuses a mother you want to fight him you want to hit him you want to kill him our non-muslim friends every day they're abusing Allah I'm not telling you fight them I'm not telling you hit them I'm not telling you kill them that's not allowed in Islam I'm only telling open your mouth most of us the Muslims are sitting on our backside doing nothing what has happened to us what has happened to this umah we say we love Allah more than anyone in the world more than everyone in the world more than our children more than our mother more than our father it is only lip service Nam sake if we love Allah more than our mother more than our father more than ourself we will not sit on a backside doing nothing at least open your mouth at least deliver the message what are we afraid of Allah is crying in the Quran they are saying Alman has begotten a [Music] son indeed you have given the biggest abuse to Allah it's the most Hest thing you can say if the sky had feeling the sky would have burst open the Earth would have split us under the mountain would have fallen down to uin we say that mountain is the strongest thing if it had feelings and if it came to know that someone has said that Allah has beg got the Sun the mountain would have fallen down toward a ruin but we Muslims we are more harder than the rock we are more harder than the mountain nothing is happening to our heart it's a shame we are afraid if I do dawa my non-muslim friend will become upset they are more interested in keeping the Friendship of their friend than the Friendship of Allah subhana wa ta'ala you have a misconception actually when you do dawa your non-muslim friend will respect you more when I did dawa anywhere in the world the non-muslims respect me in India and whenever I travel the non-muslims respect me more when I go to the shop oh Dr zakin Nik okay we will not take money from you when I'm going through the custom Dr zakin Nik whatever he says he says the we cannot check his bags we're not doing for Discount we aren't doing for freebies we are doing for Allah they respect me so much that the population of Hindus Started Loving Me the government got scared my prime minister of India Modi he got scared this man is getting very popular being a Muslim when we give lectures in India 100,000 200,000 500,000 1 million people [Music] Life 1 million people live not on the social media not on the television live and when we give a talk in India about 20% or 25% are non-muslims when 100,000 come to listen to my talk 20 to 25,000 are non-muslim when 1 million people come 200 to 250,000 a non-muslim imagine 200,000 non-muslim coming live in India in Nigeria we can't even imagine why that means the non-muslims in India love me more than the Muslims in Nigeria the Hindu tells me in 40 Years of in the question answer session in 40 years of my life I did not know about my religion what I learned in two hours with Dr Zak speech when non-muslims started accepting Islam my Prime Minister Modi his V bank was getting disrupted so what does he do he lays an allegation Dr Zak Nik is a terrorist this is the power of dawa the people loved the prophet when the prophet did dawa even his enemies they said he was Alan when they went outside the town they used to give their wealth with the prophet even though they were against him that this man he will not cheat we Muslims should be a following the footstep of the prophet and the saas believe me whenever I go in other parts of the world when I travel in the Western countries when I went to UK to other parts again 25,000 people coming when the crowd gets large the government gets a bit scared the non-muslim government so we are going by air on satellite we going by social media and believe me whenever I meet non-muslim most of them not 100% but more than 95% the non-muslim have seen my lectures they respect me they love me and many of them they accept the truth of Islam it is the politicians who say okay now he's getting popular we'll lose our V bank so even in Malaysia the people against me are the politicians therefore I suit the politicians in Malaysia the Hindus in Malaysia they love me when I go to a doctor he turns out to Bindu oh doctors how can I charge from you I see your videos on YouTube it is the politicians in India and the politician non-muslims in Malaysia who have a problem with me because they cannot face the truth for the vot bank they have to malign so that they get vot bank and now ramaswami cannot afford to give me 1.52 million ring I cannot he's doing crowd funding Crow funding imagine imagine with that 1.52 million ring $320,000 383 million na naira if he gives to the poor Indians in Malaysia it will be [Music] benefit with this money help the poor Indians in Malaysia why do you want to give to ramas Swami he made a mistake I have nothing against Dr Zak Nik I did it for the public who told you to do it laying allegations against me calling me a Satan calling me a terrorist the judge gave a fine and now he's going begging for money if you made a mistake you should pay why are you asking the other Hindus to pay for you I would want this money collected by him should be given to the poor Indians to uplive them in Malaysia not for the if you made a mistake you pay from your [Music] wealth so we have a misconception that if you do dawa you will lose your friendship you'll lose your [Music] business you'll lose your house and even if you do what is a better way than to give it in the way of Allah subhana tala what is better than that Allah will give you 700 times and when my Prime Minister Modi when he La allegation I had to do hij in 2016 7 years back I did Hijra from from India to Malaysia and all my property all my wealth big amount all sacrificed in the way of Allah my family members did not even bat an eyelid they did not even frown imagine all this wealth has been taken by the kafir because I'm a what better better business deal is this imagine sometime earthquake comes your house is gone you do business you lose money in business this all my wealth my house is gone to the CF because I'm a in the way of Allah what better business deal is this every night I us to pray in India that oh my Lord yeah Allah let my life and my wealth be sacrificed for you Allah heard half my Dua my wealth is gone for the way of Allah now I'm waiting for the second half of the Dua even in my life I pray that may I be murdered in the way of Allah"
