  "transcript": "if I can explain step by step how to become a United Muslim um once again I wouldn't be sitting here with you I would be sitting in my presidential Palace ruling the new yes I am a very simple man if we had the solution we would have implemented it over the past 15 centuries our problem is that we look at the ladder and we look at step number 100. so we break our neck looking upwards instead of walking step one step two step three now which Step are we as a Muslim ummah are in today step one which Step are you asking me about step 100 is it logical if my two-month-old child speaks and says Daddy Daddy I want to run the marathon what should I say to him either you're crazy or I am hallucinating you're two months old how can you speak besides you cannot even walk how do you want to run so the solution for the ummah is not to look at stage number 100 rather is in implementing it in myself let me look in the mirror am I 100 practicing Muslim yes or no maybe yes if you say maybe yes then it's not no it's no usually but let's assume yes how did I radiate my Islam to my neighbor to my brother to my father to my mother to my colleagues at school to my colleagues at work nothing so what do you want I want the ummah to be reunited you can't have this the prophet said begin this is instruction of the Prophet Islam begin with yourself and those who you sponsor so I begin not with the Islamic ummah I don't care about France I don't care about America I don't care about Morocco I care about my own family okay is my family all practicing they're practicing their dies let's go to my neighborhood I go to the Masjid I preach Sunnah I fight Innovation I teach correct I do this they're following masha'allah they're implementing yes now we go to our city but not to the presidential Palace immediately they will not admit me so this is my way of solving problems begin with where you are if you succeed you spread but if you try to go to ladder number 100 you will break your neck and you will never reach it so I hope this answers your question"
