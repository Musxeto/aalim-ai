  "transcript": "foreign [Music] was the best role model for men and he had different stages in his life so in Mecca he did not raise a hand he did not do a single chore in the house he was not allowed to mother Khadijah would prevent him from working in the house he was the crowned King in his home so he wouldn't work he wouldn't do any chores no loud sounds would be around him no nagging no disturbances none whatsoever and this is why jibril peace be upon Him gave mother Khadijah the Glad Tiding of a house in Paradise made of a pearl that there is no work or hard labor or any tiresome nor there's no loud noises or any forms of anointment because this is how she provided life quality to the prophet Allah when the prophet went to Medina he had nine wives they were not at the same caliber of Khadijah so the Hadith goes that he used to serve his family in the sense that and this is explained he served his family it did not it does not mean he used to cook or sweep the floor or do the dishes this is explained in the same Hadith where it says he used to serve by his family by fleeing his clothes stitching whatever is torn of it fixing his sandals milking his goat full stop so these things are voluntary not mandatory this was not his job but he used to do it and so many men sometimes may go to the kitchen and cook some burgers or hot dogs or steaks or clean the dishes once in a blue moon out of their own good will but this is not mandatory and no one says that this is mandatory the norm is that a man provides for his family a roof on their head puts food on the table and takes care of their financial expenses while the woman takes care of whatever is in the house yes sometimes women do go and buy groceries this is not their job as a man I wouldn't say to my woman go and fetch the groceries that's not manly but if she does it once every blue moon may Allah reward her and likewise if I do work in the house every once in a blue moon that is also appraisable"
