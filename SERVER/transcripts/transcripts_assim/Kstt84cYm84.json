  "transcript": "she my wife's little sister they their father passed away and they have no brother so they have no mam she was asking that what should she do she works in another city she often travels to and from her home and the things that require a mam for her what should she do it is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah and the day of judgment to travel without a Maham this is a statement that was said by the prophet Sall so it's an authentic Hadith and he said this to prevent a woman from going for Hajj without a male Maham accompanying her so what is more important going for Hajj or going to work in a different city if it is necessary for this woman your sister-in-law to go and work in that particular City she has to be accompanied by a male Maham at least to to drop her in that City and then she can work there if it's safe not having free mixing and she's abiding by the hijab if this is not possible then her commuting is sinful and Allah Asel Knows Best"
