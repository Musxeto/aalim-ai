  "transcript": "brother Omar says if one passes wind while making wudu do they carry on with their widow or do they have to redo from the beginning brother Omar Woodill is like prayer the end of it is connected to the beginning and it's a whole unit that cannot be interrupted so if you perform a little and you wash your face your arms to the elbows you wipe your head and your ears and you wash your right foot and while you are about to wash your left foot you pass wind this means that you have to start from the very beginning which is washing the face because your rule was invalid likewise if you praying two units and you finish the first unit well the second unit well you're in a jihad as you are reciting the salutation you passed wind your prayer is over you have to perform Moodle and go pray these two units all over again so this is something that are connected to one another unlike charity for example if you give a hundred dollars in charity so you give ten dollars to this poor person ten dollars to this poor person by the time you reach the tenth person and you want it to give ten dollars your intention changed and now you want to boast about it and you want to show off with this ten dollars what I say that the $90 the previous ones are all down the drain no these are not connected these are separate incidents and separates form forms of worship unlike woudl or salt and Alonzo JAL knows best"
