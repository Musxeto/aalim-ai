  "transcript": "Aliza from Belgium. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum. I wanted to ask when I make dua at the end of my prayer, should I keep moving my finger and look at it or look at the place where I put my forehead for sujood? No, the sunnah is that when you make dua before salam, after the salutation upon the Prophet ï·º, you keep on moving your index finger and you look at it until you come to offer your salam. Then you stop that and you offer your salam."
