  "transcript": "his second question was if someone writes a will and in the will he instructs his heirs to do something haram should the will be implemented that says no it's totally prohibited so if he says for example if i die i'd like you to mourn my death for seven days instead of three and i'd like you to advertise it on tv and i'd like you to lit the house lights for one month all of this is haram this is you just said insha allah you should you just die and we'll do the rest once he dies you just tear it and throw it in the dustbin if he contradicts and goes against allah's law allah says advises you and allah tells you and instructs you in regards of your offspring a male gets twice what a female gets and this is for the offspring so he says no no no no my son and my daughter they get 50 50 of what i uh leave behind inshallah after his death tear it and throw it in the dustbin because allah's law prevails and comes on top it is allah himself in the quran who divided the shares of the heirs who divided the inheritance who am i or you to come and oppose allah says no no this is not fair my wife gets 1 8 of my wealth no i'd like her to have half of my wealth no this is not permissible and not applicable at all zach you"
