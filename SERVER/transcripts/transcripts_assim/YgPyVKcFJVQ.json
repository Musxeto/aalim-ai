  "transcript": "He says, can I make dua in prostration? \nNow, the quick answer would be, yes.   Can I make dua? Yes. The extended version \nof the answer would be the Prophet ﷺ said,   the closest, a servant of Allah, is \nto Allah when he is in prostration.   Therefore, make as much dua as you can. Full \nstop [ ]. This is the hadith of the Prophet ﷺ.   So, when someone comes to you and says, O \nSheikh, our school of thought, our Maulana,   our scholars, our imams, say that you \ncannot make dua in sujud of worldly matters.   Say that you cannot make dua in sujud in Fardh \nprayer. Say that you cannot make dua in sujud in   your own language, tell them with all due \nrespect. This is not true. You can make dua   for things in the hereafter, or things \nfor worldly matters, O Allah, fix my car.   O Allah grant me a better car, a newer model. No \nproblem. If you don't ask Allah, who will you ask?   Allah has so many servants and slaves \nand creatures that worship him.   But we have only one Lord, one God, that we can \nask of him. Therefore, you can ask anything you   want from Allah Azza Wa Jal. Providing it is \nnot evil. You don't ask Allah to facilitate sin   for you. O Allah, I am dating this girl, make it \nhappen. No, this is Haram. And you don't ask Allah   for transgression for evil deeds, killing people, \netc. Which is [ ]. This is not permissible. Okay,   what about Fard and Sunnah? They're the same. \nAnyone who says that we cannot make dua in Fard,   Sujud, he has to provide us with evidence, because \nit was the Prophet ﷺ who said, make as much dua as   you can in Sujud because you are closest to \nAllah Azza Wa Jal. So we cannot come and say,   O no, no, only in Sunnah. Thirdly, you can make it \nin your own native language. With a condition that   you are unable to ask Allah an Arabic. So I want \nAllah to pay off my debt. In Arabic it is [ ].   Do I know how to say this? Yes, say it \nin Arabic. Don't say it in your language.   But if I don't know Arabic and I don't know \nhow to ask this particular thing in Arabic,   say it in your native language, and \nthere is no problem in that In Sha Allah."
