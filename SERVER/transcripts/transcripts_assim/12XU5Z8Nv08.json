  "title": "Earlier you come to masjid, more the reward, How early should we go for Friday prayer? Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "coming to the mosque earlier these five hours scholars have differed upon are they like our own hours 60 minutes that is definitely not because the hour in the Quran and in the Sunnah refers to a particular period of time that can be long it can be short and usually it is referred to as something that is short and the scholars also said that these hours the five hours can be measured beginning from solitude doha time and this is after the sunrise by fifteen ten to fifteen minutes so do you mean to tell me that people used to go to attend Friday prayers at 7:30 or 8 o'clock that's easiest because this is once in a week and this is the weekly read of the believers of the Muslims and hence going there's this early would grant them a lot of reward that are beyond imagination"
