  "title": "Is flipping a coin to make decisions permissible? What about Prophet drawing lots? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "says can we toss a coin or draw lots to make a decision because i heard the prophet salallahu sallam used to do this now this is a good question where to go and eat should we take a bake for example or a passage what to eat we don't know so tell you what let's flip a coin and whatever it shows heads or tails when we can tell that to go right or left is this permissible the answer is no this is not permissible this is like drawing the lots and this is not part of islam so what is permissible see or al istiham in arabic is a concept that is found in the quran so it was done by three prophets it was done by zechariah when he and his people disputed who to uh uh sponsor and take care of miriam so they drew the lots and they threw the pens in the river and the only one that remained was zacharias also prophet yunus peace be upon him in the quran mentioned that the boat they had a problem and they had to lose weight and as per some of the tafsirs and they drew the lots and all the times his name came up so he was thrown overboard and swallowed by the whale you know the story the third option uh uh story is of our prophet alesso whenever he wanted to travel on a battle or an expedition he could not take all of his nine wives so he used to flip a coin in a sense to draw the lots to know which one to choose and there is also a hadith where the prophet said alaihis was that when people claimed something let's assume they claimed this pen and none of them brought evidence to prove the ownership so he said okay then they should swear that is theirs so each one of them wanted to swear first in order to be entitled to claim it so the prophet said wait wait wait wait and he flipped the coin to select one and this one would be the one who swear and if he swears he takes it and the other the others won't likewise in another hadith the prophet said if the people were to know the virtue and the reward in calling the adhan and attending the first row in the masjid and they would fight over it and they would have no other alternative but to flip a coin or to draw the lot then they would do that which means that whenever the rights are equal it is permissible to draw the lots bearing in mind that if the right is known to be for abdullah and muhammad is arguing with him disputing with him we cannot draw the lot because it is abdullah's right but when it is equal for example a father dies leaving two sons behind and two properties the value of this property is 10 million and the value of this one is 10 million and 200. it's very similar so we tell the brothers sell and divide the inheritance they said no we don't want to sell so we tell them okay you choose this one and you choose that one he said no i'm deprived my brother took the more expensive one so then what do you want us to do he said i don't know in this case we flip a coin we say okay call us you want this one you want this one whoever the coin falls in his favor will take them the expensive one you both agree they agree so we flip a coin it's his the other one would be satisfied because this is what allah azzawajal has a mandated and chose for uh had chosen for them there's no problem in that but which restaurant should we go to eat flip a coin it's not permissible which uh date would we go to the beach this day or the following day this is not permissible what about if uh for example people opening the mushaf so they open the quran should we travel to uh mecca or not i don't know do you think it's a good idea or not let's open the mushaf and put your finger whatever aya is there this determines this is not permissible this is the doing of the people of shirk when they used to have birds and they make the birds fly if they go to the right this means affirmative if it goes to the left it means that don't go ahead with what you were planning to do and allah azza knows best so do we"
