  "title": "Can a woman suffering from istihadah combine all prayers if itâ€™s too difficult to clean herself?",
  "transcript": "the second um question is if a woman were to have istahada what is istihada we know hayd is the monthly cycle menstruation but what is istihada so a woman is either pure she doesn't have the monthly cycle she prays she fasts and her husband can be intimate with her or she has the monthly cycle and she is not allowed to pray nor to fast nor to have sexual intercourse with her husband or she is in between and what is in between when she has discharge that is continuous but we classified it as not being her monthly cycle so for example a woman who has bleeding continuously after the fourteenth day we say okay this is monthly period whatever exceeds that would be istihab and she has to perform russell for the monthly period that she had the past 14 days she has to perform wudu and clean herself and pray and she has to do the cleaning changing of impurity in her clothes and the wudu for every prayer once the prayer time is due so she prayed asar she can still recite the quran make tawaf do whatever she wants once the sun sets it's maghrib time she has to clean herself perform wudu and pray from maghreb till isha time she doesn't have to renew her wudu or change her nappies or whatever issue time is due she has to do the same process now ramla is saying what about if a woman in such a state goes to visit a friend a relative and it is difficult for her to go every prayer to the lu change perform mudo and and then pray so is it possible that she prays all the five prayers at her friend's house with one wudu or should she wait until she goes home and then combine the five prayers and pray them at the end of the night the answer is neither one is correct she has to pray each prayer on time because she is capable to go to the toilet and she is capable of changing her pad or whatever and then she can perform wudu and pray there is a concession for her because of her continuous impurity discharge that she can combine and she can combine mother teresa aisha to marry if there is a necessity and it is totally hard for her to do the prayer on time 99 there's no hardship nowadays women always carry in their bags these uh [Music] pads and they go to the toilet they change they wash they perform moodle like everyone else so i hope that this answers your question"
