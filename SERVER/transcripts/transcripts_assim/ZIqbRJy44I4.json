  "title": "People complain that Imam prays Taraweeh too long? Is one hour too long? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "this year in our Masjid they told me to lead the tarawei so now I lead the tarawei and it I pray and three weather so it usually takes me one hour to complete maybe five minutes less or more so people come to me and complain that uh you are prolonging the taraweh you should think about us and the old people behind so it got me thinking like based on your understanding like we know that there is no specific amount of time that's being specified but based on your understanding of Quran in the Sunnah so is it appropriate to pray in one hour or should I be just shortening my tarawik prayer no no one hour is totally fine and I believe that this is something and Imam should be a bit diplomatic and holding the stick from The Middle people nowadays want something that is easy and quick they don't like a proper Gourmet a starter's appetite appetizers main course desserts Etc they just want fast food double cheeseburger and a coke to go diet preferably this is unfortunately everywhere prevailing however there is no limit to that so sometimes you go to Masjid and the people say this Imam doesn't fear Allah oof why he should have splitted it into two to that extent so this is unfortunately to seek people's satisfaction is something that you will never be able to do if you prolong your prayer they will not be pleased if you shorten your prayer people will come and say why are you shorting the prayer we would like to hear more and more of the Quran so damn if you do them if you don't being realistic being fair but also acknowledging that it is not a must that you finish the Quran in Ramadan and this is a problem as well some people think that no every single uh night I have to finish one juzu so that in 30 days I would finish the whole Quran this is not from the Sunnah so it's not part of the Sunnah to finish the uh um Quran in in the month in taraweeh however if you think that shortening the prayer while perfecting your recitation and pondering upon the verses to get people closer to the Allah that would be a better goal than prolonging it just for quantity on the account of quality no go for quality and Allah May accept all of our Good Deeds"
