  "transcript": "together depending on the need if we have a lot of fatalities diseases Wars it's not feasible to dig a hundred thousand graves so we have to have sort of mass graves but with all due respect to the disease in the same form of burial and respecting them those who have more Quran they would be ahead more than those who are less okay then I think number 101 can you read this for me please getting putting or placing the funeral in his grave from the the last part is there any feet okay the translation that I found I don't know I'm not I don't wanna waste time the translation it says that the Sunnah is to get the disease from the feet this is not the Arabic word the Arabic word in the hadith the Sunnah is to get the deceased from the feet of the grave so the translation be gives you the understanding that the Sunnah is to give the body feet first this is wrong this is the grave this is the Qibla so there is the head of the grave and these are the feet of the grave so when I bring the deceased I bring him head first from the legs or from the feet of the grave and he's to be put down this way to collecting him usually two or three depending on the size and they put him facing the Qibla now if it's a lot it's gonna in the Qibla is here then his opening would be in this side he would be he's right meaning that his back is to the grave I put him on his back on his right i untie the knots that you remember the the straps and then put these bricks in a tilted way and put the sand or the soil approximately this is okay among the things that are forbidden it's forbidden for you to build over the grave it's forbidden for you to put bricks over the grave it's forbidden for you to make it high the most you can do oh nice the most you can do if I dig a grave and I put this the body and the soil when I put the soil a body and the bricks when I put the soil back again would it fit or would be a little bit higher because of the size inside of the body and therefore it is permissible to raise the body this high from the ground but you cannot put any bricks on top of in the sense that you cannot build on it you cannot it has to be like the hump of a camel so it has to be high from the middle but low from the outside can I write anything on it can I put a headstone can i whatever no can I mark it yes so if I put a rock so that I know that this is the grave of my relative so when I come after five six years I know that this is his grave this is not an issue and it is permissible is it permissible for me to walk over the graves with my shoes on no when you walk and if there is a pavement yes you can walk but if there are graves all over the place and to reach a place I have to walk over a grave you must take off your slippers you have to walk barefooted can I sit on a grave because I'm tired and by well the time they bury my relative you know it's high so I can sit like a chair it is permissible it is completely forbidden can I answer the call of nature in the graveyard nobody's watching and I have to go no I have 101 or 102 can I do that it's completely forbidden to do such a thing because this is a place where you should honor the deceased one of the practices in some Muslim countries when they put the deceased or the dead person what is the right thing to do when I receive the disease or the dead person I say bismillah while I'm in Latino surah allah bismillah wala Sunil Sunil both is acceptable this is what I say others add something some of them make I then and your karma what is this suggest Baraka no this is completely not forbidden not permissible others not only do this after they put the deceased one says yeah awesome yeah I mean look man he's calling me I'm dead it says when someone comes to you ask you who's your Lord say Allah and if they ask you what your religion say Islam and if they ask you what who is your prophet and messenger say Muhammad what is this they said no that I'm teaching him so that he would remember you think he would he would know he would be able to learn from you nothing you cannot say except what you have been practicing so this is again among the evils and among the innovation what to do after we finish the burial you raise your hands face the Qibla and ask Allah for forgiveness to the deceased and that may Allah may make him steadfast when the angels come there are number of long hadith at the end inshallah we've covered most of it insha'Allah and the rest you can easily find it in sha allah allahu allah allah allah rabbuna be no hamid go through the innovations which is the last chapter of the book the number two is putting the Quran near the head of a dying person number four reciting the surah yaseen on the dying person and after that number nine the belief of some of the people that the soul of the dying person roams around the place where he died number 12 reciting the Quran iya the deceased till he is washed number thirteen clipping the nails of the diseased and shaving his nose here okay this we have spoken about clipping the nails this the majority of the schools of thought say that this is part of cleaning him now you cannot say that it is a Sunnah or it is an innovation because it is part of washing and preparing but the pubic hair we have discussed this whether it is permissible or not number 15 putting dust on the eyes of the disease and then saying nothing fills eyes of son of Adam except dust number 17 constantly crying day and night number 19 feeling sorrow over seventeen actually the translation is wrong constantly crying whenever lunch or dinner are served number nineteen feeling sore over the disease is a Sunnah the woman should not put on inner and or beautiful clothes when the speed is over they start making pictures in writing read it from the beginning feeling sorrow or the disease is a sooner soon now what is sunnah it's a way of the Prophet listen to the Arabic and who's no Idol may eighty sanity own camula to mourn the death for a whole year so the center the translator read it as Sunnah so it's completely out of context so the renovation is to feel sorry for a disease for a whole year this is not permissible can you correct all the warning in your books please number 20 leaving the beard to grow out of sorrow what the deceased 21 turning the prayer mats upside down and covering the mirrors and the chandeliers okay not the prayer mats any any mats in the house you just turn them over it has nothing to do with prayer mats in my Arabic book 22 not benefiting from the water that is there in the house that comes from underground saying it is the impure because the soul of the disease after coming out of the body immerse in it number 25 not eating meat or grilled food etc number 27 leaving the clothes of the deceased one without cleaning it claiming that this will save him from the punishment of the grave number 28 the statement of some of them whoever dies on the day or night of Friday Thursday night as we call it he'll only be punished in the grave from one hour and then it'll stop and never come back to him number 29 the statement of others the punishment of the grave is lifted from the kafir on Friday and the month of Ramazan due to the honor of the prophet salallahu alayhi wasalam number 30 announcing the death of the disease on pulpits mana is not published is the merits number 31 the statement of some of them when the news of the death of someone reaches to them al-fatiha on the soul and so-and-so number 34 the one who is washing salesy current with every body part that he washes 35 sayings occured loudly when washing and when following it 36 draping the hair of the deceased woman between her breasts number 37 taking the disease to far-off places to bury him near the graves of the righteous people like the halal bait number 40 writing a supplication on the shroud 41 beautification of the bear 43 putting the turban on the bear and then the tar wood and the wedding crown and all that which shows the personality of the deceased 47 the belief of some people that if the bear was of the rightest person it becomes light and reaches it fast number 54 not holding I'm calling it not holding piece in the funeral this include raising the voice of Zickuhr and talking to each other etc any meaning that you do not part of the innovation that you do not follow the funeral in silence so it's an innovation if you think no we cannot be silent we have to raise our voices so this is an innovation and shouting al-fatiha after passing the grave of a pious person 59 that is 61 the belief of some of them that is a janazah is of a righteous person it should be stopped by a wali if it is passing by him even if one's carrying it don't want to Baraka Baraka number 64 sir completing with the beer around the tomb the tomb of a righteous Valley or Maulana or a saint or whatever thinking that this is Baraka number 69 carrying the bear in a car and following it with cars procession number 70 karyam some of the deceased ones on the carts number 71 bring Salah to the vibe on the Muslims who have died in different parts of the world after the Sun sets every day 74 removing the sandals even if there is no impurity on it and then standing on it number 91 saying in the first row of dust in the name of Allah this is one of the sinners I forgot to say after we put the deceased in his grave in his lahat the Sunnah is those attending to grab three handful of dust and throw it in the grave sayings things with it this is one of the innovation reciting surah Fateha number 93 reciting surah al-fatiha near the head of the disease and starting of surah baqara near his legs 95 prompting the disease to say Shahada when he's being buried you can try that 103 putting water on the grave from the side of the head then rounding it and then pouring too much on the center 104 offering condolences near the grave this is an issue of dispute now if you have buried someone and you see the fathers and the sons of this person who was just buried what do you say morning have a good day what do you say you mourn them you say may Allah have mercy on your deceased oh this is permissible but to organize it and to arrange it no but if this is what we all do we go and follow someone's loved one we bury them and after we finished burying them we see their relatives we give them our condolences Shaykh says no this is extremely and not permissible but yeah and this is wrong number 112 celebration of the disease first 728 48th annual

wasallam for a long time turning towards it and supplicating 239 sending chits to the prophets allah wa salem in which their needs are written down now you have emails all of these you like and they're crazy what are you doing and where do you get these things from sending things to the Prophet Isis you know that the Prophet is illiterate he doesn't read Ya Allah mentioned this in the Quran so you're writing it in what language why I pray to Allah you gel to accept what we have done for his sake and make it solely for his sake and I have prayed to Allah that we benefited from what we have learnt and that we should inshaallah increase and learning about this thing and I do personally urge you and ask you if you hear of someone dying a relative or someone you know to participate in Washington dead body inshallah yeah you have to bring this to practice and the more you do it 40 times Allah will forgive you the more you do it you get more practice in it and the closer you get to allah azzawajal because this is going to happen to you one day or the other may Allah make it easy upon us all before we close off I would like to bring a few things to your notice firstly as you all have noticed how all the volunteers have worked through all the days helping out in the seminar please pray that Allah accept is from us and from them I mean you brothers and system can also be a part of team Colima inshallah we will be sending an email out with the volunteers form and you can also fill in and drew it back to us for seeking the pleasure of Allah secondly religious knowledge is the legacy of the prophets the scholars are the inheritors when a person acquires religious knowledge it comes in to a share of that inheritance that is why seeking islamic knowledge is one of the greatest and the noblest of worship a person can engage into we in Colima shared the same thought and implement it through our courses for example we have the doha course extensive fifth course for the ladies kolima kids Arabic and Islamic course Quran and hips for the brothers film yes sir you know or do courses for the ladies on Saturdays and weekly or do lectures by prominent shakes on Thursdays does Alcala for attending the seminar again I would like to thank shake the Sokolov handshake on behalf of Colima and all of us present here we would like to thank you for spending your precious time and teaching us the aspects and rituals of the funeral in the most beautiful manner may Allah reward you for being a part of us and we pray that we get more opportunities to learn from you in the future in sha Allah may Allah increase you in knowledge and I pray that Allah brings all of us together in general for those I mean we only remember death when he strikes and his affiliation comes if we are reminded that someone has died and we remember the death as if it's in the path of it of that person alone therefore we craved for losing the dead but do not realise what will befall on us tomorrow dear brothers and sister we have observed the process of janazah from up close and personal I hope this prepares us for our own end and help us to live a life that gives us success in this dunya in Asura I mean rocky road Ivana al hamdu lillahi rabbil aalameen assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
