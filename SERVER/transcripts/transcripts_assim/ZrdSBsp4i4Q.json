  "title": "Does a wife have to cook for her husband? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "he says does a wife have to cook for her husband what does Islam say about a wife who does not want to cook for her husband the issue of a wife serving her husband is debatable and it's an issue of dispute among scholars since a very long long time as most of these issues however without going into details if we look at the Institute of marriage itself it is very difficult to draw the line as obligations and rights so I will not give you your rights until you do your obligations and she says I'll not give you your rights until you fulfill your obligations as well this is a marriage bound to failure and definitely this is not the right way of communicating and living so if we would like to know how to handle these things we have to go back to the best of generations to the best time of humanity and there is a time of the prophet alayhi salatu salam the most authentic opinion is that a woman is obliged to serve her husband and her children and that is it she's not obliged to serve her in-laws her father and mother-in-law this is not her duty but she is obliged to serve her husband and you can see this clearly in a number of hadith where the Prophet SSM addresses aisha and the rest of his wives by saying prepare food for us bring the food to us in the hadith Avaz map in ABI bakr who was married to a Zubair how one may Allah be pleased with them all she says that I used to cater for a zoo bears horse and I used to feed the horse and take care of him and I would travel to bring him the necessary food and to take care of that horse if you look at the hadith of Fatima the daughter of the prophetess of Salaam who used to work in her house until it affected the softness of her hands so she went to the prophetess am seeking a slave to help her in the shores of the house the prophet Alice a lot Sam did not tell her why should you do this you're not obliged to work no he told her I will teach you something if you say it it would be better for you than a servant so from all of this we learn we understand that a woman is obliged to serve her husband now if she says no I'm not obliged to serve him in this case the husband may say ok I'm only obliged to give you shelter which is a house to clothe you so I'll buy you one garment a year and to feed you and I'll be give you the food on the table and that is it I'm not obliged to do anything else would marriage move on would it be full of compassion and love or would it be something like a feud between two partners in a losing transaction or partnership this is definitely not the right way of doing"
