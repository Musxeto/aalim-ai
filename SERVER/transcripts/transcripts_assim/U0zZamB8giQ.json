  "title": "Clear & 'ambiguous' verses in Quran (Allah's 2 Hands)? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Arman from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh firstly I love you for the sake of Allah. May Allah love you as well. I wanted to know about clear and ambiguous verses in the Quran regarding how does one know that which verse in the Quran is clear or ambiguous. the hand of Allah is over their hands meaning the ones who pledged allegiance with the Prophet Alayhi Salatu Wassalam. Now the Ash'aris would say that the hand means power or authority. On the other hand the Atharis would say it is like the literal hand. Yani it does make sense that the hand could mean power or authority but again how do we know which verse is literal or metaphoric? BarakAllahu Fiikum BarakAllahu Fiikum The attributes of Allah Azza Wa Jal are muhkamat. They are not mutashabihat. The attributes of Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala are unambiguous and Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala spoke to the Arabs in what the Arabs understand. So when Allah says that he has a face that he has two hands saying that he has two hands any Arab would tell you that this is definitely not power or authority or a favor. When I say in Arabic liya yadun alayk I have a favor upon you that you have to repay. So this is a favor. Arabs know when I say this statement they know that this is not a hand that means that it is a favor. But when Allah mentions in the Quran to Satan why did you not prostrate to what I've created with my two hands not one hand? All Arabs know that no this is not power or authority because if it were an ambiguous word or a metaphoric it would not be dual, it would be one. So these are muhkamat and all the salaf from the Prophet alayhi salatu wa salam his companions, the tabi'een, the tabi'at tabi'een acknowledge this. They've never had any of these doubts that the asharis or the maturidis have. These are all came at later times of innovations and karrab aqeedah. The three favorite generations had no issues with that none whatsoever. And this is why the Prophet said alayhi salatu wa salam the best of generations is my generation that is of the companions then the tabi'een, then the tabi'at tabi'een. So this is what the Prophet indicated alayhi salatu wa salam. Now ambiguous or not ambiguous mutashabihat that can have dual meanings here and there they are things that we have no knowledge of but we believe as they are such as what will happen on the day of judgment how heaven and hell is and the likes these we believe as it is but we don't go into it some verses of the Qur'an can be mutashabihat that is or that are understood with other verses so when you come to one verse that says whoever commits a sin and the sin incubates him and surrounds him then he will abide forever in hellfire the khawarij look at this sin and say okay this is kabira then they take their aqeedah saying that all sinners who commit major sins are disbelievers and in hell forever how you dare such a thing so we have this ayah okay this is ayah mutashabihat you have to govern it with other verses of the Qur'an and hadith that help you and entitle you to understand but due to their ignorance they do not do this so I hope this answers your question"
