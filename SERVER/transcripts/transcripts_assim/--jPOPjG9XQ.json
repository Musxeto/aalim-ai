  "title": "She wanted Khula so husband started looking for another wife, sinful if she stays now if he moved on",
  "transcript": "Umm Amina from Emirates. Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu. So my question is about if a woman is asking for khulaf from her husband and the reason why she's asking there's overwhelmingly big problems but one of them is the husband doesn't apologize ever when he doesn't do anything wrong and over the years she could she could not make the husband see what he's doing wrong or apologize. So they already have the time that she's going she's going to be moving out of the house and then she goes to the husband and say if I've done anything wrong to you I apologize then the husband apologizes for what he has been doing and realize that and she feels like it's sincere and that changes our mind and then when she tells the husband the other one says well I've already going to move forward with somebody else my family has already made the family I just have to travel to go do like introduction and see if we can do a contract. So the if the woman wants to stay with with him I don't know is he is she thankful because now is moving forward because she told him that. Umm Amina has he already given her khul? No no. Yes or no? No. No if he has not given her khul then they're still married. or here is 10,000 dirhams in compensation for me getting khul and the husband says I agree then they're they're separated there's no way for them to go back again if she changed her changes her mind unless they remarry again. If this did not take place they're still man and wife. So what is your question now? So my question is now if he has already met over the phone with the family of the to be wife. Okay. If the woman thinks if she says I want to stay because now because she was asking for khul before and he's already trying to move on and looked for another woman I can't stay with you married to another woman and I still want to to stay as a second wife that's also her choice to make and Allah Azzawajal knows best."
