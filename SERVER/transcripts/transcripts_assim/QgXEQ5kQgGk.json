  "transcript": "a brother says if husband and wife are living in different countries is it allowed for them to have intimate conversation on text or phone there's no problem in having intimate conversation whether it's on text emails or audio or even video what's haram is for them to expose their aura on video because we can't guarantee that this is not being spied upon or that it would fall in the wrong hands what's haram is for them to physically masturbate one uh another long distance meaning that the husband watches his wife talk in a sexual and intimate way and he gets aroused and then he masturbates himself this is haram this is masturbation and she does the same if they were just to talk intimately saying nice things to one another how they miss one another what they want to do with one another and they do not masturbate there's nothing wrong in that even if it leads to them ejaculating by just speaking this is totally halal and no problem with that what's haram is for them to do it physically"
