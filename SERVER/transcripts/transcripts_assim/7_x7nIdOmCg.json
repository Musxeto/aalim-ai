  "title": "Is it permissible to wrong someone under oppression? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "says is it permissible to wrong others in fear of great harm for example if one works under an unjust ruler and he says that go capture someone's wealth and land for no reason and unjustly and if he does not obey his tyrant ruler he will be killed can one take some other people's wealth or land in this case first of all this is hypothetical any tyrant as such would probably throw you in jail would probably torture you but he would not kill you if it is certain that he will kill you if you do not take someone's wealth then it is permissible for you to take his wealth because protecting yourself is far greater than other people's wealth but the scholars different do such a person that such such a person is obliged to return to the victim what he had taken from him unjustly it's an issue of dispute but let's assume that a tyrant ruler tells his show soldiers to kill someone or to torture someone or he will kill them the answer is it is not at all permissible for you to harm someone not even by touching his finger and you are better off dying rather than harming them let alone killing them this is totally prohibited unacceptable saving yourself is not a justification to harm other people you die you go to generation la as a martyr but you inflict harm upon others or kill them you are an oppressor and a murderer"
