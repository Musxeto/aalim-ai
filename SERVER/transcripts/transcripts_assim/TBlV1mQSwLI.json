  "transcript": "a sister says can a female dance alone or in front of other females dancing is some say a natural thing another say that it is inappropriate and the most authentic opinion is that if dancing is done alone or in front only of other women and there is nothing haram involved in such dancing such as listening to music which is totally prohibited in Islam or the dance moves do not cause fitna or provoke desire and temptation among other women like belly dancing for example this is in a this is prohibited so if the dance itself a woman dances on her own in order to have exercise that looks like aerobics but its dance moves and there is no imitation of the Kafar she's doing it on her own or in front of other women and it does not imitate the Kafar it's just for the fun of it this is permissible insha'Allah share happiness a mean used to say may Allah have mercy on his soul dancing from women in front of women is inappropriate dancing of men in front of men is disgusting we find some tribes they dance and chant and swirl and and do strange things and jumping this is not appropriate for men to do but for women especially in weddings the way they move around and they they dance to the Islamic Nasheed's and to the Diouf playing this isn't sha Allah permissible with the conditions mentioned earlier"
