  "title": "Wiping is not the same as Washing! Does every inch have to be washed or wiped",
  "transcript": "ahmed from the uk he says that he asked me a question before and i answered him and now he's coming back because he read something in a book which stated that wiping should cover the whole of the organ and this is not crude not true when you wipe over your head you cannot ensure or even claim that you have managed to wipe over every strand of hair so he's saying what to do who cares what you do if you go and read in random books and want to rectify what i say with these random books stay with the books i told you logically when you do this the sunnis to blow and wipe your face now you want to tell me if i were to put my hands in flour dip it in flour and wipe my face that every single inch of my face would be covered by it by one wipe no this is not possible so the point is that wiping is different than washing you do your best by doing it once you do this and that's it you're not supposed to bring a microscope or a magnifying glass and see whether it's covered or not now if you read in other books don't read books without consulting a scholar go to your scholar and ask him and show him so that he could rectify to you and prove to you whether this is legit or it's just a book in that are that is following blindly what his sheikh said and what his sheikh said and what his imam said no you go to the quran and sunnah with understanding of the righteous favorite generations and understand it through that otherwise celebi"
