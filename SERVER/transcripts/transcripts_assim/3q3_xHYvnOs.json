  "transcript": "[Music] can dear brothers and sisters in Islam the Hadith we're about to discuss today was narrated by abdah may Allah be pleased with him he said that the prophet sallallah alaihi Al wasallam said may Allah brighten the face of a person who hears my words understands them memorizes them and convey them to others it may be that someone carries knowledge and gives it to one who understand stands it better than him three things will never allow a muslim's heart to be corrupted sincerity in Deeds for Allah advising the leaders of the Muslims and staying with their Community with the congregation with the JAMA for the supplication of the community of the congregation encompasses those behind them this beautiful Hadith highlights a number of issues among them is how to attain the brightness of the face no creams no lotions no body care the prophet saidat wasam may Allah brighten the face of a person Al IM Cindi said this Hadith means that may Allah grants him clearness of the face glow and Beauty where he would be beautified and adorned through the knowledge he carries which would take him to the adornment of J IM says may Allah have mercy on his soul no one serves the Hadith of the Prophet Alam meaning learning it protecting it studying it and explaining it to others no one does this except you will find in his face adornment and beauty and glow because of this Hadith that gives the Glad Tiding and this is something we could see the scholars of Islam those who act upon it and deliver it you can see see there is a glow in their face it's not of makeup it's not something made up or Faked rather it's a glow from Allah the prophet saysat may Allah brighten the face of a person who hears my words understands them memorizes them and conveys them to others which means that the person would who would get this brightening of the face and the glow and the Beauty has to do the following listens and hears the Hadith memorizes it continues to perfect it and then he delivers it to the people without any Distortion without any shortening or summarizing or changing any of its words such a person the prophet had made Dua for so that his face would be enlightened it would be beautified adorned and that would lead into his chest to be expanded and his moral conduct to be perfected and that he would be a person with content why would someone deliver it to others the prophet saysat it may be that someone carries knowledge and gives it to one who understands it better than him and this means that the narrator of the Hadith the one who reports the Hadith it's not his job to understand it and discover the gyms in it Al IM fi says maybe the one who carries the knowledge might not be a knowledgeable person in the sense that he's not a juror he's not someone who deals with f yet he memorizes it and delivers it to someone who can Finds Its Jewels who can find its jewels and then he would be rewarded for carrying it to someone who understands it better than him Al IM man says in this Hadith it is clear that it's not a condition to understand what you report it's a condition that you memorize correctly and accurately while the F or the juror or the scholar his job is to understand and to contemplate and to stem the gems from that Hadith Al IM says from this Hadith we learned that it is not permissible it is abhor it is Mak to summarize and shorten the Hadith so for someone who is not knowledgeable in because sometimes you tend to summarize and shorten the Hadith and you lose the essence of it because because you do not have the capability to understand it and even Tam may Allah have mercy on his soul says in this Hadith Dua the prophet is clearly giving this Dua to those who carry the Hadith not to those who understand it and explain it and you can just think how much knowledge those who understand it and explain it and how much reward they would get if only the Transporters are getting this Dua then what about those who explain and understand definitely they are more rewarded and I T goes on to say and this is why since many many decades and ages ago the scholars and the people of knowledge till date still praise and compliment those who carry the Hadith and protect us protect it for us IM shaf may Allah have mercy on his soul says whenever I see a scholar of Hadith someone who spends his life writing the Hadith purifying it from any weak or fabricated Hadith looking into the chain of narrators explaining the Hadith when never I see a scholar of Hadith as if I've seen one of the companions of the Prophet Alat because they're doing the same job Imam shaf also says the people of Hadith the scholars of Hadith they've memorized and they narrated and reported the hadiths to us so they have a hand they have a favor upon us because they memorize that for us then the prophet goes on to the punchline of our episode he says three things will never allow a muslim's heart to be corrupted and this is what we want we want to have a healthy heart a heart that would qualify us to meet Allah on the day of judgment without any doubt without any sin that would allow us to enter Paradise without any accountability so these three characteristics if you ensure that you have them in your heart your heart will never be corrupt it would never have or carry any grudges and it would never betray and this is what the word of the Hadith means the first thing is sincerity in Deeds for Allah and of course the essence of Allah the essence of Islam is to be sincere to Allah in whatever you do Allah does not accept your Deeds unless you have two conditions fulfilled one that you do these Deeds for his sake two that you comply with the Sunnah of the Prophet Alat and you do not innovate if one of the two conditions is not fulfilled you're doomed and your Deeds are rejected now this needs episodes but we don't have the luxury to do thisas sincerity doing your Deeds for the sake of Allah is the Cornerstone of your if you don't have it if you're doing it to show off if you go doing it to get more followers and more thumbs up and people talk about you you're doomed always fight to purify your heart and to fill it with sincerity number two advising the leaders of the Muslims and this is one of the attributes the most honorable attributes that the heart of a Muslim individual could have advising the Muslim leaders it's an indication that you love goodness for the Muslims for their leaders for the public and this is a sign of Iman Tam may Allah be pleased with him said the prophet sallallah alaihi Ali wasallam said the dean the religion is is advice or sincerity it can mean both both meanings so we said advice to whom so the prophet saidat to Allah meaning you have to be sincere to Allah to his book to his messenger and to the leaders of the Muslims and their common folk so you advise them and be sincere to them and may Allah have mercy on his soul says advice it is a phrase that you can describe so many things with but essentially it is wanting goodness to one to the one you're giving advice to and there's no single word that can fit this huge meaning when you advise someone why do you do this very simple I want goodness to come his way way and this is why we should always be careful when someone gives us an advice not to take it offensively and not to be offended by it don't think that he's attacking you he wants goodness for you his intention is between him and Allah take what is good and leave what is bad says when you have advice you cannot have grudges corruption and betrayal because it's totally opposite of these three so whoever goes on to say whoever gives advice to the leaders to the imams to the rulers and to the public at large then his heart is purified from such grudges corruption and hatred and betrayal then the prophet saysat thirdly and staying with their congregation with the JAMA with the community with the um and says this is a clear sign that your heart has no evil no corruption no hatred and no grudges when you are with the congregation and refusing to be rebellious or to AB abandon them because when you are with the congregation and you give them advice and you love them and you love goodness for them then you love goodness for yourself and that would mean that your heart is purified says this is totally different to those who take sides and leave the congregation and the JAMA totally different for those who poke and look down upon them resent them criticize them like the does like the like the all of these they have their hearts filled with hatred feelings of Vengeance betrayal that's why you find the the furthest from all people from sincerity and the most corrupt against the Muslim rulers and the umah at large and the furthest from the JAMA of the Muslims this is the testimony of the Prophet Alam this is the testimony of the um and this is what they testify against themselves never ever there was an enemy of Islam except they would support him and they would stand shoulder toosh shoulder with him they would give him advice against the umah this is what says and at the end of the time where is the largest supporters of the Antichrist the deal where will they come from from asahan 70,000 would follow him they're being groomed there raised and nourished today and this just gives you a an indication imari says to be with the congregation with the community is to be with them in the in the Creed so you have to be with the to believe in what the prophet Sall wasallam and his Companions and the and believed in and not to follow these deviant Cults and sects who manipulate Allah's beautiful names and attributes among other things you have to be with the congregation in doing good deeds such as praying Fridays praying congregational prayer and other things like that Imam may Allah have mercy on his soul says whoever is sincere in his deeds and he always advises people rulers the general folk with goodness and he's always with the congregation with the community does not go against them does not differ with them his heart will be pure gold it would be clear and he would be a will and an ally to Allah and if he's not like that then his heart would be filled with corruption hatred grudges and betrayal then finally the prophet saidat for the supplication of the community encompasses those behind them which means that when you are with the community and the congregation and you give advice to the imams and the rulers and you're sincere the da the supplication of all Muslims in the world would Encompass you alongside with them so it would protect you from the evils of Shan and from going astray it will act like a huge shield and this is an indication that whoever comes out of the con congregation will never get the blessings of the Muslims and the blessings of their Dua because he's away and cannot be encompassed with them I know that many youngsters who were not raised upon Quran and Sunnah may not like what they hear and this is a sign of hypocrisy when they come to the Hadith of the Prophet Alat wasam and they say that oh no we don't want to be with the community and the congregation because we see many signs of corruption the leaders are this the leaders are that the rulers are this the rulers are corrupt they are cfir they're not ruling by Allah's law and they start to give rulings and verdicts which diverts them from the straight path and puts them in line with the deviated Cults and sects this is how the came to light when you do not follow the Sunnah of the Prophet Alat and his teachings you think that I know more and anyone who speaks the truth and tells you that this is Islam there is no such thing as democracy there's no such thing as freedom of speech in Islam that allows you and entitles you to come and criticize the Muslim ruler yes if he does something wrong we give him advice the scholars the people of authority would be obliged to give him advice this is their Duty in Islam but not to go in public shaming him criticizing him putting him down taking the respect out of people's hearts as if he's a normal person this is not Islam if you have an issue with Islam this is your problem not everyone who explains the Quran and explains the prophet's Hadith sallahu alaih wasallam is a bootlicking whatever kissing individual this is not true what we do is we explain the religion and we show the of even if people don't like it we don't take a penny from them we don't have any favors from them we try our level best to be independent only depending on Allah but this doesn't mean that it entitles us to go out of our and Sh and criticize them and say bad things about them it is not permissible we have to give them advice we have to make Dua for them even if people are not listening we do make Dua for them that Allah would make them steadfast that Allah would Avenge the Muslims through them and to guide them and to grant them good followers and good companions but this does not at all mean that we turn a blind eye to what is against Shar or not to advise them and at the same time it doesn't entitle us or allow us to go and criticize them publicly like the Kish may do we have to obey and adere as the prophet said to usat only those have clean hearts and pure hearts others you can see it in their face no glow no bright in of the face and there is no Baraka in what they do because all what they want is chaos and Mayhem all what they want is Bloodshed look at the Arab Spring and what it caused the Muslim world in the past 12 or 13 years destruction misplacement migration in the millions and who won nobody so if we don't abide by the Quran and the Sunnah our hearts would be tarnished would be filled with hatred with betrayal with grudges like the prophet had warned usam and we would lose the glow we would lose the beautification and adornment that we would have gotten if we were to follow the Quran and the Sunnah we have a short break stay tuned and inallah we'll be right"
