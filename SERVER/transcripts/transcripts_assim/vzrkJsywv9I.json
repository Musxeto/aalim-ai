  "transcript": "Dhafi from Indonesia. Dhafi, Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu, Wa'alaykumussalam Can you tell me how do I eat using my hands like the Prophet ﷺ did? The Prophet ﷺ ate using his right hand only. And he used to use three fingers to eat directly. However, this is not something that is mandatory upon us. So if a person uses a fork, a spoon, or any other means, this is halal. But if a person uses his fingers, the sunnah is to lick your fingers after you finish. Can I use my five fingers, my whole hand? Yes, but this is not in accordance to the sunnah. And this is according to the etiquette, according to the customs, according to the traditions in your country. It differs from one country to the other. And there is nothing prescribed as mandatory other than you must not use your left hand to eat with or drink with, and Allah knows best."
