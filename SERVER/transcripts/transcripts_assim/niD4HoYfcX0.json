  "transcript": "if this hair transplant is for covering something that is abnormal then the answer would be yes it is permissible for example if someone who is 4 years old and he's boldness his head it's falling they usually the head is not following his this age in this case it is permissible for him to transplant hair and because this is like correcting something that was wrong but if someone was like in his forty or like in his fifty years old and it is natural for him to lose hair then in this case it appears that it is not permissible for him to have such a transplant and Allah our Georgia knows"
