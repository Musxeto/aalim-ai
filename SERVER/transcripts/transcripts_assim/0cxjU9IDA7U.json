  "title": "When is it allowed for a person to start a new row in congregation? #islam #islamic assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "So sh as we know that uh we have to fill up the first row in prayer and then the second row and so on and if someone makes a row on his own in spite of having the space to fit in in the existing row his prayer is invalid. So my question is when a person forms a row on his own when is it considered a legit role like is it when another person comes and joins him and what if the person who formed the row started his prayer before the second person standing besides him. If the person starts the prayer in on his own while there is a space in the front row and there's no one next to him, his prayer is invalid. He has to wait until someone comes and they make a row. Okay, they will be both on the edge but their prayers are valid because they started together. Or he has to go and this is what is mandatory upon him and fill the gap in the uh front row."
