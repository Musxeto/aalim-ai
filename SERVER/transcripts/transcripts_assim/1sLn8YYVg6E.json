  "transcript": "emails pending amatulla says kindly let us know what we must do during the turbulent times of coronavirus epidemic what are the doors what are the precautions and must men stop attending messages and friday prayers first of all whenever we want to discuss something that impacts muslims it is our duty to fall back and search for an and the sunnah and what trusted scholars of islam said about this so our logic our process of thinking is different than other people because we have foundation that we rely on to look at things and know their reality we as muslims believe that whatever happens in this universe was preordained by allah azza wajal and this was for a legitimate reason and the justification lies with allah azzawajal who is knowledgeable powerful and fair so our hearts are calm what whatever Allah chooses for us yet we have to understand that all this around us is the creation of Allah viruses are not different viruses are a creation of allah azza wajal they are soldiers of the soldiers of allah the almighty and they do not act from them their own selves and this is why when we deal with it we have to deal with it in an Islamic way the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam visited one of the female companions who was suffering from fever so he said o OMA Sahib you're suffering from this fever and we can tell by the way you look by the way you sound so she said yes Oh prophet of Allah may Allah does not may Allah not bless fever so she is cursing fever so the Prophet said doesn't do not curse the fever because it is your share and portion from Hellfire meaning that Allah Azza WA JAL if he were to punish a person in hellfire the fever he's afflicted by in this life he raises that punishment on the day of judgement and also the Prophet alehissalaam prohibited us from cursing the wind wind that destroys things hurricanes tornadoes the Prophet Adam do said do not curse the wind for it is or it was ordered by allah azza wajal and likewise cursing the day I saw you it was a black year that we met and may allah azzawajal curse the time I should talk to you cursing the time the year days and months they don't have a choice of their own they don't impact our lives it's what Allah preordained in them that affects us so when you curse the viruses the wind or time you're actually cursing Allah the facilitator of things and this is something that people should be aware and avoid also we have to know that whatever happens to us this is either a punishment from Allah for our sins or it's not a punishment rather it is a test to elevate your level in Paradise any raise some of your sins so prophets of Allah were tested with calamities with illnesses with poverty with their enemies attacking them this wasn't a punishment it was to erase sins and to elevate their place in paradise and to us generally speaking whatever happens to us is something to erase our sins and a punishment Allah says in the Quran women are becoming more Seba favi mikasa but a deacon yf1 kathira and whatever strikes you of disaster it is for what your hands have earned but he there is Allah pardons much this is what the Companions understood may allah be pleased with them i'm running in her sign fell sick one day and his companions came to visit him and one of them said i feel sorry for what you're going through and for your suffering and he said to him don't this is because of a sin and what allah azza wajal pardons is far greater than what you're seeing so this illness is a punishment due to a sin that i had committed but allah has forgiven so many sins and did not punish me for them so don't be sorry we have to understand what is happening and likewise what Allah may Allah be pleased with him the uncle of the Prophet alysus I'm used to say when praying to Allah for rain he used to preach the people and say o people there is no calamity that the sense except due to sin due to sins that you commit and it would not be uplifted that is the calamity until you repent to allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala so this is the understanding of the companions may allah be pleased with them that this was caused by our sins and not necessarily that everyone inflicted by such a calamity or an illness is sinful as i stated earlier it can be to erase his sins and to elevate his position at the sight of allah so we have a situation is it an epidemic or is it far greater and its pandemic well if you look at the facts you find out that throughout all those infected with this virus the fatality is around two percent and among all those infected by it the recovery rate some make it up to eighty percent and I got a call a couple of days ago from Belgium and the brother said that they had discovered two cases I don't know maybe it's much more now in Belgium and he says can we skip Friday prayer subhanAllah is this an epidemic to my observation it is not yes people are hyping it people are inflating it but is it actually a world threat or not either way this is not something for me to decide but it is not something to be classified classified as a plague or something that threatens the well-being of all people scholars say that when it comes to plague this is a specific pandemic that the prophet alayhi salatu salam told us if you hear of it in a location do not go there and if it strikes a place you are at the moment in do not run away from it do not exit this is what is known as quarantine in modern times the Prophet said that 15 centuries ago so by this sense can we compare the coronavirus to the plague the vast majority of scholars say no plague is different because the Prophet told us that the plague is martyrdom to those who died with it so you should not run away from martyrdom and this is caused by the jinn as the Prophet as some the pinching of the jinn so if it strikes a city you're in stay in the plague and if you hear about it in a city don't go there but this does not cascade to other epidemics so the corona virus is not part of it and the majority of scholars say that you can run if it hits a country because it is not that big of proportion nevertheless Islamically what should we do well it is only logical if you acknowledge that it is due to our sins instead of focusing on wearing facemasks which health specialists say that this is not a good thing to do for healthy people face masks are only advisable to those who are sick but healthy people this increases the chances of them getting the virus instead of focusing on washing your hands thoroughly which is something Islam recommends to take the means necessary to protect ourselves and our children but wouldn't be illogical to focus on such means rather than addressing a lot almighty by supplicating by invoking by begging him to protect us and the first step is to eliminate any sins that we have have in our houses that we have in our workplace that we have in our communities and we have thousands of them so you want health you want healing you want cure ask it from who has it in his hands repent to him invoke him and we as Muslims have a set of duaa that we say every morning and every evening I would be Kelly Mathilde Hector Matty me sherry Mahalo three times miss melody Loyola reminds me she will L do LF s Emma or semi-arid him three times and also a beautiful Dora that

nothing wrong in that stay away from people who sneeze or cough in your face there's nothing wrong in that but at the same time do not neglect what Allah Azza WA JAL has ordered you to do and that is to stay away from sin oma Meera from the states and I apologize for keeping you waiting Saddam Tula"
