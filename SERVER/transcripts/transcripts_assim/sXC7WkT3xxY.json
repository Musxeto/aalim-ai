  "transcript": "uh she if a person decides to move to a CAF country and uh lives there has his kids there and then the kids turn out messed up as a result of their surroundings because they didn't get Fair preaching how are the kids accountable y isn't is it okay to blame the parents for how misguided they have become or is this Che first of all the parents are accountable for Migra to a cafer country but this is all where it ends we cannot Cascade this to blame them for any wrongdoing the children may do because the children are adults they chose to act in such a fashion I know a lot of families that live in the US and in Europe who are practicing who are taking their kids to Sunday schools to learn the Quran who takes them to J and Jama and they try their level best to upbring them in an Islamic way and they and and they succeed big time the children are practicing mallah and they're leading a good successful Islamic life and I know of parents living in Muslim countries miles away from Mecca or from Medina and they fail big time in up bringing their children where their children are heedless they don't know where the is they don't know what the Haram looks like so this is not a one size that fits all sometimes you do your level best with your children and Allah wills it otherwise yes the environment does have an impact so the chances of your children going astray in the US is far higher and greater than them going astray in a Muslim country so as long as the parents are doing their due diligence and trying their level best then their the fault would fall upon the children not the parents"
