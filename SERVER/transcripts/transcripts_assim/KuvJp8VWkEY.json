  "transcript": "I I've been struggling with this one ever since I read this Hadith which um St I have to admit I I didn't like when I read it and the Hadith is uh the prophet peace upon he said that the people of Yemen are the best of people and I also read Hadith where it says that there's uh no race is better there's no racial Supremacy and then I I read this one and I to this day I'm still struggling believe like why are the the people of are the people of Yemen better why are the people of Yemen the best of people the prophet did not say that they are the best in the sense of that they are the most Believers he said that they have the cleanest of hearts and the truth the most truthful and honest of rhetoric they don't lie that's in generality and this is one of the ways of the prophet of being positive he said positive things about all the tribes in Arabia about the people in Tam in he said this about the people of hij he said this about this and that because the prophet was always positive looking at the positive things of the people not looking at the negatives and to put them down so this is not a blank a check Blan for them to do whatever they want they said that simply they have clean Hearts they don't hold a grudge and we see this among the people we know from Yemen we know them I'm not talking about the hthis so it's it's you can't say that this about people uh uh in genetically I hope this makes sense well could you don't me to keep going on this but could you not argue that that's racial Supremacy so what we do know that there is racial Supremacy we do know that although blacks and whites red and yellow are equal and they only differ with the tawa the piety in the heart but we also know that Allah selected the Arabs due to their language du to their Heritage due to their uh Supremacy at the time between the byzantian the Persians the Jews and the Christians of maintaining a level of moral conduct and um a level of social uh justice between them at the time but today we don't judge people by the color if in sou you see this we may have imams who are black we have non-arabs leading the prayer you have me I'm not originally Arab I'm originally from Indonesia mhm so nobody says anything nobody dares to say anything with my 9 mm Glock but still we respect it when we feel yeah there of our homies we have no problem so at at a certain time the Arabs were chosen people the same way Jews believe that they were chosen at yes and this is why Quran is in Arabic it's not in any other language you can have have translations in many languages but Quran is Arabic so can you say Arabs were the chosen people no because we have the worst come from the Arab world Bashar we can few name few but it's not the race you don't have the uh um what is it the notion that I can say bad things about Islam because of this or that we don't have any racism in Islam blacks and whites are equal we have this we can see it everywhere my father-in-law is as black as night my father-in-law he's black and he's the most beloved person to my life Allah have mercy on his soul that doesn't make any difference we don't have this in us we don't think of a race where are where are you Hispanic I'm uh I'm everything so everything but originally my uh mom is Filipino my dad is black white okay so we we we we integrate we don't look down at anyone"
