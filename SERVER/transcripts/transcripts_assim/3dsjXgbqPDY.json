  "transcript": "Elisa from Belgium. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam. My question is, the only mosque in my city has only one prayer room and so it is a mixed mosque and there is no entrance for women and one for men and it's a common door. Is it allowed to go and pray to this mosque? Of course it is allowed to pray in that masjid because the Prophet's masjid Alayhis Salatu Wassalam, when he was alive and afterwards, did not have a segregation between the men's section and the women's section as we have today. So it was all open. However, the Prophet made it clear that the worst of women's rows is the first and the worst of men's rows are the last. And the best of men's rows are the first and the best of women's rows are the last so that they would be as far as possible. And even when he completed his prayer, he would not turn around and he would give some time for the women to cover up or to leave the masjid and men would not move as well. So definitely yes, you can go and pray in that masjid."
