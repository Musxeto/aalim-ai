  "transcript": "faizan from india my brother had a question he says dear sheikh i read from a publication that says i cannot reproduce its content in any way like in digital form or in any way however i take notes from it and sometimes copy a text from it by typing it down that i wish to share with people so they benefit like the statement of the scholar etc is it permissible to share in such a manner after typing small parts of the text down separately he says some publications have this disclaimer that all articles are not to be reproduced not to be copied not to be shared not to be why wouldn't they put also not to be read this is not logical i bought the magazine or the book with my own money so if i would like to share a excre except expert expert whatever uh part of it online or photocopy it and give it to a friend or use it in my speech do you think that all my lectures and speeches are from thin air i'm making them i have to do a lot of research and collect from here and there and there's nothing wrong in that so you have no problem what they meant by this disclaimer usually is that they would like you to not benefit not to make business out of it so they don't want it to be used commercially but if it was for private use or to benefit a friend or relative or a neighbor there's no problem in that"
