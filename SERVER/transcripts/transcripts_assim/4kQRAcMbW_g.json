  "transcript": "Halima from Sudan. Okay, I will answer you In Sha Allah. So Halima's question is, does she have the right to wish to die? Now, first of all, to our brothers and sisters in Sudan, I pray to Allah Azza Wa Jal that He relieves them from their calamity and that He brings peace and prosperity to our beloved brothers and sisters of Sudan, a land of many, many good things and good people and righteous people and people who are dedicated to Islam and serving Islam. And of course, there are always those who are working against Islam. There are always those who are hypocrites who want that not to materialize. Nevertheless, no single individual on earth is not being tested. Those in Sudan are tested. Those in Libya are being tested. Those in Yemen, those in Syria, those in Europe, those in the US, those in China, every single individual is being tested. Some are tested with wealth and health and prosperity, but they will be questioned for every single dime they earn and spend and for every single moment they've enjoyed. And they will answer that in their grave and afterwards on the Day of Judgment and then in Hellfire. And even those who are impoverished, those who are suffering insecurity, rape, hunger, famine, all of those are being tested. And the moment they are dipped once in Jannah, they will swear by Allah they had never seen hardship in their lives. Not a single moment, because they will forget everything. So be patient and acknowledge that this is a test from Allah. If Allah wanted, He would have relieved everything that you're suffering from and He would have made everything back to normal or even better. But this is a test from Allah. You have to endure and tolerate. Now wishing for death is prohibited because the Prophet said, alayhis salatu was salam, la yatamanna yanna ahadukumu almawta li dhurrin masah. Do not hope for death for a calamity that had fallen upon you. Rather say, O Allah, grant me life as long as life is good for me and grant me death as long as death is good for me. So you are placing the choice in Allah's hands for you to choose whatever is best for you without transgressing and asking for death. May Allah make things easy for all of us."
