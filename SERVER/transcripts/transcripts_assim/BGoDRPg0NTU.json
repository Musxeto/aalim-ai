  "transcript": "ayat from the usam Alum Alum Salam when speaking about Ahmed and Muslims who don't consider them to be kafers someone said whoever denies kufur knowingly is a kafer did the person who said that commit a sin I don't understand if you're talking about Ahmed and you're saying that they're cfir who's denying it a Muslim so if he denies that they are not cfir out of ignorance and not knowing the kufur they have brought to the table yeah this is Forgiven because of his ignorance but if he knows that they reject that the prophet Muhammad Alat wasam is the last and final messenger and they say no he's not and they say that Jesus Christ BP upon him had this or that he died and and and the likes and that he would become a prophet or messenger they think of their uh prophet and their Imam to be a messenger of Allah Etc this is tot among so many things a whole list of kufur if he knows this and he still denies that they're cafer yes definitely he's an apostate cafer like them"
