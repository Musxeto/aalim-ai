  "transcript": "Ahmed from the Maldives Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh I heard that it is recommended to pray two rakat if someone gets a nightmare me then and very often I'm getting very bad dreams when I sleep after praying Fajr so can I pray two rakat if I get a bad dream at this time what the vast majority of us know is that the Prophet said alayhis salatu wasalam whenever you see a bad dream or a nightmare you should as soon as you wake up spit three times to your left and seek refuge in Allah from the cursed Satan and turn to the other side meaning sleep on the other side in another authentic narration the Prophet said pray two rakats so it is part of the Sunnah inshallah to pray two rakats if you wake up at the prohibited time then it is still permissible because such two rakats have a legitimate reason like the salutation of the masjid like the two rakats of wudu like dua istikhara prayer and the likes they have legitimate reason you can pray them any time of the day and the night"
