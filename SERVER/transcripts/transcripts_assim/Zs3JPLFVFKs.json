  "transcript": "Mustafa from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Yes, so Sheikh, I had a question which a friend wanted me to ask you. I kind of know the answer I feel you're gonna give to this, but I'll just ask in case still And so the question he asks is and I quote What should I do if my fiance says that she wants mehendi and baraat instead of just the nikkah and the waleema function She wants what? His fiance wants the mehendi and baraat function. What is the baraat function? Sheikh, these are just two Extra ceremonies which take part in the Indo-Pak subcontinent and he only wants the nikkah and the waleema But I think the fiance wants those two extra functions as well. Okay. First of all, the mehendi is a Gathering I think where they decorate the bride and the groom with hinnah and decoration on their body. If there is free mixing or Mixing between the groom and other women who are non-mahram or the opposite. This is totally prohibited But if it's only for women and they only follow a cultural thing that has nothing to do with the Hindus It's a cultural thing that even the Muslims do and they have pride in it has nothing to do with the Hindus No men are admitted. No non-mahram would ever see her in her hinnah and Decoration. This is permissible The baraat thing I don't know about it, but the same concept applies now If you as a groom Don't feel like doing it. You just simply say no, I'm not gonna do it. I'm just gonna do the waleema. This is my obligation in Islam You want to do the other two functions according to the sharia? Your father has to pay for it or you pay for it from your mahr and Allah knows best You"
