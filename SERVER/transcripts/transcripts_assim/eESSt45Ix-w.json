  "title": "Can we learn from Dr.Tahir ul Qadri, Minhaj Al Quran Why we pray Fajr 2 rakahs, dhuhr 4..Assimalhake",
  "transcript": "he's asking about manager Quran by dr. pahar al-qadir I have not seen the book but I know that any it you should not go through it because the doctor is a controversial personality and there are lots and lots of red flags around him around his appear around his political affiliations and so many things that this is not the right time to discuss them so definitely this is not a good thing to follow one of the things for example is saying that why is for two Rakas the for a cos a Sephora cos mother of three records in Asia for a cos you find this on YouTube and he comes with so many weird things such as that Taraka is because Adam when he descended to earth he prayed two rakahs so Allah as usual mandated that the Muslim spirit to rock and fetcher and Ark of Noah when it settled after the flood disappeared he prayed for raka so Allah made it four rockefeller and Ibrahim when Allah Azza WA JAL saved his son from being slaughtered and gave a sacrifice he prayed for records it's so many weird things and I don't know where these things come from but these are not related to Islam so definitely you should not learn from such a an individual"
