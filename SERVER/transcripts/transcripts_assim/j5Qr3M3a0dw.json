  "title": "Is it compulsory to publicly announce the Mahr during Nikah? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "ch√©rif says is it compulsory to announce the value of the maha during Danika maha means dowry which a man gives to the woman he is getting married to Nakara means marriage so now we know that in order to a marriage to take place there has to be the proposal from the Guardians side the father of the girl he goes to the boy and says I give you my daughter in marriage so this is the proposal and there has to be the acceptance from the boy so he says I accept her marriage and there has to be two Muslim male witnesses at least to testify of course all of this is with the consent and approval of the girl nothing is being done without her approval prior approval so if this is done the marriage is conducted and their man and wife what about the doubting well the dowry can be given before can be giving at the time and can be given afterwards but it has to be identified so it is it compulsory to announce in front of the thousand people attending the wedding or the marriage contract by saying well I my daughter has received a thousand euros no there is no obligation in that however it is recommended if not a little bit more that the two witnesses acknowledge the mahara so that if in the future we need to perform whole or there's a divorce or she the woman did not receive her Muharram the two witnesses would come to the judge and say yes it was a thousand euros and it was not delivered to the girl to our knowledge so the judge forces him to pay so these two are sufficient what about if we did not tell anyone in this case there is a dilemma because at the time of divorce or holer separation the husband says I intended to give you a thousand and the girl says no you were supposed to give me five so how do we solve this dispute the Muslim judge looks at the average that girls receive as dowry in their community and he forces the man to pay that amount and Alonso John knows best"
