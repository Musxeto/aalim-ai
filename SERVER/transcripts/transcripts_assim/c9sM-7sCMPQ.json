  "transcript": "Mazhar from India. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Yeah, in the subcontinent where I stay, when one's daughter has reached puberty, the parents of the daughter, through a grand party, publicize everybody that the daughter has gone puberty. This particular practice has been followed by a lot of non-Muslims. I just want to have your idea on that. This is immodest. And the Jews have this for boys when they reach the age of puberty. And maybe the Hindus have it, I don't know. But it is immodest when you announce such a thing that normal girls at this age would be bashful and shy to say. And you throw a party of that? This is totally not ethical and not a good thing to do. And I would believe that it is more of something prohibited. Because it's not part of our religion, it's not part of our culture, and it's an immodest thing as well and Allah knows best. Al-Fatiha."
