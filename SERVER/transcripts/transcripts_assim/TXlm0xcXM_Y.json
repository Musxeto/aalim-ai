  "transcript": "just mention a point there that that that we didn't really mention in the episode that um one of the best ways to establish a relationship a relationship is between two parties and one is always more has the priority over the other one is in fear and one is is above him as a community or as a Muslim Community how important it is for us to really uh exhibit ourselves as the the group that is above how how important it is well you don't have to go around and brag about it because then you'll make people more hostile to you it is not what others think of you it is what you think of yourself and this is why so many verses of the Quran and our problem is that we always neglect Quran we just think and think and think without going back to the ultimate con institution the Divine words of Allah Asel Allah the almighty tells us that honor and pride is for those who believe and humility is for the Hypocrites so this Pride this honor that Allah Asel bestowed upon the Muslims the Muslims should be proud of themselves we rarely see people being proud of themselves as Muslims and not go to oppress people mhm so if you're a Muslim be being a Muslim be proud when you deal with others don't feel ashamed when they ask you why are you doing this well because I'm a Muslim I'm sorry MH why are you apologetic MH why don't we find people praying in malls in universities in schools in uh uh cdor for example if it's time for prayer so no there's no prayer Hall so yeah I can pray in front of all of these people they're they're watching me so you could see so many strange strange things happening in front of you yet nobody's commenting so why are you ashamed of praying why is a Muslim woman ashamed of wearing the veil of wearing the hijab and covering her body as Allah instructed her why is a man ashamed of having his beard mhm he said well I'd like to be clean shaven like everybody else why you have your dignity you have your pride you have your source of Honor which is the Quran and the following of the Prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam so this is how we should be and we should not feel inferior to anyone but at the same time this does not mean that we should step over everybody else mhm because this is what they're doing you've got people stepping over everybody else the white see themselves as the superior race and anyone who's Jew Muslim black gay women Etc as you hear them say they're considered to be inferior and the black consider themselves to have black power MH and Hispanic think else something else and then you've got the the Asians and you've got why is this this is how created you this is not not something to be proud of if you're tall or short this is not of your own doing but your faith your belief is what you should be proud of real goal between the relationship between a Muslim and a non Muslim the ultimate goal is to give him the message but what what about those people who clearly reject the the message like for example his maintenance guide after so many tries how do we act in society with our neighbors with the people who live in the community what is our what is our relationship with them well our relationship with them is BU is built on Mutual needs MH so if I were to have a maintenance man who bluntly rejects Islam and he doesn't want to become a Muslim he's not interested in Islam what would I do if I need his Services again I'd give him a call and he would come and fix what's needs to be fixing uh which need to be fixed and I'll pay him so this is the relationship having said that coming back to the first comment you you've mentioned it is not only the Muslims and the non-muslims relationship that I should evaluate it is also the Muslims Muslims relationship meaning that if I have a friend and this friend is a bad friend he fornicates he drinks he fools around he doesn't pray on time just because he's a Muslim does not mean that this gives me the right to be with him to be around him on the contrary Islam tells me reject this guy look for someone who is much better to be with actually it would be better in that case to have a non-muslim friend who is got conscious again no not to that level okay because still he is a non-muslim but having said that this bad Muslim I should not make him as as my Ally I should not be friend with him because I tried my best to change him and he would not change so I have to neglect him I have to avoid him and look for the good company that draws me closer to Allah so if you imagine this you believe now it is not hatred that we have a against the non-muslims M it is against those who do not abide by the Quran and Sunnah yes okay"
