  "transcript": "[Questioner] from UK I'm a bit confused about you know where \nthe beard grows towards the cheeks   until when can you start shaving it off. \nWhen does it stop becoming the beard. I did not understand your question. You know the beard - The beard. Yeah, the top part of the beard when \nit's growing towards the cheeks. Ah here? - Yeah, where does \nit stop becoming the beard. When can you start shaving it off? The scholars say that the hair that grows \non your cheek and on your lower jawbone,   this is considered to be the beard. So, all \nof this is the beard. If it's here underneath   your eyes on top of your cheekbones. \nCheekbones are not your beard so you can   shave this area but this area here I'm not \nfeeling it because I’m looking at my monitor.   This area here is considered to be part of your \nbeard because it's on your cheek. What's on your   cheekbone and above or below your eyes this \nis not part of that, and Allah knows best."
