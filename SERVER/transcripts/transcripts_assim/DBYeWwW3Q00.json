  "transcript": "dealing now with uh many couples also with your therapy sessions are you seeing the divorce rate increasing decreasing and what are some of the causes if if so the majority of the cases alhamdulillah are decreasing when someone intervenes someone with knowledge not me of course but if an elder in the family sits with them and this concept is mentioned in the quran that when there is a conflict between the spouses send an arbitrator from his family and from hers so they both come and sit together and delegate and talk about the problem and come up with um solutions that may be accepted accepted by both parties this is best see islam does not promote divorce and this is why verse 34 chapter 4 in the quran allah gives a sequence and this sequence may not be preferred by so many people because they think of okay how is it possible for a man to beat his woman and he's not beating him with a baseball bat allah says those who are disobedient and rebellious among your wives you have to uh advise them so for a whole month or two i'm reminding her of allah i'm telling her this is not good for the family come on honey this is not right you have to do this according to the law of allah i have no problem do you want to follow sharia or do you want to follow your whims and desires if the woman says i want to follow sharia good for you that's look what shariah says and we follow it this is what we how we solve conflicts there's a conflict between me and you eddie you say right i say left so what to do we can't one we can't fight it off so we bring someone to arbitrate the person who arbitrates comes to us and say do you want to follow sharia or do you want to follow your whims and desires as muslims immediately we say sharia there's no doubt in that then he displays what the shariah says and if i was wrong i will say i adhere sharia [Music] rules if i'm not a real muslim i would say no let's go to the civil court let's go to a shaman who would uh say something in my favor rather than yours then this indicates that i'm not a true real genuine muslim in marriages the same thing happens so if the man is the oppressor i say to him if he says well it depends what shariah says i said case is closed because you don't want islam if both of them want islam alhamdulillah we reach a settlement and a conclusion that is acceptable to both and most of these cases alhamdulillah end up in this way"
