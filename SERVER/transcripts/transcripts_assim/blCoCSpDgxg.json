  "transcript": "Good morning, sir. My name is Maria. I'm from Singapore, just next door neighbor. Sir, I would like to asking you, this is not regarding about the fear and hope. Since, sir, you in nationality in Arab Saudi, I would like to ask you, what is the Islam view on punishment such as death penalty, stoning or cutting of someone's hand? Second question, does Islam encourage honor killing? Thank you very much, sir. Okay, if I knew you are going to ask these questions, I would not give you the microphone. First of all, it has nothing to do with Arabs. What are you asking? As if you're accusing me. I'm from Medan, from Indonesia. So, originally, sir, I brought my durian with me, but I left it in the hotel. Anyhow, so first of all, what you're asking about are the prescribed punishment mentioned in the Quran and the Sunnah. The chopping of the hand of those who steal is mentioned in the Quran. The flogging is mentioned in the Quran. The killing of a murderer is mentioned in the Quran according to the conditions of fiqh. Not anyone who pickpockets, I'm going to chop his hand. There are conditions. It has to have value. It has to be in a hirz that is concealed. It has to be in secret, blah, blah, blah, a lot of things. So, these prescribed punishments are Sharia from Allah Azza wa Jal. No one can change this. No one can say, hmm, that was good 15 centuries ago. Today, no, no, no, no. But this is not for individuals. This is for the ruling authority only. So, this answers your second question, the ruling on honor killing. There is nothing honorable about what you're mentioning. There is no honor killing in Islam. This is a crime committed by certain individuals in some countries, not Arabs only, even in America. So many murders, OJ Simpson, you don't know, maybe you're too young for that. Anyhow, so, there are so many things that's happening has nothing to do with honor. Islam is so beautiful that no one can criticize it. It's in the Quran, the Sunnah for all regions, all times until the day of judgment. So, I hope this answers your questions, Inshallah. Inshallah."
