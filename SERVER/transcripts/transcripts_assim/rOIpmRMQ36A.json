  "title": "Making Dua or Invoking to OTHER Than Allah is Shirk!  | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh we have mahesh from the u.s uh there is a very prominent scholar here in the west and the scholar has recently uh issued a fatwa about um claiming that when we intercede to the dead uh or when we make dua to the awliya or the saints that this is not shirk within itself as long as those people do not intend um you know like they're calling out to a god so the reason he says that is he says the actions are judged by intentions and because they don't mean it uh that this is not so there's a lot of people who got misguided because of this so if you can please clarify inshallah i will do that says that there is a pro a renowned daria in the us who says that asking intercession from um dead people or from graves is not a shirk by itself yet it is a means of shirk and that it would be prohibited haram but it is not shirk unless the person who who's asking for such intercession has the intention to call them as gods so what is the ruling on that first of all do not take knowledge from the likes of me or the likes of him take knowledge from real scholars this quote unquote renowned scholar he's a die he does not qualify to be a scholar he's a student of knowledge so there are so many of us we are fortunate to be famous because allah has blessed us with this gift and after that with the media had it not been to peace tv huda tv that tv islam channel etc and the social media nobody would have known known anything about us so i'm telling you this when you want to take knowledge proper knowledge especially when it comes to akida don't go to tom dick and harry don't go to people who keeps keep on switching in the uh the books of the salaf they reported that imam malik ibn anas was approached by a man of the people of innovation so he said stop imam let me debate with you so imam malik had some time on his uh uh free time so he said okay then what suddenly says if i beat you in my argument and debate you follow me and if i don't beat you and you beat me i follow you so imam malik says okay let's assume i followed you and you beated me then we both met someone who debated with us and he beated us so the man says we follow him he said my son the religion of allah is one and i see that you keep on hopping from one religion to the other this is not islam so those who adopt for all most of their life a particular opinion then they change to a second opinion give them some time and they will change to a third opinion are these people worthy of being followed in matters of akida definitely not now mehush says that he says that it's permissible i doubt he says it's permissible i would suggest or presume that he said it is not shirk but it is prohibited because if he says that it is permissible then he would have gone to the dark side which is the super sufis who believe and worship truly the grave people but he thinks that it's a sinful thing but it's not shirk and why would someone say that nowadays we are in an era where people compromise their religion so in order to gather as many people around us and to gather as many followers being a tolerant person advocating of tolerance being okay with all strands of the society they compromise their own religion so they try to walk a very thin line and they say we cannot label people as mushrik because there are so many of them well allah azza labeled them in the quran when he said the vast majority of them of the people the inhabitants of earth would not believe in allah except while committing shirk what is their belief in allah azzawajal it's the same belief of the pagans and the idol worshippers are you serious yeah the pagans and the idol worshipers used to believe used to believe that allah is a provider the allah is the giver of life and death that allah is the creator that allah is the facilitator of their affairs it's all over the quran if you read the quran don't look to scholar so and so different with scholars so and so go to the sources the quran says to us in black and white that pagans and idol worshipers believed in allah azza this is their belief but they associated others with him through invoking them and nowhere in the quran if you read it from cover to cover that you will find a distinction or segregation between when you make dua to someone who's dead thinking that he's capable or not capable of your intention dura is dua allah says in many places that they invoke others than allah he did not call them gods in these ayahs allah says clearly that they invoke other than allah and they don't have any benefit for them or can protect them from any evil and on the day of judgment they will distance themselves from their shirk so invoking is considered to be shirk on the day of judgment and this is what the prophet said invoking making dua is worship not a form of worship no is worship this is the hadith of the prophet so if you go to the disbelievers to the idol worshipers at the time of the prophet hassam none of them would say to you that i am worshiping this idol because i believe that it creates it gives life and takes it i believe it facilitates my affairs i believe rain comes through it nobody says this they know that only allah does this and this is so for this so-called quote-unquote scholar to come and claim that when i go to tijani or jilani or sidnel-badawi or to al-hussein or to the prophet himself and i make dua to them that i don't believe in them to be gods this is exactly what the idol worshipers used to do allah says in the beginning of surat that we do not worship them except so that they would get us closer to allah azzawajal why are you calling al-hussein to help you because he can call allah so this is the identical shirk that the idol worshipers used to do and if you say no no no you are judging their intention excuse me why is this person invoking al-hussein or tijani or el gilani or the dead the grave why do why are they going to dargah and sacrificing to them and lighting lights and candles why are they making tawaf why are they asking them isn't this worshiping them or do they have to prostrate so that you can say oh this is worshipping this is why i say do not and i repeat do not take knowledge from such people these people who keep on changing their colors according to the highest bidder so if they're in america they say what the americans want to say uh to hear if they go to europe if go if they go to africa they will be the same thing whatever draws followers and likes and gives them fame so their intention is with allah but you as a muslim you should depend on the quran and you should ask trusted scholars of akida if you want to be saved on the day of judges and allah azza best"
