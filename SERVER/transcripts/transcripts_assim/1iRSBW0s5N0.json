  "title": "In Islam, killing someone without a legitimate reason is like killing all of Mankind!",
  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] there will be challenges and you will face a lot of obstacles some of them major obstacles [Music] for a second I was a bit afraid when I came in in I thought I was in Star Wars or something like this but alhamdulillah it's all peaceful here the in uh the brother who introduced me did not leave a lot of material for me to talk so Mah he gave the full lecture and I'll try to recap on what he had said introduction was very thorough was very good mashallah but but maybe we would like to go into some details killing murdering taking the life of a human being is something that normal people abhor hate are discussed by and this is human nature if you see someone slaughtering a sheep or even a chicken you are not at ease with that and to tell you the truth I've never done that I was not called to do it but I don't think I have the guts to do it seriously probably I would sit and cry with it nevertheless we would like to know the perspective of Islam over the issue of killing because we Muslims so we have to run through our fundamentals the Quran and the Sunnah we are fundamentalists in this sense and we're proud of it but what does our religion say about killing first of all the prophet who does not speak except the truth and the ultimate truth said in an authentic Hadith avoid the seven things that Doom a person to hell and these are known as or the major sins and he mentions sallallahu alaihi wasallam uh um sh and he mentions killing the soul without right so killing itself is prohibited and especially if it is without any any legitimacy and without any right but what is killing there is a difference between killing and dying death is something natural that everyone has to go through each soul will taste death so this is inevitable whether you die now die 10 years from now die 950 years from now eventually you're going to die and they Define this as the soul departing the body naturally without someone causing it to happen while killing is the cause of an effect it is the result of a doing of a person so if you look at killing if you look at murdering you'll find that it is the first sin on the face of earth when humans existed when Adam descended to Earth the first sin was when killed his brother Hab and this is what the Angels Subhan Allah an anticipated they knew this and when Allah told them that I am going to place a generation I'm going to place a species that would succeed one another they will succeed one another what did they say they said will you place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood Subhan Allah the Angels knew what the humans are capable of doing they anticipated it because Allah gave them knowledge now killing is not something that is easy it is one of the major sins it is so major it is so grave it is so serious that Allah Associated it with shik with disbelief with kuf Allah says when he describes to us the characteristics of the Servants of Allah who walk the earth in peace Allah says at the end and those who do not invoke with Allah another deity or kill the soul which Allah has forbidden to be killed except by right and do not commit an lawful sexual intercourse okay these are three major sins what is the result and whoever should do that will meet a penalty multiplied for him is the punishment on the day of resurrection and he will abide there in humilated this is the punishment but imagine that Allah Associates killing others with shik with the major the most major sin on Earth that Allah does not forgive also the prophet does the same thing the prophet said every sin on Earth Allah will forgive of course if Allah wishes except a man killing a Believer intentionally or a man dying in the state of kufur and disbelief this according to the prophet Alam is Unforgiven killing someone intentionally a Believer or dying in the state of kufur and Allah AEL has magnified the human soul and he magnified the burden and sin of taking a soul to the extent that Allah gave us an example as if man kills all of mankind imagine someone coming annihilating all those who live on earth with weapons of mass destruction with uh whatever it might be no one in his right mind would hesitate to condemn such an evil act Allah says because of that because of what because of the killing of Kil to his brother habil as mentioned in chapter 5 Surah Al Allah immediately says after that story because of that we decreed upon the children of Israel that whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption done in the land it is as if he had slain mankind entirely and whoever s whoever saves one it is as if he had saved mankind entirely the sin is overwhelming even if you contribute in killing a soul by a word you're a partner Omar says if may Allah be pleased with him if the people of a town collaborated on killing an individual I will execute them all not only that the prophet said before him Sall alai wasam that if the gin and the human collaborated on killing a man unlawfully Allah would torment them with Hell Fire all of them for killing One Soul yes because this is not something that you can mess around with killing is not always a sin for example in the books of of f killing is divided into three types killing intentionally killing semi intentionally and killing by mistake so if you kill someone if you kill a Muslim by mistake how would that be I'm driving and I have a car accident the car rolls over the passengers with me all die who killed them I did intentionally definitely not this was unintentional in this case what is the experation I must pay the blood Money known as Dia and for a Muslim male it is the equivalent of 100 camels nowadays equivalent to 300,000 rings I don't know if you have camels here or not this is too serious people are sleeping anyhow and you have to fast two consecutive months because initially you have to free a slave but nowadays there are no slaves around so the other alternative is to fast two consecutive months and this is for Allah to repent over you and one says I did not make a mistake I did not sin yes but whoever goes through such a process of killing someone unintentionally it's not your mistake you are not at ease you have just kill someone you get nightmares oh they died while they were were in in the car with me I was driving if I had only done this if I only had done that what about their wives what about their children what about their loved ones you go through sleepless nights because of this tribulation Allah is most merciful fast two consecutive months and Allah would repent for you you feel after fasting these two consecutive months you don't split or you don't leave one day afterwards you feel that Allah has repented and the burden is gone what about unintentional killing how can you kill someone unintentionally this is not a mistake I'm fighting with someone who's insulting me I'm angry I slap him in the face he dies W I did not want to kill him if you swear from here until the day of judgment it's not going to help you killed him though this is known as semi intentional if you throw someone with a chalk or with a piece of bread in a state of anger this doesn't kill but he dies if you throw something that like a rope or a whip or you hit him with a small miswak and he dies it so happens don't laugh this is reality it can happen so do not use miswak in fights if he dies then this is called semi intentional so what to do the P penalty is equivalent you have to pay the DIA but the DIA is paid by your kinship not by you your family your relatives help in paying it and you have to free a slave if not then fast two consecutive months now when it comes to the third category which is intentional killing this is no game rage is there you kill someone what is the penalty there is a set of choices for Those whom the slain person was related to someone kills my brother someone kills my son someone kills my father it is up to me and to his kinship to demand for justice a life for a life so the First Choice he has to be executed who executes him no never ever think that there is a punishment in Islam that is taken care by individuals it has to be taken care by the ruler the Muslim ruler he killed my father I have to kill him okay kill him and we will kill you this is the law of Islam No no one is allowed to take law into his own hands otherwise we'll be living in a jungle and the only one who would Prevail is Tarzan no this is not a jungle this is Islamic Society this is civilized world this is life we have authorities we have people to look into it investigate condemn give a verdict and we have the ruler to approve yes or no this is the way is done in Islam so the family says we don't want him to die then you go to option two give us the Blood Money the blood Money In this case is equivalent 100 camels but your relatives have nothing to do with it you have to pay P it on your own why should they suffer for your own mistake so you have to pay it pay it and you have to pay it immediately in the semi intentional killing it's not being paid immediately it's paid over a duration of 3 years in installments because this was a mistake semi intentional what not what was not intended now the prophet saidat wasam that it is not permissible to shed the blood of a Muslim who Bears witness that there is no God but Allah and that I am the Messenger of Allah except meaning that though there is unlawful killing but in Islam there is lawful killing there are punishments of execution in Islam again to be carried only by the Muslim ruler the prophet saysat am a life for a life so when you go to the West the most most of the countries condemn and ban execution and this is very funny I was once in uh uh in a gym working out and there was an American I wouldn't say brother an American individual and we used to chitchat about Islam and trying to give him dawa while spotting him and thinking should I drop it or not no so um he was once talking to me and condemning execution and I said this is for the sake of humanity we have to have execution no this is unacceptable taking the life of a a person no matter what his sin is so I told him if someone were to rape your wife or your sister and was acquitted by the court for lack of evidence though you saw it and then you saw the man coming out of the Court laughing his head off pointing at you and mocking while you had a shotgun in your hand what would you do he said I'm going to blow the mother so and so head [Applause] off this is this was or were his exact words so I told him alhamdulillah Islam saves you the bullets we do this for you just take him to court and Islam does this and it made sense to him then people don't think logically until they are affected by it but when it's out no killing is Haram killing is not right no it is not right unless it is put in perspective so the prophet say a soul for a soul okay we know that secondly he said a person who commits IL illegitimate or illegal sexual act if he were married before or still married now so a person who commits adultery whether he is currently married divorce Widow he has committed one of the major sins that if a if proved and proving it can happen only by the witness or the testimony of four Witnesses seeing the actual thing describing it graphically and the interrogators are saying huh what did he do then or by by confession he comes up front and says I did it otherwise you cannot prove it this penalty is execution to be stoned to death and people in the west say stoning is not nice it's not good this is a punishment from Allah and by the way there are more than seven different sins mentioned in the Bible that the punishment is stoning for them in the Bible I I can quote it for you if you wish but this is not the appropriate convention maybe another convention if you insult your parents you'll be stoned to death if you insult your king you'll be stoned to death if you fornicate with the daughter of a priest Subhan Allah why the daughter of a priest this is this is their book not mine you will be stoned to death even an ox you know a bull if a bull uh attacks a human being it would be stoned to death sorcery stoned to death shik in their books stoned to death and then they come and accuse our religion ah a religion of violence they Stone people to death when was the last time you saw an execution by stoning it is the most difficult crime to prove you need four Witnesses and seriously they have to graphically describe the action not I saw two and they were not wearing clothes no no not enough I saw them really close to each other not enough what do you want me to say you have to say it rated R is not enough it has to be X then I can accept the testimony of the four otherwise they will be flogged for such a slander for not for failing to describe it as it is so this is from Islam to protect the Privacy it is to protect your reputation from being a toy played by others so a soul for a soul a person who was previously married committing uh adultery and a person who abandons his religion and forsakes the unity the JAMA this is the punishment of apostasy we have to have freedom in religion yes don't become a Muslim up to you but once you become a Muslim I will kill you if you leave Islam she this is Harsh this is no no no this is not harsh this is major treason you're betraying not a country you're betraying the whole faith of Islam remain an UNM Muslim As You Wish as a Muslim I'm not going to come to you it's your freedom to worship whomever you wish but once you come to Islam then it is not a game you cannot go back this is Islam you have to abide by it a person who commits an act of apostasy can we kill him W no she he insulted the prophet he insulted Allah he insulted the Quran I want to kill him you have no right in killing him okay but what should I do there has to be a committee of Judges sitting with the person verifying that he knows what he's saying that he's not insane that he does not have any misconceptions we talk to him we bring him the evidences we try to talk him over to uh uh let go he insists no I don't want Islam we will kill you and then fry you he said no I do not want Islam this is unfair this is so and so so we give him few days in prison maybe he comes to back to his senses he insists we take the verdict to the ruler Muslim ruler the person has committed an act of apostasy we tried our level best he's is not coming back the ruler then looks in the pros and cons 99.9% he will have him executed and this punishment can only be set by the Muslim ruler no individual can do it no Soldier no policeman it has to be from the Imam and this is how the Muslim Society lives and thrives in peace and Harmony but if anyone comes and I see this brother he's talking to me and he's saying bad things to me in in Twitter so I meet him the following day he said how are you she she why did you kill him he insulted the prophet then everybody would kill each one because he insulted Allah maybe he insulted the Quran he insulted Salam he was making fun of aan he made a joke about Shan oh well no no Shan is is other team Subhan Allah people would start killing one another and this would not ever be a a peaceful place to live in or an Islamic way of living killing is not an easy thing killing a Muslim is not an easy thing at all imagine that the prophet was making ta ta by what a grave you cannot make ta except on or around the Kaa anyone making ta around the graves or around uh uh a statue or around anything this is an act of but people don't know shik I think brother Muhammad Salah spoke about it so I will not recap on his uh lecture what did the prophet say sayam he was making ta around the Kaa he said addressing the Kaa of course the Kaa does not listen the Kaa Isa but he is saying this so that those around him and the narrator of the Hadith is abdah may Allah be pleased with him and with his father could listen and relay the message he said how sweet you are and how sweet your fragrance is and and when you love something you love it for all what it is regardless and that is why the prophet said Alam that the smell of the mouth of a person fasting is more beautiful at the side of Allah than musk though we do not like it but it is loved by Allah because it's a sign of so the prophet is addressing Thea how sweet you are and how sweet your fragrance is and how great you are and how great your sanctity is but by Allah whom my soul is in his hand the sanctity of a Believer is more important and greater at the side of Allah from you one believer his blood the prophet says and his wealth are more important at the side of Allah from the Kaa now how serious is this issue that is why a lot of the scholars of Islam adopted the opinion that a person who kills another person does not have the right of repentance that Allah would never forgive him for his sin and among them is Abdullah abas may Allah be pleased with him imagine the one of the greatest Scholars of the companions the cousin of the prophet he believes that there is no repentance for a murderer and this was when he was asked may Allah be pleased with him about a man killing another Muslim intentionally but then he repents he believes and he does good deeds and he is guided so what do you think Abbas Abbas said to him woe be to him how is he guided after he had killed a person who is Muslim I heard the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam says that on the day of judgment the murderer and the victim will come and the victim the one who was killed is hanging to the head of the Killer and he would come to Allah and says oh Lord ask him why did he kill me for what was I killed IB Abbas says by Allah this was revealed to our prophet and it was not abated so I Abbas believes that aill a murderer has no room for repenting the sin is so grave likewise abdah and we know we all know IB Omar may Allah be pleased with him and with his father he said and the Hadith is inkari the biggest problem or one of the biggest problems that has no solution to it so now he's talking about something that accepts no repentance there there is no solution you put yourself in a problem without a way out he says the biggest or one of the biggest problems that has no solution to whomever Falls in it is when you shed the unlawful Haram blood so even Omar may Allah pleas with by the way and this is a footnote and it's not included in the program IB Omar and IB Abbas may Allah be pleased with them were the two companions leading two different schools Omar was on the strict bit always being careful IB Abbas was on the lenient bit always choosing the easiest and both of them were great Scholars and Companions of the Prophet Alam however in this issue of killing someone a Believer unlawfully they all agreed that this is something that has no answer to however alhamdulillah the most authentic opinion of all Scholars and other companions that Allah forgives all sins if a person repents before dying and this is the grace of Allah and this is the mercy of Allah otherwise we would have been in a difficult position now what is the first thing a person will be held accountable over on the day of judgment they asleep aat okay alhamdulillah there's someone awake may Allah increase them however Salat is between you and Allah the first thing that Allah would judge upon the humans is in blood so if you shed someone's blood if you kill someone if you hit someone this is the first of sins to be uh judged by Allah between others and killing is not a funny thing therefore the prophet even prohibited the acts that may lead you to killing such as joking so you find people playing with the gun say boom boom don't point the gun at me yeah it's not loaded look look W this happened to me believe it or not but I don't want to waste time because I see that the the clock is running and I have a lot of material this happens it happened in Arabia people thinking that the gun has no bullets they're cleaning it and they're pointing it at another Muslim and it misfires and he dies it happened with a son and his father he killed him mistakenly the father killed the child he thought there was not a bullet there's always a bullet in the chamber by the way if you take the magazine now don't think I'm a terrorist I know [Applause] guns I know a little bit about guns I have guns but they're all licensed I'm legal so you can come in inshallah if you take the mag if you take the magazine out don't think that it's okay there's a bullet in the chamber so if you press the the or squeze uh what is it the trigger it fires and so many the prophet saysat whoever points with a piece of metal whether it's a knife a sword a spear a gun a rifle whoever points to his brother even if he was his sibling from his father and mother jokingly even if you're joking the Angels would curse him him until he puts it down I'm not going to even do anything well the angels will as is are cursing you as long as you are pointing it at your Muslim brother jokingly so how about if it was seriously and how about if it was to another uh a person who's not your brother who's a stranger the the sin and the burden would be even more and more now a lot of the Muslims here who have Tendencies of violence and of bombing others would say I hate this lecture but I can't get out now if I get out they know that I am one of them so they are calming themselves say yeah yeah this is about Muslims Muslims we don't kill Muslims we kill non-muslims kill the infidels well I'm sorry to bring you bad news even that is not permissible Subhan Allah in our religion in Islam he's a disbeliever I'd like to kill him and step on his stomach and jump and jump and jump until he throws up you can't do that why because the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam says whoever killed a will not smell the fragrance of paradise although its fragrance may be detected from a distance of 40 years travel mu this is a new word what is Mu those who are writing who have a pen and a paper write down okay translation you can see it here okay I'll I'll I'll read it for you for those who cannot see thei is a person who lives in the Muslim land and is paying taxation jiz so Christian uh uh Jew any other denomination living with the approval of the ruler and he's giving his financial contribution you cannot kill him and if you kill him this is something that the prophet is warning you of you will not find the fragrance of Jenna meaning that you will not get close to it the distance of a travel of 40 years now mu is a person who's given a covenant so they he is not living in Muslim land he is from a cafir land and he might be even from a land that has war between us and Muslims yet the governor the rer ruler gives him an exemption for a week for a month for a year to come so he has what we know now called a Visa so he comes with a Visa who gave him the Visa the Muslim ruler okay what can I do so this man you cannot attack him mu he has a covenant he has a pledge with us though he's a cafir he's from a Waring country and Al is a person who might be an enemy of Islam he might be anything but one of the Muslims not the ruler not the governor not the general in the Army any Tom Dick or Harry providing is a Muslim of course he doesn't have to change the name but this is relevant so any Tom Dick or Harry can come and say oh Muslims this individual I give him a safe haven to pass and none of you can attack him and this is in Islam none of the Muslims around here can attack this man because he was given the pledge of safety by a free man or a slave or a woman or a man it doesn't matter they all can give this pledge of safety to him now we have 21 minutes 35 seconds 34 seconds 33 seconds okay let me go back to the issue now in the times of tribulation we live in times of FNA turn on the TV all what you see bombings killings murdering slaying slaughtering Subhan Allah even if you go to History Channel World War I World War II nagazaki Hiroshima blood bodies all around what is this what's happening well the prophet gave us a warning when he said that the day of judgment would not come until a number of things take place until knowledge is uplifted real knowledge you will not find people speaking with knowledge knowledge from the Quran Knowledge from the Sunnah Knowledge from the salaf you will find people coming and giving you a talk and after one hour wah the talk was good what was it about I don't know but we laughed a lot this is not knowledge knowledge is something that you go out of the gate learning how to fear Allah how to avoid something and you gain knowledge from the Quran an and from the Sunnah so one of the signs of the day of judgment that there will be time when knowledge is uplifted and there will be a lot of earthquakes and the time will come so close that today is mallah the first of Ramadan we've cited this the Crescent mashallah you blink and it's what is this Subhan Allah 30 days go like nothing then you find few years going like nothing and then you are on your dying bed come on I was fooled man what is this 65 years passed without me anticipating it you don't feel it time runs like crazy and the prophet sayam F would appear tribulations calamities tests all over and there will be haraj and they said what is haraj he said the spreading of killings there will be a lot of fatalities a lot of people killing one another and the prophet when he is telling this he is telling us about something that will happen now is it happening yes but not to a very large scale to the extent that oh you know our neighbor Abdullah yes well he died why because Muhammad killed him we don't have this alhamdulillah we have killings but in limited areas but if we don't stop it it will spread and it becomes like cancer now we see a lot of people dying and some of them die or are being killed falsely under the tag of Islam they claim that religion tells them to do this killing and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam warned us from such people what's their name H now a lot of those brothers who want to leave but are unable to do so watch out it's all being recorded cameras are everywhere use your diapers even if you have to go to the bathroom I don't not advise you a lot of the brothers are saying yeah yeah this is what you all do anyone who fights for the sake of Islam you call him go through the Sunnah don't look at me I'm not an Hil person I'm just a poor Saudi they brought me from Saudi Arabia told me speak about this and that don't listen to me go to the books of the Sunnah and look at the 73 sects that the prophet told usam that the um will be divided to all of them are in Hell except one and look at at one of these 72 sects that that the prophet described you will not find a description more clear more prominent than the description of one Hadith five hadiths 10 hadiths more than that Subhan Allah why is that because their Danger is camouflaged their threat to the umah is deceiving now the prophet Alam gave us similar description of the Dalal he told us the Dalal looks like this he will come this and does this and he will stay 40 days and he will have this with him in rivers of milk and rivers of bread and he why is the prophet so uh going out of his way describing to us one FNA because deception is the name of Dalal you think when you see him that he's on the right track if you go back to the Sunnah oh this is what the prophet warned us of likewise with Al those who live on depriving others from living those who live on killing on Bloodshed on barbarism they're barbaric they pretend to be loving Islam and in reality a lot of them smoke drug addicts watch pornography what is this let us not I'm not addressing you brothers and sisters those who are not able to go I'm talking generally speaking huh so the prophet when he tells usat that they are the the hounds of hell that they are the worst people under the heavens and he says that whoever meets them he doesn't say communicate with them he doesn't say try to logic he says kill them because if I were alive I would have killed them the killing of and and he says they are the worst people under the heavens whomever they kill is among the martyrs and among the best of people and whomever kills them is the best of Muslims a lot of hadiths they attack the Muslims and they leave the disbelievers and this is what we're finding they attack discriminately killing men women children and this is totally prohibited in Islam and they come from ignorance and live in ignorance and they are going into to ignorance how is that they have misinterpretations they are deluded they living in confusion and they convince themselves of so many things that are baseless but because 1 + 1 equals 2 this means that's this I have to do Subhan Allah wait let's go for the beginning and communicate they don't want to communicate I'll kill you then I will communicate with you like rodu Rodriguez the professional Mexican assassin he says friend my friend I kill people for money but because you're my friend I'll kill you for nothing for this discount this is the same mentality these people have I'm taking you to Jenna that's why I'm killing you I'd rather stay here let Jenna in the hands of Allah not in your hands now killing Muslim is a major offense and listen to this Hadith Al one of the great Brave Warriors of Islam asks the prophet Alat a question so that he could have a clear job description when he meets the enemy you know you have to have a clear job description to Define Your Role he says oh prophet of Allah imagine I'm at the battlefield and I am fighting this cafir this disbeliever this enemy of Islam and while we're fighting this duel he chops my arm off now you have only one arm he chops it off then he runs away and hides behind the tree so I can chop with him with one arm with my sword and when I come to attack him he says I believe that there is no God but allaham so the prophet wasam said to him do not kill him the man is saying oh prophet of Allah he just chopped my arm off yeah this wasn't like last week I'm talking about a minute ago he cut my whole arm off and we are in the battlefield we're not in the Masjid well he would say and everybody would Embrace him and kiss him we're in the battlefield now Al mikdad is is asking a question that each and every one of us should ask should I give him the benefit of the doubt or should I act upon what I see or should I look into his heart whether he is telling the truth or not so the prophet saidat do not kill him M said prophet of Allah he chopped my hand and after that he said what he had said can I kill him him the prophet said again and again do not kill him because if you kill him you are in his position before he chopped your hand before he chopped his hand he was what he was a cafir so if you kill him you are in his position and he is in your position after saying the word or after uh uh that is let me rephrase that you are in his position before he had said the shahada meaning that if you kill someone after saying ill it's not your business if he means it or not if he's sincere or not this is not to you this is to Allah the same thing happened with us but it wasn't hypothetical it was a fact he came from an expedition and the prophet Alat wasam tell him tell me tell me what had happened he said oh we fought this we fought that and there was this man he killed so many Muslims so I took my sword and ran after him and we had a duel but then he felt that he was going to die so the minute I was there and I was about to stab him he said and the prophet said huh what did you do afterwards he said I stabbed him and I killed him and the prophet was angered was out raged he said you killed him after he said ill he said the prophet of Allah he killed he he said it only to protect himself the prophet said you killed him after he said how did you know did you open his heart to see if he was sincere or not where will you go from on the day of judgment where will you go from ill on the day of judgment and he kept on repeating it ama says by Allah I hope hoped and I wished that I did not Embrace Islam till that day meaning that after I did this sin I wish I embrace Islam today so that Allah would erase it for me and this is a serious thing now there are many many many types of killing and the people are playing with the time now I'm lost I think we have few minutes to go everybody saying dillah I don't have to use my diapers I can go in peace anyhow among the types of killing that is Haram and people usually don't associate it with this is committing suicide so many people call me she I am depressed I want to kill kill myself I want to end my life why because I failed in chemistry 101 be a man what is this killing yourself does not relieve you from your worries it's the least of your worries because the minute you kill yourself okay the people who want money from you will not run after you because you're dead the sins you've committed will not pursue you because you're dead but you will go straight to hell and this was the least of your worries that you have problems in this life Allah says in the Quran oh you who believe do not consume one another's wealth unjustly and this is the advertisement for tomorrow's lecture inshallah my lecture I don't know care about others my lecture is about the unlawful consumption of wealth so this Ayah is an advertisement inshallah oh you who believe do not consume one another's wealth unjustly but only in lawful business by Mutual consent and do not kill yourselves or one another indeed Allah is to you ever merciful and whosoever does that in aggression and Injustice that is killing yourself or the consumption of Haram money then we will drive him into a fire and that for Allah is always easy the prophet says whoever kills himself in this life will be tormented on the day of judgment with it what does that mean this Hadith which was agreed upon which was reported by bukari and Muslim explains it Abu Hur may Allah be pleased with him said the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said whoever throws himself from a high place from a mountain and dies he is in the Hell Fire falling from a high place for eternity forever so you jump from the Twin Towers it's a long way God it's long let me make a phone call Mom I'm sorry but I think I've tripped and I'm falling down anyhow don't send me the emails boom he's dead now his punishment m is to be thrown from a high place in hell and this as the prophet said for eternity forever not only that whoever drinks poison he will drink this poison in Hell Fire for eternity forever this is his punishment he will feel the pain in Hellfire for eternity whoever stabs himself shoots himself whatever he will be punished by that in Hell forever for eternity and all of this is a warning from the prophet so so that you won't ask me this question in the Forum today what's the ruling on suicide bombing it's suicide she but they killed the enemy let not joke who killed him it's he pressed the button yeah who killed this suicide bomber he killed himself he's in hell she he's got a long beard Fidel Castro has a long beard it doesn't matter the length of your beard doesn't mean the length of your Iman it is an act of obligation by the prophet Alam it's a Sunnah but Allah did not told tell us to prolong it he told us to leave it so it it is not an indication he's doing this for the sake of Allah we saw a video of him saying thatd and a long sermon that he's doing it for the sake of Allah for Jihad who killed him answer me he killed himself he's in hell and the most pathetic are those doing the Charles ebdo I don't know if he's originally Charles Abdul Hamid and they are you know the French used I don't know maybe now Charles ABDO what they had done is Unforgiven depicting our Prophet Alat wasam writing cartoons about him who are you this is Unforgiven at all and you cannot give them your condolence or say I'm sorry no I'm not sorry for what happened because you are the criminals however so now they're dimming the light time to sleep what is this it's okay it's okay it's okay totally permissible I will kill you afterwards inshallah no serious I was joking joking is not permissible she I agree can you edit this please edit it yes take it off anyhow so we condemn their kufur we don't give them our condolences we don't put their flags as a sign of uh uh solidarity solidarity am I a cafir he did an act of kufur to my Prophet but we measure things with Quran and Sunnah you cannot transgress you cannot bark back at a dog that barks at you they're dogs we not so don't get me wrong those who did the attacks are wrong but they initiated they draw First Blood secondly this Belgium attacks in the Subways and in the airport this is uncalled for this no muslim on Earth would say mashallah we like it we like what they've killed doctors Engineers schoolg goers innocent people yeah yeah so that they can feel the pain pain of what a what what are you ass sadists what pain are you talking about said they are the enemies of Islam Habibi this is my my friend in in Arabic my friend 50 kilomet from Syria and Iraq is Iran and another 100 kilometers is Israel you go 4,000 kilos to attack the enemies of Islam who never even shot a bullet at you these people do not relate to Islam they kill themselves El they're not related to Islam they do not represent Muslims at all yeah look at Indonesia next door neighbor 250 million maybe counting Allah look at all the Muslims 1.7 m billion Muslims W if we spit if we spit on Europe and America they will drown are you crazy and they they accuse us of killing people and Islam is a religion of Peace but don't get me wrong peace doesn't means mean weakness Islam is a religion of PRI of Pride without arrogance a a religion of strength without violence a religion of humanity and peace without weakness so it is not what people try to portray and know Islam is a religion of peace and then if I slap you on your face give me the other cheek we're out of cheeks Halas I gave you all the cheeks I have and you SLA them all so what are you talking about so killing yourself suicide bombing or whatever it is this is killing yourself and you are in hell in Islam 5 minutes 52 seconds in Islam it is prohibited to kill even if the justification in your mind is halal such as honor killing this is not widely spread in some Arab countries they have it if a woman commits adultery or fornication her brother her son her father her cousin would go and kill her and he considers this to be honor killing in in 90% of the cases she was wrong done to she was a victim she didn't do anything wrong but someone came to oh your sister went out with this and that so your blood boils and you go and kill even if she committed adultery even if she committed Haram killing her makes you a murderer and everything we said is applied to you and you have to be killed for it so there's no justification types of killing what they call euthanasia merciful killing doctors know this a person who is in pain in agony cannot be cured they come and give him medication to kill him they say this is euthanasia we're euthanizing him we are killing him mercifully he's not a cat you cannot do this yeah he's in pain he's in pain Allah is raising his status in jenah until he reaches the top he is suffering no problem Allah is erasing ing all of his sins you're not God he wants to be killed then this is suicide and a murder he's killing himself and you're the murderer both will have the same punishment also abortion this is killing as well and so many people call she um my wife wants to to abort a child how old is a child is 9 months a week maybe less why do you do want to do this she says that she had the doesn't have any dresses to fit her now is this legitimate reason she if if killing is I will kill you but it's not how dare you kill an innocent person a child out of fear of poverty out of fear of not being able to pursue your education are you a Muslim so to conclude 3 minutes and 21 seconds well I'm doing good huh mallah mallah in conclusion Allah says oh my servants I have made transgression I have made zul prohibited upon me and I prohibit I prohibit you to fall into it is Haram and one of the highest grades oful is taking the soul of an innocent individual without any justification or legit legitimate reason the Prophet saidat by Allah you will do your obligations and you will commit to the rights over you because on the day of judgment Allah will hold accountable the ram that has horns and the ram that does not have horns why did the Ram with the horns uh what what what is the verb used I don't know anyone knowing verbs of rams and Bulls anyhow the ram attacking the other one without horns Allah would hold him accountable do you think Allah would let you go free if Allah is holding the ram accountable for that so stay away from trans transgression stay away from stay away from Rage the prophet was approached by one of his companions advis me he said do not become angry he said give me more do not become angry and he kept on repeating it rage takes you to Hell be aware of food that Allah has made prohibited upon us why did Allah Asel prohibit the meat of lions of tigers of eagles of uh uh birds that have claws and that have uh uh teeth it's prohibited for us why Scholars say because eating them consuming them makes you like them wanting to be a predator wanting you to become aggressive and killing people avoid these games computer games and and and online games that promote violence a lot of our children live and thrive on them nowadays with this new social media I send smss and I send WhatsApp to my children next room the food is being served and he said okay I'm coming with a smiley face this is a problem we're addicted to it this is not the time but this is one of the reasons that is causing us to do this and may Allah protect the Muslim umah and us as individuals from that such violence and killing may Allah Asel protect Malaysia and protect the whole of the Muslim umah from violence from deviancy from corrupt ideology from attempting to harm one another and may Allah Asel make us one umah with one Dean with one Quran with one with one messenger Sall alaih wasallam and it's flashing saying that it is 0000 all"
