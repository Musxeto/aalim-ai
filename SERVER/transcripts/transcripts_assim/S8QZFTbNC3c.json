  "transcript": "he said sometimes we get people poor people coming and asking for financial assistance uh to marry their daughters so what's the ruling on that and i asked him what do they want what they want with that financial assistance they said they would like to buy gifts to the groom i know that he's referring to wrong practices in the subcontinent when simi men when they propose to women these simi men expect the family of the woman to give them gifts and they are not real men let alone real muslims a real muslim undertakes the full financial responsibility from a to zed regarding his marriage he gets the house he furnishes the house he has his own car he pays for the wedding and he pays the dowry these simi men who are not real men and their families are not real practicing muslims they're muslims by tradition they insist on the girls family to give the man gifts so the man sends a bucket list yes i'd like a toyota corolla 2021 preferably with a camera and rear view and a navigation uh screen and i'd like or the air conditioners to be split units i'd like what are you doing a real man doesn't do this let alone a real muslim you're not a real man you're a wimp because if you were a real man you would refuse any penny to come your way but you have no shame you have no honor because you don't know islam you are related to the hindus you're taking their customs and traditions if you were a man if you are a muslim you would never allow this to happen even if they insist and if they insist you insist on registering whatever they give in your wife's name not in your name so that you would feel honor and proud of being a man so unfortunately a lot of the girls won't be able to get married to such simi men without paying them in this case the scholars say that it is permissible to assist them unfortunately because this is the least of the two evils and that is instead of them staying without marriage we pay these semi-men for their dowry and they get married"
