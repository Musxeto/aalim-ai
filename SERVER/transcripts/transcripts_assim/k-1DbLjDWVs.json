al-amin nabina muhammad in water early he was happy he admin my bad dear brothers and sisters in islam assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh we're still introducing the story to the battle of a honda the battle of the trench or known as hospital as ab and we spoke last time about the three tribes that were inhabiting medina from the Jews and they were be no pain no car and we mentioned their story and how the Prophet Alison some expelled them from Medina after what they had done and by breaking the treaty and not fulfilling the Covenant the second tribe is the travel ban wanna be here and this tribe not more than a year after the expulsion of Banu palapa their Brethren's in the same city did the same thing but even worse what they did was they tried to assassinate the prophet alayhi salatu salam and allah azzawajal informed his messenger to fulfill the prophecy where allah says in the quran allah we are similar in an ass it is allah alone who prevents you who protects you from others so the prophet alayhi salatu salam was informed by allah that they are attempting to assassinate you so he went back to medina because he came to them and there are two stories one says that he came to them to ask them for blood money to assist him in paying off Blood Money of two men who were killed by mistake by a hammer in Omaha bloomery may allah be pleased with him the other story said that they tried to trick him and call him to come and meet them and give them Dawa and explain his lamp to them so that they can assassinate him so the prophet went back to medina and allah azzawajal saved him from their plot and he sent to them how many been muslimah me a lot pleased with him telling them that they have an ultimatum of 10 days after these 10 days the Prophet Isis I'm would kill any one of them remaining in Medina they are to be extradited they are expelled from Medina for breaking their covenant and for plotting to assassinate the prophet alayhi salatu salam and this is very kind of him salala listening because as the messenger of allah the true prophet of allah undisputed but maybe to them he is not yet he is the leader and ruler of medina so it would have been his god-given right to kill them for their plotting and for their crimes but not the prophet alayhi salatu salam he went out of his way to co-exist salalah salaam within the boundaries of Quran and Sunnah he signed covenants with them he used to preach them and go to their gatherings himself he used to accept their invitations even when they invite him as we will learn ashalla on high bar when the woman invited him to a sheep which she filled with poison without him knowing of course and he accepted her invitation though she was a Jew so he also employed one of their boys to serve him he borrowed from them as mother Aisha tells us that he died while his shield was given as a pond so that the prophetess m would get some saw of barley so he tried to do everything in his powers to co-exist and this illustrates to us how the Prophet is awesome used to co-exist with Kaffirs with Jews whom are described in the Quran as the worst of enemies to Muslims Allah tells us in chapter 5 that you will find that the most fears in their enmity towards the Muslims are the Jews and idol worshippers and this might explain why the Buddhists are doing what they're doing to our brothers in mini mar and eric on and from there oh hinges so this did not prevent the prophetess m from going out of his way trying to coexist which gives us this golden lesson how to live with those who are not Muslims how to live and coexist with those who differ with us in issues of our peda it is not an issue of killing those who oppose you it is not an issue of attacking those who do not think in the same bandwidth that you think it is an issue of following and complying to the sunnah of the prophet salallahu alayhi rod he will seldom so the Prophet gave them 10 days and the Jews felt helpless so they started packing and just before the 10 days were over they get a message from their Ally the head of the hypocrites of the La Nouba even saloon may Allah curse him and it also illustrates to us the role of hypocrites in undermining the Islamic principles the Islamic Ummah he sent to them do not leave your fortresses and village do not leave your houses i will send two thousand of my men to go in with you in your fortresses and fight off muhammad sallallahu alehiwassallaam now all the odds were against the Muslims because allah azzawajal described their fortresses to be very strong and the the possibility of penetrating them is next to impossible and they were well equipped and they were excellent fighters so the Prophet himself erased a lot of Salaam had no other choice but to fight them though he knew that in accordance to wordly measurements this was an impossible task but to highlight that victory that victory comes only from Allah not from us victory is not from our own powers and ability the victory comes only from allah azzawajal and this is why when they felt that the hypocrites were on their side and that two thousand men will join them to fight off muhammad sallallahu alehiwassallaam they were defined oye even a cop who was the leader of banu another year and by the way he is the father of sofia who later on became the wife of the prophetess m and the mother of the believers he was defined and he sent a message to the Prophet Alistair some that we're not leaving and you may do whatever you wish so the prophet has said Allahu Akbar and went to surround them and went to besiege been another year and Alonzo gel explained this in a whole chapter in the Quran and this chapter is called surah cool huh sure and I'm the love that bass may Allah be pleased with a man with his father used to call the surah surah been in a beer because it's all about them Allah says he it is who drove out the disbelievers among the people of the scriptures there is the Jews of banana beer from their homes at the first gathering you did not think that they would get out and they thought that their fortresses would defend them from Allah but Allah but a las torment reach them from a place where of they expected it not so the Prophet I racism himself did not think that it was possible but he had to do it but not only that it is allah azzawajal who came to them from a place where off they expected it not and he the almighty cast terror into their hearts so that they destroyed their own dwellings with their own hands and the hands of the believers then take admission oh you wish oh you with eyes to see so Allah is telling us that neither the Muslims know the Jews thought that this was possible and they were defined because their fortresses were so strong but after six day days of being besieged only six days Allah through terror in their hearts and this is the norm with anyone who fights the Muslims it is Allah who throws the terror in their hearts when they fight the Muslim army as long as the Muslims themselves are practicing and abiding by the Quran and the Sunnah analyze Oh Jill says afterwards and had it not been that Allah had decreed exile for them he would certainly have punished them in this world and in the hereafter there's shall be the torment of the fire what does that mean after six days they were terrified so they sent a message to the Prophet ala so solemn especially after the head of the hypocrites of the la nube even saloon did not fulfill his promise as usual this is their characteristics as a hypocrite and he did not sing send a single soldier so Allah so jeal through fear and 0 in their hearts so they sent a message to the Prophet as I'm saying we give up we surrender but on one condition that you allow us to leave safely and to be expelled without any punishment so the prophet alayhi salatu salam had the upper hand he could have said no we will kill you we will execute all of you but not the prophet alayhi salatu salam not the one whom they portray to be bloodthirsty sallallahu alehiwassallaam they did not know him they do not know him and they do not know anything about his beautiful biography and the books of history are there for them to check if they want written by kafir written by disbelievers like them but they don't they're blinded by the light so the prophets have accepted that telling them that you may leave and take everything you can accept armor do not take any weapons on you so they started to demolish their own homes taking the doors taking the windows taking the wood pillars of the homes and the roofs and putting them on their camels in a big Caravan and they left the city to high bar and high bar is not within the city limits of Medina it is about 60 miles north of Medina so it is a different village all together and it's not part of Medina so they went there but the hatred to Islam grew in their hearts and they felt that they would not rest until they annihilate all Muslims and eradicate Islam from the face of the earth so they started and continued to plot for a whole year and they were eager to collaborate even with the devil himself though there are people of the scriptures and this is the funny thing the Jews and the Christians are closer to us Muslims than the idol worshippers because we worship one same God and that is Allah the creator of the heavens and the earth and they do so and they testify that this is the fact we worship the Lord who sent us know Abraham David Solomon Moses Jesus and all the messengers and prophets of allah peace and blessings of allah be upon them all however the jews hatred is unbearable to them to conceal in their hearts so either they vent it out or die and they're willing to die in the process so they started sending the tribes of Arabia and trying to provoke them try to encourage them to attack Medina the Allies of yesterday now they want them to attack Medina they started with wash where the Prophet eyes on was born and raised and all the Mujahideen came from and they started writing to them can't you see what happened to you on the third year of hijra on I heard how your people were killed you almost got even with the prophet or Islam but he still managed to defeat you and better he killed so many of you he captured so many of you this was humiliating all the tribes of Arabia are mocking you and are looking down at you then they went to the biggest tribe up East LA fan and they also did the same and they started reminding them of their losses and errata fan was unlike crush crush was driven by pride was driven by vengeance grata fan was driven by money and wealth so they promised got a fan to give them all the fruits of the farms of Medina and this was a lot of money a lot of cash so they managed to go and negotiate and they went way overboard as I said earlier they even agreed to collaborate with the devil himself Allah tells us and describes this to us in the Quran Allah says have you not seen those who were given a portion of the scriptures that is the Jews they believe in gypped and Tahoe and say to the disbelievers to the idol worshippers that they are better guided as regards the way than the belief than the Muslims they are those whom Allah has cursed and he whom Allah curses will not find for him an a helper so they had no problem when the idol worshippers ask them whose religion is better ours or Muhammad's the Jews know that muhammad sallallahu selim worships only one Lord the same Lord that they're worshipping but in order to get to what they're aiming for they had no problem and saying that your religion is better and this is clear and blatant covered when you agree to such a statement which means that worshipping idols is better than worshiping Allah alone the Almighty so the result of their plotting was an army of 10,000 from lotfan those reportin came and besieged medina now the Prophet re salatu salam was one of the greatest leaders of all time he was the greatest leader of all times he was a messenger he was a judge he was a father he was a husband here and he was a counselor and he was one of the complete and perfect men ever to walk the earth sallallahu I hora salen though he was a messenger but he was well versed in the matters of where warfare and in the matters of dunya he had intelligence and he had eyes and spies bringing him news with the grace of Allah he came to know that Papa fan and garage are collaborating misty Medina and all those in Medina where 3,000 men a great portion of them were hits with abdullah even obey even saloon so they did not come back trust it and wait so the prophet alayhi salatu salam did what he usually does he consulted his companions he doesn't salala solemn work except with taking advice from anyone who has advice so salman al Pharisee may allah be pleased with him gave his own advice to the prophet alayhi salatu salam and salman and Pharisee is a story of his own maybe if we have time insha Allah we will mention his beautiful story someday Salman who was originally a person and his father was one of the dignitaries of their religion fled his home searching for the right religion and moved from one priest to the other from one jutsu a Christian to etc and they're all telling him that this is the time where the final messenger of allah would be sent to humanity until he reached the Prophet Elisha so he said o prophet of Allah back in Persia we have a defensive plot we have a defensive strategy and that is that we dig a trench around the area where we are staying so that it would not be possible for the horses and for the caravans to penetrate except with difficulty and as they penetrate we execute them we kill them we attack them we do whatever we want to do the Prophet Alice our son loved this idea and thought that it was a wonderful idea the muhajireen the immigrants from Mecca said Salman is from us he's one of us because he migrated from Persia to Medina so he's one of us the ants are the residence of Medina said no Sandman is from us may Allah be pleased with him because the Prophet came while he was residing in Medina so the Prophet I salam ended this debate by saying salman lumina a lil bit salman is from us from a debate he belongs to me i'm from him and he is from me and this was more than a medal which a person is proud of this is the highest form of honoring a person may allah be pleased with him so everyone started digging this trench the Prophet himself are a solid asaram contributed in digging and he used to carry the dust and rocks on his shoulder and he showed unity with his companions he was not a leader to stay away in his mansion or in his ivory tower overlooked everything he used to go down the ground be one of them be like them sallallahu alayhi wasallam and not only that he used to chant with them poetry you know as you work in hard labor you need something to sing something to say that would inject enthusiasm in you it would make you more stronger and gives you power so the Prophet erased a lot o Saddam used to say o Allah if it weren't prayed or giving money and charity stand on us tranquility because those enemies of Allah have against us if call us to fitna then we would not respond to it and he would say we would not respond and we would la la a Salem and he also used to say as a form of or sink or chant that is of course there are no musical instruments cause music is haram in islam but he used to chant by saying Allah Allah Allah Allah fellow federal muhajireen our ants are so there is no life except the real life on the hereafter this life is temporary how long are you gonna stay 60 years 70 years then what then it's your ditch it's your six feet under it's your grave if you're a believer and you've done well Your Grave is going to be a garden of paradise until the day of judgment and then you will go for eternity into paradise if you were not a believer you're just living like any other creature eating drinking mating defecating urinating and the same thing happens on and on until you die then your ditch you're six feet under would be a whole of hell until the day of judgment and then you will go to hell for eternity you have the choice my friend so the Providence and was saying that there is no real life except the life in the hereafter this is temporary so oh Allah therefore Allah have mercy all over the Ansar and the mahadji and the immigrants those who came and migrated to medina the prophet alayhi salatu salam on that reservoir on that month because the besieged took a whole month while digging the trench before the Army's arrived there were three days of extremely a difficult time of hunger all the Muslims did not have food not only that about allah may allah be pleased with him said that we complain to the program and we said Oh prophet of Allah we're so hungry that we are tying a piece of rock to our stomachs so that we can walk straight and they revealed on their bellies their tithing they're tying and it's tight a piece of rock so that they would stand straight the Prophet said I'm self Alice awesome exposed his belly and they saw two pieces of rock tied to his belly which meant that he was even more hungry than they were but he did not complain I wrestle afsaneh he was with everybody else he could have saved some portion for himself he's the leader is the king not the prophet alayhi salatu salam if they suffer he suffers with them if they prosper and have wealth he still gives them all what he has it and then does not enjoy life as they do so lala haria audio salam jabber tells us a beautiful story and jabber may Allah be pleased with him married a woman who was married before him whether she was a widow or a divorcee and when he told the profit at is awesome he told him why didn't you marry a virgin like you where you both can play with one another so he told the prophet alayhi salatu salam that I have siblings my father was martyred and he left a number of girls my sisters and I did not want to bring another girl to them so I have a bunch of them I needed someone who was wise someone who was learned to come and take care of them so the prophet has prayed for him and ask Allah to bless his marriage this wise woman he married did something to the Prophet Ali salatu salam where allah the almighty blessed her household her food and jabbers food for what they had done with a miracle that remains with us until today what is this miracle this is inshallah what will be our topic

Hume from Nigeria hello yes I do for you ya Salam aliko said I'm rahmat allah i agree with you about the israel and USA and i believe this biggest enemy of the Islam world is the US and Israel and how to say that the biggest customer of the American racers is Saudi Arabia and sy buying reasons of as much as 1 billion dollars help them to overcome the economic crisis and it changed and American firmness to the post southie in their part in Yemen okay the usual ok homes ahead from Nigeria said 'what's the ruling on the husband if he masturbates and I ask a question whether the wife is masturbating him or he's doing this on his own she said no on his own this is a sin whether he's married or not married this is a transgression and it's not permissible and I mean from forgot anyhow I mean from somewhere says that the deeds that people do we'll all be shown to them on the day of judgment each and every single thing that was recorded however he has a confusion that if allah azzawajal accepts his servants repentance and he forgives him will he still show it to him on the day of judgment and answer is yes but there are two ways of showing such deeds to a servant of Allah as in the hadith of the Prophet erase salatu salam man notation hisab Ruth tip which means that whoever is interrogated whoever is held accountable for every nitty-gritty as they say every small thing then he will be punished so there are two types of displaying your sins one is just to go over them you did this and that and you did this and that not every single thing and then allah azzawajal would forgive them all or change them into good deeds this is one way of doing it and this is for all that allah azzawajal conceals the servant from all other servants and then he tells him o my servant you did this you did that you did this you did that and the servant knows for sure that he is in trouble and he acknowledges and he confesses then Allah says I've concealed them over you in this life in this on earth and I shall give them for you in this life go so he's forgiven the other one is the one whom Allah so jeal holds accountable this one is doomed because Allah will tell him on this day you did this and that correct you shouldn't have done this and the guy says yes but so so Allah so jeal talks to him about every single thing in detail not in general form so this one will be punished therefore am I my friend I mean there's no problem in sha Allah and Allah dajjal showing you what you had done this is part of Allah express it this is part of a larger displaying to you his favor and blessing by forgiving this because if you are forgiven without any accountability or not seeing your sins we would not feel the taste of it but once you know that you'd have to be thrown into of what you had done but Allah for this makes it even greater to you umbrella from Saudi so no matter cuz I sounds a la mano como se llama god bless you an increase in the little jicama community called the whole of the Muslim Ummah from Adam yes I shall have two issues number one I am immigrants and I live in operatic specifically dicta and there are times that you see police I mean around the marks area to find out and people that are coming to the most to plea and then they come under the police come to the box area to get the clans or illegal immigrants who are without purpose and then elect them and they put them okay I want you to clarify this is double team second second question number number there is a product in Ghana who actually disc Weston and then I want you to clarify and Muslim brother went to greet his friend in a change that is a decent day and saw you go there too with a friend in the church and then after the sacrifice finish the program that our brother Muslim who kneel down and in the different area because this our Muslim brother and is looking for a position in the country and then the pastor put his hand on his head and pray for him what is the ruling in our dream about this action okay I would answer in sha Allah I'm were from Baron Samedi ok Santa ma I wanted to ask you a very important question regarding my own career and yours to be honest I I said I you know everybody works in media is responsible for whatever he says and I'm afraid because I masala tea and I believe in my heart that she has a rough edges and I don't want to say what judgment I have upon them but I wanted to know if I say this and encourage some people and they go out and you know blow themselves up in order to kill some of them is it on my conscience is their hands on my blood because if that is you know I can live with myself I said some things before and I think because of that because the things I am people like me enya said about she has you know some people got encouraged to go and you know kill them and blow themselves up like you know the pump that went asking a grave okay and you know it was really hurting so I wanted to know if somebody go go then you know kill some is it you know i got you a question of his acala here I mean from ha forgot to wear from we answered him fatma from Saudi Arabia she says what's the ruling on wearing nail polish it is permissible providing that no nan muharram can see that because this would attract men Madam's secondly that when you pray to perform what do you have to remove it so if you don't have to pray then there is no problem in them what's the ruling on wearing a trousers and t-shirts under the abaya then this is ok nobody can see what you're wearing underneath and it's more protective to wear trousers under the rabbi so in case that you your leg gets exposed when you're getting into the car out of the car so there's no problem in sha Allah as long as none muharram and other women don't see it if it's really tight but if it's very very loose then it's like a skirt there's no problem in that but wearing it on the data is permissible sometimes our parents tell us not to do things and they believe that it is haram and we disagree so how can we manage first of all if you're living with your parents you must obey them even if they tell you something that you do not believe that it is a sin to do but out of courtesy as long as it is not sinful to do it then you have to comply for example if you think that the face is not mandatory to cover and your father says you have to earth an ePub then where the new pub because he's not ordering you to do something Harlem he's asking you to do something a little bit extra and he knows what's best for you if you get married and leave the house do whatever you want the sin is on your head and your husband's but now as you are in his home you have to comply if you believe that music is not harm to listen to and he tells you do not listen to music you must obey Him there is there are things that are permissible and nothing to do with halal and haram and they have a preference they have a conviction then this differs from one place to the other where they force you to eat vegetables every meal and you don't want to eat vegetables this is up to you they can't force you to do this but if you want to study in University and they said no you had enough or you should study something else otherwise you should stay home and do your studies online this is your father's right to choose for you and you must obey Him city from Saudi Arabia she says that I'm travelling back home and coming back in showall do I perform too awful with that the farewell talk the majority of scholars say powerful weather is only for those who had performed pilgrimage but those who are residents those who perform umrah often they are not required to perform Tawaf al wahda and she says that s you had I put my socks in the state of voodoo and for a whole day I did not notify my wood when I went to bed or I went to the bathroom and i urinated so now I want to perform moodle if you want to perform what do you go ahead and instead of washing your feet you wipe on your socks or on your shoes because you put them on in the state of purity so you have 24 hours to wipe and the first time you wiped you calculate 24 hours afterwards so as long as you had put on your socks while you were in the state of would'a and after that you nullified your Moodle you may perform another would do and wipe over these socks for 24 hours khadijah from the Emirates she has a sister and her sister has a problem that she is unable to listen to the pan and she gets paranoid when she hears the Quran she cannot perform Moodle definitely she has a possession of gin most likely and she has to be treated now there is a possibility that she is insane she has a mental illness that makes her behave in such a way but usually in such cases she is possessed with gin and you have to either recite Quran on her forcefully give her rakia make Rokia on Zamzam water and make her wash with that drink a lot of that whether she knows it or not and this inshallah should help her situation after I you from Nigeria he says that he agrees that the Jews and the Americans are the enemies of Islam blah blah blah but Saudis by a buys Saudi Saudi Arabia buys billions of goods and weaponry etc from them ah he asked yourself sincerely did the prophet alayhi salatu salam by from the Jews and say yes or no if you don't know then you should not have called in such an offensive way the prophet salallahu lamp borrowed from the jews are the Jews enemies of Allah the answer is yes you do the math did the Prophet borrow not by borrow from the Jews the answer is yes I ish a mother I HTML a be peace with her set and as I mentioned the beginning of this episode that he borrowed from a Jew asar of barley and he gave him his armor the Prophet as salaam and the Companions used to buy from the byzantines from the Romans from the Persians they were all enemies of Allah so there is nothing wrong in buying from the enemies of Allah now what you are saying is a little bit strange okay I understand the hatred Muslims have to the US and it's justifiable definitely without any questioning we can see their atrocities in Afghanistan in Iraq and in Palestine Israel would not have existed and still to exist without their aides and help this is you know you don't you don't have to be a rocket scientist to know this any layman would know this but you cannot go overboard see the problem with the Muslims nowadays they don't have first of all knowledge from the Quran and Sunnah they are impulsive they are emotional and they give verdicts without contemplating and thinking they're not putting the Quran and Sunnah to the practice they just say beautiful slogans and words that has that have no value you yourself most likely if we come to your home will find American product will find British products the medication you take is either American or Norwegian Danish or British or okay why have the double standards you have to first of all know the ruling Islamically then build on that you're whatever you want to build not just to simply go and bombard Saudi Arabia for doing this Saudi Arabia for doing that as if there is no country on the world in the world except Saudi Arabia you look at York what did you do what did you contribute to solving the Muslims crisis and problems worldwide the at least our area is trying to do maybe it's not perfect but they gave charity they give 8 they supported the sealian rebellion against the kafir bashar regime for three years even the BBC and CNN reported the weaponry sent to them in aid and and help to them but yet nobody wants to believe that no one's nobody wants to even acknowledge that because it's the hatred they have Abdullah from Saudi Arabia says that he has noticed that the police in Saudi Arabia and again Saudi Arabia come around the message to see illegal immigrants or those who do not have what we called as a comma legal residency permit and they capture them and extradite them and I sense that he feels sorry for them and he believes that this is the land of Islam so if we have 1.7 billion Muslims and they want all to come to Jeddah they are more than welcome I you jaani talking seriously brother Abdullah are you in your mind nowhere in the world you'll find the country doing this this is not even logical the city itself has its capability the maximum number it can take mackay itself we cannot have more than 3.5 million pilgrims at the same time and you want illegal residents to come and live freely and the police to welcome them and put the red carpet to them this is not logical and among those illegal immigrants or residents who don't have permits among them there are crooks there are terrorists there are criminals so this is not a this is not the way you run a country of heat this is worldwide it's happening everywhere so I think it's a little bit illogical and unfair to address the issue like this his friend from Hana went to a church and they asked him to kneel down and they put their hands on him and to pray etc if he accepted and agreed to do this ritual he has committed an act of apostasy because he has become one of them and by not objecting or there's no intimidation nobody is pointing a gun at his head he's doing this willingly and freely this is an act of apostasy we have Abdullah from Saudi Arabia my question and I think you did not get any better with and I'm action about downloading mark are the same thing ah hello the same thing it's the same thing if you get five million in Jeddah illegal I'm not acting five million I'm saying that um I am coming to the most Capri and then police want to arrest me at the mosque because i am not having the comma and i I'm just trying to find out why should the police comes to the most area so Alex an illegal patient because the most we know it is what okay okay I got you a question now the brother is complaining why do they come and check for their residency permits near the mosque meaning that the mosque should be a safe haven people could come come and go okay they're doing this everywhere they're doing it near mosques they're doing it in the vegetable market they're doing it in the fish market they're doing it on the street spot checks so there's nothing wrong in that and and you cannot just simply come and say because you're Muslims know anyone who comes to pray leave him let him pray even if it's an illegal immigrant even if he's a criminal let him pray then you catch him later on if he goes to the beaches no this is not a realistic a fee prayer is everywhere is not restricted to the message Muhammad from Saudi Arabia lalala jante law how are you here I am finds ekalaka for asking uh yes I have two questions yes one question is about the level for them okay hello yes what is that what about it your line is breaking out here I cannot hear you I don't know if it's from your side or from our side okay ahamed through na Genia dammit then have an idea okay I'm saying yes yes yes question of he say my question is after after completing the dissembler you are from the mute your TV you have done to try and then give yourself a little then later in the night you went to wake up and then do some prayers what is how what is the formula okay any more questions okay I wasn't even sure are from bahrain's she says that he's a man of the media and he has something bad on his conscience because the while ago he used to talk about the Shia and about the Rafah to people and he fears that he might have encouraged someone to do such heinous acts as blowing themselves up and killing shia or caning rafi law so would this be on his conscience answer is yes definitely regardless of what you think as long as you've encouraged someone to do this the Prophet said that is for some woman sending us one night and say yeah Holly he withdrew hawa german army libya la amo p.m. ET la cosa menos REM che whoever initiates a bad thing to follow then those who follow him he will be accredited with all of their sins till the day of judgment without deducting anything from their sins so by you telling the people that rafa da do this and that and not only that see we all say rafa da say a lot of cool things but not all of them not specifically a Tom Dick or Harry we say in general yes they falsified the Quran they say they say that this is covered in general but if you go the extra mile I'll and say and such people must be executed much be killed like the color yesterday saying that we must kill their women the children and their generation so that no this is not Islamic and if you do this and someone follows you you will have the burden so what to do as Abdullah as Omar says what is how to get my conscience of this you have to clarify this to the Muslims those whom you address before you have to publish other articles and say to them that what I said was wrong and it's totally forbidden the scholars say XYZ and they should stop this hussain ahmed from nigeria says that if i pray with it with the imam can i pray afterwards the answer is yes pray as many records as you wish afterwards but in tues so to give Salam to give Salam to give Salam endlessly without repeating witter because you've already prayed Witcher and there are no two witters in the same night at the prophet sallallahu wasallam prohibited that this is all the time we have until we meet you next time same place Olivia mala assalamualaikum warahmatullahi avocado I'm a ball blessings of Allah beyond happy p7 love and blessings of Allah be on my solo beyond happy bum Salam aliko divaricata brothers and sisters this evil money join me along with other house"
