  "transcript": "[Music] for coming so far it means a lot and I love your letters so my question is um is there anything from the Quran and that keeps you personally uh Clos to uh Allah and keeps your intentions pure the whole Quran and the Sunnah yeah there isn't anything that stands out you said oh this this Ayah blows my mind and this is what no no no the whole Quran and Sunnah and you guys know that we as Muslims at least we finish the Quran once a month this is the bare minimum for lazy ones like you and me every single lunar month we accomplish reading the Quran once every night we finish one this is the bare minimum as per theith of abdah when the prophet told himat how many times do you read the Quran he said I finished it once a night every single night he finishes the Quran from cover to cover the prophet said no this is too much read it once a month so this is the bare minimum and if you have time you can do it in like 20 days 10 days 1 week 3 days max I know one of my relatives with the grace of Allah she finishes the Quran every 6 days out of memory meaning she revises five every day and finishes it six days seventh she starts over over again so it depends on your strength so what keeps you close to Allah the Quran itself the beautiful Sunnah when you recite when you read the biography of the Prophet abdah may Allah may Allah have mercy on him one of the great Scholars of Islam after is he used to go into his home and close the door and his students would say why don't you sit with us why don't you mix with us he said why would I do that I'd rather sit with the prophet Alam and his companions meaning he locks his door he takes his books of and ofth and he lives with the Prophet this would draw you way closer to Allah"
