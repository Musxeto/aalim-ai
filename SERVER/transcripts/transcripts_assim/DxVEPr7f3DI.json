  "transcript": "A question from online. In Sha Allah, I am going to get married by seeing a spouse, a girl in photo and be meeting the spouse with the wali. What sort of question should I ask while meeting a spouse to evaluate the spouse in the scale of deen and whether she will be compatible for me? Sorry, but my English is not that good. It has to be clear. I am old. I cannot hear. And your computer is going to be turned off because it doesn't have any power. The question says, I am going to get married by seeing a spouse in a photo and by meeting the spouse with the wali. What sort of question should I ask while meeting the spouse to evaluate the spouse in the scale of deen and whether she will be compatible for me? First question would be, is your photo touched by Photoshop or not? I do not at all advise the issue of sending photos. This is completely unacceptable because the photo can be circulated. She comes to me. She sends me an email. This is my photo. Nice. Send it to my friends. It can be lost. So this is not. And so many times a photograph is misleading. I see a woman's photograph. What is this? It is not human. And if you see her in real life, subhanallah, she is extremely beautiful. And the opposite. You see a photo. Some men, some women are photogenic, they call it. When you see a photo, mashallah, and when you see it in real life, ahh. So it is misleading and it is un-Islamic. Now you have another alternative, alhamdulillah. If the guardian is there, you can use Skype. So if you're really interested in getting married, you can use Skype and she talks to you. You can talk to her. You can have a sense of how she really looks. What are the questions to ask to know if she is really practicing or not? The sky is the limit. But remember, when you propose to someone, this is not an interrogation. So one of the brothers came to marry a girl, proposed to her. In the engagement, the father told me that when he came to see his daughter, he was with him, the father. The guy says, after saying salam alaikum, and the girl came, she sat down, you know, the girl is bashful and shy. The man did this. Bismillah ar-Rahman ar-Rahim, alhamdulillah, wa salatu wa salam wa rasool Allah. Question one. And the father is saying, and the guy asked about 15 questions. Saying, why did you go to school? Okay, if in an incident you saw this and that, what will you react? What kind of interview is this? He's going to propose and the girl, the poor girl is like in high school. Do I have multiple questions? Can I have a choice between two? So no, no, you have to answer this. This is not the way. How to evaluate your future spouse, you have to investigate. It's the interview. If you interview me, I have the skill to convince you in five minutes. There are people that are very good in interviewing. They know how to dodge questions in a way diplomatic. With the grace of Allah, I have this talent. Whenever I'm interviewed, I always get high marks. Impress the people in front of me and make them, you know, ah, he's the man. And I don't know anything. There are people who are not like this, who are very experienced, very good. But in interviews, I don't know, maybe, and they come out of the interview. Yeah, I did a mistake. Wallah, I didn't know how I. So an interview is misleading. Before the marriage, you have to do your homework. A man comes to propose to my daughter. I see the man. I meet the man. But before I meet him, I have a list of questions that I have to answer. So I have to see the imam of the masjid where he prays. I ask the imam. I ask the muadhin. How do you think of the of the boy? This is mashallah he prays in the first row. This is not enough. Has he ever fought with anyone in the masjid? Is his voice loud? Does he shout? Does he hold a grudge? No. OK, I go and ask his friends at school or in the workplace. How is he? Mashallah. His friends, what will they say? Oh, he's good. I said, this is not what I want. Question one, is he generous or not? Not that much, but yes, he's not stingy. OK, acceptable. Alhamdulillah. I don't want him to spend his money, but I don't want him to be stingy. Question number two, does he argue and nag? No, mashallah. OK, good. Question number three, does he ever fight? Is he usually in a state of rage? Is it easy for him to be not intimidated, provoked? Some people are always tensed, sensitive. If you say something, they take a position. This is not a very good person to live with. So they say, no, mashallah, all these are OK. Let's have the meeting. He comes and I interview him. Talk to me. Because as a sheikh, I talk a lot. And when someone proposing, I'm the one who's doing the talking. No, you talk. And I ask a few questions and I listen to him and I assess his personality. Third stage, he visits me and my daughter comes and I sit in between. Why? So that when I talk to him, she has room to look at him. And when I talk to her, he can look at her without being shy that I'm watching. But if I put them in front, no one will look. They will look at me. So this is what I do. After the half an hour, 40 minutes, they go. Following day, my daughter, how do you feel? She laughs and she looks at the ground. OK. They call the same day or the following day. Her mother calls my wife and she says, the boy is hooked. So can we come and propose officially? I said, you come. And everything goes quick. So to the sister or brother? He was a brother, huh? No, because he said the spouse and her wali. See? He's a brother. That's why it's good to study usool al-fiqh. It makes you correct things. So I asked the brother for you to ask, how can I? No, you cannot. You have to investigate. You have to ask the people, the friends, where she works, where she studies. And then seek Allah's guidance and find out a way. And may Allah make it easy upon all of us."
