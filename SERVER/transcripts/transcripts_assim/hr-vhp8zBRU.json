  "transcript": "I want to learn more about Islam but I do not know how to structure my learning any advice no it's it's it's complicated because each individual differs from the other and if I would tell you you have to start with uh reading the commentary of the Quran and learning the Quran maybe this does not fit you or does not suit you best because some people would find themselves in Reading Hadith and the commentary of the Hadith others would find themselves in reading the and learning the legislations and um uh the laws uh of uh our our religion others are fascinated by the Quran and the Sciences of the Quran and they find themselves in memorizing it and studying the T of it others would like to um work on different fields and Sciences of the uh the Shar therefore there isn't a structural thing that can be given to all yet the guidelines are as follows the best thing for you to learn is the Quran and the commentary of the Quran you should memorize portions of it per day secondly you have to know how to worship Allah and this does not come except by studying so studying chapters of to know how to purify yourself how to use water how to pray the different forms of prayer forgetfulness uh frustration fasting giving zakat all of these things you have to learn and then it can be you divided into uh different types of learning depending on your uh time and capability however I believe that it is essential for students of knowledge to learn Arabic so putting this in mind you have to uh uh try to choose the best program for yourself depending on your ability capability and depending on your time as well and Allah Knows Best"
