  "transcript": "Ahmed from Russia she I'm like one of your biggest fans so it's a bit embarrassing to ask you this but uh like I used to be a practicing Muslim always praying all my five prayers in the Masjid and uh like staying away from sins as much as possible but recently I've been having a hard time like with music and watching Haram and like I I don't even know how to like say this but I'm struggling to get my act together and even though I love Allah and his messenger like I still do major sins so is is there any advice you could give me loving Allah and the prophet is a great start unfortunately the more you continue to sin this love is depleting and diminishing and getting smaller and smaller until it disappears and goes away now my advice to you is to audit your life block all means that facilitate sins and surround yourself with practicing righteous Muslims 24 hours 7 days a week and there are so many links on my YouTube channel where you find a similar advice and more explanation and Allah Knows Best"
