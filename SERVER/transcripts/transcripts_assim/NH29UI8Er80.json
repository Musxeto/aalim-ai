  "transcript": "sherry says what is the position and importance of intellect on mind in Islam this is very generic question if you are referring to sanity and the ability to make a choice on your own this is very important in Islam because you are as a person as an individual held accountable in accordance to your sanity the Prophet says erase a lot or some Allah has uplifted the pen meaning that he would not hold a person accountable and he mentioned three one of them is a person who is insane until he regains his sanity so once a person can make a choice and is considered to be saying this shows you how important intellect of mind is but if you're referring to being intellectual but being able to make speeches and write poems and know who among the play writers died in the 18th century and the Renaissance and etc this is not it does not have anything to do with Islam per se"
