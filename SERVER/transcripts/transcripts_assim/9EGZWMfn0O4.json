  "title": "ðŸ†• Should I repeat prayer if the worshippers do not close the gap & stand away from me?",
  "transcript": "Sayyid from Singapore Okay, so do I have to redo my talaq all over again if I initially attended the Fajr prayers in a congregational manner where, I mean, when I'm about to start off the prayer or even during the prayers, I discovered that on either of my left hand side or my right hand side, there's an empty space which is about an arm's length away and that none of the worshippers decided to close up the gap which is on either of my sides? So the question of Sayyid is, is the gaps between the worshippers, does it nullify the prayer? The answer is no. It has no impact on the validity of the worshippers. So if I'm praying and the man next to me, like in the COVID era, there is social distancing. He is three feet away, one meter away, and the one on the right is one meter away, and neither of them is trying to come close. And if I come close, they get run away. So is my prayer valid? Your prayer is 100% valid and you don't have to repeat it. And Allah Azza wa Jal knows best."
