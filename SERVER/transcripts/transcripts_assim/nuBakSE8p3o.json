  "transcript": "one night when my husband was away in another city and we had a huge fight over the phone through text messages I was fed up with everything and told him that I won't live with him anymore and that time I was quite determined to do so I told him that I will inform my parents about my decision next morning I informed my parents and also told my husband that I informed my parents and I won't live with you anymore then he got angry and gave me three talak at once through text messages now my question is will this consider as one talak or Kola or both these issues of divorce cannot be answered on the phone or email cannot be answered by the woman's presentation and it has to be done with the husband so that we could hear from both parties understand the background the intentions and where they're coming from my advice is to take this case to your court in Bangladesh Islamic court and show it to the and see what he tells you about it or you can go to an Islamic Center that follows because most likely your K would say that these three divorces are final and you canot go to him at all you cannot remarry him again so no go toi or to someone who follows the Quran and the Sunnah and not the Hani maab uh strictly the Quran and the Sunnah and then inshallah they will give you the right fatwa"
