  "title": "Do I have to make up for missed fasts AND feed a poor Muslim while this multiplies every year?",
  "transcript": "from uh bangladesh okay chef um i have missed fast at two or three or four that i didn't kept for two or three years but now i can come to know that i'm sinful and i have to kept but i've seen one of the website that i have to give some money to the poor people and uh i mean not the money i i have to feed them and it increases every year like if i like one mood or it increases every year is this true okay i will answer inshallah says i heard that whoever had missed days of ramadan that he has to make them up and in addition to that he has to feed a poor person but this expiation of feeding a poor person multiplies with the number of years so the more you delay it the more feeding you have to do is this true this is totally bogus this is totally baseless the difference of opinion among scholars is if i missed a day from three four years ago and now i want to make them up so when making them up the difference is should i feed another poor person for that day in addition of making it up or not the most authentic opinion is that there's no expiation you miss the day you fast a day in its place and allah knows best you"
