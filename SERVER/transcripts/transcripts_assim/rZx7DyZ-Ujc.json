  "transcript": "he says that what's the Islamic rule on women working abroad to earn their living while she has full permission of her parents to travel without a Muharram so is it permissible for her to travel without a Muharram the answer is no even if she has full permission from her parents this is not required what is required is the full permission from Allah in worship the full permission from the prophet alayhi salatu salam and the prophets of allah salim closed this door forever and he said it is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah and then in the day of judgement to travel without a maja and the story so the Prophet himself as some who banned this who forbade this therefore no one can come and say it's okay it's permissible no one can come nowadays and say this because it was the Prophet who closed this door until the day of judgement"
