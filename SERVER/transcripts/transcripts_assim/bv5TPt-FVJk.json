  "transcript": "fatima says [Music] i have a question does a woman have more reward if she prays alone in her room or in congregation with her husband and father-in-law women are not obliged to pray in congregation so if she prays alone in her room that is much better for her reward insha allah but if she feels that joining her husband and her father-in-law in prayer would make them happy that would be fine"
