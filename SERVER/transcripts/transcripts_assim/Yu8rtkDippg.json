  "transcript": "is flu vaccination Hallel for kids with animal relatives that says yes mashaallah gelatin and likes are all under went rigorous chemical and physical process where its nature has been totally altered and changed so it's a new substance that has no relation to haram animals or pigs or whatever but personally I don't believe in by the way flu vaccinations I personally have my reservations I would never do it or allow my kids to do it because I simply think that it's a hoax it's a trend that pharmaceutical companies come up with every decade or so and they convince people to take it and afterwards we start seeing new diseases that are uncurable in the foreseen future maybe it's it's a conspiracy theory but i'm better off with a couple of weeks of sneezing and having the flu and then recovering and getting my immune system stronger by itself with the grace of allah rather than taking medication"
