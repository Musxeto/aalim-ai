  "title": "Wet & Dry Feces of Insects, Rodents, & Animals | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "fida says can you discuss on the purity of small creatures like ants roaches house lizards that are alive and also is their faces pure the scholars say that insects that has no running blood are negligible such as ants flies mosquitoes scorpions roaches so these insects and their thesis are negligible and pure when an insect has running blood they call it enough such as a lizard then this lizard or a mouse is nudges and the blood of it is najis and its thesis is nudges as well however the most authentic opinion is and this is the school of abu hanifa and the selection and choice of shaykh sheikh ibn that negligible amount of impurity is pardoned which means that if we see feces of lizards or rats that are dried these are nudges but we can simply swipe them away if they're wet we have to wash the area so why do we neglect it when it's dry because when the prophet salal salaam saw a cat and gave that cat some water the companions were amazed so the prophet explained to them that this cat is from among those that dwell upon you males and females what is the meaning of dwell meaning that our contact with them is frequent and it's too difficult to avoid such contact if not impossible so nature's animals due to being among those who dwell upon us we can pardon a lot of the najasa that may be caused by that dogs are an exception because this was clearly stated that their najasa is highly impure and needs to be washed seven times and once with soil but when you come to donkeys for example we know that the dung of donkeys is and we're not allowed to eat it and it's the prophet described as being impure however the saliva and the sweat of donkeys due to the fact that we use them so often are exempted they are forgiven likewise with the thesis of rats and lizards and allah knows best you"
