  "transcript": "abdullah from iran his question is disheartening to know that muslims specifically sunnis and when we say muslims we mean sunnis because they are the vast majority of muslims can pray anywhere in this world i think even in the vatican maybe you'll find a prayer hall in there maybe i don't know but when you come to a so-called muslim country like iran you will not find a masjid for them you will not find a place to pray jumu'ah for them if you go to the capital of iran you will not find a place for the sunnis to pray except if you go to the embassies so if you go to the saudi embassy or to the kuwaiti or the qatari embassy you will be able to pray jumaa there but this is unheard of it's very sad however abdullah says there are two options to study in a different city four hours away which is dominated by shia not a single masjid as usual and there is a lot of fitna and i feel my heart is being a hard is becoming hard and stiff and my man is decreasing rapidly or i can stay in my hometown which is dominated by sunnah with the grace of allah and we can pray in with the jamaa and congregation according to al-asuna al-jamaa but the quality of teaching the academia and the university is lower nothing can compromise your iman no wealth no higher education nothing your iman your islam comes first over everything so in a heartbeat take your decision and go back to your hometown be among your jamaa pray like the muslims pray and uh be away from fitna and insha allah allah will compensate you for the lack of quality in that university muslim"
