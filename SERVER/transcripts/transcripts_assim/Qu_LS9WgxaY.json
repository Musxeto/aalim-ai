  "title": "Innovations and Shirk with the body of Ibn Taimiyyah after he died",
  "transcript": "he says I heard someone saying that even Kathy mentioned in Alba daya when knee high a volume number 14 thereafter even Tamiya died before giving hustle people recited or an and kissed him men and women for Baraka and the water they used for whistle people drank it and so many other bidders and shirk happened was it true or ribbon Cathy was wrong or the guy who's saying this is deviant first of all this was mentioned in I'll be there one higher of him in kaffir el media one higher is a history book it's composed of like 20 volumes I think I'm I don't recall it now it's huge and it talks about from the time of Adam as if there were any one to report it from the time of Adam of Noah of Abraham etc it has all details of little things that took place which no one was there but this is history and knowledge is not taken from books of history this is 0.1 0.2 even Tamiya himself may Allah have mercy on his soul was one of the greatest scholars of all times he was so forcefully attacking and rejecting innovation anything that draws people close to shirk he was protecting the toe heat and he would never approve or had approved any of these acts mentioned thirdly none of those who had performed these innovations such as reciting the Quran kissing the dead body of women to a dead person who does this seeking blessing through kissing him or even drinking the water after What nonsense is this none of these students had done this or approved it and the laymen do more heinous things than this so whatever was reported and done was not done by the approval or acknowledgement of Chiklis ninh binh tay mia because he was dead now the issue is why didn't even katheer comment on such practices I don't know and personally I don't care see we do not take our religion from even Tamiya or even kefir or le mammoths a hobby or Tom Dick or Harry they are great scholars of Islam we put them on the top of our heads and we are not even equivalent to their toe fingernail they have vast knowledge but the religion of Allah soil is greater than them all and Allah tells us that whenever there is a dispute refer back to the Quran into the Sunna four antennas are tuned we shape for a to return it back to Allah and to his messenger sallallaahu them to the Quran and to the Sunnah so whatever was mentioned by even kaffir is unacceptable why didn't he command Allahu Alem yet he is not there is him in kaffir considered to be from the Salif because he was in the eighth century he draw and we know that the righteous predecessors are the first three generations the generation of the Sahaba of the terrain and of the tabi tabi een therefore those who circulate such a coat while ignoring the whole iceberg this coat is at the tip of an iceberg but there's a whole iceberg that condemns shirk that condemns innovation that talks clearly about these practices and how they do to relate to Islam not only that that they even invalidate Islam so those who caught it definitely have illness in their hearts because they've neglected all the teachings of him Devin Tamiya and came to an incident that happened after his death what do you want him to do to rise from the dead and say listen this is better this is innovation what are you doing this is not logical and Allah knows best"
