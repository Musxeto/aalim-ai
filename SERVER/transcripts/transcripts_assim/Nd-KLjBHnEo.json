  "transcript": "um from the emirates now i don't know how to approach my neighbors so basically i never talk to them because we live in an apartment plus my parents don't let me randomly knock their door and socialize because they want me to mind my own business is this okay okay i will answer from the emirates he says that i am not a very social person my parents prohibit me from knocking on my neighbor's doors and i'd wonder how would i socialize with them how to establish a relationship am i sinful for not doing that answer is no you're not sinful because you are not doing something evil or bad to them and part of honoring your neighbors is to prevent them from getting any wrong doings from your side so this is level one i don't throw trash in front of their door i don't blow music up so that it would wake them in the middle of the night or not make them concentrate i don't uh um peak and try to eavesdrop or to look at hours here and there of my neighbors so this is level one level two which is the best and highest is to be kind to them to send them food in ramadan some sambusa some shawba some soup um if they need a hand while moving something heavy you volunteer to do that if they need assistance in something that is halal you volunteer to do that that is a higher level but nowadays in concrete boxes that we live in usually people are intimidated when you give salam or you volunteer to give a helping hand so if you find that the consequence of your action and and and volunteering is positive go ahead and do it if not just keep your distance until the right time comes you"
