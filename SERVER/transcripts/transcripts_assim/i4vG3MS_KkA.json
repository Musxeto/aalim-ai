  "transcript": "okay um okay so basically when I'm praying I want to know if uh if like I finished the faat and then I just stopped for some reason and then thean of the next prayer is called and then I go for but I didn't know that it was the end time of that prayer is my prayer valid or not if you delayed the prayer intentionally until there was that little time sufficient no your prayer is invalid because you're the one who did this but if you woke up five minutes before the Adan and immediately went and made W and tried to pray even if the prayer for the second Salah was called while you are in reciting the fat your prayer is valid"
