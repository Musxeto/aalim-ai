  "transcript": "likewise when you opt for uh provident funds or retirement or uh 40k 401k i think they call it the retirement scheme differs if you're obliged by the government and they take a portion of your salary without your consent and they put it in a fund and when you retire they give you a monthly salary this is halal because i have no say in them taking money from me and whatever they give me after my retirement this is legitimate but if it's optional and they say would you like us to do this or that if you say yes this is like insurance it's haram because you could live for 30 40 years after your retirement and get triple or quadruple the amount that you have invested in the beginning and you may die the following month and all gone down the drain so this is gambling and risky that is not permissible in islam"
