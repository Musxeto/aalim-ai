  "transcript": "foreign and welcome to the fifteenth class of the book fusol philapada the islamic faith which talks in a very simple way about the apida the creed of now al-jamar today we will talk about chapter number seven and this chapter addresses what the muslims believe about the quran and what is the stance of so the author says in the beginning the quran is allah's word he truly said it in sounds words and surahs we do not say that it is mere meaning without utterance but we say that allah speaks whenever he wills what does that mean it means that the quran is the actual speech of allah azza wajal and what does that mean it means that it is one of allah's attributes and this is what all the salaf from the time of a prophet salaam tilde believe in they believe that the quran is the word of allah the almighty as azzawajal it is truly said in every thing of it the sound of it the letters the words the sentences the surahs and we don't say like the people of deviancy such as this is a cult a sect that was prevailing at the time of imam ahmad may allah have mercy on him and he stood uh strong in their face not backing off the fact that this is allah's word and it's not created and he was tortured and he was thrown into in jail because of that and he remained steadfast until allah azza made the truth prevail once again and were victorious so the thoughts and ideas and philosophy of those deviant sects added to their misunderstanding and to their misguidance to the public how is that if you recall in the last class we spoke about the beautiful names and attributes of allah azza and we said that one of the biggest motivations if this is a right expression to alter change and distort allah's beautiful names and attributes is bad thinking whims desires thinking that these names and attributes may make allah azzawajal similar to his creation so they say allah does not have hands allah does not have a face allah does not have eyes and all of this is mentioned in the quran and the prophet told us that allah has fingers so they said no no no no this is making allah like humans and nobody said that himself allah said but their bad ideas their distance from the understanding of the self instead of them saying okay we know that allah hears and sees everything why didn't you also say that allah doesn't hear and doesn't see anything because this makes him as a human being so like you have affirmed the attributes of seeing and hearing you you affirm as well all the other attributes as allah described himself but their bad thoughts and negativity their philosophical background made them come up with such sects that negates things that are affirmed in the quran and the sun when it came to the quran being the speech of allah azzawajal that allah has spoken it again they said the same thing that this means that if allah spoke with the quran that allah has to be so and so and so and so on all of these are unacceptable and rejected if allah azzawajal wanted us to know that he would have told us he did not he just told that this is his speech and he told us that he spoke with the quran jibril heard it and delivered it as a revelation to the prophet he told us that it is written in the preserved tablet he told us that it is in the chest of the believers he told us that it is written in papers and circulated as a book this is actually the word of allah the speech of allah he told us that when any of the idol worshipers wants to [Music] seek refuge in you give him refuge and make him listen to the word of allah how is he going to listen to the word of allah by me reciting it so when i recite the quran what am i reciting the word of allah the voice is mine it's my lips it's my tongue but what's coming out is the word of allah so they got things confused they could not differentiate between the attribute of allah azzawajal being used and conveyed through a vessel whether it's my sound whether it's the ink in the paper whether it is um what was given to the prophet islam this is all or these are all vessels to the actual word of allah so what you're hearing when i say alhamdulillah what is this the word of allah yeah but you said it yes it is the word of allah even if i said it allah spoke it and allah azzawajal made jibril hear it and jibril revealed it to the prophet saw the prophet taught it to the companions until it reached us this is the word of allah so the quran is allah's words he truly said it in sounds how this is none of your business remember we do not say how does allah hear or listen how does allah azzawajal control everything in the universe how is something that we cannot comprehend and we have to believe in it that allah spoke it in as in sounds words and surahs we do not say that it is mere meaning without utterance we do not say the quran that we have is just a manifestation of what's in the preserved tablet no this is all wrong what you hear what you see what you read is all the uh allah's words but we say that allah speaks whenever he wills what does allah speaks whenever he wills this means that allah azzawajal speech is part of his attributes related to action meaning that allah's attributes are divided into two types [Music] means that it's in it it is something that allah azzawajal has and always had and it will always be described with such attributes so allah life is a attribute part of allah azzawajal he's always described of being alive he's always described of being hearing and seeing all he's always described as wise as wealthy subhanallah as powerful all of these are descriptions of allah azzawajal there are descriptions related to actions and this means that allah does them when he wills so allah speaks when he wills laughs when he wills comes when he wills descends when he wills gets angry when he wills so these are the types of this attributes related to action and this one allah speaks as he or when he wills allah says in the quran allah and allah spoke to moses with direct speech and if you notice that i have changed the translation of this verse and a number of verses to come because i did not like the translation and being an arab being knowledgeable of what the verse means i thought that it would be better to take the the translations of some of these verses from sahaja international which is one of the best translations one of the best and it's more accurate so here allah azza says and allah spoke to moses with direct speech allah spoke directly to moses moses heard what allah had said subhanahu and also in chapter 7 verse 143 allah says what translates to when moses came to our appointment and his lord spoke to him so again this is the second verse showing that allah spoke actually to moses his word is what he says allah says allah says the truth and he alone shows the right path all of this is what all of this to prove to you that allah spoke it and allah speaks and the author goes on to bring us verses of the quran describing the actual quran and the different manifestations that we can see the quran in so in chapter 29 allah says rather it meaning the quran is distinct verses preserved within the breasts or the chest of those who have been given knowledge so the word of allah is preserved in our chests by memorizing it and this does not mean it is created no it is still the speech of allah azzawajal the word of allah the almighty and have you noticed i've changed this translation as well the sheikh says it is heard with people's ears the word of allah yes the very same word of allah is heard with our own ears allah says if any of the idolaters seeks asylum with you grant him protection so that he may hear the word of allah and then convey him to his place of safety so the idol worshiper when i recite the fatiha wouldn't say that your speech is fine i wouldn't say that listen to my words rather i would say listen to allah's word so what he's hearing at the moment is allah's word it's not created this is allah's attribute that he is hearing and looking at and listening and writing the fact that it was allah's messenger who delivered it to us does not alter the fact that it is allah's own word so the process of hearing it delivering it to the prophet the prophet giving it to the companions the companions conveying it to us is still allah's word it is not only heard it is also written down allah inscribed in parchment spread open so this book is allah's word but it's also inscribed written down some of the scholars said that this is also referring to the preserved tablet and this is one of the tafsir in the authentic books allah azzawajal has preserved it on a tablet he kept subhanahu he has kept subhana ta'ala allah says this is indeed a glorious quran inscribed on an imperishable tablet and allah azza says and indeed it is in the mother of the book with us exalted and full of wisdom the mother of the book which is the preserved tablet it is with allah the fact that it is written down does not alter the fact that it is allah's word since paper is created like the ink is created so this is part of the issues the deviant sects have they say it's not logical how can it be allah's words if it's written down in front of us by ink and paper if we hear the reciter reciting it and it's his lips it's his tongue and it's his vocal chords that are making these sounds and all of this is part of what shape on plays with their heads because allah azza told us in so many places in the quran that this is his word allah says even if we had sent down to you a book written on paper and they had touched it with their own hands he thus makes the book and the paper two different things meaning in this verse if you look if you ponder upon this verse the idol worshipers deny the fact that there is a revelation there is something called quran that allah spoke the quran subhana so allah says even if we had sent down to you a book that is allah's revelation written on paper so being a book being allah's speech does not have any impact whether it's written or not written on paper and they had touched it with their own hands he thus makes the book and the paper two different things allah also says subhanallah about it being written down confirming that the quran is his own word even though it is written with created pens and created ink he says where all the trees on earth to be made into pens and the sea is ink with seven more seas yet added to it the words of allah would not be exhausted words are endless allah runs the universe with his words imagine how many leaves fall from the trees every single minute allah makes them fall with his word with his command allah controls the trajectory the spiral uh process it falls in you can say that about every single particle of sand in a sandstorm or every drop of water in waves or every blow of air in hurricanes and tornadoes all of this is controlled by allah's words and if allah's words were to be written down by all the trees that you see in forests and the ink would be the seven seas with more supplying it allah's words would not be exhausted allah also say say if the sea were ink for my lord's words the sea would surely dry up before the lord's words are exhausted even though we were to add to it another seed to replenish it what does that mean it means that allah's words can be written down but this does not change the reality that allah's speech is not created yes allah spoke it and it's one of allah's attribute and this does not change so what is written with pence and what is not written all of it is god's is allah's word and it is all the same whoever says that allah's words is a creature is a disbeliever and this is what agree upon because it is one of allah's attributes because allah's speech is one of his attributes he has distinguished between his creation and his words so allah when he speaks to us in the quran he makes it clear that there is a distinction there is a difference between his creation and his words and allah says let me first get the better uh translation indeed your lord is allah who created the heavens and the earth in six days this is a better translation than the one you have in the book so allah azzawajal created the heavens and the earth in in six days and then established himself above the throne he covers the night with the day another night chasing it rapidly and he created the sun the moon and the stars subjected by his command subjected by his command then allah says unquestionably his is the creation and the command distinction between creation and command so the moon the heavens the earth everything is creation but his command what allah says and speaks is not creation and this is a beautiful word or beautiful ayah that anyone who reads it knows exactly that the creation is different than allah's commands and allah's speech because these are not created the sheikh says in this verse allah distinguishes between his creation and his command his creation includes those mentioned here heavens earth sun the moon the stars while his command is his speech with which he gives shape to his creatures as he says in this verse they are subservient to his command also created the voices of the reciters of the quran just as he created their lips tongues and throats as well as their movement the air and their saliva so all of these are created when we here the reciter reads something yet this does not change the fact that what we hear from them is allah's words allah the almighty says in the quran in surah do you covet the hope o believers that they would believe for you while a party of them used to hear the words of allah and then distorted that is the torah after they had understood it while they were knowing so allah is telling us that even the jews hear the words of allah azzawajal of course while it's being recited so allah described what we hear from reciters to be the word of allah this means that what is heard is allah's word even though it is pronounced by the reciters it is as some scholar said the voice belongs to the reciter but the word belongs to the creator now this chapter led a lot of scholars to write volumes after volumes to emphasize the fact that the quran is not created and that it is allah's speech so many great scholars such as imam bukhari great imams of allah spoke clearly without any ambiguous words to emphasize this fact that is an article of belief one would say what is the big issue well whether it is allah's attribute or not it's not a big deal first of all this is about allah how dare you say it's something trivial it's not a big deal it is one of the biggest deals ever because it deals with the attribute of allah azza when you come and negate it and say no no it's created and this is the last line of defense because if we compromise it then people would barge in and start to compromise all attributes of allah azzawajal and speak offensively against allah like what the jamia did and what tesla did and so on even ashari and maturity they went that route not fully but still with the same concept and inevitably they would reach there someday as long as they follow their rules and regulations which contradict with the beliefs of a sunnah now preserving the heat and protecting allah's beautiful names and attributes is one third of the heat as you all know lordship worship and the beautiful names and the attributes of allah azza this is a branch of tawheed that we must stand firm to protect it one would say okay does this mean that anyone who says that quran is created is a kafir as we have just read this is what the majority of scholars say anyone who says the quran is created is a kafir because he is messing up with one of allah's beautiful attributes and that is allah's speech so he's claiming that allah's attribute is created and likewise if someone says the prophet was created from allah's beautiful attribute light so he was created from allah's light again you are falling into disbelief but we do not give or label individuals because we always repeat this in order to make someone out of the fold of islam he has to fulfill the conditions of kufur and take fear and we must ensure that there are no obstacles preventing us from labeling as such and this is why three caliphs of the abbasi era tortured and imprisoned imam ahmed beating him up flogging him to force him say that the quran is a creation of allah not an attribute yet when he came out of prison he would seek allah's forgiveness for the caliphs and never curse them or say that they're kafir why because labeling someone as a kafir is different than saying this act is kuffer so we've said this before many times and i think repeating it is quite important because i'm getting a lot of calls and and questions and counseling sessions from people doubting everything to be covered if a person doesn't pray for 20 years and he dies is he a kafir some scholars say yes and we should warn people not to pray or janaz a prayer and we should not wash him and we should not shroud them and we should throw him in the desert like a dead dog but this is not practical because throughout time of islam never ever this had taken place once which means that the ruling is wrong of such scholars and when we go back to the quran and sunnah we find that there is a difference between a general description and an individual labeling and description so in general whoever leaves an abandoned saud is a kafir that's general in order to specifically custom made this to abdullah ahmed ahmad or whatever tom dick or harry we have to ensure that their the conditions are fulfilled so this guy for 20 years he didn't pray and died we have to know why he didn't pray maybe he was misguided someone of scholars said to him all what counts is iman in your heart maybe he was lazy maybe he thought this or that so ignorance being forced misinterpretation all of these can be obstacles that prevent us from giving fear to him this is why imam did not give takfir to those who imprisoned him and did these heinous things to him so again sometimes i think a while back one of the daris said something similar to what the jamia say and all hell broke loose figuratively not literally everybody started bashing him and saying he's a jah me he's this he's a kafir subhanallah did the guy speak with knowledge yes we can say clearly the statement that sheikh so and so said is a statement of kuffar no problem in that at all i'm with you but to say is a kafir that he's a jahme that he's this and that the guy doesn't know the guy that doesn't have sufficient knowledge he made a mistake he said something unintentionally so it is wrong to jump the gun and to start labeling people just because you dislike them just because they don't follow your man hash what you should do is to remember that the self are the kindest of people to the people they are the kindest of people to the people to others be kind say that what was said was wrong and this goes against the creed of alice without shooting the guy without executing or calling for a witch hunt because the guy did not know doesn't know he's not a student of knowledge he's not a scholar so we should be kinder to people yet never compromise the fact that this is our creed this is our akita and not with and and that we're not backing uh out and we are defending it with all what we can and allah azza knows best so we go on to the questions selma says please let me know is it necessary to mention that we are giving zakat to that relative as they are needy but i know they will feel bad if you know for certain that they are needy and deserving to take the cat plus a condition that is very important that they do not mind in taking zakat in this case you can give it to them without telling them okay can you explain this again sheikh i would if i know that abdullah's family are stone broke and this is certain not that they're pretending to be pious and righteous and not having enough money no i know that in the middle of the month they start to borrow money because the salary could not take them except for 15 days and they have 15 days to go so i know that their stone broke they need medication and they cannot afford it in this case i can give them from my zakat without telling them providing that i also know that their pride and dignity do not prevent them from accepting zakat there are people who might be from the descendants of the prophet or might have too much dignity that they do not accept zakat so such people you cannot give them zakat as some scholars say but if you don't know and you are more inclined to the fact that yeah they wouldn't mind whether it's a cat or not but they can't ask and i don't want to break their heart then you can give it to them insha allah and allah azza knows best ismael says i know that there are three categories of people that allah smiles looking at them can you mention the names of them there is a hadith and allah says the prophet says assam in it allah loves free laughs or smiles at them and he is happy with them one is a fighter when his battalion runs away from the battlefield he attacks the enemy alone either he's martyred says to the angels look to my servant how he is fighting for my cause how is he patient and tolerant for my cause the second category a man having a beautiful woman in a comfortable bed wakes up in the middle of the night allah says he abandons his desire and remembers me and if he wishes he would have continued sleeping loves this person and he laughs or smiles at him and thirdly a group in travel so they ride and late at night they go to sleep while he stands up in prayer whether at ease or in hardship these are the three types that allah smiles to or laughs to and allah loves as wajal may allah make me and you one of them amina says do i have to make up for missed fasts during pregnancy and breastfeeding or can i pay fidia the vast majority of scholars say that when a fast is missed due to a legitimate reason it must be made up and they differ whether to make it up in addition to feeding one poor person or just making it up is sufficient and the most authentic opinion is that it is sufficient only to make it up even if it is after 10 or 20 years the other opinion is a weak opinion that states a pregnant woman and a breastfeeding woman can compensate for skipping the day of ramadan by feeding a person but this as i said is a weak opinion and the majority of scholars say you must make it up and i've seen women with 120 days some of 400 days which means that like 15 years of skipping ramadan due to pregnancy breastfeeding or menses so they say now 400 days how do you want us to fast it if you want if you fast every monday and thursday of a week and every white days 13th 14th and 15th of every month per year you would be doing between 80 to 90 days so it's very easy you can do that in over the period of four to five years and you would finish making up all these missed days without a problem says can i ask you a question people who go to graves of wise people of islam like the sahaba and the imams can people pray through them as my dad says you don't ask from them you ask through them is that right so basically what media is asking about is the justification of grave worshippers when we talk to them and say what you're doing is they say i am not doing shirk i'm not asking the jilani or the badawi or the tijani or the prophet islam to protect me i'm asking the prophet all these righteous people to ask allah azzawajal so we are taking them as intermediaries and this is exactly the shirk that allah mentioned in the beginning of surat as zuma allah says and those who take protectors besides him say we only worship them that they may bring us nearer to allah in position this is the claim of the mushrikeen of the idol worshipers that we worship them just that we can draw nearer and closer to allah so what is worshipping them is not necessarily only limited in prayer bowing and prostrating tawaf is worshipping them slaughtering animals for them is worshipping them calling them at times of distress save me i'm in a dilemma i'm in a calamity protect me from what i fear all of this is worshiping them though they claim that they are worshiping allah through them we don't have anyone to er to be intermediate between us and allah azzawajal allah says in the quran and i shall respond to you i shall answer you this is what allah says and you say no no no we'd rather take a different route this would take you straight to hell so tell your father that what he's doing is mentioned in the quran and it is totally prohibited has he says buying house or making a house with government loan is it halal buying a house or a car or a plot is halal in principle how you pay for it or how you finance it is the problem so if i'm buying a house with an interest-based loan this is called riba whether the lender is a bank a financial institution the government or sherlock the jew it's the same concept any loan that draws interest is an interest based law but if someone is lending you 300 000 dollars for the sake of allah and is willing to wait for you 10 20 30 years without any interest this is totally halal and permissible the problem is that most people don't like this answer they want an answer that fits their situation even by altering the religion so they come to you and say no this is not practical we live in europe and we pay a lot of money for rent and it would be cheaper for us are almost as expensive to pay mortgage to the bank i said subhan allah so you want me to say that islam's ruling is wrong and it's permissible to accept an interest-based loan how can that be they said laws are made to be bent not broken so we can play around subhanallah do you mock allah's religion by doing this where is your submission to the ruling of allah azzawajal so people have a big time problem and they have to take care of it he says we make dua for muslim actors and celebrities is this permissible as long as they're muslim whether they are actors singers evil people they're still muslim there's nothing wrong in that we do not endorse them or approve of their evil what's haram is haram but if they die and we seek allah's forgiveness for them there's nothing wrong with that bearing in mind that we're talking about most limbs to have a muslim name but not act like a muslim or do things that take you out of the fold of islam this is different there are so-called muslim actors who are married to a hindu and their children grow grow up practicing hinduism and he goes to their temples and he even have has a temple in his home to worship other than allah and he thinks that this is right this is wrong quran is might be right might be wrong this is kufur this is yeah it takes a person out of the fold of islam and such people who openly commit acts of apostasy in a muslim environment and scholars are all around them and they've sent them warning messages that what you're doing is an act of apostasy and they still defiant because of their fame nobody would take them in and give them roles and jobs unless they act like this if they were real practicing muslims nobody would look at them so unfortunately such people commit blatant cover and disbelief and these people you cannot seek forgiveness for them allah would judge him on the day of judgment and seema says my parents have an opposite religion alhamdulillah i don't understand what this means but they are both muslim now so let's not talk about the past however my father died and my mother has or is working abroad and now i'm living with my non-muslim aunt i chose her family rather my muslim auntie because i don't like their treatment towards me my question is did i become among them the disbelievers as is no living with your non-muslim aren't if you practice your islam better and you feel better than being with your muslim auntie and you are truly getting closer to allah not getting further away from him this seems permissible providing both of them are living in a non-muslim country but if your muslim auntie is living in a muslim country then it is mandatory for you to go and live in a muslim country living in a non-muslim country without a legitimate reason is not permissible you have to migrate especially if the living conditions are the same and there is nothing keeping you behind why would you stay in a non-muslim country when you can have and enjoy the luxury of living among muslims and so many times people unfortunately prefer living in a non-muslim country with a non-muslim family because of a hidden thing in their heart that's looking up to come out so many inshallah you're not among them as nima so many people leave the fold of islam after a while because the pressure is too huge and they're swimming against the tide everybody's going this way and islam tells you go the opposite way so you don't feel at home you don't feel comfortable you feel inferior you want people to treat you normally and they won't treat you normally until you have a boyfriend and that you party that you wear like they wear if what they're wearing is considered to be clothes so they want you to be like them take off their hijab compromise the things that you always hold on to no pork is haram intoxicants haram i can sit with you i can share with you your parties your celebrations they won't be ever happy with you until you abandon your religion so this is why it's a very serious issue and you have to be careful uh says i fear so much from hypocrisy is that pray fajr and qiyam and make intention all the time to be pure enough to be a good believer it could be whispers from shape on to make muslim fear to be hypocrite if i understand the question clearly hebert allah says that she's so afraid of being a hypocrite so she prays fenji on time she offers night prayer to purify herself but she is not certain is this sufficient or not so first of all al-hasan al-basri may allah have mercy on us his soul said and this is also attributed to abdullah may allah be pleased with him that hypocrisy is not feared except by a believer and no one is safe from feeling afraid except a hypocrite so when you have the feeling when i have the feeling that i might be a hypocrite and i always check and balance whether my iman is valid or not whether i'm sincere or not whether i'm doing this to impress people or not this means i'm a believer while a hypocrite a real hypocrite doesn't care doesn't think about it and this is why in a narration of alhassan al-basri said that a believer feel fears his sins as if he is under a mountain about to collapse on him while a hypocrite considers his sins as a fly that stood on its on his nose and he did this and it went away that's it these are all his sins which means that the feeling itself of being a hypocrite and the fear this is a positive fear because it is driving you to pray fajr on time to offer night prayer and you think oh no this is not enough let me memorize the quran let me go to attend circles of knowledge oh i want to do this particular thing but this is sinful let me refrain because i don't know if it would overweigh my scale of sins and throw me in hell i'm gonna refrain from that and a person is in constant check and balance and improving and getting closer to allah so definitely this is a good sign when you are so chilled and cool and nothing worries you you skip a prayer so what allah is most forgiving you skip a day of fasting i fasted 28 days so i'm still a winner you jump to do and and commit sins after sins and you feel you've done nothing on the contrary sometimes you are sorry because you could have done this and that more then this is a full-fledged typical hypocrite that a person should be afraid of being one and allah azza knows the best and with this we come to the conclusion of today's class until we meet you next thursday [Music] over"
