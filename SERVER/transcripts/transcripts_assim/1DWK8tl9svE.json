  "title": "Can we use miswak with our left hand or brush teeth with left hand? #assimalhakeem assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh sh I'm a I am a lefty I write with my left however I eat with my right hand and drink with my right hand but when it comes to brushing my teeth I struggle using my right hand and sometimes end up using my left hand to brush my teeth is that okay what the scholars differed in terms of using the miswak the toothbrush some say it's best to use the right hand because it's a Sunnah others say it's best to use the left hand because it's removing dirt and filth so both sides have a legitimate reason and cause and hence you have no problem none whatsoever to use the left hand to brush your teeth because the prohibition that the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam taught us was to eat and drink and give and receive with the left hand and he justified this by saying because Shan eats and drinks and gives and H hands outs and receives with his left hand and Allah Knows Best"
