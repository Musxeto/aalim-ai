  "title": "Is wearing the Blue Eye Symbol Kufr or Shirk",
  "transcript": "Yusuf from the Emirates. Is wearing the blue eye symbol, you know? No, you see, what is meant by wearing the blue eye symbol? It depends on people's intention. If someone likes how it looks, not knowing of its background, or wearing a green eye, or a black eye, he just likes the shape and the looks of it, there's no kufr and there's no sin in it. If a person believes like the layman and the ignorant people, that this blue eye symbol prevents the evil eye from coming to you, so when you wear it as a necklace or you place it in your home or on your items, so when someone sees, whoa, what a beautiful thing, this would not have an impact because such a blue eye repels an evil eye, this is minor shirk. If you believe that it repels such things by itself, this is major shirk. Takes you out of the fold of Islam. But if you think that this is one of the means where Allah blocks such evil eye, this is minor shirk and it's even worse than major sins. So this depends on the intention. Now if we know the background of it, it is prohibited for a Muslim to wear it. Even if he has no conviction of its impact or efficiency or effect on him. Because people don't know that. They would think that he does believe in such amulets and therefore it is prohibited for him to wear. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
