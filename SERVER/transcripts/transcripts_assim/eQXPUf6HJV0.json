  "title": "Azerbaijan is a democratic country, can I migrate to a Kafir country and live there? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "This is your question. Mordak San from Azerbaijan. I am from Azerbaijan which is a democratic country but we have a lot of Muslims there. And my father wants to send me abroad for studying abroad to a non-Muslim country. And if I go I would like to stay there and live there for the rest of my life. And is it haram for me to leave that of my country? And I need to know that we are not a Muslim country officially. There is no Sharia law or the Sharia. Okay, I understand your question Mordak San. First of all, I do not know the nature of your country. I hear that Azerbaijan, I think it's the capital is Baku or maybe, I don't know. I've never been there and I hear that it is a Muslim country. Maybe majority Shia but they're not Rafida. Normal Shia don't have any Kufr beliefs. I still don't know. Nevertheless, it is still labeled as a Muslim majority population. So going to a Kafir country, getting their nationality and citizenship and staying there would not be permissible. If you don't like Azerbaijan, you can migrate to another Muslim country. Maybe Kyrgyzstan, maybe Uzbekistan, maybe any of the Muslim neighboring countries that practice Islam where you could have a Muslim family and a Muslim environment."
