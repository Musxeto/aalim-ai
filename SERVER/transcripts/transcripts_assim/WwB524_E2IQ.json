  "transcript": "the first question is is a missar marriage permissible and this question is unfortunately a frequently Asked question What is msar marriage a msar marriage is a normal contract between a man and a woman with the approval of her guardian with the presence of two male Muslim wit es naming the dowy so what's the difference between it and a normal marriage in this Miss marriage the woman forgives or let go some of her own rights due to necessity for example she says I don't require that you come to my home every other night if he has a first wife and she's the second wife he's obliged to spend equal nights with both wives but she says I don't require this or she says I don't require you getting me a house I have my own house I don't need a house or she says I'm a rich woman or I have a job I don't require you to provide for me the food and to pay the rent and the electricity bill I'll take care of the financials my own financials so what is the ruling on such a marriage if the conditions are fulfilled what are the conditions the main condition is that the the marriage is for good and hopefully for life until these conditions or until these needs are gone so the woman says for example I have old parents I have to take care of them there's no one else to take care of them and I can't spend a whole day with you in a house and leave them alone so I'm I'm happy if you come twice a week and we you sit with me for four or five hours and We Dine and we uh uh do whatever and alhamdulillah and the man says I have a wife and a children and I have needs but I can't financially support a woman in a separate house if Allah provides for me and I get more money yes I'll do that in the future so their intention is good so these conditions if they're fulfilled and the intention is to stay away from Haram and to satisfy one another in halal means then alhamdulillah this is fine but if it is misused and abused as so many men unfortunately do so instead of taking a girlfriend he takes a wife in missar for a couple of months and then he divorce her divorces her and goes to someone else this is Haram I've heard of some I wouldn't call them friends but acquaintance people I know unfortunately and some of them might be people of knowledge who would go to a poor country and get married to a young girl buy her a house a car and stay there for summer and they call this MF marriage not missar because it's in the summer her her family knows that this guy is there for the summer only and after 2 three months he divorces her leaves the house and the car and he says she it's a win-win the family is Happy the girl is happy and no one is to be blamed and if you look at the contract it's not timed so no one dares to say that okay I'm going to marry you for two months and then I'm divorcing you no this is totally Haram this is mut marriage a timed marriage is Haram and it's invalid but they know he knows that this is why he's there he's M he's been married like 19 times and he does this and he benefits the family and he says it's okay logically it's okay but it's not okay this is messing up with the Shar and using it for your own whims and desires which is not permissible and Allah knows best so if the M marriage is as described with the good intentions with the intention of staying away from Haram until things improve and become better inshallah there's no no nothing wrong in that"
