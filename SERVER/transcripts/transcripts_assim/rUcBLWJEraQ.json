  "transcript": "the prophetess Ram goes and collects the food and he tells the people your mother has felt jealousy she's jealous Johnny he's explaining her day to myself when I did this I did huh well I will I will step on her stomach and jump jump jump jump doing this in front of the man she's disgracing me but then I remember no I cannot do this I have to follow the Prophet and then I remember okay women by nature are jealous so this is their nature they have to control their jealousy they have to stop themselves from doing harm with their jealousy but you can never as a man say I don't understand how you think why are you jealous if I marry another woman what's what's wrong in that well okay if she marries another man how would you feel I will kill her now you know so it is natural in a woman to be jealous but we don't want too much of jealousy this too that's what it has two O's which shows you all subhanAllah and that is why the prophet alayhi salaatu a sir as in the hadith of an asymptomatic he said why don't you marry from the unsub the people of Medina the Prophet did not marry any one of the ants are so honest is asking and the people of Medina are asking and this is a shame we would like you to marry from our women and the Prophet said our salatu salam Ansar are extremely jealous the women of al-azhar are extremely jealous and that is why the Prophet Isis on did not marry from them so extreme jealousy is not a feature that you would like to have in your wife however do we have a miswak okay a question who among the Prophet Allah saw some wives was known to be jealous yet the Prophet married her no no you're gonna you're gonna mention that the whole names other by the way I have filled my daughter's my Mona half son I shot no Hafsah no again my I told you I have my Munna I have half sine alpha and none of them almost I'll give him a shock exactly is from the house okay umm Salama when Abu Salim I died I was 11 was the brother of the Prophet eraser Sam bicycling right was he yes who's the third brother Hamza very good then give them I'm sorry okay they have okay the sister who acid needs a miswak good when he died the prophet proposed to UM Salaam she refused but she justified her refusal she said o prophet of Allah I'm an old woman I have a lot of children and I also are very Jan Murray jealous what did the prophecy exam as for your children they're mine I would support them don't worry as for your age I am older than you so you don't have any problem as for your jealousy what is the solution I will pray to Allah that he will take it away from you indeed Allah accept his prayer yes how do we know he no no no she did not the one who sacrificed her night was so damn bent Zoomer may Allah be pleased with her the look at the life that the Prophet was leading on Isis on the prophets wives were two parties fighting against each other the first party was led by Aisha and half son and the second party was led by Zeynep when Josh and the rest and the Prophet was in the middle so whenever they had a problem the first the second party would complain or prophet always goes to her she always goes to her issue so they asked one of the prophets wives to go and mediate and to intercede to the Prophet who did they choose home Selim the scholars say they chose him Selim ah because she did not have the jealousy so the Prophet would accept her intercession he knows that she's not taking sides anyone would go no he's taking sides so that is why um Sarah may Allah be pleased with her did not have that jealousy because of the prophets do okay among the characteristics that we look in a woman that she does not have any hardship and getting married easy on her dowry easy in the marriage expenses this is among the best because at the end of the day what's the conclusion of marriage is that you get your wife in a house so if I can afford to do this with the least amount of money then my marriage would be perfect and my marriage would be complete we stop here yeah q and inshallah Allahu Alem when a special meeting he asked them the question if a sister had a disease like cancer and she's now cured does she have to inform her tobe husband about it she's not happy laughs of Samaras well you know the deficiencies or the illnesses that deprive the husband from having a perfect marital life the they must be told to the husband in advance and those illnesses or deficiencies that do not affect the husband they are not to be told and I'll give you an example if a why has a deficiency or an illness that prevents the husband from fully enjoying her so she has a problem in her private parts for example or she has as in the case of breast cancer she had one of her calves or her breasts surgically removed may Allah cure all those who have this illness and prevent those who do not have it from having it so a man proposes and we say no you're not going to tell him that she has only one breast is this permissible no he has to be informed because this affects how he is enjoying her but if she has for example a birthmark on her back of shoulder it's a big birthmark does she have to tell him it has nothing to do with enjoying her if she has an illness in her skin that is making her skin not acceptable or maybe it repels people if they see it yes we have to tell him if she has an illness that gives her mouth a very bad breath there are the we have dentists here there are some illnesses that are not easily removed and they're permanent and in Arabic fact we call it a bar he's smelling and it is one of the excuses that permits a person from not attending salon it's like onion and garlic no this is worse so bad smell if the moment has this she has to be clear it has to be clear to the husband but if it's normal no normal things Gani a mouth shabby he was one of the scholars of Islam and he had a lot of sense of humor in him a man came to him and said share I married a woman and only discovered afterwards that she limps so shall I return her back to her family because this is a defect he says yes if you want to race with her yes limping is not something that affects the marriage so if she limps I'm not going to race whether she's not a horse so this is not something that you usually would affect the marital order if a bride's family gives some kind of degree by their own reach so the groom rejected or should be accepted because it's kind of like a ritual and if a man accepted it during his marriage so what should he do I believe that the question is if a man receives gifts from the family of the girl should he accept it or not the answer is definitely accepted as long as is coming as a gift but what is not permissible is for you to give a list when you propose I'd like to have a car I'd like to have a flat I'd like to have a hundred thousand in my bank account my mother needs this my father and he has a long list of what he needs this is how long a ritual like any accepted to lead a driver becomes a ritual yeah it's a nun Islamic ritual it definitely it cannot accept it it is different when I get married in Saudi for example the relatives of my wife they give us without me instruction instructing it or asking or requesting it they give one example my father-in-law says I'll give you a refrigerator and my mother-in-law says I'll give you the oven my family say for example my uncle says I'll furnish your bedroom the others say I will furnish your kitchen with dishes and so on this is all acceptable because this is mutual help gifts no problem giving gifts is okay what is a problem is that you as a man do not give dowry you do not get the house who do not furnish the house all of this is Haram this is your responsibility but if anything comes as a gift without you asking or demanding or not becoming as a ritual yes again another problem is when I'm invited to a wedding it is mandatory for me to bring a present who says this I quote all weddings I never give anything this is not an obligation when it comes on obligation it becomes a bidder it becomes a financial hardship because I have to go to my cousin's house I have to go to my brother-in-law's marriage and I have to give him money I have to give it no this is Haram no obligation financial obligation of such is not part of the Islam okay second question in case the girl had a past relationship and she has stopped she's repented but she doesn't want to get married again because she feels this thing will come back again good thinking so this will remind her about the past relationship so is it right no she is not this is not right as long as she had repented from her previous sin and she gets deep remorse Allah is most forgiving she has to have full and complete trust in Allah and she has to go on with the marriage and with the grace of Allah Allah will make her marriage blessed from Islamic nest in Malaysia what if you see a beautiful girl and want to propose her but feel fear and cannot speak to her how to propose in their condition you don't don't propose to her first of all second of all do not I repeat do not approach a girl even if you want to marry her and sisters if someone comes to you when you're in college waiting in the street where you're in the office and says Salam alaikum I appreciate your hijab and you I would you want to marry you but I don't know your father's name so I have can I have your name your email your phone number and your father's address and you think that oh he wants to marry me okay here is my card this is Haram don't take yourself to that low level respect yourself you're a Muslim girl you are dignified you have your honor and pride don't sell yourself cheap don't talk to anyone who comes and proposes to you he if he wants to know where you live he will find if he wants to know who you are he will find it but 99.9% this is exactly like the collections in an Arab world always 99.9% day everybody's elected 99.9% in your case this man is playing with you so don't ever respond or answer him if you sincere and you want to get married to this girl you have to find a way to know her family and propose to her if this is your question the hadith it's it's a woman may be married for four reasons does it say it is okay to marry for four reasons people use it as a delay to ignore the fourth reason that is virtue no one says that marrying a woman for her beauty is Haram if I want to that is that is why it's permissible for me to marry a Christian there's no religion at all she's covered but it's permissible for me if I find someone that appeals to me and I want to marry her halal with the conditions to marry a Christian woman so the hadith indicates that this is the norm not one marries for the purpose of the religion which means that is permissible to marry for other three purposes but the best is to marry for a woman who is or where the woman will who's practicing the question remodeling the question says I am going to get married by seeing a spouse in a photo and by meeting the spouse with the valley what sort of questions should I ask while meeting the spouse to evaluate the spouse in to I lit the mouse in the scale of teen and whether she will be compatible for me first question would be is your photo touched by Photoshop or not I do not at all advise the issue of sending photos this is completely unacceptable because the photo can be circulated you know she comes to me she sends me an email this is my photo mmm nice send it to my friends it can be lost it can be so this is not and so many times a photograph is misleading I see a woman's photograph as a good Buddhist this it's not human and if you see her in real life how much is extremely beautiful and the opposite you see a photo some some men some women are photogenic they call it when you see a photo Masha Allah and when you see it and very like well it's so it is misleading and it is unassuming now you have another alternative hamdulillah if the Guardian is there you can use Skype so if you're really interested in getting married you can use Skype and she talks to you you can talk to her you can have a sense of how she really looks what are the questions to ask to know if she is really practicing or not the sky is the limit but remember when you propose to someone this is not an interrogation so one of the brothers came to marry a girl proposed to her in the engagement the father told me that when he came to see his daughter he was with them the father the guy says after saying salaam-o-alaikum and the girl came she sat down you know girls bashful and shy the man did this miss Miller of murder him de la tercera murders will the question one and the father thing and the guy asked about 15 questions saying why did you go to school okay if an incident you saw this and that what will you react what kind of interview is this he is going to propose and the girl the poor girl is is like in high school do I have multiple questions can I have a choice between two so no no you have to answer this this is not the way how to evaluate your future spouse you have to investigate it's the interview if you interview me I have the skill to convince you in five minutes all right there are people that are very good in interviewing they know how to dodge questions in the know in a way diplomatic with the grace of Allah I have this talent whenever I'm interviewed I always get high marks impress the people in front of me and make them you know ah is the man and I don't know anything there are people who are not like this who are very experienced very good but in interviews I don't know maybe and they come out of the interview yeah I did a mistake well I didn't know how I so an interview is misleading before the marriage you have to do your homework a man comes to propose to my daughter I see the man I meet the man but before I meet him I have a list of questions that I have to answer so I have to see the imam of the masjid where he prays I asked the Imam I asked them I didn't how do you think of the of the boy this is mashallah I praised in the first row this is not enough has he ever fought with anyone in the Masjid is his voice loud does he shout does he hold the grudge no okay I go ask his friends in at school or in the workplace how is he masha'allah every his friends what will they say horse is good diesel I said this is not what I want question one is he generous or not not that much but yes he's not stingy ok acceptable Hamlet I don't want him to spend his money but they don't want him to be stingy question number two does he argue and nag no ok good question number three does he ever fight is he usually in a state of rage is it easy for him to be in Timnath intimidated provoked some people are always tensed sensitive if you say something they take a position this is not a very good person to live with so they say no marshal all these are ok let's have the meeting he comes and I interview him talk to me because as a share I talk a lot and when someone proposing I'm the one who's doing the talking notes you talk and I ask few questions and I listened to him and I assess his personality third-stage he visits me and my daughter comes and I sit in between why so that when I talk to him she has room to look at him and when I talk to her he can look at her without being shy that I'm watching but if I put them in front no one will look they will look at me so this is what I do after the half an hour forty minutes they go following day huh my sister my daughter how do you feel she she laughs and she looks at the ground ok they call the same day or the following day her her mother calls my wife and she says the boys is hooked so can we come and propose officially I said you come and everything goes quick so to the sister who's a sister or brother he was a brother no because he said the spouse and her Wally see brother he's a brother that's why it's good to two studies or sooner truck it makes you correct things so I asked a brother for you to ask how can I know you cannot you have to investigate you have to ask the people the friends where she works where she studies and then seek Allah's guidance and find out a way and may Allah make it easy upon all of us before we whine I mean Sharon is one last question from sister's side I think she wants to ask directly we'll have the question now I have a question there's one sister whom I know who's willing to marry a religious person even she's also religious at home Villa please so I come from Saudi Arabia my English is not very good so speak slowly so that I can understand you I'm too old for this you know a sister who is wanting to marry a religious person but is okay and she is also religious and hamdulillah and she's got many proposals from boys who are early who say who say they're religious they fast they pray they pray they do not go to any graves and all but when when they look when you look at their way of dressing their appearance they don't have beards they wear their pants below the ankles maybe when we ask them and we talk to them they say they have loans they take loans from banks on interest so is it acceptable to get married to somebody who's like that or we just have to look for the right talk either like if they just pray to Allah alone they don't you know they they say that they don't go to any graves and all Greg they don't go to any greater they don't do any grave worship they don't do any better but still they do all this that is they don't have a proper appearance is it ok to get married to them or do we still have to look for a person who you know is a question the problem is that to answer this question it's not one plus one equals two it's not easy because it has many factors that govern the answer among them one the profit area so sir I'm told us if a man with two qualities comes to you you should give him in marriage what are these qualities we will come to this in Sharma in the second session his luck and his religious practicing so these are two criterias now you're telling me that this is a practicing is a religious brother but his dress his pants are below the ankles he's shaved he doesn't do that what kind of practicing is this he's a Muslim he's not a practicing he's not religious now if you tell me that he has good heart either 90% of the Muslims have good nikita's you don't to go to Darger's they don't worship a graves but they're not practicing so among the factors that answer this question is the level of the sister herself if I if you tell me that the sister is really practicing she has this long build meaning Yanni she is Masha Allah this she is 100% practicing hijab niqab she doesn't listen to music she doesn't watch movies she doesn't mix with the opposite opposite sex she does not she prays night prayer she past Mondays and Thursdays she attend helices Michailidis is a perfect muslimah and someone like this proposes to her definitely say no completely you choose someone who is like you or above you never choose someone who's below you but if she says I am religious but I listen to music and I have posters of Shahrukh Khan in my room and I go to mixed marriages and I don't wear the niqab but I went this high job and sometimes my hair comes a little bit I wear make a nail polish when I go outside that may put some makeup I do but I'm religious if she's like this I would say yes if a brother proposes to her who has good a flaw and this level of Iman okay but if she is not no don't take anyone who is below you take especially if you're a woman why because man is more superior you will drag you down and life is extremely I know - I hope they're not watching two ladies in in Jeddah who are Diaries big big tires students of knowledge they usually call me and you know take my advice ask me about this and masha'Allah and I know their husbands and their husbands are completely not practicing well shaving those brave off and on in the Masjid and they are living in hell that fifty years old the women 52 years old and they're complaining but can they do anything better no this is how they of course when they get married they were not practicing now they're students of knowledge you know they're attended their circle is attended by hundreds of women yet what can they do and you look at them they are suffering with their children because the children are not practicing due to the influence of the father so choose someone who's like you or better than you and then you will have insha'Allah a better life Allah who knows best yes you just know said about the week-long marriage celebrations and if it happened to be your own brother should I have attend the marriage or better to be away from that yes yes no no attend one party that is it Hoss Shambala one night first night anything I believe that you have to draw the line explain it to the people with a big smile apologize to them and tell them that I cannot attend such customs that go against the Islam we have to draw the line and I'll give you example as we stated before marriage and death are similar we have a practice in Saudi Arabia that if someone dies we put lights outside the house we put chairs and people come between mother in Benicia to give their condolences and usually we have someone to recite the Quran or a cassette player playing the Quran it's a ritual and once the Quran is is over the people stand up and they come to the family of the deceased and they give them their any condolences allah awj Ericom may Allah forgive your disease and they leave this is Abaddon do you have it here you don't have it what happens if someone dies o Thursday they will give a party yes hon Allah we have the first and second and third day and after Asia every night food and sheep and rice is given away to those who came to give their condolences so it's three night free dinner this is Haram and its elevation but every single one is doing it especially in the Western Province in Mecca Medina and jinda now when my uncle died he was about 85 years old 90 years old and he died last year I washed him took his funeral parade and buried him and I'm his nephew I'm the closest one of the closest relatives the three nights of mourning I did not attend I did not even reach the house and everybody was saying what is this what is this this is not right this is not correct I could care less because I've appointed out to them I did the most difficult thing to do which is the Proceedings of the funeral of preparation of the funeral now my mother may Allah bless her soul she's about 90 years old I told her this and she agreed completely that if she dies we will not do any of this thing and she lives with me and I told them the same thing if I die not a single chair to be put no lights you don't open the house for a reception if someone comes to the house to give the condolences no problem don't give them tea don't give them coffee unless it's for hospitality but it is not a place of gathering because jerry-rigged Nagila he'll be jolly may Allah be pleased with him said in the authentic hadith we the companions of the prophet Sam used to consider gathering for mourning and making food for the people kind of weeping and wailing kind of Nia huh which is one of the major sins in Islam so they never did this they used to avoid doing this so we have to hang the bell but we don't hang the bell by forcing people by making us Islam unpleasant to them we have to do it diplomatically with a smile try to convince them if there could not convince well we tell them when I I respect your opinion Europe should respect mine as well instead of getting doing it in a harsh and hard way and Allah so generous"
