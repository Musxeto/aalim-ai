  "transcript": "do I have to fast the six days of shewhart in a row that says no you can break them one day here one day there one day in the middle one day at the end which means that you have the option even to combine the intention of six days of Shawwal with voluntary fasts so if I select too fast Mondays and Thursdays with the intention of the six days of Showa you get two birds with one stone if I intend to fast the white day's 13th 14th and 15th of Shaban with the intention of the six days of Shawwal this is no problem"
