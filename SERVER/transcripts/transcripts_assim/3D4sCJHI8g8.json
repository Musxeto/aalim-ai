  "transcript": "Hamza from Bosnia Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh, if someone asks us to do something and we accept it, especially if it's a family member, they want us to drive them somewhere or to do something for them, and we accept it and tell them that we would do it for them. But after we accept it and promise to do it for them, we find out that they would actually be doing something haram. What should we do in that case? It is not permissible for you to assist them or collaborate with them on haram. Even if you promised them and told them or gave them your word that you will do it, because this is sinful. So you have to, number one, not do it. Regardless of the consequences. Number two, you have to explain to them that, listen, I wanted to do something for you, but because it was haram, I could not do this anymore. I'm willing to do anything else that is halal, just to please you and to compensate for that. And I hope this would be a win-win inshaAllah."
