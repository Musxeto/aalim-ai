  "title": "Was the Universe created for Prophet salla Allahu alaihi wa sallam? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "liber says why did Allah create this whole universe many people claim if there would not be the prophet re salat wa salam there might not be this universe everything has been created for him so lala haria Selim and out of love for him so Allah Allah what's the actual reason for this well this is what some deviant cults claim and the Christians claim that God created the whole universe for the sake of Jesus and another cult claims that this universe was created for the love of so-and-so whom they follow so as Muslims let's not look into other religions let's focus on our religion if we can learn our religion as it was revealed to our prophet Allister so now we are in good hands so let us read the Quran those who claim that Allah created the universe for the profit erase salat wa salam do they accept the Quran to be the judge between them and us if they say yes alhamdulillah if they say no then there is LOM is doubtful because no one refuses the Quran to be the judge except the kafirs or the hypocrites so what does Allah Azza WA JAL say in Surat as there yet chapter 50 I think Allah Azza WA JAL says wa ma khalaqtu l-jinna well insa illa li abuddin i have not created the jinn and the humans except for the sole purpose of worshipping me so Allah Azza WA JAL created this vast universe and specifically created the jinn and the humans to worship Him who should I believe I claim from nowhere that Allah created everything for the sake of the Prophet Alisal asana or the poor and that states in black and white that the purpose of the creation of the jinn and the humans is to worship Allah the Almighty definitely these people who go to such extremes are not adding any value to Islam on the contrary they are undermining it again this serves the plans and strategies of the enemies of Islam you want to attack Islam undermine the infrastructure by infiltrating the Muslims by inserting weird ideas corrupt ideologies disturbing there are tidak throwing left right and center fabricated hadith that has no origin and make them think and believe in things that are not related to Islam yet the value of their belief in such things that are not related to Islam far exceeds everything else in Islam so by throwing one birthday party for the Prophet Alakazam throughout the year this raises all of your previous sins even if you don't pray even if you did not fast Ramadan no problem just celebrate his mullet this is how they undermine your religion and this is part of it and our struggle is to educate Muslims to bring to them the Quran and the Sunnah to bring to them the Quran and the authentication which you and I can understand this is the religion of Allah you don't need a priest or a clergyman you don't need someone with authority to tell you and explain to you what is easy to understand by laymen yes there is a 5% or a 10% of Islam that requires high intellect that requires explanation and this is where a lot ELLs us twice in the Koran fest LOL a vicar asked the people of the scriptures or the people of the knot of knowledge if you do not know so that it can be explained to you but everything else is crystal clear someone comes to me and say hey inspire in prayer don't put your hands on your chest put them on your forehead why is it it's higher it's better said okay give me the evidence Quran and he said Sheikh so-and-so said so-and-so I could care less the chef is not someone who has been descended from heaven to teach us he's not a messenger he's not a companion he's a regular Joe so if he does not back up what he's claiming from the Quran - and then whatever he says is rejected no one can play with Allah's religion that was revealed 15 centuries ago and will remain as it is till the day of judgment no person no individual no entity no organization can come and say by the way in toxicants at the time of the Prophet a son were Haram because people used to get wasted and do hideous things nowadays it's controllable so it's okay this is nonsense the religion is the same and will remain the same"
