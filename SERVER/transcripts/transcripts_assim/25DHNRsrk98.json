  "transcript": "Halima from France Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Walaikumussalam Yes Sir, I would like to know if it is permissible for me to say the Zikr of Allah while defecating or urinating outside the toilet? Like I'm not inside the toilet but I'm urinating for example outside the toilet. Am I allowed to say the Zikr of Allah during that time Sir? So when a person is answering the call of nature, it is totally inappropriate to make Zikr verbally and move your lips while doing this because this is haram. Of course we all know that answering the call of nature when it's harmful to people is haram and prohibited. So I hope this answers your question. Thank you."
