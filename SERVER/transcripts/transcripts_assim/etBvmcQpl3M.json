  "transcript": "questions regarding the beard is a compulsory in the middle the beard growing the beard is it is compulsory not to grow it just to leave it so if it doesn't grow you don't have to put any fertilizers and have it grow just leave it the Prophet told you Salam leave it and it is mandatory to grow beards otherwise I would have been the first to shave it as for the length it's an issue of dispute among scholars some scholars say that you have to leave it as it is others follow the companions opinions in the sense that it can be shortened providing it exceeds a fist length and you shorten it from the bottom not from the top like a lot of the brothers may me do I follow the opinion that says no you have to leave it as it is and not touch it unless it becomes harmful so anything that becomes harmful it is permissible for you to remove the harmful bit so if it is so long to the extent that it annoys you when you eat and it sometimes you just mitten make them steak and eat your beard because no no this is serious guys I know I have one of my brother's like this and he is he loves the Sunnah so much it kills him and he says I can't whatever I Drive it you know the beard comes into my face and people thinks that his Superman is with this cape going behind him this is a reality so if it's this extent and you have your hearts filled with love to the Sunnah that I believe that it is permissible for you to shorten it to an extent that it does not annoy you but if not you have to keep it and not touch it and Allah knows whistles sorry if I could carry on with it so what is the hook among those who shave it completely their sinful it's like any other sin definitely not Catherine so if you're asking about this it's a sin the consensus of the four schools of thought that we all follow states that it is forbidden to shave they differ on shortening shaving using a razor blade is haram and so kawaiiiii I find it difficult to imagine where these people are coming from I know it's you know majority rules and when you see everybody's clean-shaven I'd like to be like them I'd like to you know blend in and and join the flock I don't want to you know stick out as in Wu it doesn't look nice but so panel I always thought of it in reverse engineering if a lot were to tell us to shave our beards every single morning what would the people do oh it's difficult you have subhanAllah every single morning I'd like to skip it I'd like to do this and when Allah tells you just leave it you know save that the the the created the v-system morning the shaving foam saved the gillette two blades three blades six plays I don't know where there there's a terrorism company with so many blades shave the aftershaves that burns your your Sheikh why use it so Allies is exempting you from all this trouble but people still insist in Allah knows best"
