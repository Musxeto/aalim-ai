  "transcript": "oh oh ah we're still studying the times of salat times of prayer last time we did not have time so for another time brother father will read us hadith number 136 all right okay uh narrated by abu sayyid may allah be pleased with him i heard allah's messenger salallahu saying no salat meaning prayer is to be offered after the morning prayer until the sun rises or after the afternoon prayer until the sun sets and in the narration of muslim there is no salah prayer after the fajr morning prayer all of the name are narrated there is no narrative there are three times at which allah's messenger used to forbid us to pray or bury our dead when the sun begins to rise that's fully up when the sun is at at its height at midday till it passes the meridian and when the sun draws near to setting till it sets okay if you recall last time we talked about this hadith we said that hadith talks about two general times with a long span time span between them and ahmad ahmed talks about three specific times that are very short and not that long and to sum things up it's very easy to make them into three times that is after us a prayer until the sun sets completely we have here two times after as a prayer until the sun begins to sit and from the moment it begins to sit until it disappears completely so these are two times the last time that the latter one is the latter period is extremely forbidden to be prayed in because this is the time where the non-muslims prostrate to it those who associate others with allah whether they're devil worshippers or whatever so this is one time the second time is when after a person prays fajr until the sun rises and just before it rises this is one time when it rise it begins to rise until it's completely risen this is the second time and it's about five to ten minutes so these are two times actually there are four and two and the last one as in hadith when the sun is exactly in the middle of the sky which is about five to ten minutes before the adhan and when is the adhan called for lahore rushdie it's not written pardon me when does the adhan is called what is it called when the sun when the when the sun sun rise when the shadow is yes same with the no nor uh when when a cedar is as i said little to two meridian yes and no abu malik when the sun is beginning to turn to west yeah the middle point okay when the sun starts to head towards the west and the object begins to have a shadow this is called zawal lohur prayer is indicated by this short shadow as you remember when fazure is called and sun rises the shadow comes from the west towards the east and it decreases as the sun rises and the minute the sun is in the middle of the sun in the middle of sky when the object has no shadow it's forbidden for us to pray until it's called the doha is called though her prayer is called and when does the prayer the time of the prayer begins is when the sun sets to the west a bit and the object begins to have a shadow pointing eastwards this is the time for the prayer so we have three times if you look at it in a general way or we have five times these times is forbidden for us to pray the question is brother mustafa it's forbidden for us to pray all kinds of prayer volunteer prayers only voluntary prayers only because obligatory prayer you can pray them any time of the day or night there are no restrictions none whatsoever for you to refrain from praying now we come to these hadiths scholars have different opinions as usual because some of them say well when it tells us not to pray this is not because it's forbidden no because it's not recommended but if you pray then it's okay some scholars say this other scholars say well it's forbidden because the prophet tells us not to do it so some scholars say you do not pray any type of prayers at all and this is one of one of the schools that does this are the hanafi school also the maliki school and that is why if you see a person that follows the school of malik may allah have mercy on him you would find him coming before mahdi prayer and sitting down immediately without praying anything without offering anything and also the followers of abu hanifa they would do the same thing so others say no you may pray and if you look at it you would find that you are stuck between a rock and a hard place because on one hand you have the prophet saying do not pray during these five times and on the other hand i come into the mosque after ask a prayer i'd like to sit down until it's married i would like to read quran i want to sit down but i remember that the prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam said that whoever enters a mosque must not sit down until he prays to raqqa so what do i do again we have a conflict that appears to be conflict in the here between two hadiths and if you recall we have set four stages four steps for us to follow whenever there is a dispute or a conflict between two hadiths one we join if we cannot we look for a hadith or the one that obligated the other if we cannot we try to uh uh determine which one is stronger or more authentic if we cannot we just wait until another scholar comes in and allah gave him knowledge seki have a question yes i have some story that i got in my home someone prayed after prayer and then after praying he prayed again two rokad and then after praying i asked him what kind of praying you you do you did you do after that after a moment he said to me i pray to rock out to my brother who has died it is it is uh include to the sunnah prayer or maybe well what this gentleman did was wrong in two ways one he offered voluntary prayer after assad and this is not permissible the prophet saws allah said is forbidden two he offered a prayer to the to a dead person and scholars say that no one can offer prayer on behalf of a dead person of course not even on behalf of a living person because prayer is an individual form of worship it's different than paying charity sadaqah and it's different than performing umrah or hajj because you can do this you can give your hajj to someone else so if i have a grandfather that is dead i would say okay this year's hajj for my grandfather and before i set off for hajj i say allah and my grandfather this hajj is for my grandfather but prayer cannot be uh there's no transaction in prayer or you cannot draft a prayer and and give it to someone else this is not acceptable so he did two mistakes one and two coming back to our hadith coming back to our dilemma this guy who came into the mosque and does not know what to do what do you guys think should he sit down without praying and then he would have not followed the second hadith of the prophet salallahu or should he pray and then he would have prayed in the time of nahi the time where he was not supposed to pray as mentioned in the five times what do you do do you think mustafa i think he should not pray he should not pray because the prophet says that these are times of nahi and should he sit down yes okay rushdie i think i have the same opinion with brother mustafa it's better left because it's the time is for a bit i mean okay well i assume he should pray because this and the other hadith you know these are talking about certain prayers this takes the spirit out of these ones you know what you say so you're trying to join both hadiths instead of neglecting one exactly of them brother zeki yes i think he could he could pray he could or he should he should pray pray so we have two e's and two knees uh okay we have we're looking for elbows now fadi i think this is an exception when he entered the mosque he could not he's not allowed to sit therefore he should pray and this is like a type of obligation to not praying not obligation specializing a general thing nor exactly i think you should pray you think you should pray what what school are you following shafi yes like all indonesians you are all shafi school and this is an issue of dispute among scholars and each one has his own chunk of evidence which is authentic which is considered to be authentic and correct and depends how you look at it and the first thing that we should put in mind is that always allow those who differ with you in opinion to have room of thinking so it's not always that what i think is the ultimate and it's the best and what you think is wrong there has to be common ground i see it this way and i have the evidence that backs it up you see it differently and you have the of the evidence that backs it up we're all doing the right thing so there's no need for us to fight over it especially in lots of things that differences among us is is possible and probable uh before going to details i think we have a short break so stay tuned in this program insha allah will be discussing the major sins in islam the way that the prophet muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam why the neighbor does not care about their neighbor anymore why does the father does not care about the son anymore why does the mother does not care about her daughter anymore there's major sense that we need to be very far away in our lives so we could get and give the pleasure of allah subhanahu wa ta'ala obtain the pleasure of allah and salvation as long as we commit those major sins allah subhanahu wa ta'ala would not as when we commit those sins especially those major sins remember you are displeasing your lord and you are bringing upon the curse and the anger of your lord uh and welcome back just before the break we had an interesting survey regarding that if a person enters the masjid the mosque just after assa prayer and he has prayed asar and he would like to sit down and recite the quran so what would he do would he pray to raqqa the salute of the message as it's called among scholars so that he can sit or would he sit without praying and in both cases he would have done something that seems to be conflicting with the hadith or the other of the prophet we have split decision here and thank god we don't have to refer to the golden goal and we just move on and mention what the scholars said about this issue one al-imam shafi may allah be pleased with him and have mercy on his soul said that if you look at all the hadiths see this is the job of a fakie this is the job of a scholar that works and deals with jurispudent he should look into all evidence not on only to one because because if you limit yourself to one there are many others that have exceptions and exemptions and so on and you would lose a lot so a chavez says that after looking at all the evidence we can say that it is prohibited for a muslim to pray during these five times that we've mentioned before after assad until the sun sets after fajr until the sun rises and during midday when the sun is exactly in the middle of the sky he says but there are exceptions with the exception of things that have a reason so it is prohibited for us to pray if it's voluntarily general forms of prayer what are you doing um i don't have anything to do so i'm just going to pray no sit down it's forbidden it's the time now it's forbidden for you to pray and there's another different form of prayers and and that is the prayers that have a reason behind them and he called it the asbab the the prayers with a reason for example we prayed asar and just as we prayed asar and we finished praying they brought a funeral and we have to pray the prayer of the funeral of the dead so one says um as a prayer we can't pray until it sunsets we cannot pray until sun the sun sets so what do you think leave the guy lying there for three four hours and not pray or shall we pray the answer is we should pray then how would we say that do not pray after asar this is exempted because this has a reason this has a cause another example you enter the mosque you pray as a prayer and just as you finish asar there's an eclipse of the sun and i don't know if it's possible to have the sun eclipse after us or but you have to ask those that deal with the stars let's assume so what do we do we pray the prayer of eclipse why because it is a time for it it's being called for and likewise if i i'm going to engage i'm going to propose to a woman after assa prayer the sunnis to make istikhara is a prayer with supplication requesting allah to choose for you and to support you if it's good for you and to distract you away from it if it's bad for you so i have to propose i hope my wife is not watching again i am going to propose after assa prayer but i did not perform stihara and my meeting with them is at five o'clock so should i go without making a sahara and then find myself in real bad trouble because i didn't seek allah's support or should i pray scholars say go ahead and pray because this has a legitimate reason it's not voluntary prayer it's not something a preferred prayer you're doing you're just offering without any reason and this is the choice of ibrahim islam even the choice of sheikh abdullah as he's been with them and all the authentic and strong scholars knowledgeable scholars of islam they say that this way we combine all evidence together without neglecting this one or that one it's all combined and it's all uh uh joined in one category brother mustafa you have a question so that will exclude for example if i missed the sunnah of fajr can i pray it after the fetch directly or do i have to this is different because there's a hadith that states it's okay so we don't have to you know imagine things there's a hadith the prophet salallahu finished one day he finished fajr prayer and then saw one of his companions praying next to a pillar praying to raka so he came and stood beside him and said angrily what the guy was praying is fajr and he kept on repeating it the guy finished prayer quickly he said oh prophet of allah i ask allah for forgiveness i left my house without praying the sunnah and i came into the masjid while you were praying in the congregation so i joined you and immediately after you finished i came to pray the torah of sunnah that i was supposed to pray before but i couldn't but i was late so the prophet sallam did not say a word and this is one type of sunnah there are four types of sunnah let's try and brainstorm it the first type of sunnah who knows it saying by words words if the the prophet says something this is sunnah the second type of sunnah action by action by action so if the prophet does something this is sunnah because he did it so we do it afterwards third form of sunnah statement is what's already mentioned first step which is words if he if he refuses to answer approvals approval so in this case here the companion said something and the prophet did not say anything which meant that he approved it otherwise the prophet would have said no don't do it again so by not saying anything this becomes a sunnah approval and the fourth and last sunnah is the sahaba it says something from sunnah well this is again either considered by deeds or approvals because for example hadith we used to well i don't want to translate this uh they used to do something at the time of the prophet while the quran was revealed and the prophet did not deny them from doing it so this is an approval no the fourth type of sunnah is the description of the prophet allah so when one of the companions say that the prophet was this high he was this big his eyes were this uh a form his fingers were this and or that he used to wear this and that this is called describing the prophet coming back again you have to catch up with me because so many times i talk and i forget what brought me to this uh issue so remind me what brought me to this issue nevertheless you yes we're talking about the times you're allowed to pray during the night okay so this is the verdict of the scholars that you are allowed to pray in the times that you're not allowed to pray depending that the prayer has a legitimate reason a legitimate cause of it one thing i'd like to point out for you is that the the time may span and may be short now it's forbidden for us to pray after us the sun sets now does this mean it's forbidden for me to pray from five o'clock until eight o'clock which is from azer to maghrib no it can be shortened in the case if a person did not pray asar yet so if a person prays answer at six o'clock though people have prayed and gone home he can pray as long as he has not prayed i believe that this is understood and again if you reverse this if a person is traveling and he proceeded as a prayer and prayed it with so aloha is called at one o'clock he prayed for and he prayed for raqqa of asur or because he's traveling he prayed two and two so he prayed two raka then he prayed turaka of asar and the time is still one o'clock and the call for asur has not been called yet so if the guy came to the mosque at two o'clock and said well let me pray nephil i just want to pray voluntary prayer is this allowed it's two o'clock the call for asar has not been called yet yes is this allowed for him in truffle in truffling no no he went into the mosque now now he prayed us and at two o'clock he went to a mosque while he was traveling and he thought that as might as well sit and rest for about half an hour and pray shouldn't have a luxury prayer for about half an hour then continue to travel is it permissible for him to pray yes yes rusty christie i think yes or no yes yes yes no well we got four uh opposing two and unfortunately two leads the way he is not allowed to pray now if you look again at the hadith we've studied the prophet says that it's forbidden for you to pray after assad until the sun sets you as a traveler traveler did you pray sir yes you prayed asar but you prayed it at one o'clock because you have the option to precede the prayer so now it is for you forbidden to be to pray voluntary prayer though the call for assad has not been called because for you individually the prophet tells you that it is not permissible for you to pray until the sun sets so as i said it is individual basis it's quite can be quite uh long on and also on individual basis can be quite short depending if you did not pray answer you can do this we have like uh 55 seconds okay what if someone for for any reason forgot the frederick prayer in the same case forgot the son of the first prayer and the prophet he never left the son of the fridge when he was traveling and he came in this time between us can he enter the mosque and pray the son of the fetch that he had left earlier before he left the country or the his his town in this case there is a hadith narrated by um where the prophet sallallahu sallam used to pray two raka's of sunnah after asar so she asked him now you said that we should not pray how come you prayed he said well i was engaged with some delegation that came to visit me and i could not make it i could not make pray the sunnah so he prayed it so she asked can we pray it the prophet said no you cannot so this answers your question you have to delay it after words uh i'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program i think there are a few issues here and there we shall be able to continue it when we meet next time until then allah"
