dear brothers and sisters in islam assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wa barakato and welcome to this new session on Islamic fit I hope before we start the class that the vast majority of you have registered in the website and participated in the quizzes they sent because as stated before that there will be prizes insha'Allah and this would add value to you in terms of fixing the knowledge itself to maintain it with the grace of Allah so we begin in to studying the fit now if you look at the vast majority if not all books of fit you will find that it begins usually with chapters dealing with water vessels that carry the water and whether it is pure or Naji's halal to use or Haram it deals with adjacent impurities and it deals with mainly ruble why is so much emphasis placed on these things scholars say that the first thing a person will be held accountable on the day of judgment is his prayer so if his prayer is valid then all of the rest of his good would be valid and if not they're not and this is why they put a lot of emphasis on prayer and anything related to prayer because if Allah would not accept your good deeds as this is dependent on the validity of your prayer in this case prayer has a great importance in our lives and hence we should take care of it when we study fact we should give it a priority but by default your prayer is invalid unless it fulfils the conditions what conditions are there there is the condition of purity there is a condition of the time is due the direction of the Qibla covering the our different conditions so when it comes to purity Woodill is what first comes to mind yet the scholars differentiate between two things in purity so when they give the definition of purity of Pajaro to a referral hadith e.y email total ha bethey it even rhymes purity is the uplifting of the ritual impurity which is either done by wouldl or also we have minor impurity major impurity hadith and and this is second half removing of the impurities that there are physical so for instance your prayer is invalid if you know that there is an impurity substance on your body or on your clothes or on the spot you are praying on half of the purity is not there which is in a total habit and the first half which is uplifting the ritual impurity with a minor or major the minor deals with Moodle which we will talk about Asha Allah hopefully today maybe on coming sessions what is will see the state you're in is either you are on a ritual purity or not okay go on so that I can follow when you perform would you are in the state of major and minor ritual impurity which means that you can pray now I'm not going to go into the major ritual impurity which is known to be the state of cover to some scholars and a state of janaba resulting from sexual intercourse or discharge of semen or the state of a woman being in her menses or postnatal bleeding all of those are in the state of ritual major ritual impurity which means that they cannot pray they cannot enter the Masjid unless they're passing by they cannot hold the most half they cannot recite the Quran among other things and this is uplifted by having ocean and we will come to that later on my concern our concern today is with the issue of uplifting the minor ritual impurity okay share what is this ritual impurity caused of we will come to that in sha allah in a while but this ritual impurity does not show physically so now you cannot know if I am in the set of wood or not this is something between me and a larger version it is not something that you put me on the scale and you say okay here's on Moodle or you say nope he has to go and make wudu this is something that no one can detect it's a ritual thing so in order to pray you have to be in the state of Woodill otherwise your prayer is invalid so what does Waddell linguistically means you'll find in the textbook and not everything in the textbook is a hundred percent proof because this is not the Quran only the Koran is 100 percent accurate and that does not accept any error but human effort you have to have discrepancies shortcomings wrong things here or there but minut and this is what we are doing studying the book so that we have a reference at at the same time taking notes if there is something wrong why is it wrong where did it come from to the best of our ability and to the time insha'Allah that is allocated to us okay so linguistically speaking Woodill is derived from the root that can connotes good looking cleanliness and brightness in arabic oh children Wadley meaning that he is illuminating not that we if we turn off the lights that he would shine but rather he is bright he something comes out of him and he looks masha'Allah positive this is what the well he is also describing someone who's beautiful who's handsome linguistically it is the use of water in respect of for organs the face arms head and feet in a particular way defined by Islam with the intention of worship so if you do the acts of Woodill that we usually do but you do not intend that it is will do you're just doing it as a habit as an exercise for any other reason this doesn't count it has to have the intention of worshiping Allah Azza WA JAL now where does waddle actually come from well this is clear in chapter 5 verse 6 in Surat al-ma'idah ya Ujala Dena Amano EDA Compton Ella sowlaty fallacy Luger hakama idea communal Marathi p.m. Sahib you see kumar jha kamila capping the ayah so it clearly states o you who believe whenever you want to pray then you have to wash your faces your hands till your elbows wipe over your heads and wash your feet so this is in the Quran also in hadith of Earth man evening a fan may Allah be pleased with him he described how the Prophet also Sam used to perform the Woodill so we know that this is the consensus of all scholars upon it no one ever differed among the Muslims saying oh no no no water is not mandatory no this is something recommended or this is an innovation no one dares to say this because all Muslims agree upon this fact Woodill is the means of purification if you were to come and look into the good sides of it it is sufficient to know that when you perform will do all your sins drain out from your body so anything you looked at with your eyes or heard with your ears once you wash your face it drips there is the sense it drips with the last drop of water coming out from your face likewise what if you had done something with your hands if you had done something with your feet it all drains away and out of your body because of woudl and there are so many virtues of although this is not the time to go through them so what are the requirements for performing Woodill the textbook we have says in order for the ablution to be valid it must comply with the following requirements number one belief in Islam sanity and sense of discrimination these are known to be the conditions for being accountable so usually you'll find these conditions in the very beginning of every single act of worship you have to be Muslim you cannot fast if you're not Muslim not the ability or the physical ability rather it would not be accepted from you so fasting it requires that you are a Muslim if someone who's insane fasts this is not permissible because he's not considered to be saying and if someone does not have the sense of discrimination this is a rough translation to being able to distinguish right from wrong so for example a woman takes an uber and she has a two-year-old child and she says that this child breaks the seclusion with the driver of my uber we say no this is not true because this child does not have the sense of discrimination he cannot say or tell whether the driver is hitting on you or not but if the child is eight years of age nine years of age though he's not an adult yet yet he is aware of what's happening and he can understand what the driver is hinting to so the driver would most likely be afraid to say anything because there is someone who is listening and aware of what he is trying to do so these are the three conditions that are always required in any form of worship so a child who is beyond or below the sense of discrimination age if he's five years of age six years of age and wants to pray should we tell him to perform whether or not yes this is part of teaching him but yanny we would neglect if he did not wash one of his arms or other likes the second requirement is intention and the vast majority of scholars say that intention for woudl is a must because the Prophet said I some verily deeds are judged by their intention so if someone just goes to the toilet not thinking of what he wants to do or it's not a time for prayer let me give you another example it's not a time for prayer and a person goes and answers the call of nature and soon afterwards he finds himself washing his left foot and he looks in the mirror and founds it finds that he had already performed woudl now it is not time for prayer to perform model and he did not intend to perform Buddha rather it is an automatic reaction to whenever he answers the call of nature so can he pray with that what would answers no because this was not intended it's different to someone heating the event or wanting to go to the Masjid and he goes to the toilet to answer the call of nature and to make Waddell house his intention was done he doesn't say anything verbally or he doesn't need to think about it because this is what he's going to do when he already thought about it unlike our friend in the first scenario number three the requirement says it is it has to be clean water and this is not accurate see the people of Phil the scholars choose their words very carefully clean water and he defines ablution cannot be done using water that has been contaminated by impurity in this case you should have said power water or pure of from impurity water because clean does not mean it is not contaminated and dirty does not mean you cannot make Moodle up with that clean and dirty are terms that we use in our daily lives that has or that have no connection to whether I can make wudu or not so for example in some countries where they use ductile iron or some sort of metal pipes that rust if you turn the tap water in the beginning you will get yellowish water is this clean for you to drink no I'm not gonna drink this would you wash your clothes was it definitely not it's gonna stain is this permissible to perform water with that says yes so the colour has changed but not with an impurity and a Jassa like urine or feces rather it was changed due to the rust the corrosion in the pipes therefore this is not clean but you can perform well with it and likewise if we have a container of water that looks clean smells clean but you see a drop or more of urine fall into it let me avoid urine because one of the characteristics did not change with an ijazah if you have a container of water and a dog comes and drinks from it licks it so it smells good it looks good but do you know that this is definitely impure and that you cannot drink it and you cannot perform will do with it because it snatches to the folks who don't believe in Islam would say yeah but this is clean water I have no problem with my pet a dog licking it or drinking from it so I can perform although the answer is no Muslims do not do that though it is clean in your standards it is neji's in Islam's standards so the word clean water if we adjust it and change it into it has to be pure from Nagisa water that would be better insha'Allah number for removal of anything that prevents skin contact with water such as the presence of wax or dough on some spots or nail varnish so it is requirement of woudl that the organs mentioned which we will come to discussing Sharla later let me check check the recommended part yes yes it we will comment and talk about it the organs of Woodill must have no barriers between them and water so if i have paint on my hand water is invalid because the layer of paint prevents the water from reaching my skin if i have nail polish the same thing happens i cannot consider myself in the state of water because my the water did not reach my layer there was a layer and on top of it and this is a real physical layer that has a mass unlike if i have a pen and i draw a line you can see it it's blue but this does not consist a layer so when i wash this is just a color when i apply henna or muhindi on my hands although men are not allowed to do this but hypothetical and then there is no residue there is nothing solid on it except the color this color does not prevent water from reaching the skin unlike when it has a mass and a layer preventing the water from reaching the skin number 5 cleaning the private parts after discharge and I don't know what what the this has to be or to do with requirements of wood oh this is not related to Moodle that you clean yourself after defecating or urinating this is something different this is called the sinja anesthesia mod I may perform woudl afterwards I may not so this is not connected with the chapter of wood oh and hand should maybe be removed immediate progress from one action to the next and this is known as a Louisville at sea I have four organs I have to take care of washing the face washing the arms wiping over the head and washing the feet there has to be simultaneous miss when I do this I cannot wash my face and then I make a phone call and a text messages and maybe go and check the microwave and then come back and wash my arms this does not work this way because for many reasons and we will get to hopefully today to talk about this in a while insha'Allah and whether this is measured by the drying of the limbs or not because this is also an issue of confusion with a lot of the Muslims they think that in order to have immediate progress from one action to the next that you must not have any of your limbs dry so if I want to wash my feet I have to grab my foot to the sink which means that I have to with my hands hold my trousers now my hands are dry so my order is invalid because I did not have this immediate progress no no no this is a different issue altogether there's nothing wrong in drying your limbs by itself or due to the actions of woudl in hot weathers like here inside Arabia and sometimes it reaches forty seven forty eight Celsius centigrade if you performing Woodill by the time you wash your arms your face is already clean dry so what should I do this is a vicious circle should I keep on doing Moodle for the rest of my day know what is meant is by moral at is that you do not leave a gap which according to the earth which is one of the sources of legislation we discussed last time according to the out of the gap between washing your face and arms are not long so yes if I am washed my face and someone said something to me and I replied took a couple of seconds then went on with washing my arms there's no problem there was not a long gap unlike if I go and open the door and welcome the guests in and then I go back to the toilet trying to finish what I started number seven following the proper order and this is known in Arabic as a tube so the order in the Quran faces arms head feet if someone went to make wudu and he found that he washed his arms to the elbows but did not wash his face he forgot so if simply washes his face what's the big deal and he goes on to wipe over his head we say your rule is invalid and why would it it be invalid because you did not follow the order so what well if you notice that allah azzawajal mentioned two organs to be washed fallujah hakama idea come in america and the fourth organ is also to be washed what a jewel a communal kabane but in-between allah inserted an organ to be wiped over and not to be washed so had it been washing the face the arms the legs and then wiping the head then okay the order would not have been of great importance but to have two washed organs and then a fourth one separated by wiping this means that the order is intended and it is sufficient to know that the Prophet s resource and throughout his remaining life in Medina ten years had never ever gone against the order mentioned in the Quran so we have to stick to it and it is a pillar one of the pillars of Moodle as we will hopefully discuss in a while now the following section talks about mostly what we have discussed which is the obligatory part the obligatory part what are the obligatory parts in Moodle what do you mean by obligatory meaning that they are pillars of woudl so there are six we won't discuss them a lot so that we can save a little bit time but just in case first of all the first pillar is washing one's whole face as God says believers when you are about to pray wash your faces yeah you already namun read a poem Tamira Salah t-fal salut would you hakumen and the face as scholars define it is from the roots of the hair till the chin this is your chin it's not below it's this is this is the face and from the ear to the ear so a lot of the Muslims just wash this area avoiding the sideburns to the ear and not wash it the rule is invalid yep sorry to be the bearer of bad news you have to wash the whole face which is washing it from the roots of the hair entirely and this area as well because this is included so like this and you wash your face this is pillar number one hold on your horses share what do you mean pillar number one we know that what the first thing you do is wash your hands ah wrong what do you mean wrong I've been doing this all my life yeah this is not part of the Woodill this is Sunnah this is recommended if you want to do it go ahead if you don't you just go ahead by washing your face no problem seriously yeah this is what's mentioned in the Quran is a complement of salat if Alice Sydow would you welcome if you are to pray wash your faces this is the first thing to do but as soon as we will come to get to know she Allah is to clean your hands first three times before dipping it into the bucket of water and washing your face and doing the rest of the wouldl procedure number two washing one's arms up to the elbows as the relevant verse makes it clear and your hands and arms up to the elbows this is pillar number two now in pillar number one the text did not consider turning swirling the water in your mouth madaba and rinsing your nose by sniffing it up your nostrils and blowing that water which is called Alliston sha ooh well it's intolerable why is that because the author does not think it's mandatory so it is mandatory and this is the most authentic opinion of scholars so after doing that you wash your arms to the elbows which a lot of us make the common mistake chef's you are destroying me everything in my will do now you're telling me is wrong I've been worshipping Allah in the wrong way this is why we're here so what mistake were what was I doing see the vast majority of Muslims turn the faucet on and then they wash the water that their arms from the wrist up to the elbows so they do this and then they do this ok sure what's what's wrong I've been doing this all my life ah the problem is that they don't wash their hands because they are relying on the fact that they wash their hands in the very beginning of wouldl 3 times so this is wrong of course this is wrong we've said that you have to have order one of the pillars of Woodill the six pillars order so the order was not made there because they wash their faces when it came to the hands they said they washed it earlier and this doesn't count so the right way of doing it is after you wash your face you wash from your fingertips to your elbow and this would count and would be sufficient number three wiping one's head with one's wet hand and I'm not going to go into difference of opinions of schools of thought who said that one quarter of the hair is sufficient some said three hairs are sufficient others went in to know that we don't want to go into details that are not backed by evidence yes the schools of thought they may deliberate on such issues spend a lot of time giving a lot of logical comments that are not based on the Quran what does allah says in the quran wom Sahab you see come now the issue is beer ooh ooh cecum the letter back B is it to minimize the amount or is it to mean to be touching and adjacent to it's an issue of dispute we are not that interested in such issue of dispute that would confuse us just show me how to perform Moodle so the Sunnah and the vast majority of scholars say is that you put water in your hand it's not soaking wet some people wash their heads and this is wrong this is invalid the right way is to wipe and this is a concession from Allah to ease things for us because if we have to wash our heads five times a day we will definitely have sinus cold and we'll be sick all day long but Allah Allah made it easy so your hands are wet there's no no water actually being carried in them it's wet you just from the top of your head or hair you go backwards and then you come forward once that is it this is one way of doing it to those who are have normal hair or short hair what about for women who have long hair or men who have hair that is difficult to tidy up after you know disturbin so there is another hadith which is authenticated by Albani that the Prophet used to do this through those who have long hair from the top of the head you follow the roots till the end of the hair so if you have hair coming down like this you wet your hand you do this you do is you do this so you don't bring forward and backwards and this would keep your hair intact and would fulfill wiping over the head so two ways of doing it and the LA surgeon knows best number four washing one's feet up to the ankles and the ayah you know the ankles are the two bones coming out from the foot and the leg so the leg and the foot you have these two bolts on the side these are the ankles so you wash the whole foot up and the ankles level and that is it to the top level of the anchors not the bottom so you include them in washing and the hadith of evens eight also explains this so then we have number six and that is odd maybe I copied and pasted it wrongly but there should be number five so number five should be the order which we spoke about earlier and that is you have to have this order you cannot wash your arms then go to your face then go to your feet then wipe over your head you have to follow the sequence mentioned in the Quran and then by the Prophet Allah to sinner this is crystal clear but it is permissible for you to begin with your left hand arm and then wash your right wash your left foot then wash your right because this the order has been followed you've gone against the Sunnah but your rule is valid so it is the face arms head feet you have to follow the sequence but in each each level you can play around so if you wash your arm left arm first then wash your right arm afterwards this is number six can continuous progress and this means washing one organ immediately after the one before it without any delay and we spoke about this so I don't think inshallah we have to elaborate on it anymore now the author says that I commanded part and as I stated earlier I beg to differ so in the mandatory parts he did not mention swirling the water in the mouth when washing your face you swirled water first you sniff up your nostrils water and then blow it out then wash your face and he didn't also mention wiping of the ears because the Prophet him said himself I racism said the ears are from the head so this means that we must wipe over our ears with the same water used to white our heads so we wipe our heads and immediately go to the ears put the index finger inside and your a thumb outside and you wipe that's it you don't take new water for that thing so the author did not mention this and he now says that a commended part and he considers it to be Sunnah so number one saying bismillah and the vast majority of scholars say that saying bismillah is recommended but it has no impact on the validity of you would some people think that if they do not say bismillah in the beginning the rule is invalid invalid and this is not true because the hadith that backs this up is not authentic as made weak by mmm I met any ma'am Noah we and also should have been Abraham live night Amy number two it is recommended according to the author to brush once teeth and brushing meaning that using this twig miswak so it is recommended to do that during or after or before Woodill and also to do it before prayer and the Prophet had stated in an authentic hadith had I not burden had a not fear to burden my Ummah I would have instructed them to make or to use a see walk before every prayer time number 3 washing one's hands three times at the start and we address this this is a Sunnah and it's true that it is recommended to do number four rubbing one one's face to ensure that one's wet fingers go through one's thick beard now these are two different things the author has mixed two things together rubbing the organs in Woodill is a recommended Sunnah putting your wet fingers inside your beard is a recommended sin separate from that so if a person just washes his face without rubbing it this is valid yet still he has to a different Sunnah which is putting water in his palm and just getting it inside one handful of this is was the son of the Prophet Asura and this is for those who whose beard are thick those whose beard are light you can see the skin underneath washing the face suffices for them and number four yeah rubbing one's face so the issue of rubbing it is recommended for the face for the arms and for the feet but if you just dip them in water or just put them under the faucet and it covers the whole organ this the job the wood is valid it is recommended that you do the rubbing part to it number five starting with the right hand or foot and we gone through that so I will not repeat it number six washing one's face hands and feet three times and this is Sunna and this is the max see the minimum in wood o is once so I can wash my face once I can wash it twice and I can wash it maximum three times and this all was done by the Prophet Alice a lobster I can also alternate so I wash my face once and then decide to wash my arms three times and wash my feet twice no problem the same model so it doesn't have to be one one one or two two two or three three three it can be 1 3 2 up to your preference and what you wish but of course three times is the max and it is the best because it's a more purifying rinsing one's mouth we have discussed this and it is mandatory and not recommended likewise cleaning one's nose and wiping one's ears for the hadith number 10 the author says glorification after the ablution so there are a number of duaa to be said after ablution you can find this in sahih in the fortress of the Muslim of chef Psilakis Pawnee may Allah have mercy on his soul and also in sahih hadith car or psychic element ie all of this these books of a car you will find it inshallah in it and number 11 to utilize the amount of water being used so you should have a sort of economy a lot of us just opens the tap the faucet and performs Woodill in an amount that is a lot which is not according to the Sunnah which is not at all recommended in Islam the Prophet had in his salatu was-salam when he performed woudl as we are told by the hadith and when he performed also the amount he used was very negligible to the extent or to the to the amount that the Companions said he used to perform whistle with once our and he used to perform Woodill with one would and these are measurements of the size of a container so a mood is what gathers in a person's hands and if you put water definitely it's not gonna be a lot maybe 300 ml milliliter but if you put rice or dates and fill it up to the rim and then you put it in a vessel usually it's gonna be about 600 to 700 milliliters this is his wooden ass are for his oasl is for wood and this means it's about 2 liters give or take when we perform woudl we use at least 5 liters because the tap is running and this is totally wrong and not permissible I think it is time for the questions and answers I'm waiting for my admins to send us the D questions inshallah I don't see anything here so let us give them a couple of minutes and see when they will inshallah send us the questions so where are we so these are the recommended parts of the woudl the following paragraph says what"
