  "transcript": "an from Canada oh yeah so uh when I was uh once urinating in a toilet in a public washroom and uh and uh because like the toilets flush quite uh strong uh uh it automatically flushes so before I even get up it flushed uh and I and I felt sprinkles of water uh into my uh bottom and uh doubtful uh I don't know whether the urine was flushed in time before the water sprinkled into me or I got some sprinkles of urine uh so uh what should I do uh should I should I have washed the bottom uh what I essentially did is that I uh I thought that the urine has already Flushed Away before the water sprinkles back so I uh hope that it was pure so I wore my pants and I uh my underwear and just went to like pray uh is my prayer valid and uh should I have wash uh was that normal normal people first of all would not flush while they're still sitting on the toilet seat that is awkward and weird uh but if you did the problem is do you have certainty that these splashes are NES the answer is no I'm just speculating maybe it came from the toy toilet itself seat not from the water mixed with urine maybe the amount of water that came overwhelmed the urine and made that uh whole mixture uh pure because of the uh overwhelming process so the element of uncertainity is there what you've done I would assume that it was wrong you should have at least washed yourself and moved on but due to the fact that you didn't and there's no certainty I pray to Allah that this was fine but I would not advise you to do that again and Allah Knows Best"
