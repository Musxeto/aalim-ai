  "title": "What is Isbaal (letting the garment come below the ankles)?  assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Fahoor from Jordan. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaikumussalam. Is the name right? Yes, correct. Yes sir, what can I do for you? So, what is Isbaal and is it Haram or Makrooh? One question, JazakAllah Khair. Isbaal is to lower a man's garment, trousers, thawb, or whatever he's wearing on his body, below the ankles. And it is prohibited. And it ranges from a sin that is punishable in hellfire to how much is concealed of your ankle. So this is your ankle. If this much is concealed, this will be punished in hell. If this much is concealed, this would be punished in hell. If this much, the ankles with the heels to the ground, are concealed, this would be punished in hell. As per the hadith of the Prophet ﷺ, whatever goes below the ankles is punishable in hell. But if it is accompanied with arrogance and pride, then there are four more torments and punishment for that. Where the Prophet ﷺ said, there are three whom Allah does not look at them, does not speak to them, does not purify them, and will give them severe punishment on the Day of Judgment. Number one, Al-Musbil, the one who wears his garments below his ankles and Allah knows best. May Allah protect us. Ameen."
