  "transcript": "Sultan says I had taken student loan and later came to know that this is not permissible what do I do now student loans are very common in Europe and the states and they there is a government or the private sector would finance your study so for example in the UK every year they give you I think nine thousand pounds and they say that you take the his mind powers pay your tuition fees to the University the second year the third year the fourth year you graduate if you work and you your income is less than 21 thousand pounds a year then you're not obliged to pay us but if you get more than that you have to pay back the loan with interest now no doubt that this is RIBA any loan given to you with the condition of returning back with an interest is RIBA I am a third jarana fine forever and it is not halal to say that this is from the government in the form of benefits this is not benefit they're making money out of it it's not halal to go into a contract signing it and saying that yeah I know that I'm not gonna work so I'm gonna take the money and I'm not I won't be obliged to pay them and once I die they take it out or once after 25 years I think they scratch it out and it's it's not there no this is not permissible your signature on the contract allowing them to take RIBA if you get a job that is more than 21 thousand pounds a year is agreeing on a major sin and this is like someone saying listen I'll give you a hundred thousand as alone but if you fail to pay it I know I'm gonna pay it but if you fail to pay it I'll chop your hands off or I'll take your son as a slave and you say okay no problem nobody says that this contract is halal or what you're doing is the right thing to do on the contrary this is totally prohibited so now if you had taken a student loan this depends on the stage is EURion if you took it the first second third or fourth year not knowing that it was haram there's no sin on you none whatsoever because the sin is related with knowledge someone who does not know whatever he commits out of sin since he doesn't know the ruling Allah will not hold them accountable but if this is your second year already you have taken a year or two loans and you did not know now you came to know and you still have the third and the fourth year to continue and you can't continue without taking a loan can we take a third and fourth year loan the answer is no what to do well this is something you have to come up with either you borrow from Muslims and finish your third or fourth year or don't work at all see people come to a crossroad come to the fork of the road either obey allah azza wajal or we have to obey our whims and desires people come and say share I can't afford to buy a house cash so can I opt for mortgage they take X Y Z percentage every year and I have to do this this is the necessity so my leash is it ok that's just no so check what would I do what would you do pay rent till the rest of your life there's no problem in that so yeah but this is a lot and I need to keep something from my family and my children I think you want Jenna this is the road route to it this is the road to it you want Hellfire be my guest but you cannot compromise ribeyes Alam and this is not a necessity you can pay rent to the rest of your life without any problem in that at all so the same goes with your student loans if you came to know that it is haram you have to stop immediately do I have to return the money dancers yes this is a debt but return it whenever you are capable of doing this and as long as they're waiting inshallah you have no problem in that but don't go for any new loans"
