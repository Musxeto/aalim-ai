  "transcript": "I think it's Juwayriya from France. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaikumussalam. Is the name right? Yeah, it's right. Yes, what can I do for you? Sheikh, I have a sister who was indulged in sins. Now she wants to repent and get closer to Allah, but she doesn't have any background in Islam. Though she prays and fast and do all the maybe we say five pillars of Islam, but she wants to start practicing Islam correctly. She doesn't know with what she should start and begin in terms of acquiring knowledge and getting close to Allah. Can you advise, please? OK, first of all, this is a very long topic. Number one, if someone was indulged in sins and Allah guided him or her to repent to Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala. First thing to do is to fulfill the pillars of Islam. So as long as she's praying on time, she's fasting Ramadan. Then she must abandon all types of sins and reduce them, if not terminate them totally. So this is stage number two. If she manages to avoid all types of sins, she would be one of the elite. At the sight of Allah Azza wa Jal. As the Prophet said, Ittaqil Maharim Takun A'abad An-Nas Stay away from prohibited things and you will be the most righteous of all people. Number three, she should start with learning the religion and the branches and sciences of religion are so many and life is short. And one has to balance. We can't focus on one and ignore the others. So she should try to memorize portions of the Qur'an while knowing the tafsir and implementing it in her life. Number two, she should learn Aqidah issues, the basics only of Aqidah, the pillars of Islam, pillars of Iman, the pillar of Ihsan, some of the signs of the Day of Judgment, whether minor or major, because this gives her a good insight of what's going to happen. Then she should learn the basics of the forms of worship that her Islam would not be accepted and complete without knowing. So she has to know everything about Salat, how to pray, when she makes mistakes, how to rectify it, the pillars, the mandatory actions, the sunnahs. Then she has to know about fasting, about zakat and whatever is essential in her life, little by little, portions of this during the day. Within six months time to a year, she would be, inshallah, safe."
