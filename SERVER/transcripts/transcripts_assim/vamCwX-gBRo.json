  "title": "Late 2 masjid, prayer finished, call someone 2 pray 2nd congregation with me? Prohibited time? Assim",
  "transcript": "from bangladesh says if i come to a masjid and the prayer and the congregation is already over is it permissible if i don't find a second congregation to call upon one of those who had already prayed to pray with me a second congregation the answer is yes this is proven from the authentic hadith where the prophet islam once prayed fajr congregation with the companions and after they concluded the prayer a loner companion came in but there was no one else to pray with him so the prophet addressed alaihissalatusam the congregation who had just finished praying and said who would give charity to this man meaning who would go and pray with him so that both they would have a congregation bearing in mind that they've just prayed fajr which means that it is time of restricting voluntary prayers but this is exempted because it has a reason so one of the companions went and offered the prayer with him"
