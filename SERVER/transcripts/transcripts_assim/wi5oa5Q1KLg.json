  "title": "Ruling on selling halal products that have packaging of haram images (women etc) - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "storing on storing and sending um products that are itself 100 halal but are packaged in the packing that contains harm images for example women that are not covering and drawings of living creatures and etc what's wrong on that what's your zakum so the merchandise itself is halal now selling it when wrapped in paper that has images of women is it this is one of the contemporary issues that they call require a lot of contemplation unfortunately the vast majority of products have such images so if i have a supermarket or a grocery shop i cannot go and put a sticker on every item of shampoo that i'm selling because it has the face and the hair of a woman and this is not practical at all and at the same time it is not practical to tell the people close your shops you can't sell such items so generally speaking if one is forced to do that such as supermarket owners or pharmacies and they have no control over it i pray and i hope it's okay but if you are the importer the one who's importing it and you have a selection of different items that you can import and you can require or demand not to have such images i believe in this is my own opinion don't sue me for that i believe that there is nothing more worthy of assalamu and to be far away from anything that is dubious you're the the importer you're the merchant who can put an end you"
