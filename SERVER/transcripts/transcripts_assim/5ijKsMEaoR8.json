  "transcript": "[Music] oh my Creator oh Allah fulfill our AIMS in life Allah forgive our sins yeah Allah oh Allah the most gracious oh Allah the most gracious yah [Music] dear brothers and sisters in Islam yesterday we were about to talk about one of the signs of the day of the Judgment of the day of judgment the signs of the hour and this was about the suspension of jiz and alaraj and I talked briefly about the definition of these two words and jizya is the taxation taken from non-muslims living on Muslim soil and this is for their protection for them not to have to fight when there is an invasion or an attack on the Muslim soil this taxation gives them the privilege to sit home and be protected by the Muslims themselves the haraj is when they work on Muslim soil they cannot own it because this belongs to the Muslim state but they're giving the privilege of working and planting it investing it or whatever they want to do and making a profit out of that providing they give a share to the Islamic treasury it goes to the welfare of the whole Community or of the whole country now the prophet told us in the Hadith that Abu Hur may Allah be pleased with him narrated he said that Iraq withhold its Durham and PE Syria with withhold a would withhold its mud and dinar and Egypt would withhold its and dinar and you would recoil to that position from where you started and you would recoil to that position from where you started and you would recoil to the position from where you started so the prophet Alat is telling us us one of the signs of the hour the the mud the are all means of measurement by size so we have means of measurement by size or by weight so the prophet is telling us that would withhold its Dirham which is currency dinar is currency and it's kaf Syria it's mud Egypt it's erub the funny thing is that these three countries did not accept Islam even the prophet did not send anyone to these countries to invite them to Islam or even to uh uh conquer it so the prophet Alat wasam was talking to the people in Arabia about countries that were not Muslims Muslim yet he is giving them the Glad Tidings that these countries Egypt Iraq and Syria will come there will come a time when they will accept Islam and not only that the country will be dominated by the Islamic ruling and the people would pay their jizya and their zakat Etc to the Muslim estate but there will come a time when they will prevent or they will stop giving what is their obligation to the Muslim state so Iraq would stop sending its goods Syria Egypt would follow suit so the prophet is telling his companions about countries that did not or they were not at the time even close to Islam but he told them that they will become Muslim it is exactly like when the prophet Alat wasam named named the for and you know that he designated five areas and he said that this area is for the people of NJ this area is for the people of Medina okay this area which is ala it is for the people of Asam and the people of Hasam did not even hear about Islam at the time but the prophet is telling us that there will come a time when they will accept Islam and they will come for and so this which is nowadays known as is the mik for anyone coming from the North or from the West like uh uh North Africa Egypt uh Syria Jordan Palestine Etc they all come and make their mikat from that Village so Subhan Allah the prophet is telling us about the signs of the hour but he's also prophesizing that these countries would Embrace Islam now Scholars said that when will the time come when they will stop sending such rights to the treasury of the Muslim State this has already gone this happened and gone because these countries were all part of the Muslim empire so whether it is at the time of the or the ab or thean Empire they were all part of it and they were all giving what was due to the rulers at the time not to them personally but to the treasury of the Muslims so that they would spend the money in the welfare of the Muslims and their communities so Scholars say that this time has already gone and now we know that Egypt Syria and Iraq are not doing this because there isn't any Muslim state that combines all scattered countries of the Muslims every country has its own government and they they have their own problems and they are isolated they don't want to join forces with others so this had already taken place others say this might uh uh uh also take place in the future when it becomes an Islamic State and they give what they're supposed to give but then they would be conquered and invaded by the kufar by the disbelievers and they would prevent paying the jizya to the Muslim government or they would feel so strong that they don't need to give the money uh to the Muslim government or the people would commit an act of apostasy and leave Islam and hence would not give the money to the Muslim ruler either way this had already taken place and we have seen that in the past two cent centuries when the uh uh uh Western countries invaded Iraq invaded Syria invaded uh uh Egypt and they controlled these countries for so many years and they have done what the prophet has told us that will take place Subhan Allah Now we move on to some of the signs of the hour that took place and are continuing to take place Allah Allah only knows when it will stop there is a possibility that it will keep on taking place until the day of judgment among these signs that the prophet told us about is the numbers of conquests and wars being waged by and against the Muslims so the prophet Alam prophesies that there will come a time where a lot of Wars would take place and when the prophet alhat wasam was saying this it was a little bit strange because when the prophet sallallahu alaihi Al wasallam was telling his companions about the good times to come about the Glad Tidings they were shocked because all what they can see at that moment was that they are being oppressed some of their companions are being killed and executed others and the majority were tortured and this was in the first phase of Islam in the meca uh uh period so one of the companions one of the slaves who were freed came to the prophet Alat wasam and said oh prophet of Allah and the prophet was at the time in the shade of the Kaa and leaning on his jacket or cloak so Kabab came to him and said oh prophet of Allah don't you see the amount of Oppression that we are suffering from don't you see how they are torturing us and doing so many evil things against us and against the Muslims don't you supplicate to Allah can't you ask Allah to grant us Victory and the prophet Alat wasam said to him before your time in previous Nations a man who was a Believer would be brought and they would bring the saw and put it on his head and start sewing him until he is split into two parts and another man would be brought and they would bring coms of iron and they would start to calm his body between the Flesh and the bones and all the nerves until everything is exposed torturing him like crazy and both men would not go back on their religion Subhan Allah the prophet is telling them that what you're suffering from that what you are facing is not different than what the people before you used to be tortured with just because they believe belied in Allah on the contrary it was far greater than what you are suffering at the moment so the prophet is telling Kabab to compare Apple to Apple to what happened in the past to the previous Nations that followed Jesus that followed Moses that followed all the prophets and messengers of uh uh the sons of Israel what happened to them and compare that to what's happening to you which is great but it's not as severe as it used us to be in the past and then the prophet gave the prophecy he said by Allah the rider would travel from to this is north and south of Yemen which was known to be controlled until today by tribes men and who only communicate by the gun so the prophet is giving the Glad Tiding by Allah he will travel from s to and he would not feed fear anyone except Allah and maybe a wild beast a wolf that would attack him but he would not Fe be afraid of people jumping on him or stealing his money or killing him and he would not fear except Allah and a wolf that may attack his sheep other than that he has no worries inshallah he has no fear but you are Hasty the prophet is saying to ababab you are Hasty wait and inshallah you will find this so if you were in kab's place and you had weak Faith you would say what is he saying come on we are being oppressed and we're being tortured and we're being uh uh squashed and he's telling me that this will happen that would happen this is not the case also he was with the prophet and the prophet was giving him prophecies and he said a woman you will if if you live long ad you will soon see the woman traveling from Iraq to Mecca on her own safe and sound and no one would come in her way and and was he's he's narrating the Hadith and he's telling us about his thoughts he said and I was wondering where are the thugs of the thugs of My Tribe who usually uh cut the way and attack Travelers then the prophet saidat wasam and if you live long you will be and you will see the treasures of K KRA or k of hmus the ruler of Persia you will see his treasures being spent in the cause of Allah and at the time uh uh Persia was a superpower like the the previous Soviet Union used to be and the room or the Christians were like the western civilization and the imperialists so the third prophecy he said and is telling us now I after the death of prophet Alam I've seen a woman traveling from Iraq to Mecca alone without feeding anyone and I was among those who conquered Persia and gathered the treasures of uh uh Krab hmus so these Glad Tidings and prophecies were all fulfilled and the prophet told us that as in theth of uh uh he said the prophet says you'll attack Arabia and Allah will enable will you to conquer it and this happened after the death of the Prophet Alam and then he said and you would attack Persia and he would make you to conquer it and this took place the prophet says then you would attack the room and this is in reference to the the bantian and what was there from the Roman Empire and Allah will enable you to conquer it then you would attack the de the Antichrist and Allah will enable you to conquer it so all of these are signs of coming conquests and wars and the prophet alhat wasam gave us the Glad Tiding that there that we will invade and Conquer India and at the time it was beyond imagination India is so far away yet the Prophet saidai that there were two groups that are from my followers and I ask Allah that they will be protected from Hellfire one of them is the group that would invade and Conquer India and the other is those who will be with Jesus Christ in his second second coming so all of these were prophecies by the prophet that took place also the prophet Sall alaihi wasallam gave us the Glad Tiding that we will Conquest uh Constantinople and con Constantino is known today as Istanbul at the time of the Prophet it was the capital of the byzantian empire in the East so it was inhabited by all Christians Orthodox and it and their leader whether it Wasa Caesar or their King whatever his name was was residing there and the prophet told us that it will be conquered twice once that already had taken place and that is by force Muhammad Al Fat the seventh uh uh emperor of the oan Empire managed to conquer it and open it and alhamdulillah it's an Islamic uh uh it's a Muslim city in Turkey as you all know but there will come a second conquest of it which means that it will return back to Christianity it will return back to disbelief and may Allah protect the people there but we believe in the Hadith of the Prophet Alam and some Scholars even go further to say that it has already been there because the rules that are being implemented are not Islamic rules Shar is not implemented what is implemented is man-made laws and this to some Scholars is considered to be a a major Act of blasphemy whenever you apply rules other than the rule of Allah where Allah says that the ruling it should be only to Allah so the prophet gave usam the Glad Tidings of two conquests one which has already been done the second one the prophet tells usat wasam and the Hadith is narrated by Abu Hur the prophet was with them and he asked the companions have you heard about a city that is half in water and half on on land so they said yes so the prophet saidat wasam the day of judgment will not come until 70,000 of the sons of Isaac now this is what the prophet said wasam the sons of Isaac would invade it and when they come close to it they will not use an arm and they they any arms and they would not throw a single Arrow how are they going to invade it then the prophet saysat when they come next to it they would say 70,000 shout in these beautiful words there is no God worthy of being woried except Allah and Allah is great when the prophet said said this he said that one of its side which is in the sea it will fall down and then they say again and the second side which is online will fall again and they then they would say say it for the third time and then it will be opened and they will enter it and take whatever is in it as a a war uh uh booty and as they are dividing the bounties of war and they are dividing the treasures that they had found it the prophet tells us they would hear someone warning them that the Antichrist has come so they will leave everything and they go back to fight the Antichrist in this Hadith the prophet is telling us that this Conquest will be without any fighting and this Conquest would be led by 70,000 of the sons of Isaac but we know that the Muslims are the sons of Ishmael so how do we interpret this Hadith Scholars have different opinion but the most authentic opinion is that the majority of the Muslims at that time would be the descendants of previously uh uh Christian forefathers and nawi may Allah have mercy on his soul says that and this is obvious nowadays at his time in the sixth or uh in the seventh century almost hij he said that the majority of the army armies in Iraq in Egypt and in Syria are all previously Christian who reverted to Islam who accepted Islam or who were abducted throughout Wars to be prisoners of wars and then accepted Islam and look what they are constituting the majority of these armies and this coincides with what the prophet tells usam when the Christians come to fight the Muslims in what some say the greatest battle of all Armageddon or whatever they may call it it is a huge battle that happens at the end of time and this is just before the Antichrist the Dalal comes out and we will come to discuss this inshallah if Allah prolongs our lives uh uh at the end of these uh programs and the prophet Alat wasam tells us that an army from Medina they are the best of the best of all the Muslims on Earth at that time come out to fight the Christians and the prophet tells us that they are in number approximately to a million to a thousand thousand so they are 1 million troops coming to fight a handful of Muslims so the Christians tell the Muslims give us our people that we should fight them we don't want to fight you Arabs give us those who were previously Christians and now they are Muslims so that we can fight them now either they were abducted ages ago and they accepted Islam or they were newly revert to Islam so the Christians don't want to fight the Arabs they want to fight those who left the religion and accepted Islam but the Arabs the Muslims Say No by Allah will not leave our brothers for you they are our brothers you fight them you fight us so they they engage the prophet says that the Muslim Army onethird of it Retreats and these are the Hypocrites Allah will never forgive them and the second third they will die as Martyrs and they're the best of martys as the prophet saidat wasam and the uh uh the Third will be Victorious and they will prevail by the grace of Allah and they will never be affected by any tribulation until they die and afterwards they manage to con conquer uh uh cant Noble as the prophet said sallam now said something that is quite beautiful he was with at in the company of may Allah be pleased with him and he said that I heard the prophet sayat that the day of judgment will not come until the Christians are the majority so told him are you sure and he said yes this is what I heard from the prophet Alam then being as fair and just as he is he did not say that these are cfir they are going to hell he said as long as you have said said that it is a fact now he's describing the Christians at his time he said it is a fact for they have four qualities they have the patience to undergo a trial and immediately restore themselves to sanity after trouble and attack again after flight they have the quality of being good to the destitute and the orphans and to the weak and fifthly they or the good quality in them is that they put resistance against the oppression of kings and this is in Muslim is describing describing them to the letter it fits like a glove they are kind to the poor to the destitute to the orphans they the minute a Calamity or a tribulation falls upon them they are quick to restore themselves to sanity and they whenever they are in a fight they attack and they Retreat and they attack and also they are having this quality that prevents their kings from having oppression against them so they always would resist any kind of Oppression from their leaders from their kings from their presidents they will stop them where they are so that they do not go on so uh uh um pleas with him is quite right when he described this and uh telling us about what will uh happen at the end of time as the prophet saidat after the conquest of Constantinople the prophet told us and gave us the Glad Tidings that we will also conquer Rome where the Vatican is now this is not this time this year not this Century Allah knows when when this happen but it's inevitable Wars and Conquest are continuing until the day of judgment and he also told us about the attack over the Muslim umah by the Moguls or the Tatar though they are different but we call them usually uh the same and he even described them to us the prophet sallallahu Al wasallam said that the last hour would not come unless you fight with people that is against people whose fa faces are like hammered Shields the prophet is describing the Moguls their faces are like hammered Shields and the last hour would not come until you would fight against those wearing the shoes of hair small eyes and Broad snub noses their faces like hammered Shields and all of this had happened we know the atrocities and the great Wars that took place between the Muslims and the Moguls when they came and invaded the Muslim umah and then alhamdulillah they were defeated and with the grace of Allah they all accepted Islam and we know that the whole area they came from is a Muslim area with the grace of Allah Asel now the $1 million question is Islam a religion of violence the prophet is giving us Prophecies of Wars of killings of Conquest so those who claim and accuse Islam to be a religion of violence are they saying the truth or not as a Muslim I would say definitely this is not true this is incorrect Islam is a religion of peace and throughout the whole wars in the 14 previous 14 centuries you would not find the atrocities that have been committed by others you would not have uh you would not find the amount of violence that took place for example World War World War I how many fatalities four years it lasted 10 over 10 million died world uh uh War II over 60 million people died in that war what kind of Peace are you talking about what kind of civilization and this did not happen uh in the Dark Ages this happened less than 100 years ago in Hiroshima and nagazaki two bombs more than 200,000 killed instantly in a matter of seconds and why children women elderly indiscriminate killing and you call this civilization drone attacks killing people discriminately say young old children women widowed we have doubt so it's okay to bomb a whole village and kill the people okay if we made a mistake collateral damage it's okay is this peace is this civilization we have a break so stay tuned inshallah and we continue just after the break and there is an American sister was very active in Egypt told me personally that uh she traveled between Buddhism and Christianity and different sex and when she came to read the Quran she started by reading from right to left she said I swear once I finished it I fainted I could not believe myself that there is such book that people were so negligent and ignorant about this is that has to be the book of Allah subh and she said I accepted Islam simply after reading and knowing the first chapter seven verses seven verses the Arabic itself which is the Allah spoke the Quran so this is by itself is a medicine it is a word of it's a word of Allah subhana it goes into the heart it was not created rather Allah spoke it out welfare and forgiveness Ramadan Ramadan [Music] rad can do that because you do not know what to say to them something at least you raise up your hand and ask Allah oh Allah please give guidance to this brother of mine the importance of following Prophet Muhammad Salli wasallam to follow our Prophet s wasallam means you must understand his is is a very easy religion simple religion so don't make religion difficult to yourself I believe this Hadith is very common to all of us but the beauty part of this Hadith number one it started by om saying now again I like to share with the brother and sister to understand the beauty of the say of the companion [Music] oh my Creator oh Allah fulfill our aim asalam alikum and welcome back so is Islam a religion of violence definitely not if you look at other denominations if you look at other religions if you look at what they call the Civilized world the Western countries you'll find more violence far exceeding anything that is close to what you may find in the Muslim world or as a result of the Muslim world look at the Swedish sniper in Malmo Sweden recently going throughout a whole year shooting people on racial uh uh basis just because they're immigrants to Sweden his name is Magnus or whatever is is is called as look at the uh uh in Norway Andre uh Rik or whatever when he killed 77 people just for the sake of it look at the sniper or or or the the the lunatic the shooter who went into a movie theater in Aurora Colorado in the US only few weeks ago and killed Allah how how many nine I think and injured so many no no reason no explanation and he's not a lunatic he's not crazy he is in his sound mind Goldstein the Jew settler who went into the Masjid and killed tens of worshippers in uh Palestine occupied Palestine you look at David korash and what he did with his followers you look at Timothy mcfay and what and the Oklahoma bombing you you see and the drones again and again and again killing lots and lots of Muslim but Muslim blood is cheap nobody stands up for it so he they can kill in Afghanistan they can kill in Yemen and then they claim that we are the terrorist and I don't know what is happening so if a Muslim country thinks that there is someone in the western world or a leader that has to be assassinated for his crimes and they send a drone or they even send a firecracker do you think think that they will leave them alone can we do this no they can't why because they are the Masters they are the police of the world and they are the one who are controlling how we breathe and we eat and think and and and whatever we do this is unacceptable in Islam Islam is not a religion of violence and the violence that is attributed to the Muslims the uh the the the World Trade Center bombing this is ridiculous you have so many documentaries proving that this was not the doing of a Muslim ask any pilot who knows how to fly an a jetliner and tell him can a person who had only few classes on one propeller jet uh uh engine plane fly a 767 or a big aircraft full of fuel and passengers and maneuver through New York and Bullseye from the first attempt to This World Trade Center not once twice and he would gu I would guarantee you that no professional pilot would say that this is possible put them in a simulator flight simulator let them fly a professional pilot and put them in a flight simulator let them try to go through uh uh the world train C uh World Trade Center building I know a professional pilot who has 30 years of experience flying 747 jumbo uh uh airplanes he said I tried this three times oh the third time I managed to hit a bullseye so all of this all of this is unacceptable and I believe that it's all made up who did it allaham I'm not going to accuse anyone but to claim that a Saudi passport was salvaged and that this infero this hell this fire did not affect it I believe that we should take the Saudi passports and wrap all black boxes of airplanes with it because it definitely proved that it is not burnable as they claim otherwise they are telling a mere lying this is what I believe we we have yya from Saudi Arabia yes yya hello listen to me from the phone and mute your TV please yes yes okay how are you doing sh I'm fine my question is in your talk you mentioned something about I think some City which is half in water and half in land yes can you just explain is uh what is this Constantinople or some other City okay okay and my second question is that uh the money that we get like uh from interest for example like from a bank or something uh how should we spend it can we give it as Charity or some other way like what's recommended for it okay I will answer questiona so the brother is asking about the city that the prophet told us about that it is half in the sea and half in uh land this as a scholar say is Istanbul Istanbul in turkey and it's Constantin Noble as they uh used to call it in in the past and we know that it has it's divided into two parts one a European part and one is uh the Turkish I I would love to say the Islamic part inshallah and the we know that they are going out of their way trying to join the European community and we as Muslims Pride on our Islam we do not look for others to help us or to give us strength we as Muslims should abide but unfortunately this is not the case not only in Turkey in all Muslim world except those who are trying their level best the brother is Al ask saying is I have Haram money um from uh Bank interests so what should I do with that first first of all you should take your money from this riba based bank and put it in a bank that does not deal in riba Islamic banks that is and there are plenty here alhamdulillah so you take it and give it to the Islamic Bank because this is a must you cannot give it to a bank that deals openly in RBA you go and I say I'd like to borrow 100,000 say okay this is 100,000 you return it 120,000 this is clear riba that we cannot take we have uh Abdullah from Saudi Arabia yeahum yes I have some question just uh it's about my intention if this is valid or not it's about zaka okay you know I have I had some relatives called me and borrowed money from me then I gave it to her but my intention that money is my zaka is that valid or not because I did not inform her on that SP my plan or intent ention I will inform her on the day when she repair the money back to me okay my intention is valid the second question the second question also is also about intention this is posed by my sister she used to help people but her intention whatever she gave or expend in different transaction the amount deduct from Hera is that also valid okay I will answer your question inshallah uh brother Maru from bahin Brother is G is gone okay U so you this is the first thing you do you take your money from this interest based bank if you don't have any other bank for as example if you're in a country and there isn't any Islamic Bank in this case if you have to try your level best to have your money in an account that does not take interest so a current account for example they don't give you interest in a saving account they give you interest you have to demand that it be in uh current account if this is not possible as well if the bank gives without your uh uh uh permission um Haram money in this case you may take the money and give it in means of Charity and helping people who want to go to hospital and buying medication and paying their rent and paying their uh electricity bill in means of Charity not to get closer to Allah but to cleanse your money from this Haram uh money that you have incurred uh sister Abdullah is saying that intention i g someone came to me who's needy asking for a loan I gave her a thousand r with my intention that I will tell her that this is zakat when she returns the money is this permissible the answer is no if it's zakat then you have to tell her on the spot now that you've lent her the money you cannot make this money part of the zakat you have to pay the zakat somewhere else or you have to take another thousand R and give it to her and say this is my zakat money now she has an option whether to return the loan to you or take the Thousand R and spend it elsewhere in what she needs but for you to wait until she returns the money this is not permissible zakat when it's due it has to be given on time on the spot on the same day not to postpone it 6 months one year until she returns the money as for her sister whenever she helped people she intended that this is from the zaka this is permissible providing that these people are legible for zakat so my zakat for next year is a th000 r and then a friend comes or a beggar or someone who is in need he says I I need 500 real for uh to pay my electricity bill or they'll cut the power off and I don't have any money and I'm really poor so I give him 500 r with the intention that this is from my th000 R uh uh coming zakat this is halal and this is permissible inshallah now is Islam a religion of violence no it is not and we don't have what they portray against us we're 1.6 billion show me the violence that 1% are doing. 1% 000000 1% from these 1.6 million Muslims are a peaceful umah they're a peaceful people and we have never heard of any acts of terrorism or violence except in the past 20 or 25 years when the Western Powers started oppressing the Muslims attacking them invading them making their atrocities in Afghanistan in Iraq in well Palestine is a clear example of their atrocities and their wrongdoings uh from Jed yes bro I have a question regarding umra okay I live in jeda and we went to umra we generally go to to Makkah now before taking I mean we came to Jed I shaved my head off in jeda okay I mean is it permissable or should I shave my head in in makah only okay any more question another question yes yes uh sh um um I have I have missed 200 Rosas you have I have missed 200 uh fast s 200 uh 200 but like this is before I didn't knew that I have to uh um make up for my Ramadan fast I came to know 10 years back Allah give us and I came to know 10 years back that I to uh uh keep my Ramadan my Miss Ramadan fast so what should I do at the time I should I pay the ransom or should I fast at the time that you've missed these 200 days were you praying regularly no you I wasn't praying reg you wasn't praying at all no I was praying uh like two three times um uh but I wasn't praying five times okay I will answer your question inshallah uh brother Abdullah from Saudi Arabia yes sir yes bro we have a good question actually end of Ramadan I I have a plan to leave to another city so my question is inah for zaka which place I have to spend the zaka is it possible to give it to someone in my city to give it to people or I have or is it possible to spend it in that that city which they will go to in I will answer your question insh okay thank you uh brother Su from jeda his question was regarding performing omah and then postponing making his himself Halal by shaving his head until he comes to jeda so is this permissible answer is yes remembering that you are still in the state of so if you went for and you finished your and you went to your car and drove back home this is okay but you are is still in the state ofam so don't do any Hanky Panky or hold your wife's hand and and being intimate with her in the car this is not permissible you're still in the state ofam once you reach jida and you shave or you cut short uh uh your hair this is alhamdulillah permissible and uh his wife is asking about that she missed 200 days of fasting in her previous years because she did not know that she was obliged to make up for these days so she's asking can I give fidya and the answer is no and I asked did she pray or not because if she did not pray at all she was not a Muslim so I would not ask her to make up for these days but she said I used to pray two or three times a day which make is a a major sin but she's alhamdulillah Muslim so 200 days and inshallah Allah will make it easy try to as much as possible make them up if you fast Mondays and Thursdays three days of uh every month the white days inshallah you'll be able to uh uh make up for these days Omar Froman hello Alum okay my question is concerning a person who cannot fast during Ramadan why uh they have to feed poor people according to the law of Islam correct why then can they fast in Ramadan well uh I have a friend and she she's doing chemotherapy so this Ramadan she will not be able to fast okay okay I will answer your question inshallah um sister Shaquil from Saudi Arabia yes hello yes yes I can hear you listen to me from the phone and mute your TV inshallah yeah um uh my question is first question I am pregnant now I'm having 8 months uh doctor advised me not to be fast but I want to fast alhamdulillah I am okay when I'm fasting and my second question is when we are are giving zakat so we have to mention that we have to give we are giving zakat okay I will answer your question inshallah okay thank um brother Abdullah from Saudi Arabia uh is asking that he is traveling at the end of the month to another country so he's wondering where should I give zakat Al Scholars say that zakat Al f is to be paid wherever you are so for example if you're going to Egypt for for your uhid and you travel in the last week and Eid comes you give zakat in Egypt if this is not possible or if you're going to a Western Country and you don't know who to give it to there is no problem none whatsoever to tell your younger brother or your uh uh friend that listen this is the money for the zakat we are seven people so please give the zakat on my behalf to the poor in jida or in wherever you are in Saudi Arabia Your Home Country and this is permissible alhamdulillah and no complications none whatsoever from she's saying that if a person is undergoing chemotherapy may Allah cure all those who are undergoing this uh uh uh rigid and tough uh uh procedure of chemotherapy and may Allah grant them uh uh their well-being and restore their health back so she is asking does she feed I I I think Omar is online I don't think my supplication was answered that that quick but inshallah yes Omar hello alikum yes uh we wanted to know how many poor people should she feed for the day that she missed okay and how many meals is it like breakfast lunch and dinner or is it a particular meal I will answer your question inshallah and um if she is because she lives in America and she came to visit her family in Oman and F SI here so the amount that she's going to remove is is it supposed to be American or is it supposed to be Omani we'll do inshallah so now if a person is undergoing uh chemotherapy this means that he will not be able to fast and it's very difficult I know my sister under gone such a a procedure alhamdulillah Allah cured her and may Allah cure all those who are suffering from the same so she is not to fast however feeding the poor is only for those who are too old to fast they're not going to get younger so that someone is 85 90 years of age he's not able to fast or she's not able to fast they feed and or someone who is chronically or uh terminally ill someone that the doctors say you will never be able to fast until the day you die so someone who has a a a an extreme illness that requires that he drinks every couple of hours or takes pills around the clock and he's unable to recover and the doctor said you'll never recover you will always won't be able to fast these two are permitted and they are given a substitute for their fasting by feeding a poor person so if your friend who's undergoing this chemotherapy the doctor say alhamdulillah there are chances inshallah she will make it and I pray to Allah that she would make it as well in this case she cannot feed the poor she should wait until 3 four 5 years down the road when she is fit and healthy again she should make up for the days M ABD rman and I believe it's the last call inshallah from Saudi Arabia hello hello my question is can we read Quran without W okay any more question no so uh sister Omar if your friend will recover inshallah then she cannot she must make up for the days even after four five years if she is not going to recover may Allah help her and the doctor say that she will not be able to fast in this case she should feed one meal per day to a poor person so if Ramadan is 29 days she after the sunset of every day she should feed one poor person a breakfast dinner lunch it's up to you definitely lunch in Ramadan is not the case so you give this person a meal that is sufficient if you don't want to give a cooked and ready meal then you may give that poor person 1 Point uh uh uh 25 kilog of rice if you want to to postpone the whole thing till the end of Ramadan so after 29 or 30 days of Ramadan are over you cook a huge amount of food and you invite 90 poor people to eat from it she's from America where should she feed the poor people most likely Muslims in America are not that poor to the extent that they don't find food uh and these have to be Muslims so if she gives the money to someone in Oman or in the Gulf or in a Muslim State and ask them to buy food and to give the food to the poor this would do the job inshallah uh Shaquille was asking about her pregnancy she's eight months pregnant may Allah Grant her a righteous son who would become an Imam of the Muslims um and she's asking the doctors say you should not fast but she says that I am fit and I'm capable of fasting if fasting would not affect your health nor the health of your baby you can go ahead and fast what determines whether you fast or not is the health and the well-being of yourself and of your uh baby and uh she is asking about giving the zakat to the poor and telling them is it a must the answer is no unless you are doubtful so if someone comes to me or if I have a neighbor or if I have a relative that I know for sure that they are poor they are classified to be poor or needy and I give them zakat I give them a th000 5,000 without telling him this is zakat money this is permissible but if there's someone that I'm in doubt he looks poor but I'm not sure maybe he's pretending he's not begging he's not asking but I do not go and give him the money as a donation or as a s or as a gift because if someone me if someone gives me Asim a million and he said that this is s I will take it Sak is not something that only to be given to the poor it can be given to your uh uh parents it can be given to your wife whatever you pay is sodak but in zakat you have to make sure or you have to have yeah reasons Beyond doubt that he is poor or needy so if I'm sure that he's poor and need I don't have to tell him it's zakat maybe it's better not to tell him because then I will break his heart but if someone that I'm doubtful so I would say listen my friend this is a thousand R of zakat are you worthy of taking it or take it if he's worthy he'll take it and keep it if he's not he'll fear Allah and he'll give it to someone else or uh tell you that I cannot uh take it finally abd's question is it permissible to recite the Quran without wo the answer is yes the dispute among Scholars is is it permissible to hold the Quran without W or not the majority of Scholars say that this is not permissible and alhamdulillah nowadays with technology we have Alternatives I recite the Quran I've never I have not held a Quran copy in Arabic in ages I I always read it from my uh PDA from my mobile alhamdulillah from my laptop so you don't have to be in the state of Purity uh uh and state of w to do this just to be on the safe side this is all the time we have remember tomorrow is Friday and Saturday we don't have signs of the hour we have ask Huda at 5 o' inshallah and as for the signs of the hour I will be honored to meet with you inshah on Sunday same time at 3:00 meca time and until then I leave you myat Allah fulfill our AIMS in life Allah forgive our sins yeah Allah oh Allah the most gracious oh Allah the most gracious oh my Creator oh Allah fulfill our AIMS in life Allah forgive our sins yeah Allah oh Allah the most gracious oh Allah the most gracious"
