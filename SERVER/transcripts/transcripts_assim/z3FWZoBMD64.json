  "title": "If a woman has gold above nisab but divides it among children & now it is below the nisab, must she",
  "transcript": "a man from the emirates my friend sister is a single mother she works and takes care of three daughters who are all above 14 years and they're not male so if she has 120 grams of gold uh as we know the nissan for gold is 85 grams so if she divides the gold between her three daughters each of them will get 40 grams which is below the nishab can you please advise if zakat is applicable in this case or would it come under playing with the rulings of islam okay i will answer inshallah and from the emirates says if a woman has gold and this gold is over 85 grams of uh gold 24k and usually she gives the cat to it now she wants to give her three daughters divided upon them like 30 grams each which means that it would be below the threshold so do they have to pay the cat the answer is if she's doing this as a trick so that she would skip the cat this is not permissible because gold is actually hers it's in her position she did not give it to them so that they can sell it if they wish or give it as a gift if they wish no she still possesses it but it is uh just by name possessed by them but it's not the she has to give zakat but if she actually and genuinely gave the the gold to them and both on all of them it's below the threshold then there is no zakat on it because they possessed it they can do with it whatever they want and it's not hers any more you"
