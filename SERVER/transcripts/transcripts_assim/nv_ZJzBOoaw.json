  "transcript": "But if you continue to pray, shaitan is pissed because you disobeyed him and his strategy did not work. Allah is pleased because you're worshiping him. It boils down to two things. Either you obey Allah or obeyan. Now you tell me watching anime. You tell me loves anime too. I don't care about I'm so glad I got to meet a guy. Funny. I feel like almost like this was supposed to be blocked off and they just opened it. That's exactly what happened. There's a rope right here, but you can get on the sidewalk. You can drive on the sidewalk. Oh, welcome. Welcome to Saudi. It's called Offensive Driving, baby. You know what I'm saying? It's called Bumpy Rides. It's the last 10 nights. It's an odd night of Ramadan. So, very special nights. Stay reminded of everything we're grateful for and everything we want and everything we're going to ask God for. You got a beautiful voice. Yeah, I know. That's why it's so packed. This This is a famous recider. It's great to finally meet you. I look at this. I'm like, \"Oh, look. We could smoke in here.\" But Arab people, they put the date seeds in here. Even though this is definitely I don't know what animes you watch. I don't watch animes. You said that that video that went viral. You talking about it? You spoke like you've watched a lot of anime in your life. Never in my life. Wow. You don't talking about viral you? No. No. What are you talking about anime? It's all a bunch of crap. It's all the same. He said it was so funny. He makes a good point, man. Anime for anime for I was laughing so hard at that clip. I said I said I said that clip to all my brothers. I'm a serious person. I don't watch any stuff. I don't watch anime at all. But but when I talk, I try my little best to make people feel what I'm talking about and that I have some idea. So aren't you tired of pretending that anime matters that you care? I like anime. I love anime. I'm not going to lie. Well, I mean that last you said made me laugh. I'm not going to lie. How long have you been Muslim? My whole life. Okay. So, what's your take on Islam? It's a beautiful religion. Okay. The truth. What is it? The truth. It's the truth. So if you don't walk the talk, what good the truth is to you. So the borderline is if you're praying to in the mid and you get whispers that, oh, they're looking at me. I'm praying so that I can get their praise and compliment. You have two choices on the table. either to break a prayer or to continue. Logical. Is there a third option? No. You tell me. I don't know. Okay. If you break your prayer, Shayan, Satan, Lucifer, El is pleased because you obeyed him. Correct? Yeah. But Allah is angry because you broke your prayer. Yeah. But if you continue to pray, shanan is pissed because you disobeyed him and his strategy did not work. Allah is pleased because you worshiping him. It boils down to two things. Either you obey Allah or obeyan. Now you tell me watching anime. Okay. You tell me. Sne does anime too. I don't get I'm so glad I got to be a guy of judgment. You're going to stand alone. But Naruto Naruto, he's inspiring. Honestly, I did not ask him. I don't not I'm not asking about his seven lives or or or the demons he's into. I'm just asking you does it please Allah or please Shikban? Simple as that. Very simple question. Don't beat around the bush. He's not going to save you in your grave. I'm not going to do anything to you on the day of judgment. I'm going to bail out for myself, man. It's my skin. So, this is how we roll in Islam. It's not what the people say. It's not what my followers dictate that I should do. A lot of my followers would like to see me in a boxing match with with this uh what's his name? The one who fought. No, no. With who fought uh Tyson. Yeah, something like that. I get paid a lot, but who cares what followers want? You have three boxers here, mashallah. I go with Gawk nine. You win a boxing match with the Glock. Yeah, this is nonsense. This is I I've done this 40 50 years ago. I did kung fu. I did karate choto. I I I did a little bit of Aikido. If you sweat and you like a pig and then get a shower and then what elevator glock does the job for you and you don't have to podcast. Guys, guys, help yourself. First first round is on the house, but then I'm I'm a sheh. I'm not used to serving people. You guys are going. So, enough preaching. So, what's happening with you guys? What's what's up? Busy day. We just flew 24 hours and we had a jam-packed day. And we were we were all tired downstairs and now we're wide awake. Tired. They're all sleeping in the car. Oh, well. Now they're wide awake. At least I first uh one of our brothers over here uh got held over at the airport cuz he was wearing a unfriendly sweater. Was it sweater? That's not sure. I don't think it's The sweater was a part of it. No, it was a giant part of it. He was getting eyes everywhere. He's wearing a sweater that says the White House is Israeli owned or what is it? Israeli occupied territory. Yeah. Anything anything that is political motivated is it's not welcome here. We don't mess around with politics. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. It's not messing around with political. It's just what is it you want to do? Yes. Send a message. You have to be aware of the environment. You're sending a message. So I wouldn't go to America and say Trump sucks or El Musk is the president. Tell us. He's a very political man. He loves like being uncensored. Again, as a Muslim, what is your intention? Is it to? And I I know this is is coming like you're not my father. Don't judge me. What? I'm a Saudi. I'm a she. I am I have the hell to judge you, man. What are you going to do? Sue me? It is content out of him. That's what it is. It is our part and responsibility in Islam to give as much dawa and advice as possible because this is what we do. This is how we roll. On the day of judgment, I'm going to be questioned alone. And allahel is going to ask me, you sat with these guys. Why didn't you benefit them? Why didn't you give them advice? Yeah, we could all laugh and could have jokes and, you know, have a good time, but I'm going to be questioned for every second of my life, and I have to have an answer. So, do I want to be controversial? No. I could be one of the most controversial people on earth. Do I want to be a stand-up comedian? I could do a good job. I think I've got the wits for it. But I want to be a Muslim. Meaning, I don't want to control people. I don't have control on anyone. I don't control people's lives. And you're going to hell and you go to heaven or you're good or you're bad. I don't judge people. I like how you picked me for heaven. You're big. You're big. Mother's not going to work over here. I'm afraid. Isn't being a Muslim telling the truth always, no matter the cost? I like that. Muslims do and say according to the result and the consequence of what they do and say. meaning if I'm going to do or say something that has bad repercussion and make things far worse, Islam tells me stop. I give you an example in the Quran. Allahel says in a crystal clear ayah, do not insult the idols that they worship. Come on, insulting the idols is a good thing. because it's false. It doesn't have anything to do. But why Allah says do not insult the idols they worship so they would not insult Allah unjustly. So the consequence is what is far dire and serious. Though insulting the idols is good, but if it's going to cause them insulting Islam and insulting Allah, refrain. This is what you do. If I'm going to say the truth or if I'm going to do something that is good, what is the consequence? It's going to cause someone to die. It's going to cause a whole village to be annihilated. No, stop. Keep it to yourself. But if it's going to cause something good, go ahead. I don't know if this makes sense or I understand don't personalize things because when you personalize things it makes the advice watered down. So even if I was about to accept your advice when someone waters it down and makes fun of it is going to make me reject it and not accept it. Watch out again. Father figure soon. So you got you got any questions? Over here is a convert. He's been Muslim for only 9 months. He's a revert. Rever back to Islam. Is it bad to say convert? Convert is when you convert from a religion to another religion. But a revert is you're going back to your nature to original state. Original state. And I'm sure he has a lot of questions, right? N off the top of my head right now. No, I'm just listening. Any experiences? No. You had a couple questions you're asking, but I don't talk about your experience in Saudi. Obviously, it's the first day, you know, as an Italian. Uh, what do you what do you thought so far? Yeah, this is my first time in a Muslim country. It's been the craziest thing has probably been the nikabs everywhere seeing women everywhere. You're kidding. Most of we are complaining that women are not wearing the nikab as they supposed to. Really? Yes. And we're seeing that we're being westernized more and more and the women are being liberated from Islam. Unfortunately, it's very sad. We weren't like this. But unfortunately, that's a good thing. I mean, compared to the way. Yeah. Yeah. That's the modesty is a good thing in in in in Saudi Arabia, we're still enjoying a fair amount of modesty. The the family unit here is incredible. praying tower week, having kids running around with a father and a wife. We just prayed inani just prayed there right now. So they liked where the kids were playing. Why? Because I question. So like I get like why our purpose is here is to worship Allah but like why did Allah like create the whole simulation? Like why create everything? Why not? Is it just like out of his mercy and his love like out of his Why not? Why not? He can't afford it. See he is not a CEO of a company that we can hold to account and do a Congress hearing. He is not someone who's equivalent to us. We cannot imagine the greatness of allahel because unfortunately we not doing a good job. Look at you in which state you coming from? Boston. Massachusetts. Mass. Okay. So Boston, Massachusetts. And compared to the US, where are you? I can't see you. The US compared to the earth, I can't see it. And I definitely I can't see you is so minute. And the earth compared to the solar system where I need 100 lightyear to travel from one end to the to the other with millions of solar systems in the Milky Way galaxy. With millions of galaxies, with so many solar systems and planets and the likes, where are you? You're nowhere to be found. You're negligible. And all of this is like a ring tossed in the desert as in the hadith. Imagine this huge creation of Allah is like a ring tossed in a desert. What's the comparison compared to the throne of allahel? And this is one of Allah's creation. So when we get to know who Allah is, nobody has the guts to question but we know that we were nothing and Allah created us from nothing and he gave us life and gave us the ability to grow up and to eat and drink and mate and enjoy life with all his pleasures. And not only that, he gave us an ultimatum. And he told us, \"If you guys do well, I'll give you a paradise where there's things no eyes had seen, no ears had heard of, and no heart had ever imagined. For a gazillion years, no. Whatever years, no, is for eternity. You will enjoy eternity.\" No death, no sleeping, all enjoyment. Just if you do well in these 60 or 70 years of your lifespan, but if you don't, I'm going to throw you in hell. And you have no way of objecting or complaining. So we living in this life, having a good time, having a blast, enjoying everything that is halal. And at the end of the day, when we get the SMS, come. It's your death time. We die. We I'm hopeful that I'm going to enjoy life even further and more. So it's not that why did Allah create us? It's what are we going to do now that we created? We have a choice. Take the red pill or the blue pill. Neil, you make a choice. So this is the choice you have to make. I don't know if this makes sense or I'm going if it's not it doesn't challenge me. No, it's Yeah, I get what you're saying. You're saying like we're already here. We're already created. Like there's no point in really tripping about why it is is nobody cares. You have the full will to just blast away and say, \"I'm not interested.\" Okay. Do whatever you want. Do drugs, do women, do boys. It's a free country. It is. Do whatever you want, but at the end of the day, you're going to pay the price. I love to drive my car 230 km per hour. But if I get the cameras picture, I'm going to pay the price. Either my license is going to be suspended is either I'm going to pay the fine. But if not, I'm not caught red-handed. No problem. So this is what life is. Allahel doesn't need us. We need him. We are so vulnerable and weak and poor. Our hearts can't beat without his permission. But we don't show our gratitude to him. Once Allah wants it stops the blood in our veins, the breath that we take, we can't inhale and exhale without him giving us authority to do something. But we don't think about this. We're so arrogant. We're so thinking highly of ourselves. No, I can't do this. I can, you know, he can. One Corona virus does wonders. I don't know if this makes sense. a question. So, uh, we're actually the most popular Muslims in America right now. The most popular youth, Muslim youth in America. What advice do you have for us, you know, going back to America after this trip? Like some general advice that you could give us cuz we do have influence. It doesn't matter what influence you have. It doesn't matter what people think of you. What matters is what Allah thinks of you. I like that. And so many people say, \"She, you did this. You said this. Who? Who cares? So, no, you have to care. You have so many followers. You have this. I don't give a damn. Excuse my friend. Seriously, I don't care if you come and criticize what I say. Who cares? If you come and compliment me and praise me, I don't care. What counts is, does Allahel approve of what I'm doing or not? So, you ask the same question I asked your your fellow brother a while ago. Is Allah pleased with you or is Shayan pleased with you? This is what counts. So you go back to the states and you do a an audit of your life. Nobody's going to help you. Nobody's going to go down in your grave with you. You're going to go alone. And when the moment you die, they're going to strip your butt naked and they're going to wash you and perfume you. And have you ever washed someone before? I have not. Oh, it's a sight to see when you just strip them out of the clothes and this they're a corpse and you have to make them sit and squeeze their stomach. So whatever impurities come from wow again front and and the back and you have to keep on the water running and you have to conceal it not tell anybody oh man the guy had orchestras. No, you have to conceal it and wash thoroughly. And then you make woodoo. And then you turn them over to the side and wash their back. And then turn them to other side and wash their back. And you try to clean them and then put kafur which makes the skin a little bit tougher and and and stiffer. You perfume them and you shroud them. You're going to be do this alone and everybody's going to be doing it and weeping up. He was a good brother. It's too late. We pulled the plug. So whatever you do, you're going to find in your grave. And this is what a joke I always make to the to the guys. Guys, when I go in my grave, alhamdulillah, it's all furniture. I got two slit units and spotlights and fridge and everything is fine. All what I need is just connect the power. What do you have in your grave? This is what everyone should ask. What do I have in my grave? If I have good deeds and no sins, you're fine. You're doing great. You are living the life. But if not, you have time to rectify it. Fix it up. Nobody says ditch everything you're doing. Go to the masid. Stay there 24/7. This is not Islam. But at the same time, you have to check and balance. Is what I'm doing pleasing Allah or is it pleasing? Whatever pleases, I cross it out. Whatever pleases Allah, keep up the good work. It's very simple. Yeah. Awesome. I have a question. Sure. Um, what if what do I do if I'm not uh I'm not like these guys? I'm not driven to maybe strive to do a lot of uh work on my own. I feel like I'm being uh lethargic or how do I find the motivation to or the drive to accomplish something that is worthwhile? Every day, every Friday that is, we read surah and in verse I think 28, Allahel addresses his messenger and the message is really weird to us. What does Allah say to him? He said, \"Make yourself patient and tolerant with those who remember Allahawel in the morning and the evening and do not look elsewhere wanting the prompt and the adornment of the dunya. These guys are poor guys. And I I'd like to go with 50 Cent and you know uh the guys that have Ferraris and Lamborghinis and all the blinglings and these these are my my type of people that I'd like to these are my grandchildren. So don't overlook around and um don't overlook. Keep your eye on the ball and do not associate yourself with those whom we've made their hearts neglectful and their affairs on the loose. So Allah is telling his messenger to circle himself with righteous practicing people. When you go with righteous practicing people, hypothetically, hypothetically, assuming me, what would you always get from me? Reminders, words of advice. Yes, we may do something. I may play eightball with you and, you know, beat the heck out of you. We may play sports, you know, paddle or table tennis, and I I give you a handicap of 10 points. I could do that. So it's fun to be with me but at the same time I'm going to do what you all the time remind you of allahel get you closer to Allah because we want to roll together to Allah if we don't listen you pull out the clock now right no I choose someone else it's not sufficient time is short if I give him advice and he doesn't listen the hell would I go somewhere else because time is limited I can't invest my time on an individual or in a group and it's not paying off. I have to keep on trying to even if I have my siblings, my my own brothers and sisters and I try my level best to give them D and it's not working. What should I do? Go look for someone else because I want to fill up my grave with another split unit and few fridges and maybe I don't know. So this is what the advice to the prophetam was. You look for good companions in the masjid in the community. This would motivate you. When you strive to be with someone higher than you, you try your level best to reach their level. But when you're always with people that are lower than you, they'll drag you to their level and before you know it, you're like them. So, I don't know if this answers your question. Yeah, it does. the sheh and and the US just told us uh at last Friday Pride that your friend is the one that will judge you which way you want to go the right way or the you know the wrong way. This depends who's stronger. If you have an influence of the prophetam who was his best companion Abu Bakr did Abu Bakr drag him down no the prophet drag him up. So yes, your friend dictates what kind of a person you are. If you are not strong and well-versed and steadfast on Islam, but if you aren't, then alhamdulillah, you're a good influence to the community and to the others. See, I got a random question. Yeah, it's random. I'm just saying that cuz my friend Adam over here mah he's got engaged and I was just asking him about his if he's going to have a second one but he was telling me like like people in his family were like saying it's haram or like look frown upon like I don't know it's frowned why is it so frowned upon like it's not frowned upon it's with all due respect stupid is it to ask someone who's not married yet my brother he was interested too he was telling me like no my answer I say you start with One. So one. So before you can think about two, you have to think about one. True. I know. How come like women get so like there's always a debate when around like Muslim women, Muslim men, they always have like a crazy debate and the women always get so mad about it. So like what's your thoughts on polygamy? Is it even logical for Muslim women and men who are non Maham to engage in such debates? This is immodest. America. This is our definition here of slots. Was he a woman who sits with an M and talk about issues of the bad? Both of them are not real Muslims. What is this? First of all, second of all, those we have a saying. Dogs that bark don't bite. Those who talk about polygamy and I'm interested. I'm from this gives you an idea. Yeah. Check how much you got honestly under the belt, under the hood. What? Oh, no. Understand? In my bank account. What? How much I have? How many wives he's trying to say? How many wives? I have one wife. Oh, why is your voice? And it is not it is not indicative of how machu you are. Yeah. Maybe if you are not a Muslim and you say, \"Okay, I have my black book or blue book and I have how many girls I know?\" Yeah. This is really bad. Omar says, \"I hate it when men speak about their private parts and about the stomach. All what they care about is their food and their sex life.\" This is not befitting for a man. Marriage is a sacred bond between two for the sake of having a family, having a a kids, and finding your soulmate. Down the line, if there is a need, Islam allows you to marry a second and a third and a fourth, but with the right intention, not with, hey, how many wives you got? Hey, sound like he was kind of shy to ask the question. So, I was like, \"You know what? It doesn't look shy.\" Adam was a reaper, too. You know, don't dodge a bullet like a man. Just stand and block nine is good for you. So basically speaking the issue of marriage is something halal but the guys in the west are making it really bad. This is what I was talking about consequences. When you open this topic women become aggressive defensive and they hate Islam. They hate men especially with beard because they think that any person who's committed to Islam is going to take her as a second or a third or a fourth wife. It's not it's not a a hurricane that was over in 5 minutes like most people are. It's a it's a commitment. It's not only the 5 minutes at the end of the night when you try to listen to sex. It's not it's a commitment. It's a financial commitment. It's uh having the tolerance of being good to your in-laws, your kids, and responsibility. huge responsibility. Yeah. I have a use your right. Yes. Yes. Repeat that. I I have a question that um I I've been I was struggling with this one ever since I read this hadith which um I have to admit I I didn't like when I read it. And the hadith is uh the prophet peace be upon him he said that the people of Yemen are the best of people. And I also read a hadith where he says that there's uh no race is better. There's no racial supremacy. And then I I read this one and I to this day I'm still struggling believe like why are the the people of are the people of Yemen better? What what is that? What does that mean? Change your profile picture. This is my niece. You can do can I can I listen no? First of all, we as Muslims have to have submission, certinity, no questions asked, no strings attached. This is Quran. I believe it. Do you fully embrace it? Yes. No questions asked. This is a hadith. Do you take it? Uh, is it authentic? Is it? That's what I I read. Yeah. Then if it's authentic, it's from Allah. How could I be shaky? Because if you want to be shaky, this means that you don't have certinity. And when you don't have certinity, you're this close to flipping to the dark side. But I mean, how how are we able to judge how authentic hadith is or you don't how do you judge whether this neurosurgeon who's going to do a spine cord surgery on you is authentic or not? I judge by opinions of other people. Okay. So by whose people? Professionals. Professionals. So you go to the scholars. That's why I'm asking you. I'm coming to you. I'm not answering yet. I'm just setting the foundation for the belief. The biggest problem we have with the Westerners from America and from Canada and from Europe is that they don't have their Islam on cemented area. They're so easy to flip to the other side. And that's why you find many of them starting to be good and strong and mashallah and all of a sudden I have doubts why uh the prophet married Aisha when she was nine. Uh ooh you're a kafir. If you doubt the prophetat for a second you're a full-fledged cafeter. Get the heck out of my house. Don't even think about it. No second chances. Watch out. I don't know if I don't know why you're there laughing. Guys, I don't know any of you. With all due respect, not because you're not famous because of my ignorance. I don't watch social media. I don't watch people. I don't follow people. We are your fans though. We always watch you. Mashallah. May Allah promote you to big air conditioner. Anyhow, so the issue is I'm I'm not y punching below the belt. I don't know what you guys views are, but I'm telling you Islam is crystal clear. The prophet said, \"I've left you on Islam which is as clear as night and day. There's nothing ambiguous in it.\" So if someone has the hesitation and is not certain, you know how many counseling sessions I do over the the year? Thousands. I counsel people for money. They come to me, they pay me $220 per hour. I'm cheap. So what's what what's the problem? And they come to me and say, \"She, I'm not certain that Allah exists.\" You're kafir. And of course, watch out. If you doubt something in Islam that is beyond doubt the prophet wasallam if you look down at him if you think bad about him if you think something wrong with the Quran if you think allahel is unfair you're a kafir we don't have to beat around the bush but if you have a doubt why did this happen I'll explain it to you this is why I'm here you say I don't know why the prophet misha when she was nine and he was 50 years of of age doesn't sound good but I accept it do you think bad of the prophetam is he a pifer I would be a kafir thinking this but I just want justification I I'll explain it to you and I'll remove all doubt in your head I have no problem ah men marrying four and women marrying only one I'm a little bit dodgy about this but I embrace I can explain everything to you. The thing is if you don't have certinity, this is one of the seven conditions ofahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahillah honesty, certinity, acceptance, uh and the likes. If you don't have certinity, you're not a Muslim. What are the three questions you'll be asked in the grave? You know, no. What's your what's your Lord? Who's your messenger? What is your religion? And who's the man who was sent to you? The prophet told us two people would be placed in their graves. We did a course in Medina, the whole book. Yes. The three principal fundamentals. The first question would be the three questions will be asked to a believer and two horrible looking angels would come, grab the man, shake him up. He's dead. Huh? But he's dead and but alive in the bar life which is not if we pull him out of the grave he's dead he's a corpse but this is another level of life between this duny and the hereafter it's called bazak so they shake him violently and they say to him who's your lord what's your religion who's this man who was sent to you and he would say out of confidence my lord is Allah my religion islam and this man is Muhammad they shake him again and ask him and He confidently answered. Allah says to them, \"My servant has said the truth. Open a window from Jenna, from paradise, where the fragrance and the coolness and the blessings would come to him and let him rest.\" The other person would say, \"Huh? Huh? I don't know. People said something and I said it.\" And this is the hypocrite who says things but um yeah but I can't say anything bad because everybody's watching. So yeah, I'm a Muslim but deep down he's a hypocrite. This guy easily flips. And this is what most scares me about the people in the west that their iman is not stable. It's not cemented. It's not concrete. It can flip any time. If you manage to strengthen your religion by not only reading books because you need to walk the talk. If you read six volumes on how to swim in the ocean and you throw yourself in a swimming pool, what will happen? You'll draw like a rock. You have to practice it. So what you practice in your life, your daily routine, your masid, your salat, your Quran, your community work, this is what will help you answer in the grave. If you don't walk the talk, you will be saying, \"Huh? Huh?\" I don't know. Scary, huh? Can I ask you about that hadith specifically? Sure thing. What was the hadith? Why are the people of Yemen the best of people? The prophet did not say that they are the best in the sense of that they are the most believers. He said that they have the cleanest of hearts and the truth the most truthful and honest of rhetoric. They don't lie. That's in generality. And this is one of the ways of the prophetam of being positive. He said positive things about all the tribes in Arabia about the people in Tamim in he said this about the people of Hij. He said this about this and that because the prophet was always positive looking at the positive things of the people not looking at the negatives and to put them down. So this is not a blank a check blank for them to do whatever they want. They said that simply they have clean hearts. They don't hold a grudge and we see this among the people we know from Yemen. We know them. I'm not talking about the Houthis. So it's you can't say that this about people uh uh in generically. I hope this makes sense. Well, could you I'm don't mean to keep going on this, but could you not argue that that's racial supremacy? So what? We do know that there is racial supremacy. We do know that although blacks and whites, red and yellow are equal and they only differ with the tawa, the piety in the heart, but we also know that Allah selected the Arabs due to their language, due to their heritage, due to their uh supremacy at the time between the Bzantians, the Persians, the Jews and the Christians of maintaining a level of moral conduct and um a level of social uh justice between them at the time. But today we don't judge people by the color. If in Saudi Arabia you see this, we may have imams who are black. We have non-Arabs leading the prayer. You'll have me. I'm not originally Arab. I'm originally from Indonesia. So nobody says anything. Nobody dares to say anything with my 9 mm Glock. But still we respected and and we feel they're our homies. We have no problem. So at at at a certain time the Arabs were chosen people the same way Jews believe that they were chosen. At the Yes. And this is why Quran is in Arabic. It's not in any other language. You can have translations in many languages but Quran is Arabic. So can you say Arabs were the chosen people? No. Because we have the worst scum from the Arab world. you give we can few name few but it's not the race you don't have the uh um what is it the notion that I can say bad things about Islam because of this or that we don't have any racism in Islam blacks and whites are equal we have this we can see it everywhere my father-in-law as black as night. My father-in-law, he's black and he's the most beloved person to my life. May Allah have mercy on his soul. That doesn't make any difference. We don't have this in us. We don't think of a race. Where are Where are you? Hispanic. I'm uh I'm everything. So everything, but originally my uh mom is Filipino, my dad is black. So we we we we integrate. We don't look down at anyone. But to have this notion of no black life matters, me too movement. Don't say I'm your [Â __Â ] We don't have this nonsense. We don't have this nonsense. We're all equal. If you're black and you're thinking that, oh, you use the N word. Yeah, I did not use the N word. What's wrong with you? No, you're racist. You Come on, get a life. We're all the same uh uh u origin. I didn't choose to be white or yellow. Indonesians are yellow. Not in the sense that they're scared, but you know, and you didn't choose to be black. This is what Allah created. You be proud of it. Live to it. Don't play the victim role. It's not going to take you anywhere. We both children of Adam. Yeah. Everyone says to me, \"What are your origin?\" Especially here in in Saudi, they have this this racism stuff, tribal stuff. So, what what's your origin? My they don't know they say I got I got your answer from the beginning. You're from everywhere. Okay. So, when they say to me, \"Where do you come from? What what's your origin?\" I said I I play the serious you know role. I say my my grandfather is is a a prophet of Allah. They said whoa okay well what do you mean? Said my grandfather is Adam. Adam my grandfather's Adam as well. So what are you boasting about? We come from the same root. Tell us we're Adam. So you don't have any leverage whether you're white or black, whether from America or from Arabia or from the Far East, you're all the same. You really got a problem with the hadith, huh? Yeah. I was But I like the way you explained about generalities and the prophet not saying things negative about people like they're they're the best. They're the best. like have clean hearts. They're great. He's great. You know, people good, too. You know, also, he's not saying they're the best. He's saying a specific trait in them is good. Yep. A specific trait, their kind hearts is good in Yemen. And truthful and truthfulness. A trait is uh that's beneficial. Not best of all people. Yeah. I think I think the misunderstanding of the hadith, you read that wrong. Yeah. translation is very very problematic and this is why we say learn Arabic in a translation it could flip things all over the place there's a hadith where the prophet saysam seven are martyed other than those killed in the on the battlefield one of them is in the Arabic al means the person who dies with a plague but it also means the one who's killed with a stabbing so imagine if I and I read this in in in hadith translation in in Los Angeles. The Imam of the Masid was giving and he translated to be a stabbed person. So imagine if I'm listening to the hadith and I think, huh, if I die stabbed, I'm going to be a martyr. And a guy in Harlem says to me, \"Give me a wallet. I'm going to stab you. I would like to be a martyr. Go ahead.\" And I'm killed. Am I a martyr? Of course not. I'm I'm a nut case. Give him your wallet and save your life. But this is the translation that you have to be careful of. The prophet when he listed the companions, he said uh uh the most shy of all companions is and the most uh uh strong in the truth is Omar and the most uh person who judges among others is Ali and the most person who knows in inheritance is Z. And he started naming companions and pointing out to the best in them not meaning that the others are nothing. So this is the way of the prophet. Tomorrow inshallah we're going to go in and then it's the last 10 days of Ramadan. So we're going to be in Mecca for a few days in the Medina. What advice do you have for us in the last 10 days in Mecca Medina and some of them it's their first time doing. So what advice? My advice is you guys are the chosen one. You're the way you're not Arabs. So you are the chosen one that allahel selected you to bring you to the most purest of all regions of the world, Mecca and Medina. Utilize your time to cleanse your hearts because Allah does not look at your bodies or your wealth. This is hadith narrated by Imam Muslim reported by Imam Muslim. Allah does not look at your bodies and your wealth. Rather he looks at your hearts and deeds. No one can look at your heart. Only allahel. So utilize this time to cleanse your heart. have purify it, repent, ask Allah for forgiveness, go to Allahawel wholeheartedly and asking him for guidance and to remain steadfast on Islam. Avoid being together. Not that I want you to disunite, rather avoid being together because when you're together, you're going to waste your time chitchatting, joking, cracking jokes, talking about things here and there. and that's not helpful for you, have quality time with Allah. Just be there with Allah. Reflect on your past life. Reflect on how much time left for you on earth and utilize the best of it. And inshallah it's going to be a transformational period for you guys. I'm engaging proposing to a woman. First one. First one. And uh the sunnah is what is it you guys called? Yeah. Yeah. The prophet said, \"You have to go and look at the one you're proposing to because ideally you don't know the woman.\" Of course, if you've been going out steady for four or five years, you don't want to exaggerate looking at her again. It's going to put me off. No, no. Talking about ideally. So yes, you go and propose and if they accept you after doing the due diligence and check on you, you have to have a a an interview with the woman for the first time in the presence of her father. This is when you get to look at her, take a good look at how she looks, communicate with her for half an hour or an hour, exchanging views of polygamy. Don't ever open the topic in such incidents because they're going to kick you out of the house. Um, I have a video on this. I'm telling him whoever opens this topic, get kick his butt out of the house cuz this guy is bad news. Anyone who goes to say, \"Listen, we're getting married. I think you're good girl, but I'm giving you a heads up. I'm going to get married again. Maybe a third time. Get the hell out of my house.\" I thought being straight up works though, right? The what? Being straight up. You got to be No, no, no. This is being stupid, you know. Anyhow, so the question is, is she allowed to come in normal house clothes or she has to abide by the hijab? It's an issue of dispute. I'm inclined to the opinion that says she can come with her hair exposed wearing normal decent clothes, zero makeup, zero eyeliners so that he would see her as she is. Of course, not wearing tights or miniscirts, decent clothes. So where I can see her face, her her hair and and maybe part of her uh arms. This is totally halal. I hope this has bro Yemen they're very strict with it like they have good hearts and honest Yemen they never they always come with a hijab you know this is cultural but again the majority of scholars follow this opinion but says you can I get to see I get to give my yes you can let's take a group picture apologize if I offended anyone That was quick. I had 30 more questions. Next round. Or you have to pay for it. I go put it on. What is what is the DM that you just"
