  "transcript": "Maz from the UK Maz Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh I don't think you would have got a question like this before but it's also like a bit funny basically If a husband finds his wife too attractive and you know, if she's around he's always distracted He can't focus on his work and get his tasks done. Is it permissible to ask his wife to cover up? No, it's not he should man up and ask Allah Azza wa Jal to grant him the ability to be grateful and Thankful and show his gratitude to Allah Azza wa Jal What kind of a person? would have a gorgeous wife and ask her to cover up and What kind of a man who would be distracted by the beauty of his wife after a week? Come on, give me a break. This is not a funny question. This is a mental illness with such a person Who is distracted by the beauty of his wife instead of? enjoying what Allah made halal for him and making the best of every minute with such a wife and Showing his gratitude to Allah. He wants to cover her up What about if he finds money in his bank account? after years of saving Wouldn't that distract him as well? I can send you my bank account If you want to not be distracted, this is not Logical nor normal. May Allah Azza wa Jal protect us all"
