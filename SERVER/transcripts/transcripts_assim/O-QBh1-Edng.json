  "transcript": "the topic of our imams beautifully recite did to us in the second the concept of can we remove the echo well that's difficult to remove the echoing so now any I take this off okay any so what is is a straight line and we say the Straight Path so was defined by many many scholars in different ways a lot of them said and avoiding shik like Abu Bakr said may Allah be pleased with him and Omar said is to be straight and not go around like a fox and in essence is to abide by Allah's rulings and religion and Shar and the issue is to abide to hold on to to practice to implement to walk the talk and some defined it as to hold on to the Sunnah of the Prophet whatever the prophet does muhamad this is now a lot of us know the rulings and the truth rarely you will find among those who know it those who implement it until they die upon it and this is why we have Peaks and valleys someday you wake up mallah you feel you can conquer the whole world and some some days you wake up and you question yourself am I a hypocrite am I a cafir what's happening to me so when you don't have the proper is when your IM fluctuate but sometimes it can be really really dangerous Allah says in the Quran indeed those who have said our Lord is Allah so they confessed by saying it but this is not enough you have to follow what you say with actions so Allah says indeed those who have said our Lord is Allah and then remained on a right course there will be no fear concerning them nor will they grieve sufd may Allah be pleased with him came to the prophet and the Arabs don't like to speak a lot like they do today the Arabs Mah they speak speak speak speak speak no actions they don't have any results only talk we will do this we will come con we will free Palestine go sleep and eat some sambusa some shba before you go to bed so you don't feel hungry they only talk sufan abdah may Allah be pleased with him he was a real Arab he came to the prophet Alat wasam he said tell me something in Islam I do not need to ask anyone else don't give me a lot of talk that I cannot Implement give me few words that I can Implement and I will be inshallah successful the prophet said to [Music] him say my Lord is Allah I believe in Allah then remain on the straight path exactly like this Ayah so saying is not enough we all say we all say this is why the Sala used to say all people are doomed except those who have knowledge and all people who have knowledge are doomed except those who implement this knowledge into deeds and all those who implement this knowledge into Deeds are doomed EX except those who are sincere and those who are sincere are in great danger so when we come and look at ourselves we are doomed definitely unless Allah Asel casts his mercy upon us and shower us with it so how is it that can we can be on this well number one you cannot be saved as youth or even as Elders unless you have the correc AA and we always hear the scholars of Islam saying AA comes first but what is AA what is the definition of AA everyone says oh the of this and that what is it's not something you talk about it is not something you can say this is a it's a package deal that includes your conviction of Allah the pillars of IM how to glorify Allah how to reveal the Quran the prophet Muhammad to believe in the Unseen all of these combined constitute your a and when we look today at what we have with the social media the influx and the expansion and the explosion of social media this has led to the corruption of our a without us knowing us why because we learn from people we do not know someone who popped up last week oh he has how many followers wow 200,000 you should be good so we judge people by what the number of followers the number of likes whether they're funny or not I like he's Savage he's rude he's awesome he's I will follow him you crazy why do you follow me I always walk in the streets and I look behind me who's following me they have to explain it to them well anyhow sorry I I speak sometimes and I don't any pay attention so don't follow me please huh when I'm walking you can follow me on social media anyhow you have to look at whom you take your religion from because so many today have corrupt AA someone comes and says oh Muslim rulers are cfir oh Muslims are all in hell because they fornicate they drink wine they do this they're all cfir this is his a is corrupt yeah but he's very f i I like him I no he's you cannot follow him or someone who comes to you and says Allah is everywhere what do you mean yeah Allah is maybe let me are you crazy Allah is on the on the seventh heaven no no no no this is you're not correct Allah is everywhere this is not true someone says you say you're in Jen you do whatever you want you do you do here you do drugs you do intoxicants you go to nightclubs no problem you're in Jenna you say this is so what is the correct a this is what you have opened for yourself a can of worms and now the worms are all over you you're not following Quran and Sunnah you're following any Tom Dick and Harry where did you get your religion from Tik Tok mashallah this is where you get your religion from tick Tok yeah I saw a she very long beard not as long as yours she but very long and he said something and I I believed it what's his name I don't know who are his Scholars I don't know how long you've known him two weeks and you're taking your religion from Tik Tok you're crazy is the most important thing Scholars you learn from have to be on the manhaj not only halam and quoting verses of the Quran and Hadith and that's it no even their has to be good their practice has to be good their Association you get some Mah sitting with women and laughing and it's okay so laughing in your Muslim brother's face is brother not sister we don't have any gender discrimination watch out you cannot be without having pure this is what will make you walk safely on the on without the correct you will fall definitely you'll crawl definitely so number one is a and number two to follow the Sunnah and this Mah now is Allah huhh number two is to have on the what's the opposite so the moment you see someone doing something that the prophet did not doat but he says this is good I celebrate the m m is you everything yeah but the prophet didn't celebrate M right theak Ali they didn't celebrate M no so you want to be with them in you want follow them you love the prophet and love the day he was born in fast every Monday fast every Thursday oh fasting is too much why sh if I don't take my shot of latte in the morning I can't go to work and then excuse me where is your so avoid avoid making Innovative avoid making oh oh I love the prophet I will do I see people making Sal on Prophet what are you doing I said come on let's dance what are you doing I said offering salutation upon the prophet but why are you clapping he said no this is and all of this Innovation Sal they have never heard of in the Quran and the Sunnah avoid Innovation because the prophet sallallah Ali wasallam said whoever innovates in our religion what's not part of it it is what rejected Allah will throw it in your face not accepted Allah will say I sent you the Quran I sent you Muhammad with authentic sunah and you said this is not enough I will invent something new I have this Salah it's very nice I will pray like a gazillion Salah I have VI I will have these prayer beads and I say Allah what are you doing mallah you going to fly now all of this is and it's not part of the and whoever creates a and spreads it he has killed a so you are destroying the Sunnah of the Prophet Alat why do people commit arrogance will you tell them you have to follow the Sunnah they say no I have something better the prophet did not do it you know better he said maybe the prophet did not know about it you know better Allah says today I have completed your religion perfected my grace and favor upon you and accepted Islam to be your religion Allah said completed your religion he said yeah yeah but we have few things missing I'd like to make these things Haram you cannot have without purifying your soul without dealing with good we have problem with people who say we have correcta we are following the Sunnah we are on the correct manh masallah and theirl is zi yeah zift is like tar is like SP their is bad they are rude they are arrogant they sit and backbite everyone what about Abdullah Abdullah is innovator what about Ahmed oh Ahmed is a hypocrite what about is oh he's this he's that he's this and they start labeling people left right and Center okay look in the mirror what do you see allahar this is the Sunnah they see that they themselves are the best and this is a very bad sign if you're not humbl by your own shortcomings and flaws if you're not humbled by the Quran and the Sunnah and the knowledge you have you are not on the the prophet saidat I was merely sent to perfect and to complete the best of moral conduct and he said the closest to me in Jenna on the day of judgment are those who have good manners good look at us when we leave the Masjid what happens shold and they he grab people and throw him with with wrestling moves why I have to go first look at us when we're driving do when you go to other countries people say please go what do we do we never give the right of way to people we're always number one why because we don't have we don't have generosity Mercy compassion and this shows you that we are not on the the prophet saidat a man with his with his moral conduct and manners reaches the level in Jenna of a person who prays all night and fasts all day with your and you can ask people how is the AK of XYZ if they compliment him and say that he's generous he's courageous he's kind he's caring know that inshallah he's from the people of jenah every day we ask Allah to guide us to the straight path why do we do this because without Allah guiding us we will never ever be on the and this is why the prophet used to make a lot of Dua by saying oh Allah grant me the sense of piety and purify my soul as you are the best to purify it and he used to often ask Allah oh Turners of heart make my heart steadfast on Islam then from this we know that guidance can only be through what through Allah no one can bring you and guidance except Allah otherwise n could have guided his son ibraim could have guided his father Muhammad could have guided his own beloved Uncle how can we reach there are a number of factors but the time is quite limited I think but we will just wrap it up as fast as we can the best way of is a righteous upbringing and this is the responsibility of the parents when you're blessed with good parents who raise you on practicing Islam on on good manners on walking the talk this is a blessing from Allah and inshallah you will grow up to be a person of you will be on the straight path and this is why the prophet saidat every newborn is born upon F the natural inclination of Islam but his parents make him a Jew a Christian or a fire worshipper so the parents have huge influence as well as the environment but when Allah blesses you with good parents then this is one of the main reasons for and this is why the prophet emphasized Muhammad that you choose the best wife who's righteous practicing and wise everybody's thinking oh she it's too late I already chose one we go for the second one is it okay don't take my word for it don't ask me be happy with the one you have and try to invest in it and work hard on making her like this inshallah and also the prophet saidat if a man with righteousness and good akl proposes then marry him and this means that they have a huge impact number two knowledge knowledge is the best way to become righteous and knowledge is not memorizing only the Quran so many people memorize the Quran and fail miserably not because they memorize the Quran but because they only focused on how to recite how to make Taj how to beautify their voices but their conduct is totally against the Quran the Quran says don't deal in riba and they have a mortgage ISL Quran says don't lie and they're the biggest Liars don't backbite don't cheat don't do this don't do that and they go against the Quran so knowledge means the fear of Allah in your heart you can be illiterate you can't read you can be someone who doesn't speak Arabic doesn't read the Quran doesn't know theith but when F calls you're in the first row behind the IM and when voluntary work is open you're the first volunteer you pray night prayer you do Witter you fast Mondays and Thursdays you make a a lot of Vick but you don't know what is this Hadith authentic or you don't memorize the Quran this is the most knowledgeable of all of us because he has reached the peak of knowledge only those who are knowledgeable those only are the one who fear Allah so the knowledge is fear not only memorizing also among the things that would make you upon the is to go through the of our Prophet Muhammad Alat wasam to learn how he lived where he went how he treated everyone around him and this by knowing it it's like brainwashing you're brainwashing but in a good sense because now you live with the prophet Alat wasam you know how he treated his wives his children his grandchildren his neighbors his companions the new Muslims the disbelievers how he treated the Hypocrites how he visited the sick how he lived his day last week Allah blessed me to be in Kuwait and I did a workshop it's called a day in the life of the Prophet Alat wasam where we tried to gather in about 7 hours or less how the prophet started the day from f after f d before when did he sleep his nap what he did after till after after how he slept and then night prayer it's on my YouTube channel it's free but each one of us has to know it is extremely shameful when I ask people when did the Battle of UD take place and people say masallah huh he said long time ago mashallah very good good answer sit down what year of Hijra did it take place don't know and people say I have no idea I ask people how many years did the prophet live in Mecca um I don't know how many years did he live in Medina I have no idea what do you know it's very shameful so when you know the of your Prophet Alat you love him and when you love him you follow him step by step until you reach Jah but you don't follow him you don't know his s what are you ah I'm a Swifty sheh what do you mean I'm I'm I'm a Swifty I follow Taylor Swift sorry what are you doing all the youth now are engaged on Instagram on YouTube on Snapchat following celebrities cafir celebrities and they know everything about their lives if you love Prophet Muhammad you want to be with him you have to study his he once you study his and love him you will be on the also among the ways of being in is to learn what Allah has prepared for his righteous servants in Jah if we ask people what will you find in Jenna oh a lot of food a lot of drink okay what else I don't know but it will be very nice this is not enough you you if I'm traveling to zenbar or am I going to Dar Salam Tanzania I will Google every in there where am I going to stay what are the attractions what are the currency what is the weather you want to go to Jenna you have to study it and you want to stay away from Hellfire and the more you read about it the more you get more knowledge and you will become on the one of the best books I highly recommend that you buy maybe it's on online free it's called it's called Heaven and Hell written by Dr Omar he has beautiful on on the angels on the Jin and the Devils on the signs of minor signs and major signs of and the and the messengers and their messages all of these books extremely beneficial and very light to read it's not very complicated or you know you need someone to explain it to you it's very very and it's mostly authentic inshallah among the things that you make you on is a good companion who is your companion take your mobile phone open your contact list and tell me which one is a righteous companion that you would like to meet Allah with him he said oh delete delete delete delete delete delete delete delete all I don't have any righteous companions why well this companion he's very good in cracking you know filthy jokes we like to sit and listen to him this one always gives us DVDs of the latest movies he's good one this one is mashallah he knows people in the government he can cut red tape and this one well we go to play football this one we go to play hockey this one we go the who among your contact is that helps you get closer to Allah that helps you to go for om that helps you to come to the Masjid attend lectures that you would call what's the ruling on drinking camels milk does it break my woodoo yes or no I'm asking fatwa huh camel milk doesn't break W yes huh no difference of opinion among Scholars this is not the time alhamdulillah we will not uh uh discuss this so you need righteous practicing friends they will correct you when you're wrong they will guide you when you're misguided bring you to the straight path you need them but how many do we have very little sometimes your bad companion drags you to the ground to the bottom why it's time for M and all of my friends they don't want to pray M should I go uh okay guys I'm going to pray m m make Dua for usah mallah he goes to pray in M very ashamed he comes back tomorrow comes he doesn't go for prayer he's ashamed these companions take you straight to hell so you have to choose your companions Allah says in the Quran close friends on the day of judgment will be enemies to each other close friends on the day of judgment will be enemies they were close friends but now they're enemies except for the righteous my righteous friends we will never be enemies we will take hand in hand in Jenna inshallah finally you have to always remember the last day you have to remember death you have to remember that soon you will die when will you die when will you die I hope soon because we're bored of you when will you die soon I will die soon when Allah knows are you ready inshallah I'm ready what what what am I waiting for inshallah I'm ready but I hope that I don't have to suffer I don't have to be bedridden I hope that nobody would have to change my diapers and take me to the toilet and wash me and people are saying Ya Allah he lived so long when is he going to die I hope that my death comes quick but on on sh and and may Allah give us all a good death but are you prepared do you have debts you did not pay off do you have rights of people you have taken unlawfully nobody knows about it I made money he I well I fooled him I took his money and he doesn't know you will pay in your grave return everything that is unlawful today now not tomorrow and prepare yourself for death so that when death comes you say you're happy because I was waiting for this moment to come until when do you want to live I heard of he lived 9 150 years so maybe 800 years good 700 years alhamdulillah the average age of my umah the prophet says is 60 to 70 if you're over 70 you have extra time bonus overtime what are you waiting for ah 75 75 what are you waiting for 80 80 what are you waiting for Allah no always prepare prepare yourself for this moment and embrace it because no one will ever escape it if anyone were to live it would have been Muhammad wasam he died when he was how old I don't know a long time ago 63 years Abu Bakr how old 63 Omar 63 so what are we waiting foras therefore when you remember that you're going to die everything seems fine no worries of debts no worries of problems calamities because I'm going to die I'm going to get rid of all of this and I pray to Allah asael that he finally grants us the last thing that would help us be on and that is Dua always ask Allah for always ask Allah forat to be steadfast always ask Allah for Al what should I ask the prophet said so we ask Allah to have a on us and once we have this and we make Dua and Allah would give us inshallah this happy ending and the ability to be on"
