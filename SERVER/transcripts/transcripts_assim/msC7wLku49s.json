  "title": "Believing and Playing Games that include Jinns, Demons, & Satan   SHIRK",
  "transcript": "Farhan from India. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. I heard a game which is known as a four corner game and people start to make up stories like it's used to detect demons or Satan in your house and some people say it really works so there are other games floating around like this and is believing in these games and playing these games shirk and thank you Jazakallah Khair. I do not know these games and whether they're shirk or not but anything that involves jinn and demons and the likes would probably be either sinful or shirk depending on the intention, depending on the context, the storyline and the likes. A Muslim avoids such games totally."
