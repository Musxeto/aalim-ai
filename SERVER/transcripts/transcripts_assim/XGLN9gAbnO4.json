  "transcript": "um I've been watching a lot of quote-unquote Ghost Hunters on YouTube these Ghost Hunters utilize equipment to presumably communicate with ghosts obviously we as Muslims know that ghosts aren't real and that these people are actually speaking with demons now shake these Ghost Hunters utilize different types of equipment for their paranormal investigations some of the paraphernalia in these investigations include the Spirit box and the EVP which are devices allegedly capable of having humans communicate with demons but the authenticity of these devices are disputed and they may be bogus another device which is perhaps more authentic is the rempod which is a device that has a magnetic field surrounding it if demons penetrate this magnetic field the device starts emitting sound along with blinking lights so Shake I'm interested in perhaps purchasing a select few items to determine if there is any demon in my house and subsequently recite the last two groups of stood up in conjunction with other powerful verses from the Quran mind you I do remember reading somewhere that communication with demons in Islam no matter the intention is strictly forbidden to my knowledge communication with the demons isn't necessary for the rampart to work so would it be permissible for me to use device solely as opposed to the Spirit box and the EVP which would require me to communicate with these demons and are probably fake devices which are worthless crap may Allah bless you first of all what you see is old bogus is all fabrication they are fooling the masses with these things to intimidate them to make them live in a fantasy and all these rubbish is rubbish so regardless of the names of the devices they're claiming that may allow you to communicate with the Jinn we know that Allah tells us that the Jinn can see us and we cannot see them and we know that they have no power over us as long as we protect ourselves with that car save your money and save your e-man why would I say save your Iman because the moment you go that route shaytan is gonna haunt you and he's going to make you think that yep I have established contact with the Jinn and I have gin in my house the machine says that there are presence of the Jinn so what every Muslim knows that there are gin in his house the Jinn are all over us are they with you Sheikh within the studio yes they are you won't have a genie coming behind me I hope you don't uh and and saying that here I am so there is a genie or number of Genies they're all around us even when we enter the toilet they're inside the toilets so how can I answer the call of nature the prophet tells us say Bismillah this is a visor and a screen between the eyes the vision of the Jinn and our own Aura they can't see us when we take off our clothes in the toilet if we say Bismillah so this is a way way cheaper solution and alternative to what you have come up with don't buy any stuff don't watch these movies or shows because they're all bogus you don't need Ghostbusters you have I tell Kersey you have uh the last two verses of uh Surat al-baqarah that prevents the Jinn from entering the Devils from entering your home for three days and nights and if you believe in the Quran the Sunnah you're safe if you say you're a car in the morning in the evening after the farts a lot before going to bed and before leaving your house you're protected but to believe in such nonsense and bogus stuff coming to you from the kuffar about the Jinn this is totally unaccepted"
