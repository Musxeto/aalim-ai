  "title": "Is a woman SINFUL for stipulating in her Nikkah for her husband NOT to take a 2nd Wife",
  "transcript": "and we have nisha from japan japan it's only five six thousand miles apart no problem yes you have posted uh one query on your page that said a woman is allowed to put this condition on her marriage contract that while the person is in you know nika with her she does not want him to take another wife right yes sir we can put this condition yes surely those uh that query there were all those comments and everything a lot of people kept on saying and i even asked a few people i'm not sure if they are knowledgeable around but everybody said that you cannot put something or ask for something that is already allowed in the sunnah okay that a woman is going against sunnah and that's sinful she's sinful for doing this okay i just want why is it allowed if it is you know i will answer inshallah ishaab from jeddah she said that on my facebook i think or instagram or whatever she read a post where i said and this is not what i say it's what the scholars say i do not shoot from the hip i don't say things from my own mind this is what the scholars say if you go back to their classical books you will find this condition mentioned a woman has the right to ask for divorce and she is awarded it as a condition if her husband were to take a second wife without her permission and she read the comments and she said the comments were heinous and in the beginning like 10 years ago i used to be a little bit saddened by such comments but then my skin got thick and i don't care anymore why because those who comment are ignorant imbeciles with all due respect and i don't know them so i'm not pointing and saying out of my ivory tower that these guys are imbeciles they're ignorant i don't specifically mention someone by name i'm just talking generally those who comment negatively like this and say no this is making halal things haram etc have zero knowledge in islam if they sit with me face to face they don't even know how to clean themselves after answering the call of nature if i ask them simple things and i've done this gazillion times i ask people what are the pillars of iman so yeah yeah i know the pillars of you man no this is the pillars of islam you schmuck you have to have understanding of your religion you don't know you don't know fairque you don't know quran you don't know hadith yet you have the audacity to come and comment about things that are mentioned in the books of philip and the scholars agree upon it without any knowledge you just comment so with all due respect who cares what these guys comment upon so many people call not to add value rather to be heard on tv so um how do you think i should comb my hair what is this they just want to be heard or to make a point not to add value or to correct my mistake or to benefit the the listeners or to learn themselves so don't pay attention to the comments i did not say this woman made something no it's her right so if she says i want to put a condition that he does not force me to live with his parents oh she's making that haram no that's her right make a condition i don't want to travel outside my city so if he's really relocating in another country i don't want to go and if he insists i have the right to ask for divorce without any compensation he gets he is forced to give me a divorce likewise marrying a second wife wasn't it fatima may allah be pleased with her who ali wanted and thought of marrying the daughter of abu jahl and when the prophet heard this he said this is not possible because this saddens and angers and harms fatima and whatever harms her harms me i don't say that it is haram to marry i don't say that it is halal things they are haram the prophet says he's not changing the religion but the daughter of the enemy of allah and the daughter of the prophet of allah cannot be together so ali stopped did the prophet make anything haram no so this is the woman's right to ask for whatever she wants as a contract her right is to continue to study until she gets her bachelor degree if the man agrees then he's obliged to fulfill the right or do you divorce her and likewise with the marriage you"
