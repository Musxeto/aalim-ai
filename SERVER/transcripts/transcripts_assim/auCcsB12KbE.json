  "transcript": "Nair is asking about is it allowed to conduct condolence meetings to remember to praise and to do Dua for the deceased person or deceased body and the answer is no this was not by done by the prophet Alam and it was not done by the companions may Allah be pleased with them and on the contrary may Allah be pleased with him tells us that the companions of the Prophet used to consider such a meeting or prepare preparation of food and inviting people to it they used to consider this as part of whining over the decease which is a major sin and that is why what the people do after a deceased is dead especially here in Saudi Arabia in Egypt they do the same where it's even worse where they go outside of the house and they put lots of loads of chairs to receive the people between and and they hire people to come and pour coffee and tea and they some of them even hire a Sheikh to recite Quran and they have this format when the Sheik is reciting everybody's sitting once he stops and pauses between a like a break like we've just done they all stand up and go to the family of the deceased who sit in one uh in another area in a row and they give their condolences all of this is an innovation and it is part of whining that the prophet Alam forbade us to do other people give even go a little bit further so they have uh this commemoration on the 40th Day of his death and this is uh something they got from the Pharaohs because they believe that after 40 days of the death of an individual or their kings or or whatever they will be resurrected and that's why they put horses and gold and food and drink in their pyramids for them but Muslims now are doing it and this is wrong they commemorate his memory after a whole year a full year of his death on that specific day and all of this is part of the Innovations"
