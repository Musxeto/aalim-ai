  "title": "What to do when someone is backbiting, leave or hate it in my heart",
  "transcript": "zade says i know that we denounce evil with hand speech or tongue but sometimes when i go to a shop like a meat shop there i have to wait for my turn to come but most of the time someone starts backbiting listening to music doing something haram etc and because of weak faith i cannot tell them anything so what am i to do leave that place or sitting there hating in my heart same situation with family if we're sitting in the room and they start backbiting first of all we can't 24 hours seven days a week be the religious police i cannot go down the street where i meet a thousand people one is smoking smoking is haram one is shaven shaving the videos haram one wearing the at his thumb or his trousers below the ankles this is haram this is a major sin one is backbiting one is listening to music one uh is not doing this it's not my duty to go and be the religious police monitoring people auditing them forcing them to do what is right and forbidding them from what is wrong why number one this is beyond human ability number two people will not accept this from you which means that the consequences of my action would be negative and that would far away outweigh the positive that i was anticipating number three this was not the doing of the companions to my knowledge all their time yes if i'm in a gathering if there is benefit from it if there is an individual i can address but when everything around me is corrupt and sinful for me to go and do all of these things that would put me out of gas and it would exhaust me and it would most likely backfire at me by me feeling weak in faith and hopeless maybe despair and this is all negatives what should i do first of all remember the hadith of the prophet that whoever sees evil must denounce it either by hand if not possible then by um by um tongue rhetoric if not possible then by heart so if you're possible or you're able to do all of these things then yes you have to give it a go within your human ability plus while anticipating positive response so if i'm with someone in a room and there is two or three other people probably it's a suitable environment for me to open a topic with him maybe first break the ice then choose and select something that might be beneficial by talking something remotely not related and then bring the topic at hand but to just fire at him and say your beard your smoking your though and it seems that you don't pray in the masjid and i think you deal with river so fear allah azza he would not take anything from me he would not accept anything from me not only that he would label anyone with a beard like myself to be extremist and he will keep his distance from because such people are rude and offensive this is not the right way of giving dawah one has to be diplomatic has to be wise and has to give fair preaching and know when to speak and when not to speak and allah knows best you"
