  "transcript": "Shahid from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu So Sheikh my question was that you know there is no masjid in my vicinity so I'm not able to pray taraweeh in the masjid but like I have the intention of praying it so I pray at home whatever I can maybe not that perfect but I pray at home will I ever get the reward of praying taraweeh in the masjid? Do I have this intention like if it was there near my house I would have done so? Well Akhi this is an issue that only Allah Azza Wa Jal has the ability to answer because this is in Allah's hands. We know that whoever prays in the masjid behind an imam until the imam concludes his night prayer Allah would reward him as if he prayed the whole night. Someone who does not pray in the masjid though he is eager to pray in the masjid but there is no masjid in his vicinity would he get the same reward? This is in Allah's hands so my advice for you is to pray as much as you can and try to read as much as you can from the Qur'an while in qiyam in night prayer and hopefully Allah would reward you for that and Allah knows best."
