  "title": "Doubt if I was in 2nd or 3rd Rakat, what to do, should I repeat the prayer? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Sumaiyah from the UK. So once I prayed Isha and inside the prayer I couldn't remember if I did my second rak'ah and my sister was in the room with me and I decided and I think it was a period where I had lots of huswas, lots of doubts in the Salat so I made it my third. I had the doubt like whether I did my second or third. I said this is my third rak'ah and I concluded the prayer and I asked my sister and she told me that she didn't see me. Now I tried to remember why I made that rak'ah the third and I couldn't remember whether I was inclined or not so should I repeat the prayer? Now take it as a rule of thumb, whatever doubts you get after the ibadah is over, these are whispers from shaytan, ignore and move on. Example, I am doing tawaf from the Ka'bah and we are in the season of Hajj. I'm supposed to finish seven rounds. On the sixth round I get a doubt, is this the sixth or the seventh? I could not figure it out. What should I do? Act upon certainty. I'm doubting whether this is the sixth or the seventh. Where is the doubt in the seventh? Cast the doubt away so this is my sixth. Finish it, add one more, that's it. My ibadah is 100% valid. Now imagine I finished my tawaf and I'm going through sa'i or I finished my whole umrah and I went to my hotel room and then I get these thoughts that did I make six rounds around the Ka'bah or seven? Now the ibadah is over, the tawaf is over and when it was over I had no doubts. These doubts that coming up now are from shaytan, ignore it and toss it in the dustbin as if they do not exist, don't pay attention to it. Likewise, after you thought to the best of your knowledge that this is my third and you completed your prayer as such, finish, the prayer is over, after that if you get doubts why did I do this? Why did I assume it was three not two or four? You ignore such doubts because these doubts came after you made the best of your ability to determine whether it is two or three and acted upon it and finished your salat and your prayer is valid insha'Allahu azza wa jal."
