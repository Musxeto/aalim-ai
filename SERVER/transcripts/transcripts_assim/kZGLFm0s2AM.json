  "transcript": "on fasting our own birthdays and the origin of this is that the Prophet erase a lot Sam used to fast Mondays and Thursdays so when he was asked sallallaahu Selim why do you fast the day of Monday he said Salalah Selim this is a day that I was born in and allah azza wajal had sent a revelation to me first on it so he first became a prophet and a messenger of allah Sajid on a monday so as a form of gratitude the Prophet Allah so salam commemorates this beautiful day every week by fasting it so mmm now this is a tough one can one fast the day of his birthday some say that well if the Prophet did it is salat WA Salam then might as well we do it but there is a problem here the Prophet arezzo son did not fast the 9th of Rabi al-awwal which is the most authentic opinion of his date of birth not the 12th or a beer the 9th so the Prophet never racism highlighted the 9th or the 12th of Rabi al-awwal he did not give any of them any preference but he chose the day of the week which is Monday and he chose it for two reasons so it was not only because he was born in it but also because the revelation of Allah first came to him on it so some scholars say if you were born for example on a Wednesday and you want to fast every Wednesday this is ok permissible the Prophet did it you can do it as some others said no the Prophet did it for two reasons and you have only one so it is best to restrict with the reasons that the Prophet gave Ali saw something that is fasting Mondays Thursdays every three white days of the month etc are sure a day out of a day every alternate day all of this is part of the Sunnah no problem but to say that I want to fast on the day they I was born in this is not right and Eliza Hill knows best"
