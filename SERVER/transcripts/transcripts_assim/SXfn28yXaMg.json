  "transcript": "uh cave from india says pictures on the video or videos on my mobile if they're stills and their photographs not edited there's no problem providing it's not full of women or of deceased but if it is stills that are drawn and and pictures that people have made and you put it as your background or the likes this is not recommended if we would not say it's haram it is totally not befitting a muslim to have this and allah azzawajal knows best"
