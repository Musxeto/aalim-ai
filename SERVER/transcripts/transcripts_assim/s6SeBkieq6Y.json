  "transcript": "Suhail from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh My question is Sheikh, a week ago I made a mistake in Fatiha, instead of pronouncing Mustaqeem, I pronounced Mustaqeem So I don't know, I literally don't know how many times I have done this in Salah in order to catch the Imam Suhail, Suhail, what did you change in Mustaqeem? I think I changed the Zeer from upper, it is the lower Zeer but I pronounced the upper Zeer But I thought that time it is correct Can you pronounce it again please? Mustaqeem, Mustaqeem, like this Yeah you said the M at the end, Mustaqeem Yes That's fine, you have nothing to worry about"
