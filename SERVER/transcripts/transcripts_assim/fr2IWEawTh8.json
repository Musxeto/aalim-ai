  "transcript": "alhamdulillah it is a very sad moment actually it's the saddest moment Humanity had ever witnessed and that is when the prophet sallallah alaihi Al wasallam passed away and we spoke about this before and how that the prophet Alat wasam suffered before dying and this was so that his level would be elevated at the S of Allah Asel and he explained that this life is a test and the more a person is righteous the more his heart is filled with Iman the more test Allah puts on him and that is why the prophet saidat the most of the people to be tested in life are the prophets and then the righteous and then those who are lesser and lesser in IM every person the prophet saysat is tested according his Iman so if he has strong Iman Allah would test him strongly and if he has weak Iman may Allah have mercy on us Allah will test him lightly and that is why when you see the tests that Allah is testing us you know that we don't have strong Iman because we have we have everything we want we have three meals a day not only that maybe five meals a day we have a roof on our heads all of us are in good health relatively speaking everything we want we can find and get and buy Allah says if you count the favors and blessings of Allah you cannot calculate them there's so many yet the greatest and saddest moment in the history of humanity is when our Prophet wasam died when he died the companions did not know what to do so where shall we bury him some said we should bury him this place some said no don't move him until they learned that the prophet saidat wasam all Messengers and prophets of Allah when they die they're buried where they're dead they are not moved out so they knew what to do regarding the burial grounds but they did not know what to do regarding washing him and they heard some sound from the house and most likely it was an angel telling them that keep his clothes on because some of the companion said let's take all of his clothes off and wash him like we wash all the dead people and they heard a voice telling them don't do this so after washing him they want wanted to wrap him in shrouds and as we know all the dead are wrapped in the shrouds and this is something that we should contemplate on because most of you probably did not wash dead people and some of you may have I have washed dead people relatives and friends and it is a sight that frightens you he's dead so what's a big deal we take off his clothes if it's difficult to take off we cut it by scissors only me two people three people and then we cover his a area from the naval to the knee we bring the water we prepare it we put the cider in it until there's a foam in it and we prepare the perfumes we prepare the soap or whatever we look at his fingernails if they need clipping we clip them his mustache if it's needs trimming we trim it and then we put the cotton in his nose cleaning it cleaning his teeth he's dead yesterday he was talking to me yesterday we were having laughs now he's dead so we do this sometimes without thinking and many times we not think about our loved ones that we're washing we think about ourselves when people are washing us how it's going to be if I were lying on this wooden bed and people are washing me how much would I pay to go back to life so that I can repent to Allah how much would I give from my fortune from anything that I have so that Allah would give me the chance to pray two Ras on time we have a lot of sins yeah yet we always have Shan at the back of our heads telling us it's okay it's okay take your time you still have long to live how old are you 60 oh you have 30 years to go I know a neighbor of mine who's 90 years old and if you go to the man who's 90 years old and ask him when are you going to die Grandpa he says H I've heard of someone in the north of the country whove reached 110 so 110 and US humans never lose hope we keep on thinking that we will live till ever and we never think that there is a possibility that I'm going to die after an hour and so many times I have friends I have loved ones they tell me on the phone so and so just died how is that possible well this is life death does not knock the door and say can I come in therefore we should be prepared now going back to our Hadith we have Hadith number 158 the Hadith was narrated by may Allah be pleased with her she said that the prophet of Allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam was shrouded in three cotton garments of white y stuff from sahul among which was neither a shirt nor a turban so the scholars said from this Hadith that the ideal and the best way of shrouding a dead person is in three pieces of cloth and it is highly recommended that it is white because the prophet Alat wasam praised the color white by saying that wear it when you're alive and shroud your dead when they die so the white color is the best of colors and that is why we wear it when we go for and it has to be clean so you don't bring dirty shrouds or dirty clothes to shroud him in not only that the Sunnah is to put some incense to it and you know the incense that that you burn and you bring the clothes on top of it so that when you put it on the dead person and you carry it whenever it passes by some people they will find a good smell of it and this is the Sunnah and Scholars differed whether to use three pieces of cloths for both men and women or three only for men and five for women it's an issue of dispute among Scholars and the most authentic opinion in my view is that women have to be shrouded in five why because they are supposed to be protected more than men the shrouds that the prophet was wrapped in it did not have a shirt and it did not have a turban which means that a man or a woman must not wear a shirt or a turban when they are being wrapped and shrouded after they are washed this is the Sunnah of the Prophet moving on to Hadith 159 this Hadith was narrated by may Allah be pleased with her and she used to be a professional in washing the dead female companions and this we have in every Community there are people who charge money for it but when they charge money they are not rewarded by Allah do you know that if you wash a dead person and you do not disclose anything that is bad you had seen Allah will forgive you not one not five not 10 Allah will forgive you 40 times as in the Hadith and whoever gives the Shroud for the deceased Allah would give him clothes from the silk in Paradise he will grant him reward him clothes made of silk in Paradise this is what a person who washes the debt for the sake of Allah would be rewarded 40 times Allah would forgive you we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be asalam alaykum and welcome back may Allah be pleased with her she has a number of hadiths related to women and women only for example she's the one who narrated The Hadith about seeing the brownish and yellowish discharge after Purity when the menis is over and she's the one who narrated The Hadith of the Prophet instructing the women and those who are in their menes and The Virgins in their seclusion to go out for Eid prayer and a number of different hadiths related to these topics which meant that she had more knowledge than other women when it came to issues related to women now she says may Allah be pleased with her that the prophet of Allah sallallahu alaihi alh wasallam came to us when we were bathing his daughter and his daughter was Zab the wife of Abul when she night the prophet Alat wasam visited them as they were washing his daughter and he told us wash her with water and with leaves of the lot tree three or five times or more than that if you think fit and put Cur or some of the comfor in the last washing then inform me when you have finished so when we had finished we informed him and he gave his own isar which is the Garment that is worn from the waist down and he said put it next to her body in another narration or seven so three five or seven he said begin with her right side and with the places of w said and we plated her hair into three braids in this Hadith we learn how to wash a dead person and washing a dead person is not rocket science it is not something that is so difficult because simply washing him or her is sufficient it does the job however can a man or men wash a woman men can men wash a woman no one man is only entitled to wash one woman and that is his wife and can women wash men or a man no only the wife or wives can wash their husband however if hypothetically a man dies in the desert or in a village and only women are present can they wash him the answer is no they offer and they bury him and the opposite is also true if a woman dies among her mams brothers father Sons can they wash her the answer is no completely only a man can wash his wife and a wife or wives can wash their husband because the prophet Alam stated this in authentic Hadith he once entered the house and AA said oh my head I have this severe headache and the prophet said no it is my head as if he is feeling pain because of her pain and this is the great form of showing love when you enter the house and your wife says oh I have this strong pain in my head some husbands say you deserve this because yesterday you gave me a bad time others would say you have a headache go and take aspirin go and take Panadol this is not the right way of showing your love when your wife says I have a a strong headache you say your headache is my headache now I'm feeling the pain for you show her some affection so the prophet said it's my headache I am the one who has a headache what would happen oh if you die the prophet is teasing her now what would happen if you die and I wash you and shroud you and pray funeral prayer and I bury you what would happen what's wrong in that so this means that it is possible what did AA say AA said no that would not happen prophet of Allah because if you do this you will immediately go to the other wives of yours even after her death she's still jealous so she doesn't want this to happen and in the Hadith of may Allah be pleased with her after the death of the prophet she said if it were for me no one would have washed the prophet Alat except me and his wives so this clearly indicates that it is permissible for a man to wash his wife and it's permissible for a woman to wash her husband Asma one of the great companions she washed her husband who was her husband Asma she was one of the greatest Companions of the Prophet first she was married to ja abali who jaar the brother of Ali huh and the cousin of the Prophet alhat wasam after he was martyred in the Battle of M she married Abu Bakr ass sik and she had from him a son and after Abu Bakr died she washed him and this is why I brought her name because she's the one who washed Abu Bakr Abu Bakr said to her you wash me after I die don't let other men come in you only wash me and after he died she married Al Talib now she had a son from jaar and she had a son from Abu Bakr and while she was with Ali her latest husband her two sons fought together the son of Jaffer says my father is is better than your father and the son of Abu Bakr says no my father is better than your father and they you know Brothers siblings but from the mother they started to fight so Ali was there and he said you be the judge between them and tell them whose father is best so she said to the son of jaur your father is the best of the youth because he died young and she said to the son of Abu Bakr your father is the best of the elders because he was in his 60s or so now Ali is the third husband and he said Asma what did you leave for me if he's the best of the youth and he's the best of the elders what's left for me so with all the diplomacy in the world she said to him Ali three jaur Abu Bakr and you three you are considered to be the worst of them W this is an achievement if these are the three and you're the third and you're the worst of them this is an achievement Ali smiled and he appreciated that and he said to her by Allah if you had said anything else I would have hated you and resented you because then you would be lying if you said no no I did not mean this not jaar is better than you or AB is better than you if you said anything I would have hated you and resented you but you've said the truth she washed Abu Bakr now we have schools of thought that claim once a woman is widowed she is a complete stranger to her husband once a man dies these are some of the schools of thought without naming them they say that the minute the man dies the wife becomes a stranger why they say because the marriage contract has been nullified it's over he's dead he's not a husband anymore and hence they say she cannot see him she cannot give him the last look she cannot wash him and of course by the evidences I've just brought forward to you we know that this is completely wrong even if he dies she's still his wife and that is why she has to stay 4 months and 10 days only in one condition that this becomes true which is very very very hypothetical but it can happen and that is if a man is on his dying bed and his wife is in labor she's pregnant and she's about to deliver if he dies at 1:00 and she gives birth bir at 11:15 can she wash him the answer is no why Sheik she's her wife it's very simple after a pregnant moment delivers the is over her waiting period is over whether it was four months and 10 days for a pregnant woman it's not 4 months and 10 days the waiting period for a pregant woman is when she delivers so if a man dies in the First of muharam and his wife is pregnant in her second month she has to wait seven months before her is over meaning that she doesn't leave the house she doesn't wear perfume she doesn't put makeup she doesn't show any sign of Happiness once she gives birth then she's entitled to get married and she's out of her this is the longest period but if he dies and she's in her ninth month of pregnancy and she delivers the following day she has only one day of and she can marry the same day why because she is not related anymore and the issue of is very important in Islam inshallah if Allah grants us life we will be able to discuss these in detail so a man can wash his wife a wife can wash her husband unless in hypothetical situation she's pregnant and she delivers then she becomes a stranger to him is telling us that the prophet came did the prophet come and witness the washing definitely not because a man cannot attend any woman's washing even if she was his mother or his daughter or his sister but he came and he requested them and he told them what to do in regards of washing so washing a man or a woman is it rocket science no if you have a shower and you just simply do this and wash them three times or five times this is enough this does the job you've washed them or not it's like you remember we said that there isul according to the Sunnah and there isul which is not according to the Sunnah but it does the job so if I go in a swimming pool a big swimming pool or if I go in a lake or in the sea and I dip myself with the intention of and I make m i turn the water in my mouth and I uh inhale water and blow it in my nose I have W and I have also if it's from sexual impurity likewise washing the dead however if you go to the books of f whether the F of Abu hanifah Malik shaf ored you will find extensive details and these details like 90% of them are not from the Sunnah where are they from they are from thead from practice and some of them may have some logic some may not have any logic we inshallah will get to know this when we meet next time until then some of"
