  "transcript": "Mateen from Australia Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Sheikh, so my name is Mateen and I was just wondering if I need to change my name because it is one of the 99 names of Allah Mateen is one of Allah's beautiful names and it means the one with the strength and power and this name unlike Al-Ghaffar, Al-Rahman, Al-Razzaq can be used with individuals as well as a name of Allah SWT so we can say Kareem and Kareem is one of Allah's beautiful names we can call someone Hakeem or Al-Hakeem because this name can be shared in Surah Yusuf the ruler of Egypt was called Al-Aziz and this is one of Allah's names so there are names that can be shared and there are names that can't and Mateen seems to me that it is permissible definitely putting Abd before it would add a lot of value and would make you safer and out of any harm's way though it is permissible and Allah knows best"
