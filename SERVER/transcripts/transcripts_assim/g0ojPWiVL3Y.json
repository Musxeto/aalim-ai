  "transcript": "sister fatima asked please give me some tips to parents to make their children to love the quran this is problematic because in our busy schedule we tend to make grave mistakes the vast majority of us are so busy trying to make ends meet trying to put food on the table we have to work 10 hours a day maybe spend three hours on the road in traffic jams we have to attend to our own needs and social activities to obey our parents to do the shopping groceries to pay the bills and maybe to go to the gym and refresh ourselves a little bit through halal entertainment which means that we leave very little time in our busy schedule for our children yet we have good intentions so what do we do we delegate and this is the job of a good manager we delegate such activities to a quran teacher to a special school that would teach them the quran and i'm willing to pay for that in order for them to become better muslims and memorize the quran however we fail to follow through when we actually consider it as a form of punishment so whatever we are frustrated coming back home tired and the children are fighting their children they fight what do we do we angrily reprimand them scold them why are you shouting why are you doing this did you make effort did you revise the quran go and do this so it's like a form of punishment instead of masha allah come come come come how much did you revise from the quran today what is the new surah you memorized masha allah recite it to me allah the child kiss them hug them give them some candies when guests come oh look at my son look at my daughter she memorized two surahs recite it to them and when the kid does that you praise them this is how we build souls and nations by praising by encouraging not by did you pray today go and pray you always pray late why don't you do so all what they see prayer quran doing good things as a form of punishment something they hate so they grow up hating it unfortunately no deal with it with the psychology and with the way that the child perceives what you are addressing him make a day or a time in your day where you sit and praise your child encourage them let them recite the quran if you go the extra mile and you be the one who revises their daily revision with them it's good for you it's good for them but unfortunately we're not all alike our times schedule is not that yeah any uh generous so it differs from one person to the other the most thing you have to remember is consistency you don't have to have them all memorize the quran by the age of seven oh sure i want them to be like imam shafiri i want them to be alhamdulillah if they memorize the quran by the age of 50 you are like so be consistent some of them you masha allah when they begin their children go to tahfid quran they have as a teacher of the quran for a week or two and then they take a vacation for a month they don't know the quran they come back they want to start fresh no they can't even if it's a small portion make it consistent every single day so that it becomes in their system it becomes part of their dna and may allah azzawajal grant us the success in guiding our children to adore and to embrace the quran as they should allah you"
