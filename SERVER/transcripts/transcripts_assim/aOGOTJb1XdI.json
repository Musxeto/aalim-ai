  "transcript": "the ashra from Saudi Arabia had two questions he says what is the distance for traveling Allah did not mention to us in the Quran the distance for traveling neither he mentioned to us the amount or the level of illness a person must be in in order to break his fast yet he told us that if you're traveling or you're ill you may break your fast so the scholars say if Allah does not define this to us so how would we know the most authentic opinion is that we have to refer to the the norm what the people uh uh know and share between them so if you tell a person in your community in your town traveling from District a to District B is it part of traveling said no this is within the vicinity of the city then this is not traveling if you say okay if I go to a little bit further place he said no we go for um a picnic there so this is not traveling once they say and acknowledge that from point A to point B is a traveling distance they consider it traveling and when they leave they uh uh bid their families farewell and they say the Dua of the saf of the traveling in this case this is considered to be traveling to us people residing in jeda whenever we go to meca we don't consider this traveling so we don't shorten prayers we don't combine but if we go a bit like 60 kilomet further to T then we do that and we consider this as traveling so I hope this answers your question as for the duration how long should I keep on uh offering in or Shoring prayers there is no time specified in the Sunnah some Scholars say four days you have to complete afterwards some say 17 or 19 days some limit this a little bit less or a little bit more there is no specific ruling in the Sunnah and the most authentic opinion is the choice ofb Tam may Allah have mercy on his soul he says As Long As You Are still labeled as a traveler then you may shorten until and this is logical until you settle down so if someone goes to another country for a whole week he's a traveler no problem shorten he says okay I'm staying there for four weeks where are you staying in a hotel then this is still consider to be traveling he said no but after the third week I rented an apartment I first finished it and I'm staying for a year now in this case you feel settled yes this is my apartment I'm settled down I know the timings of the Salah I know the I have no problem in this case you from that point on you complete your prayers but before that you're still considered to be a traveler you can shorten and combine ASF from SA"
