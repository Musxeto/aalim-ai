  "transcript": "I would like to bring your attention that it is now time for those interested in registering in zad academy and you will see that there is a barcode uh the QR which is here and if you click it it will take you to where you can register in zad Academy what is zad Academy zad Academy is an online Academy where I'm blessed to teach in the first semester two subjects and and other great Scholars and brothers of mine teach other five subjects and it is similar to the Arabic Academy which was a great success with the grace of Allah people get books they get proper knowledge they get quizzes they get midterms and finals and they graduate after four semesters with an amount of knowledge that is the Cornerstone for any student of knowledge to pursue on the right path to acquire correct knowledge and Elevate himself to be a student of knowledge to be a scholar from this with the grace of Allah so we basically teach you what each and every Muslim must know in order to be a Muslim the basics but through an academic process that is totally free and it's alhamdulillah coming to your doorsteps whether through zad TV whether it is through YouTube whether through social media totally free and totally reliable so now it's time to register for it and you have to be a little bit quick because last semester on in January I think 20 20th January when we opened the registration we had only 5,000 slots or seats and it was gone in a heartbeat I think this semester is going to be more but again there are hundreds of thousands of people eager to register so be among the first one and inshallah you will benefit from that greatly"
