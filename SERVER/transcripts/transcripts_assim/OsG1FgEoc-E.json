  "transcript": "[Music] s I know that you have a lot of questions to be answered and this is one of the easiest way of dodging questions is we're out of time so and you forget about the question but inshallah I'll try my best after finishing Hadith number four inshallah we will try our best to answer as many questions as possible Hadith number four uh who will read this yes brother narrated Abu Hur Allah messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam said if any one of you performs abusion he should put water in his nose and then blow it out and whoever cleans his private parts with stones should do so with odd numbers and whoever wakes up from his sleep should wash his hands before putting them in the water for ablution because nobody knows where his hands were during sleep okay now this Hadith mentioned three important topics and I don't know if time would permit but inshallah we'll try our best first topic is the ruling on what is known as what is the meaning of it's inhaling and the Hadith clearly states that whoever performs wo he should not inhale blow so how can I blow water before I so this is understood from the Hadith and from other hadiths so part of washing the face is that you bring water and you inhale the water up your nostrils through breathing it doing this of course don't overdo it because you'll drown but it is is sufficient enough to enter the water into this area and then you blow it using your your breath again and this is the Sunnah and the prophet is telling usat that when you wake up when you perform woo you should do this when doing the woodoo but before that also in other Hadi we have also rinsing the mouth M what is that getting water putting it in your mouth and turning it around your mouth to clean whatever there is and then spitting it out so we have this rinsing and we have inhaling and blowing your nose part of the Sunnah the majority of Scholars say that they are Sunnah not mandatory immed say that it is mandatory why because throughout the life of the Prophet Alat never reported to us that he did not do it on the contrary in the Hadith of may Allah be pleased with him the prophet told him to exaggerate in rensing your mouth and blowing your nose unless you are fasting so he told him exaggerate do it a lot which means that it is something that is mandatory now the first part is the ruling on rining your mouth inhaling the water and blowing it in wo of course we know part of the etiquette that we do this when we wake up from sleep we have to blow our nose three times when you wake up from sleep and the prophet told usat that the Shan sleeps on your nostrils so when you wake up you inhale and blow the water three times so that you can remove all of these traces the second part in the Hadith whoever cleans his private parts with stones should do so with odd numbers now people say cleaning your private parts with stones where is this are we living in a cave in Tabora what are you talking about well listen this Hadith was said when how many centuries 15 centuries ago and where were the people in Europe or in the US or in the far East did they have these luxuries what we have now no so this is how the people clean themselves and to find a religion that tells you whenever you urinate or defecate it is part of your worshiping Allah that you cleanse yourself you purify yourself you clean yourself I don't know of other religions I know only about mine but I can see by practice that people don't clean themselves and if you work somewhere that is UN Islamic in the laundry it's a filthy job but look at the underwears of people without being noticed because then they will think that you're a pervert but because it is your job you go you have to wash it you'll find filth not with the Muslims never the Muslims underwears are always as clean as it can be why because it's part of religion I cannot pray with traces of urine or traces of feces in my clothes so Islam tells us that it is part of your religion to clean yourself it is part of your religion to always be in top form and part of that is when you answer the call of nature you purify yourself and purifying yourself has two ways either by using hard substances such as Stones uh tissue toilet papers anything that is hard or by washing it and this is the top way of cleaning yourself by using water now it was reported in IM Muslim that the Jews were making fun of Salman Al Phi may Allah be pleased with him and they said your Prophet taught you everything even how to defecate even how to answer the call of nature what is this they're making fun they're saying that your Prophet even this Salman did not even pay attention to them he's teaching them our religion he said yes the prophet wasam forbade us from facing or giving our back to the to the Kaa when answering the call of Nature and he told us not to touch our private parts with our right hand and he forbade us from cleaning ourselves with our right hands or to clean ourselves in less than three stones and whenever we want to stop we should make that on odd numbers Islam is a religion that controls everything in your life it tells you everything you need to know so in this Hadith the prophet Alat wasam is telling us that when you use which is hard substances you should use it on what on wit what is the meaning of wit odd numbers and what is the meaning of even numbers is one three five 7 9 11 Etc and Allah is wither one who who has no second and that is why the prophet saidat oh people of the Quran pray with because Allah is Witter and he loves Witter so the prophet is saying the Arabic word whoever uses hard substances toilet paper Stones Etc then he should use it in odd numbers so if you clean yourself by four Stones use a fifth if you clean yourself in six wipes using toilet papers use the seventh so you have to have it on that is it a must or not it's recommended it is not a must it's recommended what about water if I if I wash myself do I use also odd numbers call say no because water purifies by itself it cleans by itself and it's not a number of wipes so you clean yourself with water and when urinating it's is simply enough to pour water after you finish urinating when you defecating it's different you have to wipe and you have to follow the sequence that we have just mentioned and the last and third issue is that the prophet tells us whenever you wake up you have to wash your hands before putting them into the bucket or the utensils now one would say what is this what is this before centuries ago people did not have faucets they did not have tab water what did they have they used to fetch water from the well and put it in a container or in a bucket so people use this water the prophet is telling us when you wake up do not insert your hands into the bucket but before you do that wash your hands from the bucket itself not inside and then once your hands are washed you can do that and take from the bucket as much as you want why the prophet said because you do not know where your hands spend the night what I know hands were there next to me what do you mean said no no no no no you while being asleep you do not know where your hands go you might touch your private parts you might touch something that is impure and this would not be wise pollute the water when inserting your hands so is this the reason only yes and there might be another reason that you don't know what the shatan did with your hands we know that he sleeps on the people's nostrils what does he do with their hands we do not know and that is why Scholars say what about if a person goes to bed and before he sleeps he puts a glove and he ties the glove and he goes to sleep and he wakes up he takes off the glove does he have to wash his hands or can he put his hands in the scholar say the ruling stays as it is the prophet told you to wash your hands you have to wash your hands so this is approximately uh what we need to know the most important thing is the issue of inhaling water and cleansing your nose by blowing it we have a break stay tuned inshallah we'll be right [Music] back Salam alaykum and welcome back so questions yes we'll take one from here one from there yes brother sh uh it's ler to the first Hadi of intention uh I just wanted to clarify with you what is the ruling on combining intentions in I because we have heard many of the scholars say that and must cannot be combine so I just wanted to know the general principle of combining intentions in I well the general principle is that if a particular I is supposed to be done in a certain fashion and another I that shares the examp motion and the exact movement and the exact name can be performed both can be performed as one and you get both rewards for example if I go to the Masjid after thean I know that I cannot sit until I pray two for greeting the and I know that part of the Sunnah is to pray two the voluntary two of so do I pray two plus two the scholars say no pray one with the intention of the is gone how about if I have something to pray for Allah for example so can I pray two intending that this is for and this is for and also this is for there's no reason not to the prophet said whenever one of you wants to do something he should pray two other than the far I'm not praying far I'm praying so this means that I can do this as well likewise in which is a pillar of Haj they call it it's all the same thing it's supposed to be on the 10th of on the day of but you can have the option of doing it on the 11th 12th and 13th so if someone does not do it on the 10th and before he moves out from the holy Shrine leaving he finished everything on the 12th or on the 13th he offers and immediately leaves do we say go back and do your farewell no the has been joined with because they have the same characteristics Etc and that is why why Allah have mercy on his soul said that the day of if you fast it how many years Allah forgives two years it's voluntary he said that if you have days missed in Ramadan and you fast the day missed in Ramadan Ona you get both rewards one day of Ramadan has been fasted and the two years of forgiveness also have been attained in Allah asael knows best yes brother alikum my question is regarding wo uh regarding there some paint SP on your hand or something since I belong to construction industry in India I have seen that most of the construction projects are in remote places Indian working pattern they do not sanction times for Salah and Indian working laborers they are not offered clothes as per International labor laws for providing them mask Body cover all there are thousands of Labor who work for painting the big sheds and all and they have lot of PHS of paint on them and the schedule is very tight and the labors are also very poorly paid so how can they match like removing each and every strain and they it will cost them the job and all everything this a this is an issue of belief a worker no matter how low his salary is and no matter how difficult conditions are and no matter how rigid the rules and regulations regarding taking a break he has to set up his priorities as a Muslim what is your priority to pray as a Muslim what is your priority to obey Allah if something else is telling you not to pray or not to obey Allah or not to do what Allah commands you to do who do you follow this answer would give you an indication what will happen to this individual on the day of judgment we have to set the record straight by us Muslims being the top of our fields our profession whether we're labors whether we're professionals doctors Engineers by being the top we can ask for favors but if we're lazy if we're not doing our job on time or in the best of quality then when we ask people to give us 5 minutes break to pray they will not give us well tough luck you have to stop and pray and you have to clean yourself because this is the religion of Allah Asel if you give a in if you surrender if you're weak if you compromise your religion this will happen in fasting you're not allowed to fast oh I have to work I will skip fasting this will happen with your hijab if you're a sister take off the hijab this would happen with your modesty you have to compromise your boss likes you if you're a woman or if your boss is a a woman and you have to do this you have to do that when do you draw the line when do you say that no I can't this is my religion you have to know where things have to be done and inshallah whenever there's a will there's a way whenever you have full trust in Allah and you depend on him Allah will make an a way out for you as Allah says in the Quran whoever fears Allah Allah will make a way out for him not only that and he will grant him provisions from sources he was not anticipating this is in the Quran now says yes but I get my check from my manager you get your check from Allah depend on him and he will give you all what you need and Allah knows best yes brother uh you just mentioned about fasting uh a missed fast in Ramadan on the day of araa and getting the benefit of both uh it's kind of a question related to this that uh if I enter the Masjid when theama has been given for the FJ prayer and is for so can I have the intention of uh praying the greeting of the Majid along with the FJ or you know if it's a act which I'm doing I can't combin with anything else true with f you cannot combine anything else therefore if you go to fer prayer and the is given can I pray I've seen a lot of the brothers here in Masid when the when the IM is Reading in the first of they don't join they go and pray to of their prayer is invalid and they're sinful the prophet saidham whenever the prayer has been called for there is no prayer except the far the one that is being prayed after you finish fa pray your two ofnah but to join intentions with the no is you cannot combine to it any other uh prayer yes brother while watching news channel or any channel which going wrong okay so for example if we are watching news channel the news anchor will chances are there anchor lady okay so uh okay I get your question the brother is asking by looking to the opposite sex does this nullify my w and this is one of the beauties of is once you master something you don't need someone to tell you while we will take inshallah we will learn that the things that nullify wo are the five that I've mentioned to you passing wind urinating defecating or anything that comes out of your private Parts sleeping and eating camels meat so if someone says okay sh what's the ruling on smoking does it nullify my woodo talk to the hand meaning these are the five is smoking there no h talk to the hand then it doesn't that does not mean smoking is halal okay alhamdulillah if it doesn't nullify wo give me a cigarette no it's Haram but it does not affect your woodo one says okay shik I performed woodo but I wasn't wearing any clothes I was in the bathroom alone I was nude I performed woodo does this not nullify My Wo no one says what about touching women does this nullify wo ah this is something of dispute among Scholars but we will come to that and the most authentic opinion is not okay what about touching my private parts again this is something that is an issue of dispute among Scholars we will come to that so by knowing these things anything else that comes in you can easily answer yourself and to answer your question yes looking and watching or uh seeing something of the opposite sex is not permissible unless under the guid guidelines and exceptions that we have in our religion but watching a film or watching a a TV series and this is not permissible however it does not affect your wo unless you see something so exciting that something comes out of your body you discharge something this in case falls under the five categories and then you have to offer I'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time got you [Music]"
