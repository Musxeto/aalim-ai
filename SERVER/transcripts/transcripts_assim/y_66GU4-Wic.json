  "transcript": "Saad from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi If the Imam is sometimes lazy or maybe he doesn't know how to decide properly So if the Imam recites Fatiha loosely at like Iyyaka and says Daud like Daal So like Maghdoobi or that he says Subhana Rabbiyal Azeem like Lazeena Dhaal So what is the ruling on this? There are letters that are close in proximity when being pronounced Such as Dhaalleen or Dhaalleen Of course the appropriate way is to say Ghayril Maghdoobi Alayhim Walad Dhaalleen But sometimes the Arabs even say Ghayril Maghdoobi Alayhim Walad Dhaalleen And not Dha So the scholar said that because of the proximity of the place where these two letters come out They may sound similar This is permissible It doesn't change the meaning However when it is Al-Lazeena and he says Al-Lazeena Some Arabs even like from Egypt and the likes Ghayril Maghdoobi Alayhim Walad Al-Lazeena Surat Al-Lazeena An'amta Alayhim Al-Lazeena No this is totally unacceptable and the prayer is invalid Because you've changed a letter drastically in the Quran when you have the ability This is unlike someone from Bangladesh Who is unable to pronounce the letters correctly So his prayer is valid Because this is the best of his ability Someone who just embraced Islam He cannot say Maghdoobi He says Magha Maghdoobi Do Not Maghdoo Doobi Maghdoobi Alayhim Alayhim This is totally fine because this is the best of his ability and Allah knows best And we have to be a bit cautious Because a lot of the Muslims nowadays are asking these questions And in so many of these scenarios It's only their heads Camouflaging to them that he did not say the right letter In one of the masjids I was praying the other day The Imam said Ghayril Maghdoobi Alayhim Walad Al-Lazeena One of the people behind him said Maghdoobi Alayhim Walad Al-Lazeena Correcting him What is this? And this guy is insisting that he's right and everybody else is wrong And this is problematic The man's prayer can be invalidated by him interfering in something he has no knowledge of So be careful Al Fatiha"
