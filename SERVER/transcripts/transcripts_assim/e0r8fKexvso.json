  "transcript": "to our teachers because as you know images are really unstable human being right now and they do a lot of their behaviors responsible guidance and also and a friend is more important for them parents I think that's it thank you my name is first of all I totally disagree with the comment you made that the teenagers are unstable if you look in the CR of the Prophet what was the age that the prophet would allow people to come and fight in Wars 15 so when you come and say no no we have teenagers here we don't have the terminology in Islam of teenagers no we do not have teenagers we have adults and non-adults in Islam the moment you hit puberty you're an adult you're accountable usaid was 17 some say 18 years old when the prophet appointed him as the ruler of an army who was in this Army under his leadership was black so even the Arabs would say how is this possible no this is management if you look at IBN um he was 15 when he was admitted to fight in the battle of and the prophet we used to scan and and Screen the companions whole value of 14 go back 15 come so I believe that the teenagers need Trust need support need us to believe in them why do we always deal with them with doubt what are you watching show me your mobile what is in your back why did you come late what are you talking to why do we treat them okay don't they do bad things yes but excuse me parents don't you do bad things so it is the same concept number one number two when we fail to give our children quality time they will run when your child of course you don't have children but they're talking out of experience when your child is five six seven eight until maybe 10 years of age he's running after you Papa I want to sit with you I want to talk to you let's go and play but you don't have time I have work I have that one I have this I have that when he reaches 15 16 you run after him come let's sit no no I have friends I have uh football I have to go there I have to go that now you come and cry why is he not sitting with me you refuse to sit with him in the beginning had you given him quality time from the beginning he would have been with you all the way so it's not Rights and Wrongs do's and don'ts it's a full package once you bring up the children to be adhering to Quran and Sunnah you will never never have these problems inshallah problem [Music]"
