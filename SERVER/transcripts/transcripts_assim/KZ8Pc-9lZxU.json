  "title": "They say: do not pray any prayer when the athaan is being called, either pray before or after?",
  "transcript": "Ana from Uganda. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Someone told me that I should not begin prayers while the Adhan is being called and that I should either begin it before the Adhan or after it is completed. Is it authentic? What kind of prayers are you doing? All voluntary and obligatory. All of them. He was like I shouldâ€¦ Okay. First of all, it is not permissible to offer Fard prayers before the Adhan. So the instruction that was given to you is invalid to tell you that you should pray either before or after the Adhan. Fard prayer, it is invalid. If you pray Maghreb prayer 30 seconds before sunset, 30 seconds, your prayer is invalid. Secondly, what they told you that it is not permissible to pray while the Adhan is ongoing is totally bogus and wrong. Whether you're praying Fard prayers or you're praying Nawafil or Rawatib or voluntary prayers, while the Adhan is being called, whatever you pray is valid. Thirdly, is it best? The answer is no. Why? Because we know the great reward that the Prophet has placed, alayhi salatu wa salam, over repeating after the Mu'adhin every statement he says. Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar. We say Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar. When he says hayya alas salati, twice, we say la hawla wa la quwwata illa billah, twice. And likewise with hayya alal falah. And then we say at the conclusion la ilaha illallah, and we offer salutation upon the Prophet, alayhi salatu wa salam, and then we ask Allah that du'a, Allahumma rabbaa hadhihi al-da'wati al-taamma, wa al-salati al-qa'ima, aati Muhammadan al-wasilata wa al-fadheela, wa ab'athu Allahumma al-maqam al-mahmooda alladhi wa'atta, innaka la tukhrifu al-mi'ad. And whoever does this will achieve the intercession of the Prophet, alayhi salatu wa salam, on the Day of Judgement. So who in his right mind would jeopardise this great reward and pray fard or sunnah when he can delay this a couple of minutes until the adhan is over and he says the du'a and then prays. Nevertheless, if a person insists and prays fard or nafil while the adhan is being called, the prayer is totally valid. That's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session, and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
