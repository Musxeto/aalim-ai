  "transcript": "Dima from Germany my question is question is so I don't know if um I missed the Headless time or not so should I now this question a lot of the Muslims keep on asking about it and actually you guys have to use your logic we know that you have to pray at this specific time mentioned by our Prophet correct correct let's assume that it is from five to six o'clock the Sun rises you prayed when you don't know Before Sunrise or after Sunrise you don't know so one of two options one either you did pray on time so you're safe two which is why you're asking maybe you did not pray on time what is the solution if you did not pray on time if you prayed after the sun has risen no one ever says repeat the prayer why would I repeat the prayer I already prayed oh because you prayed after the time has gone out so if I pray after three hours wouldn't I be also praying after the time has gone up what's the reason for repeating the prayer it doesn't make any sense so to come back to your question this is just the thought process that I'm trying to teach you so that you don't have to ask another time if you prayed thinking that the time was fine and then discovered that the time has already expired you cannot do anything because if your prayer is invalid system invalid praying it again doesn't help and if it is valid because you did not know alhamdulillah you have not done anything wrong you don't have to repeat so either way Dima do not repeat your prayer [Music] oh my God and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah"
