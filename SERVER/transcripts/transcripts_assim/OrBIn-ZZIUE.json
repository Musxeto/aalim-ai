  "transcript": "Talha from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu My question is that, regarding, when you talk on the Quran verses, where is Allah? I have a question, you know when it says Can you just explain this verse to me? Like what does it refer to when it says Wajhullah? Because I heard it means the Qibla But I'm not sure This is an issue of dispute Akhi And the most authentic opinion as Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah May Allah have mercy on his soul said that Wajhullah in this ayah in Surah Al-Baqarah refers to the direction meaning whenever you face for prayers there is a direction of Allah so it doesn't matter whether you face to the Qibla you face South, West, North if you don't know especially when you're traveling for example the Sunnah is that you pray voluntary prayers wherever your ride is taking you even if the Qibla is behind you you can pray to the opposite direction as the Prophet Alayhi Salatu Wa Salam had done this is involuntary prayers while traveling and while riding therefore as I said it's an issue of dispute however there is no difference of opinion from Ahlus Sunnah Wa Al-Jamaa that Allah has a face but in this particular ayah because it was talking about the direction of the Qibla and whether you face East or West your prayer would be directed accordingly and correctly Ibn Taymiyyah referred to the direction Allah knows best"
