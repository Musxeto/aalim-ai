  "title": "Islamic ruling on standing up for people. When is it permissible? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "among the things that the prophet salallahu hated was for people to stand up to him and this might sound a bit weird for us because in many cultures if you enter a room and no one's and everybody stands except one or two you would feel bad feelings and negative feelings towards them thinking that they're disrespecting you on the contrary the sunnis that you do not stand up except in certain times the prophet Allah as anas says was the most beloved person to the whole of the companions may Allah be pleased with them however whenever they see the prophet Allah they would not stand up because they know that he hated this he does not endorse or like people to stand up for him imagine if a Sheikh comes into a room and everybody else is sitting and nobody stands up how would the Sheikh feel who cares the sun is that you don't stand up so what's the ruling on standing up to people Scholars say that standing up all the time behind a tyrant or an official is prohibited and this is how tyrants live and exist they want people to stand behind them and never sit never feel comfortable and if anyone is not standing behind them they feel humiliated and agitated and disrespected and this is not true this is a sign of arrogance and hypocrisy again you should allow in order of people to sit down and not to stand like this secondly when people come from a journey this is permissible for you all to stand to greet and this there's nothing wrong in that or to help someone if he's in need of help like when he came to the prophet he was injured the prophet said go and stand up and assist your master thirdly is when you stand up whenever you see someone coming in and this is a an issue of dispute it seems that it is totally prohibited when the person coming in wants people to stand up for him because this is a sign of arrogance and the prophet saws never allowed people to do this so you're not better than the prophet sallam so why should we stand to you unfortunately in some countries in Africa not only they want people to stand to them even the elders want people to bow to them or squat to them and if you don't do this they consider this a sign of disrespect subhanallah what religion do these people follow no no this is cultural you have to bow you have to squat no no this is not part of Islam even if it's your culture Islam comes first if you're a true Muslim if you're not and you prefer your culture over Islam then on the day of judgment you know will where you will be inshallah as a Muslim I have to tailor make my life according to Islam not the other way around Islam is to be followed and not to follow so we follow what Islam says squatting and bowing down to the elders if it's a cultural thing keep it in your culture but don't do it it's unislamic it's not permissible this is a form of glorification for other than Allah azzawajal"
