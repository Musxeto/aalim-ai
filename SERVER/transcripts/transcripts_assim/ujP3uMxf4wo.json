  "transcript": "Mutulu says we have three sisters we sleep together but I heard that we should sleep separate we do not have too much space as well is the hadith regarding this authentic the hadith is definitely authentic the Prophet said allah√≠s alot was salam instruct your children to pray when they're seven and spanked them or beat them to pray when they're ten and separate them in bed so the instruction of separating them in bed includes boys and boys girls and girls boys and girls however when the place is tight and there is no other place to sleep except this bed and the sisters want to sleep together or the brothers want to sleep together then there is no problem insha Allah providing that they are fully covered secondly that they each have her or his own blanket or covering so they do not use the same blanket to cover themselves with but each one has a separate blanket and this or a bedsheet this isn't sha Allah permissible and Allah knows best"
