  "transcript": "Neela from Bangladesh Sheikh, people in Bangladesh believe that west is the Qibla but about a year ago I downloaded an app and it showed in my house that the west is the Qibla. I also checked in my aunt's house and my mom's doctor place. There is another place where I normally pray when I'm outside but the people told me this way west is the Qibla. I prayed so many times without checking. One day I checked with my app and it showed the Qibla is a little bit right and I became so confused. One day I prayed the way I used to pray. Other days I decided to pray according to my phone. Sheikh, what to do? Please, please advise. There is no problem inshallah in a small diversion in the direction of the Qibla. If this is the Qibla and I pray a little bit to the right, a little bit to the left, there is no problem in that. Alhamdulillah and this is part of the ease of Islam. As long as I can pinpoint it correctly and accurately there's no problem even if I go a little bit to the left or right."
