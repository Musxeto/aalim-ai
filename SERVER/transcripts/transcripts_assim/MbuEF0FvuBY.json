  "transcript": "my the month of ramadan is the month of dua where every person fasting or not fasting would invoke allah would supplicate to allah would ask and beg allah azzawajal which brings us to two of allah's beautiful names allah says in the quran and when my servants ask you concerning me indeed i am near i respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon me allah azzawajal is paribas so one of allah's beautiful names is al-kharib the one who is near and allah azzawajal is not far from his servants he is close in responding and that is why he said i'm near and i respond to the invocation of the supplicant and this is similar to the verse where allah says and he is with you wherever you are so this confused some of the deviant sects and this is the origin of all confusion to these deviant sects that is when you hold on to a particular evidence without comparing it to the rest of the evidences and in our case the rest of the evidences are way overwhelming this is how the hawaris started killing people muslims by taking them out of the fold of islam for making a major sin neglecting all the evidences about a major sin being a sin not something that nullifies islam the murtazilah the ashariya the matari diya the jahmiyah all of these went astray into 70 72 sects and cults where the prophet al-islam warned us from because they did not comprehend islam in its totality so where did they go wrong here when allah says and he is with you wherever you are some of them said haha this means that allah is everywhere so if i lift up the pen allah is here if i look under the table and when we ask them where did you get this notion from said well the verse clearly says that he is close he is al-kharib and he is with us wherever we are subhanallah when we drive through the night between states or between cities and we look at the moon traveling with us we say the moon is with us is the moon inside our vehicle of course not so when allah says he's with us wherever he is you have to understand this with the hundreds and tens of evidences stating that allah is above everything yesterday we spoke about the one above everything we spoke before that about the one who's high we spoke about allah rising upon or over the throne and all of this you neglect just for this particular ayah which you misunderstood allah's being close to us has nothing to do with him being above everything because him being over his throne on top of the five the seven heavens yet he's closer to us than our jugular veins how is that possible because he hears us he sees us he has full control over us and he knows our inner thoughts how close you want him to be then this is as close as anyone can get and no one can get closer to us than allah the almighty azzawajal so he's close to us by responding by answering our prayers and he is closer to us through his sight hearing and ability and power though he is on top of his throne the prophet said allah once to his companions when they were making dua raising their voices with dua he said oh people take it easy upon your yourselves you're not calling someone who's deaf or far away you're calling someone who is all hearing and close to you and he is closer to you than the ride the neck of the camel you're riding on this is as close as it gets to a rider on a camel so al-kharib is one of allah's beautiful name likewise al-mujeeb so if he's close he's near he responds al-mujeeb is the one who responds allah says in the quran indeed my lord is near and responsive and invoke me and i shall respond to you i shall answer you so allah answers muslims and non-muslims alike allah answers righteous and sinners alike according to allah's judgment and wisdom sometimes the wisdom is not to give you what you ask for today maybe delay it a year maybe 10 years maybe delay it until the day of judgment with good deeds maybe deflect something that was harmful predestined for you but because you invoked allah azza this takes care of that so this is general way of responding to you but there is a specific way of response and that is which allah mentions in the quran is he not best who responds to the desperate or the one in distress when he calls upon him so this is more specific type of ijaba al-mujeeb would answer those who are distressed those who are despaired those whose hearts are broken because of their calamity because of their necessity and because of their great need and the best way to get al-mujeeb to respond to you is to praise him with his beautiful names and attributes and to express your gratitude to his endless blessings and favors and this is why those who are in distress allah answers them more those who are sick those who are traveling those who are breaking their fast the father when he makes dua for his son or against his son and in all different types of situations the third name we have today is one of allah's beautiful names in our common language means the rich so when you say that this person is rani you mean that he's rich what do you mean by being rich it means that he is independent he doesn't need anything he doesn't need anyone and this is not befitting creatures because their independence is limited but to allah azzawajal he is the independent one he is the free of any need never ever allow yourself to have this thought crossing your mind that allah may need the throne no allah does not need the throne allah may need the angels to do this and that for him allah may need that this or that allah needs no one every thing in this universe relies and depends on allah azza there is no independence at all without depending on allah listen to this beautiful o mankind you are those in need of allah while allah is the free of need the praiseworthy all of mankind no not only all of mankind all the jinn all the animals all the fish all the birds all the insects everything that exists in this universe all these planets all these stars who do you think is keeping them in orbit if allah for one second let him let them be chaos and destruction would result allah is the independent one and everything else is dependent upon him and he cannot the almighty be other than that this is part of the attributes of his essence that he is that he's independent that he is the creator he is al-qaeda the abel he is the razak the one who provides the facilitator the giver of life and death he cannot be anything other than that because this is part of his essence as he is the creator of the heavens and the earth and this is by default one of his beautiful attributes and names he is if all of his creations were to stand in one open plaza and ask him for whatever he or she wants and allah gave them all what they want and tenfold over that it would not have reduced his kingdom except as a thread put in the middle of the ocean and taken out what water was reduced from that ocean nothing so the most manifestation of allah's independence and richness and generosity is displayed on the hereafter when we see what allah has prepared for us in paradise because in there there are things that no i had seen no ear had heard of and it never crushed the mind of a human being things that are beyond the imagination it is described as simple as that anything you can imagine it is beyond that part of allah's being independent that he does not have a partner he does not have a spouse he does not have a child he does not need allies he does not need protectors or others to defend him the following name is a name mentioned in the authentic sunnah mother aisha says whenever the prophet haslam used to visit someone who was sick or they brought him someone who was sick the prophet used to say adhibi bass is this is one of allah's beautiful names a shafi what does it mean the healer the one who cures and a shafi is the one [Music] who cures the sick from their illnesses either by means we know of such as medication such as rookia such as herbs and possibility that people are cured and healed without any of these things so it is allah the almighty who cures the ill and it's all by allah's pre-decree when people fall sick and others in the same house don't fall sick though they ate from the same food though they mixed with the same people but this is according to allah's preordainment according to the qadha and of allah and when they are cured that's also one of allah's blessings and favors upon them and it's not the doctor and it's not the medication these are causes so many doctors prescribe medication it doesn't work so many patients consume medication it doesn't work so it is all in allah's hands subhanallah who says as ibrahim peace be upon him said in the quran and when i am ill it is he who cures me and curing and healing is not only physically but it's also mentally it's also for the illnesses of the heart allah says o mankind there has come to you instruction from your lord and healing for what is in the chests and guidance and mercy for the believers so your chest your depression your sadness your grief needs cure and the cure is in the quran the cure is seeking it from allah the almighty mentions a beautiful fact that when the heart is connected with allah the almighty the creator of the medicine and the illness itself then the heart would benefit tremendously because it's connected with the main source but when the heart is negligent and is far from allah azzawajal a person would lose interest would be fragile and weak and the medication would not help so the more you have trust in allah the more you have reliance and dependence upon allah the more knowledge that allah is your cure and allah is your healer then this would effectively cure you with the grace of allah azza wajal the following name is al-hadi and what does al-hadi mean it means the one who guides allah says and indeed is allah the guide of those who have believed to a straight path and also allah says but sufficient is your lord as a guide so al hadi is one of allah's names and guidance to us has many levels the highest of them all is when you're guided to know allah when you're guided to know islam the quran and the sunnah this is the ultimate when your akida is pure and you worship allah as he wants you to worship him because this type of guidance will lead you ultimately to the guidance of your own house in paradise because without this guidance in on earth you will miss your route your way to paradise so this is the most important part and form of guidance however this name is not limited to such guidance animals when they're born who guides them to suckle the milk of their mothers who guides them to know that fire is hot and dangerous and water is good to drink children who guides them to grow up to become men who guides every one of us to know what is right and what is wrong it is allah azzawajal who guides us to know what's beneficial and what is harmful in addition to sending us his messengers revealing his books guiding us to what pleases him not only that guiding us to do what pleases him and then reward us upon that so this beautiful name al hadi is a name to remember that everything that you've been guided to which is beneficial for you in this life or in the hereafter is it was through the guidance of al-hadi and finally the prophet said and subhanallah we began our series in the beginning of ramadan with this hadith and we conclude with this hadith what is allah has 99 names whoever learns them will enter jannah and allah is witter and he loves witter so what does whitter mean first of all generally speaking not referring to allah's beautiful name witter means odd even shaffer means even so 1 3 5 7 9 these are odd numbers these are witter and this is why the prophet hassam used to offer witter prayer in the following forms three raka's together sitting only in the last and doing to shahood or five raka's witter not sitting in the first four only sitting at the fifth or seven in continuous only sitting on the seventh or nine continuous sitting on the eighth doing first the shahood then standing up then doing the final shahad in the ninth and offering sallam so witter generally speaking means odd numbers but when we come to the name of allah al-witter this means that the one you see everything whether god or not god whether claiming to be god or not god anything if you combine to it something else it cannot be witter it has to be shepherd and by the way shepherd we stem from it the word shafa you know what shafara is it's intercession and why do we call intercession shaft because if i being alone in a single person would like someone to speak in my favor to this dignitary to this ruler to this important rich person what i do is i go to a friend of his and ask him to intercede so when this friend of his come with me we're both now we're not a single anymore we're both going in so this is called shafa because it's an even number this is where a shepherd well witter comes from so when it is with the name of allah al-witter no one is deserving of this name other than allah because he does not have any partner no one can be combined with him not even in dua not even in attributing favors you cannot say whatever allah wills in you this is shirk whatever allah wills full stop you cannot associate in your intention other than allah azzawajal allah says i am the wealthiest and most independent among the partners independent and wealthiest whoever associates other with me i would leave them and their shirk allah would not accept that so al-witter when it refers to allah azza it refers to the one and only who has no partners who has no spouse who has no children who has no allies or protectors to protect him he is one in his powers and attributes and names and and attributes of perfection without any associate with this alhamdulillah we've concluded the total of a hundred and two names of allah azzawajal that are the most authentic there are almost a dozen of names i did not mention simply because they were not backed by authentic hadiths such as mohsen such as and so on and therefore al-hafiz all of these we did not mention so that we would conclude on these authentic beautiful names we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back"
