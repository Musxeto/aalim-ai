  "title": "Difference between Hasad or Envy (Major Sin ) VS Evil Eye (Ayn) assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "ill intent and be careful because there is a difference between evil eye that comes out without intention most of the time and between envy which is a major sin. Envy or hasad is something that a person wishes that a particular favour or blessing of Allah is to be removed from that individual because he's envious, he doesn't deserve it. When you see a neighbour moving into a nice house, you're envious, you wish that he loses this wealth or the house is burned to the ground. When you see a friend marrying a beautiful woman from a reputable family, you're envious, you wish they divorce. This is a major sin and this consumes good deeds like bushfire does to a forest or to the plantations. Evil eye is different. It's called in Arabic Al-'Ayn. The Prophet said Al-'Aynu Haqq. Evil eye is undeniably true. It exists but we have to block it by saying Allahumma Barik."
