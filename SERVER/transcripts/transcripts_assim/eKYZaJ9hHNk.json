  "title": "Prophets can be assassinated but Messengers can't??? Assim Al Hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Amman from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu So Sheikh is this true that Allah made all that his messengers can never be assassinated by their people but his prophets which are not messengers can be assassinated as mentioned in Quran that Bani Israeel killed so many prophets but when they tried to kill Prophet Isa and our Prophet Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam they failed and our Prophet Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam also wanted or had a wish that he be killed in cause of Allah then grant life again then he be killed in cause of Allah and then grant life again so in short I want to ask that the verse in which Allah says they killed prophets so are messengers included in or not? This is something only Allah Azzawajal knows of such a rule which you stated in the beginning that prophets can be assassinated but messengers can't this is baseless to my knowledge Allah says in the Quran about Prophet Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam It is Allah who protects you from people so we have this evidence about the Prophet but other messengers I don't know anything to back this up and to claim that this is a rule and a fact needs evidence and there is no evidence to my knowledge and Allah knows best Thanks for watching!"
