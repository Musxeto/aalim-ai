  "transcript": "camel from saudi and our righteous family members like our father our mother who had passed away is it they can reunited in the grave okay i will answer inshallah camel from saudi arabia is asking do the dead meet after they die it's an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion is that they do not meet because there isn't any authentic hadith stating that they meet one another and ask about who they left behind all the hadith to my knowledge are weak and not authentic and hence this is not authentic we believe that they're dead they're waiting for the day of judgment they have a window from paradise to enjoy if they're righteous and they have a window from hellfire to be tormented through if they are not an allah knows best"
