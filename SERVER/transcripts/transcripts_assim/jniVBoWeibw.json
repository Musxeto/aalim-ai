  "transcript": "aasif from Saudi Arabia says that there are dolls such as Ana and Alicia Alicia or whatever I don't know these dolls though I have daughters but I don't know they all what I know is Barbie and he says okay what is the ruling on having this for children first of all dolls are permitted for girls and even for boys when they are little and young it enriches their imagination it is something that Islam has permitted for children to play with now yes these dolls are a little bit exaggerated in the sense that wow they look like real their eyes and they have makeups and breath lipsticks etc nevertheless they're still dogs it's permissible to play with but to go a little bit further and to take an extra mile by saying okay now it's becoming a brand so we have backpacks for children going to school with images of these dolls and we have mugs we have lunch boxes we have shoes we have dresses no this is haram what is permissible only for them to play with the dolls and not to cascade with this craze that is widely spreading and people go and take this excuse me and we have to also make a distinction and a difference between a doll that the children play with and with a statue that is not a dominant so for example this famous brand Kipling which is a bag that has a monkey attached to it I've seen a lot of people buying the bag for the monkey and their grown-up women and girls and they say yes we love this brand no problem in buying it but you have to dispose of this statue because this prevents the Angels from entering the house it's not something halal you are a grown up person you cannot keep these dolls some of the brothers call me and say what's the ruling on me keeping teddy bears and he's a grown up man she's a grown up woman she says I love to sleep with a teddy bear next to me this is Haram these are statues these are only permissible for girls and girls and boys who are children not for grownups and allah azzawajal knows best"
