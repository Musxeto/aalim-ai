  "transcript": "shihab from bangladesh says what is the ruling on karamat of awliya well we know that miracles can only be given to prophets and messengers and this is to indicate and prove to the people that these are messengers of allah extraordinary things splitting the sea and crossing it this is a miracle curing the leopard and the death the mute this is a miracle having the moon split into two or the water gushing from his fingers and filling up a well this is a miracle and we can go on and on and on in mentioning the miracles of prophets and messengers of allah are something that is supernatural and they are awarded and given to followers of the messengers to prove that the messengers they're following are on the right track and path and that the religion is valid and this is also part of our religion sheikh hasn't mentioned this in and he stated that we a part of our akida is to believe that it is possible and it happened with companions like like other companions who were given supernatural things that do not happen usually but allah has given it as a form to prove to everyone who notices this that this person is a follower follower of the true messenger of allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam like the incident where um was giving the friday sermon while a muslim army was up north fighting the byzantians and they were almost about to be caught in uh the two sides and annihilated so while umar was giving the speech the the oration the khutbah all of a sudden he said yes yes was the army leader and he was telling him oh saria head to the mountain and he continued his speech and afterwards they said to him what was you thinking of what was that he said what was that they said to him you said so and so and so he said did i well i just thought across my mind that the army was being slaughtered and they were going to be defeated and i saw the mountain so i was shouting at their leader to take them to the mountain and get their back covered with the mountain and fight the army a month later they get the news that on that particular friday as they were being defeated they heard rumors voice instructing them to go to the mountain yes this is this is something given from allah azzawajal for the muslims to save them and save the day which it happens once every blue moon but it's a gift from allah now claiming that i am a righteous a person i'm close to allah i'm one of allah's awliya you have to be careful not to say anything bad about me because allah gives me every now and then a karama that would astonish you and i can destroy you i can anyone who says this is a soothsayer a blatant liar or an imposter the true awliya of allah they are not people who boast about what allah has given them they're humble they are unnoticed and this is why the prophet said in an authentic hadith he says o prophet of allah the prophet of allah says watch out there might be this person whose hair is untidy it is all dusty wearing two pieces of cloth that you don't pay any attention to so cheap so torn so dirty yet if this individual were to swear upon allah allah would fulfill his swear if he would say o allah i swear upon you that you destroyed this building allah would destroy it this is an authentic hadith among them is may allah be pleased with them so you have to be careful those who claim and both say yes i'm the one who has karamat i can find your car that was stolen i can bring you the gold that you've lost i can see things people don't see these are soothsayers and imposters and blatant liars to be ignored"
