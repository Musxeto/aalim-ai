  "title": "Is it permissible if lower part of my chin is exposed while praying? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh my question is is it okay if little bit area under the chain is visible in prayer of a woman if I cover that area then my kimar gets loose and may show my hair also because our marks move while reciting the Quran little bit area under skin becomes visible all the scholars say that what is permissible to be shown of a woman during prayer are her hands and her face now the area the face is ending here so this is where your himar should be covering but if it goes down here and I can see underneath your chin and part of your neck this is Aura exposed some of the sisters may try to make it this tight it's if it's possible that's good but sometimes it just goes and covers their noses and disturbs them in their Salat to the extent that the whole foraka of Salat they are distracted from the essence of the Salat by focusing on oh is it here is it there is it fine can I can anyone see part of my lower chin Etc which is what shaytan wants so you have to do your due diligence try your level best to where the uh head scarf that is already pre-tailored and fixed so that it would only expose your face and a little bit would be negligible and forgiven inshallah not to the extent that it shows your lower chin and part of your neck and Allah Knows Best"
