  "transcript": "Sanjar from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh could you please tell me the etiquettes of reading the Quran and likewise is there a supplication that we should say in the end Jazakallahu Khair Wa Jazakum. There is or there are a lot of etiquettes but this is again not the time guys when you come for a Q&A session you have to be brief and ask a question that the answer would help you in a brief answer not in a lecture so there is a book for Imam Al-Nawawi it's called Al-Tibyan Fi Adabi Hamalati Al-Quran and it talks about this topic it's a big book however the etiquettes vary from recommended actions to obligatory so among the obligation is that you are in the states of major purity and the issue of being in the minor purity meaning having good or not it's an issue of dispute to be properly dressed to face the Qibla when you are reciting the Quran to have your heart there to contemplate and ponder about over the or upon the beautiful meanings of the Quran not to be engaged with something else so that you won't have two minds and the likes so maybe if you go to the book and read it you will find what you want there inshallah"
