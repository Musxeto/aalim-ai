  "title": "Must we recite Fatiha behind an Imam? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "if you're praying behind an imam in this case the imam if he is reciting a loud recitation in the first or second raka if you skip the fatiha it's okay his recitation is sufficient for you but if you skip the fat in the third or fourth raka which are usually silent in this case after the salaam you have to offer a raqqa for the missed invalid raqqa which you did not recite the fatiha in and i hope this answers your question you"
