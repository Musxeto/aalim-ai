  "transcript": "foreign uh-huh in these programs as you know we discuss the prophet muhammad seerah and biography it is a branch of the islamic science that a muslim's faith would not be complete until he masters it because from it he stims the lessons and he learns how the prophet sallam dealt with all the different circumstances that he was faced with whether he was in mecca or when he migrated to medina last time we met we talked about the night journey which is called al-israe and and israel means to go from one place to the other while means to go upwards in the heavens and we talked about the prophet sallallahu alaihi meeting the messengers of allah in jerusalem in al masjid al-aqsa the aqsa mosque and we also discussed how the prophet sallallahu salaam led the the messengers in prayer which indicates that he is the chosen one and that he is the most preferred among all the messengers of allah to the almighty allah azzawajal and that is why the prophet tells us to seek al-wasilah for him and to pray that he gets the wasilla which is a level that only one slave one servant of allah can reach and the prophet sallam which is that he is the one and indeed he is the one that has this level of wasilla and he is the only one that intercedes for all humanity on the day of judgment as he told us when the prophet sallallahu sallam went to the seven heavens of allah he was met by the messengers of allah over there he told the salam that he had seen al-bayt al-mamur which is a structure similar to al-qa'aba al-qaba on earth is visited by muslims who go seven times around it and who face the ka'ba in prayer in their daily five prayers al-bayten mamur is in the seventh heaven and our prophet told us that 70 000 angels every single day come into that house and go out of it and never return to it once again which means that the angels of allah azzawajal has no end and no one knows the soldiers of allah no one knows the angels of allah except him the almighty also the prophet told us about a river in paradise which is called and there's a chapter in the holy quran with the name of al-qaeda this river was given to the prophet alaihis wasallam and those who believe those who follow will drink from that river and we are told that whoever drinks from that river river will never ever get thirsty in paradise and that is why we pray to allah that he may grant us and you dear viewers this honor of drinking from the hand of the prophet alaihis something that may allow us not to be thirsty after that forever the prophet told us about this river and told us that musk is the mud of this river and he told us that gold and silver cups and plates are on each side of this river in this journey the prophet also told us alas that he had seen four rivers other than the kautha in paradise and he told us that he also had seen the archangel gabriel on his original format that allah israel created him upon because as we know angels have the ability to transform they have developed the ability to look like men but the prophet saw on that night journey so gabriel on the his exact uh status that allah has created him uh like and he saw him before when he was first revealed to and he told us that he had seen gabriel sitting on a throne covering the horizon so big so huge because he is by far one of the greatest creations of allah azza and he told us that he saw him magnificently having 600 wings and from each wing emeralds jewelry diamonds were coming out you can tell how magnificent that scenery is yet you cannot imagine it we can imagine a bird having two wings but a bird having four wings this is beyond our comprehension and that is the case with anything that we do not see the case with angels with gin with devils paradise a hell heavens we cannot imagine this and we are not supposed to put much effort in it because for example in paradise the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam tells us that in it there are three things that no eye has ever seen not there's nothing similar to what you have seen and things that no ear have has ever heard of and no heart ever imagined so it's beyond our imagination in his night journey the prophet told us allah that gabriel brought him two plates or pots or three a plate containing wine a plate containing milk and a plate containing honey and he asked him to choose so the prophet sallam chose milk which is one of the greatest food around us that people could live on it forever so gabriel said o muhammad you have chosen nature and if you had chosen wine then you will your followers would have gone astray but alhamdulillah you chose milk so the prophet salallahu chose milk in this night journey when allah spoke to our prophet muhammad he gave him 50 prayers per day and night and he told him that these prayers are obligatory upon your followers so the prophet sallam took this and came down and as he came down he was met by moses and moses peace and blessing be upon him we love him as we love all the messengers of allah but we particularly love him for this incident he told him what did allah give you so the prophet told him that he told me to pray 50 times a day so he told him go back to him go back to the almighty and seek his forgiveness because i have dealt with the sons of israel i have dealt with the jews and i know they are very difficult people and i'm afraid that your people will not accept this or comply with this so the prophet went to allah seeking his forgiveness and to reduce these 50 prayers and alhamdulillah allah reduced 10 of them so we were left with 40. he went back to moses and moses peace and blessing be upon him told him go back again for it is still a lot i know the sons of israel i know the jews and your the arabs are the the cousins of the jews the jews originated from isaac and the arabs originated from ishmael and they were all brothers the sons of abraham so we cannot be anti-semitism we are from the same blood he went back and allah scrapped 10 more and he kept on going on and on and on the prophet islam until allah made them five moses again told him go back five is a lot the prophet then stood and said i cannot go i am ashamed because of the numbers of times i went on and off to my lord and then allah spoke to them and said that i have originally made them 50. now they are five i did not change anything it is five with the reward of 50. and alhamdulillah imagine if we were to pray 50 times a day nowadays with only five prayers we have people saying we have 20 discount we don't prefer dawn prayer others say no we have 40 percent they don't pray fajr and they don't pray asar prayer which is afternoon prayer and by far whoever abandons prayer is not a muslim because the prophet says allah the oath that is between us and the non-muslims is prayer and the prophet allah said in a hadith which was narrated by imam muslim in the sahih he said that between man and blasphemy and kufur and disbelief between man and disbelief is prayer and whoever abandons prayer is not a muslim and this is the narration of abu dhabu therefore prayer is by far the one of the greatest pillars of islam and if you look at the pillars the different pillars of islam all of the instructions of islam were given to our prophet muhammad ali on earth with the exception of prayer it was given to him on the seventh heaven so this indicates its importance to us as muslims and how we should preserve this prayer of allah azzawajal the prophet salam took this prayer and also he told us that he had seen people being punished in hell and he had seen people being rewarded being living in the blessing of allah azza in paradise which means that hell and and paradise hell and heavens are do exist at the moment and allah had created people for them and there are people on this earth that will go after death to live there we have a short break and insha allah we will be right back if you're 18 or if you're 18 if you've been muslim for 50 years or five minutes this is a show for you you know when five times a day i've our foreheads touch the ground in prayer we beg for what's most important in our lives we want to be good people better muslims we want to serve allah almighty with all our hearts in this show let's talk every week we're going to talk about islam and life how to relate with other people and how to serve allah we'll have studio guests we'll have a live studio audience there'll be an email for you to write to talk tv so if you're looking for something different looking for something that will make you think maybe even touch your heart this is the show for you and welcome back through his night journey the prophet alaihi salatu salaam told us that he had seen the heavens and hell and scholars had their different opinions regarding this night journey is some of them say that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam made this journey only with his soul but not with his body and this is not true because if he made it with his soul then it was like a dream and we also in our dreams go different places so there's nothing so special in a person seeing things in his dreams the authentic opinion of scholars that this journey was made by his soul and body sallallahu alaihi but this does not mean there were other journeys with his soul so the journey with the body was done once but the journey with the soul took place a number of times where the prophet sallam told us in a number of hadiths that he had been to the heavens and that he had seen paradise and hell for instance the prophet sallam once said to his the abyssinian whose name was he said tell me what good deeds you have so special that qualified you to the extent that i heard the sound of your shoes ahead of me in paradise or the flip-flop the sound of your flip-flop and paradise so the prophet saw is telling us about an incident where he entered paradise and he heard this sound of the shoes or the flip-flops of bilal so bilal said i don't have anything extra oh prophet of allah except that whenever i nullify nullify my wudu whenever i pass wind or answer the call of nature i see that it is allah's right on me that i perform wudu again and pray to raha so this is the thing that qualified him to go to paradise in another hadith the prophet sallam told us that he went into paradise with the angels and he saw a very big white and beautiful house with a maid outside of it and he liked the house so he asked the maid who are you for and the maid said i belong to omar ibn khattab the second caliph and the father-in-law of the prophet sallallahu salaam and one of his best companions so the prophet said umar i remembered your jealousy so i said away now this is all in paradise umar burst entities weeping saying o prophet of allah do i feel jealous from you you are our master do i feel jealous from you you are our father this indicates that the prophet salallahu was in paradise and he visited that place unfortunately we also are told about the things in hell because the prophet sallam told us that he had seen malik the guardian of hell the angel responsible of controlling hell and that his face was so grim flowing enthralling face without a smile because this is his job and the prophet told us about some of the punishments that people are punished in hell he told us once that he had seen a man in lying down with another man carrying a rock and throwing it at his head breaking it into two and then the head comes back again and the man carries another rock and smashes his head on and on and on the prophet sallam asked the angels with him who's this man they told him that he is a man that sleeps over the obligatory prayer he has been given the quran but he does not pray the obligatory prayer so this is being done to him until the day of judgment another incident the prophet salallahu saw a man opening his mouth and another throwing into its stones and this man is swimming in a sea of blood and he keeps on throwing this stone to his mouth and he goes back and then he comes back again to the shore opening his mouth and the man throws stones into us so he asked who was this man and the angel sold the prophet sallam it is the man eating usually eating interest dealing with reba imagine this punishment until the day of judgment and on the day of judgment he will be thrown into hell with all the other sinners this is a very serious warning to whomever is dealing with banks whose whomever is dealing with on islamic banks that deals in riba usually this is one of the most major sins in islam in this case what we can do every the number of muslims living in the united state of or in united kingdom or european countries they're using the the cards mastercard visa cards without that they they can do marketing so this is completely different story now we have islamic banking and even banks that are not muslim they are using these divisions and departments because they found first that it attracts muslims secondly they found out that it is safer and more productive than the uh normal banking procedures they have as muslims living in the west you are told not to take you usually and not to pay it so if my credit cards if using my my credit cards means that i'm going to pay interest at the end of the month or at the end of the 40 days then this is forbidden this is completely unacceptable there are other islamic alternatives for example there is what's called debit card and debit card is a card that you deposit money so you for example you deposit 10 000 or 20 000 and wherever you go it's exactly like the credit cards you buy things with it you pay things with it and they deduct from your account until you have zero then it is stopped where you have to put deposit borrowing with interest is a major sin and both parties are alike in the sin so the person taking usury is sinful and the pa person paying it is sinful and both of them are cursed by the prophet salaam and those who uh the clerics writing this transaction are also cursed and those who witness such a transaction are also cursed they all share the same burden so muslims should stay as far as possible from such transactions the prophet sallam told us also about another punishment a man sitting with another man coming behind him with a a piece of metal that he puts in one side of his mouth and he tears his mouth to his back and with another a piece of metal tearing his other side to his the back of his head and the pro it's a horrible scene to see and then it goes back again not to normal and this punishment is inflicted hit on him over and over and over again so the prophet asked ali who is this man so he was told that this man is a liar that says a lie and his lie spreads all over the world among people and this is being done to him until the day of judgment now who would you think that would be the best person to qualify for this punishment who do you think would be appropriate person to be in this position people working in the media reporters journalists if they do not authenticate their news if they spread gossip if they just write things and slander people and whatever they say is spread all over the world if they don't fear allah azzawajal the people working in the media and the press and the tv and radios then they will be punished this punishment because they are spreading lies that go all over the world and if a muslim is concentrating to do the best thing and to say only the truthful thing then of course he is definitely rewarded greatly also among the men and women that the prophet saws so uh being punished on the day of judgment are the adulterers those who fornicate men and women he saw them in a an oven-like a building or structure which was narrow from the top and white from the bottom and they were all in that oven in that furnace and the men and women and they were nude and fire would used to light under them under the feet and they used to make noises and screams and they try to go up through that narrow place and then the fire goes down and they go down and it kept on going on them off and on when the prophet asked who are those the angels told him these those are the the one who commit adultery and finally the prophet alice also also saw people with nails made of copper long nails and they're scratching their faces and scratching their skin all the time until the day of judgment imagine the pain inflicted on such a person and it's not for one year 10 years 100 years a thousand years it's until the day of judgment so the prophet said islam who are these and the angels told him that these people backbite other others so they sit together and say oh do you remember john or jim he did this and that and that they say bad things about people in their absence and that is why they are being punished in this manner i'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program inshaallah we will meet next time and until then allah um"
