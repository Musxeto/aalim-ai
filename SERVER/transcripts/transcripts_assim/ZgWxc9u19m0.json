  "title": "If I join Friday prayer that is at 3:30 when Prayer App says Asr is at 3:00 pm Is prayer valid assim",
  "transcript": "yes sir uh sh I got a question so I live in the United States and we use a Muslim app that shows the timing so that we can keep up with the prayer timings so you know we also like follow daylight saving so you know sometimes timing is affected now let's say there's a Masjid that has like three different timings for the Jima prayer 1:30 230 3:30 but my but the Muslim app says the Ard timing starts at 3: so if someone joins the one at 3:30 is it still acceptable or not this depends on the calculation of prayer if the Masjid is following the Hani calculation the answer is no his J is not valid because was at 3:00 according to the three schools of thought and the majority of Muslims but if the app itself is inaccurate and the Masjid is following the correct timing of ass beginning at 4:00 or whatever in this case the Salat is valid and Allah Knows Best"
