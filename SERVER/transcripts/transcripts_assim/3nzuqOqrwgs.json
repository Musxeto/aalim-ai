  "transcript": "alhamdulillah we begin with the grace and blessing of Allah Asel in today's class studying the chapter that deals with that deals with fasting and as we know that fasting is one of the pillars of Islam and the definition of fasting linguistically is to refrain so linguistically you could fast from talking as mentioned in the Quran I have pledged today that I fast from speaking so I would not talk to any human being but we know that the linguistic definition is not what counts but rather what counts as the Islamic definition or what we call the technical definition and fasting is defined by to refrain from things that nullifies your fasting from the break of dawn till sunset with the intention of worshiping Allah and this is very important that you have this last phrase with the intention of worshiping Allah because I could fast and a lot of the non-muslims fast from things that nullify their fasting but the intention is not for the sake of Allah the intention is for dieting the intention is for losing weight the intention is because the doctor told them not to eat or drink so is this considered to be fasting no the proper fasting is to refrain with the intention of worshiping Allah Asel and Ramadan is known as the month of patience because fasting is an excellent display of patience and the pillar that is fasting it only fasting of Ramadan so it is not fasting of Ash or ARA or the white days or the Mondays or Thursdays it is only fasting the month of Ramadan this is what's a pillar upon every Muslim and muslima so it is the month of patience and Scholars divide patients into three types and they say that all of these three types are found in fasting the month of Ramadan so when they say patience they say that that you have to be patient in not doing the sins and you have to be patient in doing the mandatory things and you have to be patient when the calamities of Allah befall upon you these are the three types of patience and whoever attains these three types he is considered to be the patient one in fasting Ramadan you have all these three displayed so you fast from Haram you fast from things that are sinful the prophet tells usat that he who refrains from eating and drinking but does not refrain from false testimony and saying false things Allah does not need him to stop eating and drinking meaning his fasting is not accepted if you continue to do bad things and sins especially testifying falsely or saying false things this means that your eating and drinking did not change anything also in fasting Ramadan we have patience on doing what Allah instructed you to do and by stopping eating and drinking is an excellent display of obedience to Allah and of your patience on doing things that Allah commanded you and of course the greatest type of patience would be to be patient when the calamities of Allah befall upon you and hunger and thirst is a Calamity not being able to do Halal things such as having intimacy with your wife is a Calamity but your patience is highly rewarded by Allah and it is a training session Ramadan is a training session because anything that is considered to be addictive Islam tells you not to be addicted to it Islam only wants you to be addicted to worshiping Allah and remembering him and striving in reaching Allah's pleasure for example your addiction to food and drink which is Hal Allah tells you you have to take a break so that you would not be enslaved to Halal things such as intimacy with your spouse such as eating and drinking be free because when you are able to control yourself over Halal things it goes without saying that your control over Haram things would be even stronger if a person person does not drink water because Allah tells him not to drink water do you think that he will be able to drink alcohol he would have a stronger will than any other person and that is why Islam forbids you from being addicted to things especially Haram things so those who are addicted to smoking in Ramadan they display their obedience to Allah by quitting for 16 hours which means that if they have full confidence in Allah and Trust they will be able to stop the full 24 hours all what you need is to believe once you believe Allah asael will support you and Allah the almighty would guide you and who is it that fasting is mandatory upon it is mandatory upon every Muslim who is sane who has reached the age of puberty and who does not have any restrictions from fasting and what do we mean by restrictions of fasting for example a woman in her mensis or a woman in her Post delivery bleeding is she obliged to fast is she permitted to fast no she's not so this is something that restricts her from fasting a traveler and this this depends on the traveling but it's a permission from Allah that a traveler May skip fasting and to make it up when he's capable a sick person likewise and we know that we have to fast the month of Ramadan but we have to also go through the process of identifying that Ramadan is due or not and this is done by observing and citing the birth of the new moon so we will come inshallah to the hadiths that explain some of the previously mentioned topics Hadith number 177 yes brother there it is related from abuur that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said none of you should fast a day or two before Ramadan except a man who customarily fast in this Hadith the prophet wasam is forbidding us from fasting a day or two before Ramadan why is that Scholars say that there is something that is known as the day of doubt and the day of Doubt usually is the 30th of of shahan and why do we call it doubt because if today is the 29th after Sunset what will we be doing we'll be observing and trying to site for the new moon and that is the Crescent if we cite it this means that tomorrow is the first of Ramadan if we don't site it for a reason or the other or if we fail to cited because there are clouds or a lot of wind and dust what should we do the prophet told us Alam to assume that tomorrow is the 30th of shaan and not fast so there would be people who would come and say well it's an issue of Doubt is tomorrow 30th or the 1 of Ramadan just for the sake of argument I will Fast tomorrow just to be on the safe side the prophet said this is not permissible do not precede Ramadan by fasting it a day or two why because then you would allow Shan to come into your thoughts and to your life and start to always tell you to be on the safe side you perform M I washed my limbs three times just to be on the safe side wash it once again by this you you will destroy your life you will allow shatan to play with you like children play with football like those who come and ask Sheik did I divorce my wife or not I don't know he said I divorced my wife in my mind 100 times but I did not say it so I say she's not divorced said yes but I may have said it such thoughts and Whispers of shatan destroy your life so you should not allow this however the prophet am made an exception and this exception was for those who regularly fast a particular day such as Mondays and Thursdays so if it happens that today the 29th of shaan is a Wednesday and tomorrow the 30th of Shaban is a Thursday and I have the habit of every Monday and Thursday I fast what should I do tomorrow I I should fast because the prophet gave me the permission likewise those who fast the fasting of the W peace be upon him which is fast today and break the next so if I did not fast today and tomorrow is the 30th is it permissible for me to fast the answer is yes because by this you would be complying and following the prophet's instruction Alat wasam we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be assalamu alaykum and welcome back Hadith number 178 this Hadith was narrated by Abdullah may Allah be pleased with him that the prophet sallallahu alaih wasam said do not fast until you see the new moon and do not break the fast until you see it if it is cloudy then you must calculate it the Hadith Falls in line with what we've mentioned before Muslims know the beginning and the end of the month by observing the new moon so you do not begin Ramadan until you site and observe the new moon at the end of shaan and likewise you continue to fast until you sight the moon at the end of Ramadan or until you finish Ramadan to be 30 days and the prophet gave us Al an easy solution out if there is cloud and we're unable to detect the new moon on the 29th of the month then you have to calculate it in the sense that calculating it would be that tomorrow is the 30th and there is a Hadith clearly stating that Shah complete the month meaning that it would be 30 so you have only two options after the 29th day of the month you either site the moon or if you are unable to site it or you don't see it due to the presence of clouds you have to complete the month to be 30th there's no other third alternative okay then what is the ruing on What Muslim countries or some of the Muslim countries do they depend on astronomists to calculate to them the birth of the new moon so astronomist say that tomorrow definitely is the beginning of Ramadan can we go ahead with what they had said even if we did not site the moon and the answer is no the prophet wasam he clearly stated that we are a nation a umah that we do not calculate and the month is either this or this meaning it's either 29 or 30 days you cannot have the month being 28 and you cannot have the month being 31 it has to be either 29 or 30 so how do we know by observing the moon if we did not see the moon on the 29th then definitely tomorrow is the 30th and that is it and you find that even if you were wrong it will be rectified the following month by citing the moon ahead of time or it would be 29 or 30 days and this goes on throughout the whole year so in Islam alhamdulillah any lay man can observe the moon any person can know by looking at the sky that today is the middle of the month or the beginning of the month or it's approximately close to the end of the month you can tell by the size of the Moon and the month is known by the birth of the new moon do all Muslim countries fast Ramadan if one of them cited the moon or not it's an issue of dispute what is practiced nowadays clearly states that every country has its own sighting and and this was the Sunnah of the prophet in the authentic Hadith when and he was one of the companions of Abbas came from Syria where the Khalifa was mua IB Abu sufyan may Allah be pleased with him and with his father he came at the end of Ramadan so IB Abbas asked him when did you see the Cent and they said on Saturday so IB Abbas said well we did not see it on Saturday we saw it on Sunday so he told him are you going to do and apply the sighting of muaah he said no we're going to apply our own sighting and this is the Sunnah which indicates that each region has its own sighting but Scholars differed in regard to what do we call a region so if I see the Cent In mumbay the people of Delhi would fast or they say no we depend on our sighting it's an issue of dispute most likely a region is one that is governed by a ruler and the ruler is the one who dictates whether to take the sighting of the adjacent region or not some Scholars say that a region is what is approximately to be in the diameter of 2,000 kilm and these approximately 2,000 km would have the same sighting what is being practiced today that each country each government has its own sighting usually when we site the moon in Saudi Arabia we have all the gulf countries following us so they believe and they Depend and they follow the sighting of the same Arabian Peninsula which is quite huge likewise other countries each country has its own ruling the do you have any questions Alum sh my question is regarding last time when we met we talked about the experation maybe on the Hajj that when we sacrifice so can we eat the meat of that sacrifice the answer is no whenever you pay an experation you cannot eat from the meat of the slaughtering but if you are offering for example you may eat if you're offering W you may eat but when you're offering Hadi you should eat when you offer you should eat because all of this is part of the Sunnah the expirations and the oath the you do not eat from them at all with the exception of NE if you intended it so for example if someone makes an oath and this oath is not recommended it is Mak the prophet told us not to do do it but once you pledge yourself to do it you must do it so if someone says oh Allah if my child passes tomorrow's exam I will slaughter a sheep he made it General now what is your intention he says my intention is to give it to sodak you must not eat anything of it if I ask him again what is your intention he says my intention is to slaughter it and to call my relatives so that we will eat from it then you can eat from it it depends on your intention so I hope this answers your question any more questions yes brother shik supposing if someone makes a oath to Allah that he wouldn't do this and he breaks the oath you feed 10 people then does he have to continue with that oath or that means that oath is finished if it is continuous he has to fulfill his pledge the prophet said whoever pledges that he should obey Allah in doing something that is form of worship he must fulfill that so if someone says if this thing happens I will Fast every Monday he must fast every Monday and if he misses one Monday intentionally he's lazy he should continue this does not affect the coming Mondays so if this is your question then I hope this answers it though we know that it is not not recommended to have such a Pledge yes brother question is regarding last topic when we met last time what is the ruling about zaka on the money people have in their accounts of government Provident funds or private provent funds okay I will answer this question inshallah the money that the government deducts from your salary this is not something that you can use or utilize you cannot go to the government and tell them give me my money they will not give it to you it is the scheme that after you complete 25 years they will give you this retirement money on installments once every month and in this case it is completely different than your own savings so this money is not your saving likewise the end of service Indemnity if you finish 10 years or 20 years if you design usually they calculate something and give you the money and this money is also not zable unless one year passes because during your service you were unable to cash this money it was not in your possession you're not the lawful owner of it I'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time"
