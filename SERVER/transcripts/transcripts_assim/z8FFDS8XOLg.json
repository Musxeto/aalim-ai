  "transcript": "Islam from Bangladesh shik our nikah has has been fixed and I think and hope it's a very good match evaluating all sides inshallah he says his is of but my concern is his b with the and positiveness about them as I have limited knowledge about t also he told is new of which I don't know is right or wrong can I married to this man he says what knowledge I I don't understand sh I yes yeah what about his he said is new who's uh Islamic any knowledge any Islamic knowledge is new is new new new light no okay okay so basically speaking I cannot judge a person from what he says if he says that he's from I'll take his word for it but if he reads and believes in it or or goes to their conventions and believes in their Innovation then he is not from that doesn't mean he's a cfir there are so many good people among theis and they are close to us but they have a lot of ignorance a lot of um lack of commitment to the holistic and what they focus upon is or are very few issues and they have big issues with or with and with weaks and with Innovations so I cannot judge and it wouldn't be fair for me to judge this person to say that is n every knowledge the Quran is new the prophet is n these things are light because they shine in our lives and they shine our chests and bring light to our uh uh life with Iman and the likes this is not related to the light of Allah which is one of his attributes of course that would be kufur but yes knowledge is light and ignorance is Darkness so this is not enough to judge this person however you have to try your best to um enforce the and to correctly present it to him after your marriage is done you have to increase the knowledge of Allah's beautiful names and attributes and the articles of faith and inshallah things would work out"
