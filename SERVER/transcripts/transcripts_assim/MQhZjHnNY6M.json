  "transcript": "most of the applications on uh on the phone like Facebook or YouTube or even the transactions like creating a bank account now we have what they call terms of service and these and these two terms must be agreed upon to in order to use the app or even create the account the problem is that these terms do um these terms say that any dispute between the two parties will be resolved exclusive in courts that do not rule in Allah's laws so what's the ruling on on signing this agreements especially with applications that are not necessary or just used for entertainment purposes safan uh I'll ask you two questions or one question maybe how many options do you have not a lot um only two either to agree or to disagree so what will you choose if you choose not to agree this means that you will not use any application any form of even you cannot install Windows on your computer and this is so much hardship and the Shar with the grace of Allah says when everything gets too hard Shar makes it more wide and when things are so open and wide Shar makes it narrow and limited so you have two options either to refuse and this would cause you a great deal of hardship you cannot live normally because all of these applications that are required for your livelihood for your work for your uh studies for transportation require you agree the second option is to AG due to compulsion and to doing due to being forced I don't like it and I know they put this agreement and said that I have to say I agree only to protect themselves from legal prosecution so that I would not sue them I would not say this and that about them so this is why they're saving themselves and protecting their back as they say so person you have two choices and you do the math and Allah Knows Best"
