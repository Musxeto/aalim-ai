  "title": "Emotional: An incident with the Prophet ﷺ and a nomad companion [POSITIVITY] assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Saying a lie. All what comes from his mouth is truthful. In an incident, there was a companion by the name of Zahir. And this companion was a nomad, a Bedouin, meaning that he did not live in the city or the town or a village. He was taking his sheep, roaming around the earth looking for places to graze. So he was always living in his tent. And he used to come to Medina every now and then to sell some of his goods and earn money and go about his own life. But whenever he comes to Medina, he used to bring gifts to the Prophet ﷺ. And the Prophet loved him. A simple man. He used to say, Zahir is our nomad living in the wilderness or in the desert and we are his town folk that he comes and visits. One day the Prophet went to the market ﷺ and saw him auctioning some of his stuff. This is how the markets were. Who would buy this pen from me? One, two, five, okay five, nobody else, I'll sell it to him. This is how they used to sell and buy things, auctions. So while he was selling his merchandise, minding his own business, the Prophet sneaked from behind him and embraced him. So the guy wasn't able to see who was that behind him. And he says, let me go, who is this? Let me go. Then when he looked and he discovered that it was the Prophet ﷺ, he kept on going back so that his back would become in contact with the Prophet ﷺ more rather than trying to release himself from the Prophet ﷺ. So the Prophet ﷺ started announcing, who would buy this slave from me? The Prophet is joking with him but he is a slave, a slave of Allah. So the Prophet is auctioning him and he was joking in a very beautiful manner with this companion who was not of great importance like Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, he was just a nomad. And Zahir said, O Prophet of Allah, in this case nobody would buy me. If you're auctioning me, nobody is interested in buying someone like me. And the Prophet ﷺ said, but by Allah you are of great value at the sight of Allah. Encouragement, positivity, optimism, what kind of a boost this would give to this nomad? No one knows him."
