  "transcript": "Yasin from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh, my question is if somebody says the morning Adhkar, Asr time, would he still get the reward of saying it or does it have to be said at Fajr time? Jazak Allah Khairan Yasin, are you referring to the morning Adhkar or the evening Adhkar? The morning Adhkar No, if he says it at Asr time, it's over. Once the Zuhr is called, the most authentic opinion is that it's, that's it, you're not protected anymore. So be careful."
