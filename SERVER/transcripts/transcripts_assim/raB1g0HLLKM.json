  "title": "Dua for moving into a new house - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "regarding a dua for a person who moves into a new house and there is no such prescribed dua so the only thing to say is when you enter a new house or you enter your hotel room or a rented apartment that you say three times that's it other than that if you wish to recite surat al-baqarah entirely to ward off shaytan this is good but if you do this uh reading the last two verses of surat al-baqarah which afterwards alhamdulillah this would ward off shaytan the devils for three nights and then you recite it and we know that reciting it is part of the athkar of going to bed so alhamdulillah this is all what i know and allah knows best"
