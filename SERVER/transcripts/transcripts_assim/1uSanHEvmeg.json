  "transcript": "foreign days off of what just from leading the five daily Salah you know I don't maybe like going somewhere to have fun this is up to them an Imam is either being appointed by the board of the Masjid or by the government and he gets paid for that or he he is a freelancer doesn't get paid for it he assumes the role of Imam for the sake of Allah and For the Love of the religion like a lot of the Muslims a lot a lot of us don't get paid for this because they have other sources of income they don't need it alhamdulillah so if he's someone that is appointed by the government or by the committee or the board of the Masjid and he gets paid for it we have to look into his contract if his contract says that you're obliged to give four every month of Fridays and one or two classes a week as for the prayer it's up to you this is what's between him and the committee or the government if he is a volunteer he does it for the sake of Allah no one can hold him accountable he can set off whenever he wants and and quit the imama for a week or two or three without any problems so it is dependent on the contract"
