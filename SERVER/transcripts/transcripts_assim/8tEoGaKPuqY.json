  "transcript": "[Music] of arafah which is the ninth day of the hijjah the prophet alaihis wasalam gave a concise speech and it didn't take more than 10 minutes even less yet it contained so much knowledge that if the muslims were ever to implement it they would lead the whole world once again the earlier generations followed it and they led the world and this is what was known as the golden era of the muslims and of islam and maybe they called it in europe the middle ages or the dark ages but to us it was the golden times because the muslims followed what the prophet taught them word for word this is not the addressing the state of the union for an hour filled with rubbish this is what cements the ground for an everlasting civilization we don't have the time to go through it though it's quite short but the messages the messages are so profound in the beginning the prophet says o people your blood your wealth and your honor are sacred to you as the sanctity of this day the day of arafah in this month the day the month of the hija in this land of yours which is the sacred holy shrines now the prophet allah is began his address began his speech by warning the people that they do not they do not have the right to harm others to take their wealth or to tarnish their reputation and he made this so clear that he compared doing this to violating the sanctity of the sanctuary of the haram in the holy month and the sacred month of the hijjah in that holy day of arafah which is a eid for the muslims as um said may allah be pleased with him so why aren't muslims following this why do we see this chaos this carnage the killing the bloodshed because those who are involved in such actions are not real true muslims simply because they're not abiding by the quran and the sunnah yet the west the disbelievers the other denominations are trying to label islam of being violent where it's in black and white this is the address the oration of the prophet islam to the whole ummah not to violate such sanctioned things such things of importance bloodshed no taking people's wealth and no tarnishing their reputation this is the understanding of security that you feel secure when you are around muslims and this is what all expats acknowledge when they come to muslim countries they say we feel safe even if we leave our things most likely nothing will happen to it we will come back and find it where we had left it and this is a glimpse of the traces of the teachings of the prophet alaihissalatu wasanam then the prophet sallallahu alaihi walisalam moves on to canceling calls of pre-islamic era and these calls that may go against sharia may go against the teachings of islam anything that goes against the quran the sunnah the prophet says al-islam it is under my feet it's all abolished it's all cancelled anything that was pre-islamic and goes against islam and the sharia it's completely abolished and he gave an example of blood feuds which were prevalent at the time so if someone kills someone the tribe of the victim will kill two or more of the murderer's tribe not the murderer innocent people and in retaliation they would kill five and they will kill 10 and they will keep on fighting the prophet said all of this was abolished it's all cancelled underneath and beneath his feet and likewise anyone who comes nowadays to call the muslims for similar feuds whether he's calling others for communism socialism or being liberal or being a capitalist any calls that goes any calls that go against islam such as the call of equality feminism liberty all of this is against islam not that islam opposes freedom no but what kind of freedom are you hinting oh the freedom for a man to walk naked or a woman to take off her hijab this is not freedom this is transgression against islam against the teachings and the commands of allah and this is abolished and cancelled and underneath the feet of the prophet sallallahu salaam democracy stating that we rule by the people by the people this is all abolished there is only one that rules and there is the rule of sharia the rule of quran and sunnah not the whims and desires of humans who change and flip every single minute also the blood feuds the errors of others the mistakes of others allah says and no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another so we can't blame others for things that they have not committed let alone prosecute them and carry the sentence upon them prophet furthermore goes on in in his short concise speech to abolish riba to abolish usury and he tells us that this is one of the major sins in islam and when we look and reflect 15 centuries ago what kind of riba was there i'll give you a loan of a thousand you returned them 1100. very simple very easy look what this had grown into nowadays you have institutions that facilitate riba mandates riba in slaves countries and individuals through river the imf the international monetary fund enslaves countries for billions and billions not of loans rather of interest compound interest the countries have paid the original loan years and decades ago but they keep on milking them in a recent form of colonism and everybody is working hard to pay off such a debt and they keep on growing richer and richer and looking for other countries to colonize and to enslave people nowadays work more than their ability to pay off their mortgages to pay off of their loans they got for buying a car or a property or the furniture or to finance their summer vacation everybody lives on credit cards and they pay compound interest something that the prophet warned against allah 15 centuries ago and the muslims don't pay attention to the curse that allah has placed on the people who take riba and give interest in riba and witness this contract writing and those who write and keep the books they're all in the curse of allah alike no one has the upper hand over the other they're all equal then the prophet is remind us by saying fear allah in what the prophet says fear allah concerning women so the prophet allah is instructing us and telling us to fear allah the almighty when it comes to women affair in the past women were a symbol to all evil betrayal and shame women used to be nothing allah honored women allah made her a mother a sister a daughter and a wife allah secured her financial needs and gave her the freedom of choice no one on earth can get her married to someone she doesn't want but at the same time she cannot marry someone her guardian does not approve of why have a guardian because this is how allah created women they he created them to be submissive to men that they could never be guardians over men women can never be rulers they can never rule or control but this is how allah made man man and woman and allah did not order women to provide for men but rather the opposite men provide for women men deal with women by honoring them by loving them by carrying them they're prohibited from smacking their faces or leaving a mark on their bodies islam prohibits men to starve their wives or not clothe them or not shelter them this is a man's responsibility what we hear nowadays calls for empowerment of women feminists calling women to go on the rampage to rebel what we see in the kafir and the disbelieving world from things getting out of proportion this is what islam prohibits and this is what allah azzawajal orders us to protect our women folk and to order them to abide by the hijab for their own goodness and for the community's goodness allah says do not display yourselves as was as was the display of the former times of ignorance time does not permit us to go on but there are so much to be learned from this small concise speech of the prophet which i encourage myself and you to go over and over again to study it and to implement what's in it and allah azza [Music] m [Music] foreign"
