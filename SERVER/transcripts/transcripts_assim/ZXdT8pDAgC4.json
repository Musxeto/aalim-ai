  "transcript": "n the next question from our main side n my question is what is the view of Islam on the doctrine of reincarnation Islam does not believe in reincarnation this is a Hindu uh uh I think an an Buddhist belief you die you are in the bar there are three stages in life Life as we know it we're born we live and we die then we move to stage two which is Barak which is a transitional period between dun and Hereafter the day of judgment and we live in this period in our Graves for a known period of time until the day of judgment on the day of judgment our souls are restored to our bodies in the perfect form and then we live for eternity in Jenna inshallah and those who do disbelieve will be in Hellfire for eternity so the concept of reincarnation which is not related to Islam and which is not logical so you ask them and they say yes yes I think I know I've met you in a previous life yeah I think but then I was a fish man I was a bad man I was a bad person but I love to swim this is why I love to swim I was a fish said what is this said yeah when you die you if you did good in your life you'll be reincarnated into a Pious person if you are a bad you'll be a coach yeah don't kill the coach it might be one of your ancestors of oop sorry so this is stupid this is nonsense and nobody has any but this is what the disbelievers believe because they don't want to believe that there's a day of judgment and the natural inclination Al they all know whenever we die there will be a day of judgment and we'll be resurrected and held accountable to it and Allah Knows Best"
