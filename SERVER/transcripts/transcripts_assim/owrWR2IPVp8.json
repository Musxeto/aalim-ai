  "transcript": "sh I'm from Bangladesh and I don't like Bangladesh for so many reason so I wish to get married to a man from like UK I don't have any specific men selected and I am very biased alhamdulillah so I believe I will be able to stay on Dean and make my child's better um and spread Islam there I know I'm not worthy of a man from UK but there is no harm in trying and every time I make decision I take advice from you and make Dua to Allah we can get anything if we make Dua right so can I make Dua to Allah for I as good man from ukuk should I make this Dua please advise me first of all there's no problem in making Dua to Allah to Grant you a righteous practicing Pious Rich healthy wealthy handsome husband totally permissible however your Dua should be governed by Quran and Sunnah so if the result of your Dua would lead you to travel to a non-muslim country and stay there and leaving behind your Muslim country despite the corruption the bribes the lack of Education the bad attitude towards women Etc still it is a Muslim country still Islam is valued there and you can practice and not fear upon your children that they would shove down their throat the belief beliefs in the rights of lgbtq or free sex or uh uh protected sex or evolution theories or attacking religion because all of this falls under the freedom of speech but when it comes to expressing Islam oh this is an act of terrorism this is hate speech Subhan Allah so who in his right mind would jeopardize the upbringing of their own children and I have hundreds of C in sessions with folks from Europe and from North America where they're crying their tears because of what happened to their children who ran away or who started doing weed or who took off the hijab after memorizing the Quran because the fitna is overwhelming so no woman in her right mind would ask Allah to take her to such country having said that without any doubt the UK is one of the best if not the Best Western non-muslim country on Earth that I know of the amount of Tolerance and and and and uh respect to the Muslims is unmatched with any European country at all they're you know Miles and Miles Ahead nevertheless you do not have the right to leave your Muslim country to such a non-muslim country let alone make Dua for that and Allah knows best uh uh"
