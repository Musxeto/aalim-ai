  "transcript": "ismail says does a woman have to wear hijab in front of her brother-in-law can she be alone with him as he is like her own brother the prophet islam salam answered this question and highlighted the dangers of the brother-in-law and he taught us that the dangers of the brother-in-law is far greater than the dangers of a stranger is far greater so he once addressed the companions he said do not enter upon women meaning to you so i'm here in my room and there are other women in the adjacent room so i would like to go in there and mix and chit chat and give salam the prophet says islam do not do this so one of the companions said alaihis salat was merely pleased with him said okay what about the in-laws of prophet of allah so this room i'm entering they're not full strangers they're not my wife's besties no they are my cousins my female cousins they are my wife's sisters or aunts so they are my in-laws the prophet said if you allow your brother to enter upon your wife if you allow your uncle paternal maternal or cousins to enter upon your wife and mix with her this is as if you allow death to come to your wife and nobody wants this what does that mean it means that the dangers of in-laws whether they're my brother my uncle my cousin the dangers are far greater than a stranger why if a random stranger a friend of mine who my wife doesn't know or the plumber or any person wanted to come to the room to initiate a conversation to mix with my wife she would definitely refrain and fight that he said how can i speak to him while if that person happens to be my own brother or my uncle she would not find it that difficult and she would let her guard down and that would lead to catastrophes and i'm not talking out of thin air i've done counseling to people who had fell in the major sin with a brother-in-law with the nephew of the husband with the closest to the husband because they let their guard down he was raised with us for so many years we've been mixing together for so many years and shaytan doesn't rush for things he has all the time in the world how much time do you need a couple of months no problem couple of years no problem i'm willing to wait 10 15 years until the dish is marinated and the meal is just about to be cooked properly this is when he strikes and when he strikes he strikes bad mellow protectors so definitely this is not permissible at all and to treat him as a brother that would anger allah the almighty is you"
