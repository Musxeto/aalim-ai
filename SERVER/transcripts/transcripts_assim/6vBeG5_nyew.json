  "title": "Who to follow when Prophet's sunnah differs from sunnah of 4 rightly guided caliphs? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "South Africa he says we have an issue which is the prophet Alat wasam orders us to do something so his Sunnah is fixed then the four righteously guided calfs whom he the prophet told us to follow his Sunnah and their Sunnah do something that is different what are we to do this is an issue which means that you can do either one and both are correct according to the isad of the Muslim ruler for example the prophet in uh flogging the one who drinks intoxicants they used to flog 40 Lashes when Omar came and people used to drink like fish and 40 is nothing so he consulted the Companions and if I'm not mistaken Al Allah be pleased with him the fourth Calif said when a person drinks and gets wasted he starts to slunder and slandering punishment is 80 lashes so you can go up to 80 lashes and he did so and since then everybody is being flogged 80 lashes for getting drunk or consuming intoxicant if the Muslim ruler thought that no I'd like to go back to 40 would that be okay that would be a okay this is a sun of the Prophet Alam if someone says no I'm going to stick with 80 because all the companions agreed upon it and nobody went against it this is okay so it it is dependent on thead of the Muslim ruler likewise the prophet time you say to your wife I divorce you thrice or divorce divorce divorce the prophet used to count it as one Abu Bakr used to count it at one om may Allah be pleased with him in the beginning of his Reign used to count it as one then when he saw that people are making it easy to throw three divorces at once he said no as a punishment it's three and many schools of thought adopted this opinion and it continued nowadays it's up to the Muslim judge to decide which one to take and both opinions are fine so when it comes to the aan if the IM of the Masjid wants to have one aan this is fine because the second aan which was introduced byman was for a reason and this reason does not exist anymore but if he wants to maintain the Sunnah ofman that's perfectly fine of having two adans and if he wants to let that or limit that to one of them this is also fine and there's no reason to fight over it"
