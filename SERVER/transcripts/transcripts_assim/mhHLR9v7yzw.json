  "transcript": "a question is from aksa and she says is it okay to say arabic is the language of allah what is meant by such a question is not limited to a specific language so we cannot say that this is the language of allah per se however all languages are the languages of allah allah azza created these languages and enabled us to speak with them but if your question is implying that whether arabic is the language of the hereafter of paradise the language which allah will speak on the day of judgment to the people with this is something we have no evidence to back it up to confirm that yes it is or no it isn't some scholars say that all the conversations in the quran and the hadiths being in arabic and allah selecting arabic to be the eternal language of the quran insinuates that this is the case and that arabic is the language of the hereafter but again there is nothing concrete that we can base this allegation of own and hence we cannot confirm nor deny"
