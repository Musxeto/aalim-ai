  "transcript": "Ayaan from US. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu. I have three scenarios. Can you tell me if they're kufr, shirk or not? Three is too much Ayaan. You know that's the routine. You know the drill. We can only entertain one question. Imagine if everyone has a scenario of like five pages long. I can't entertain this. So give me one scenario and then we will look into the others later on InshaAllah. If I'm afraid to advise someone, is this kufr or shirk? The fear that would take a person out of the fold of Islam is the fear that is a mixture of revering Allah Azza Wa Jal or glorifying or worshipping. This can only be devoted to Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala. I fear a lion or a black mamba. I fear gators. I fear snakes. I fear scorpions. I fear maybe some people fear the dark. Fearing the jinn. All of this is not shirk or kufr. This is natural fear. Fire is in front of you. You're appalled and step back. Hey you're afraid. You're a kafir. Don't fear other than Allah. Okay what do you want me to do? Go in? You be my guest. You don't fear other than Allah. Be my guest. This is natural fear. So if you fear someone or you're shy of saying or doing something because of someone, this is not shirk or kufr. Because the fear of Allah includes revering Allah Azza Wa Jal, glorifying Allah, worshipping Allah, being submissive to Allah. And all of this is not happening here when you fear someone or you're shy from someone Allah Azza Wa Jal knows best."
