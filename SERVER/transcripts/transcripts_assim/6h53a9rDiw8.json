  "title": "How can a layman ponder upon the Quran? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "from the emirates so i know that allah wants us to ponder and reflect over the quran but i'm a layman i haven't studied arabic yet so i'm asking i know it's not a according to our whims and desires but are there any steps to take to ponder and reflect finally we have two minutes left so i think we will conclude with this uh question musemal from the emirates he says i am a layman i am not an arab and i'd like to know how to ponder upon the quran and can i make my own ways of pondering and coming up with ideas that i understand from the quran the answer is no you must in the beginning understand what the ayahs talk about in arabic because with all due respect non-arabs when they read the translation of the quran they get 95 of the meaning but or maybe less but not the 100 percent they are depending on my translation which might be good but it is not accurate and this is why we say don't say the translation of the quran because the quran cannot be translated rather say the translation of the meaning of the quran because the meaning differs from one person to the other so you don't understand the quran directly rather you just understand it through an interpreter a translator secondly in order to ponder upon the quran you need to know the reason this ayah was revealed when how why and you have to know was it abrogated or not you have to study what are the hadith that prophet hassam used this ayah in and what did the companions use it used it in and how they understood it because this all adds value once you have all this cocktail ready and made and you can grasp the spirit of it and you have at least done the basics of al-qaeda the basics of hadith etc yes after that you can ponder upon it and understand things that may allah ignite in your head to understand that people may not have seen this concept from your angle before and allah knows best you"
