  "title": "If everything is already predestined Why do anything at all? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "abdul mujeeb from nigeria now the hadith where the prophet says assalam about predestiny when people asked him why are we doing what we're doing is it something that the ink that allah wrote everything that's going to happen has dried and the books were folded meaning nothing else can be introduced or is it something reoccurring something that is continuously being updated and written again and again so the prophet said no the ink has dried and the books have been folded so the companion said then why work why pray why worship allah azzawajal the prophet said as islam work and offer deeds everyone allah would facilitate him to do what is best what does that mean everything was predestined 50 000 years before allah created the universe so in the authentic hadith when allah created the pen allah ordered the pen to write the pen said what should i write allah said write everything that is going to happen until the day of judgment the prophet al-islam tells us about the time he said that this was 50 000 years before allah created the universe so now this means that it is already predestined whether i'm going to heaven or to hell it is already predestined when i will die it is already predestined whether i will drop the pen or not everything is predestined is everything is written the biggest problem is when people think in the details which they're not supposed to do because the english say the devil is in the details you have to believe in general the sixth article of iman and to believe in predestiny whether good or bad so you believe in that but what is pre-destiny oh how can it be that allah azza knows whether i'm in heaven or in hell if he knows and he registered that i'm in hell then why am i doing what i'm doing after 20 minutes i have to go to the masjid and pray aisha why should i pray isha if i'm already destined to hell that's a very valid question the problem is how do you know whether you're destined to hell or to heaven oh allah azza already wrote that true but how do you know why do you assume the worst why didn't you say no i am among the people of paradise in the highest level of paradise therefore i'll go 10 minutes early for isha prayer and i'll pray in the first row and i'll read one jesus of the quran and i'll do my card this is how you're supposed to think pre-destiny is allah's knowledge so when you come and try to figure things out how can you figure things about allah's beautiful attribute which is knowledge he knows the past he knows the present he knows the future he knows what will not happen in the future how would it have been if it were to happen all of this is within allah's knowledge all of this is within allah's will all of this is written 50 000 years before creating the creation and if you know this and if you know that all of these predestined things are created by allah whether they're good or bad nothing is created without allah's permission but one million kuwaiti question is do you know what is predestined for you no so what to do well you can sit back relax do nothing and end up in hell choice is yours or you could strive you could work out you could go and do the best you can to enter paradise from the eighth gates of paradise and to be next to the prophet sallam you do your best maybe you will not be able to do half of that but at least show allah that you're doing your best and at the end of the day you will see what was predestined for you materializing so don't mix apples with oranges always acknowledge that pre-destiny is related to allah's knowledge and no one can comprehend that you have to believe in it and this is why it's one of the part one of the articles of e-man"
