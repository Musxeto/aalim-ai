  "transcript": "while watching the new moon sighting it felt like a good day lighting this day is so bright as the first time i was the night with family around a nice meal we're making duan i feel how nice it is to be so neat to those i love and welcome to this new program which will come to you live with the grace of allah azzawajal every day of ramadan days with the exception of friday at this same particular time from two o'clock till three o'clock every day on huda channel and the topic would be the virtues of fasting and we selected that we study one of the traditional books of islam and one of the most prominent books of and that is the book of bulu al-maram which was compiled by al-hafiz may allah have mercy on his soul of course we all know that ibn hajjar is one of the great scholars of islam he was in hadith he was so knowledgeable that you cannot find anyone who does not depend on his literature who does not refer to the things that he had written may allah have mercy on his soul and one of the greatest books that everyone knows in islam is his famous book fat albari which was a commentary on sahih al-bukhari what is the significance of the book beluga al-maram what is so special about it well there are a number of books that are similar to it and for beginners there is um and a step higher is the book balur and what is bolo ham is a book that is compiled and written in accordance to the chapters of like any book so instead of putting the opinion of people the schools of thought that is a hanafi school maliki school shaffer school or hambili school ibn hajjar brought the evidences that the majority of these scholars used to back up their verdicts and he only puts the hadith of the prophet sallallahu alaihi so he started with the book of purity book of tahara then he moved on to salat and then to zakat fasting hajj all the things that are related to the forms of worship then he moved into transactions etc so this is what or how al-hazr may allah organized his book and this book is so highly reputed and accepted among the muslims that it is almost taught in all muslim universities all islamic universities it is something that has to be taught and studied thoroughly and most of the imams do explain it and go through it in the masjid because it relates people to the main sources quran sunnah i could spend the whole day talking about different of opinion among this school of thought and that but we could and we could argue on this for times and times without end however when there is a dispute among us and someone says yes but the prophet said that islam this and that this is it this draws the line because whenever the evidence comes from the quran or from the sunnah of the prophet sallam this makes the argument over and that is why a lot of the the students of knowledge would memorize by heart the book of um and if they have the ability they would memorize by heart the book of bulu al-maram as it takes them to a whole new level of knowledge because they have the evidence they have the sources in their hands and they can coat and they can stem the verdicts straight from these beautiful and authentic sources so the format of this program would be insha allah that we will try to take the first half of this hour to talk about one or two or maybe more of the hadiths that is in the chapter of fasting from the book below and the second half would be uh to answer your queries and questions and there will be inshallah the phone lines displayed at the bottom of the screen as usual um i'll try my little best to answer your questions but no promises what i have knowledge and i will try to answer that with the grace of allah azza in saudi arabia and so many muslim countries today is the first day of ramadan so i pray to allah the almighty that he makes this a blessed month for all of the muslims worldwide and that he gives us the energy and courage to fast pray recite the quran give charity or and offer as many good deeds as possible so that we could get closer to him and that we can attain his uh pleasure and to attain his paradise i mean chapter of fasting what is the meaning of fasting and which fasting are we referring to first of all fasting or a soul in arabic means to refrain so you can fast from speaking if you take a vow not to speak as found in the quran with prophets of allah azzawajal and with maryam etc peace be upon them all it also can be to refrain from eating drinking or anything that you stop yourself from this is considered to be fasting linguistically when you come to the technical definition it's a different thing because the explanation the definition of fasting is to worship allah through refraining from the nullifiers of fasting from dusk till sunset from the brink of dawn till the sun sets this is a definition of fasting so what is the significance of saying that to worship allah by refraining why wouldn't say to refrain from eating and drinking that that is it well if you refrain from drinking and eating this is not fasting this can be dieting this can be trying to reduce your weight this can be you have problems with food and drink and doctors tell you not to eat and drink for a particular period of time but to fast for the sake of allah azza it has to be with the intention of worshiping allah azza and all types of worship they have to have this particular phrase to indicate that there are forms of worship when you define them so prayers one say it is specific acts and words to be said done in a special format that is uh inaugurated or it begins with tabir and ends with salaam this is not prayer this is not salah you have to say worshiping allah azza with and then continue this definition of yours fasting is to refrain and to worship allah azza through refraining from these things that we will come to talk about insha allah later on the program now what kind of fasting are you referring to there are three types of fasting or actually there are two types of fasting mandatory fasting and voluntary fasting so are we referring to voluntary fasting when we talk about pillars of islam the answer is no in islam we have five pillars and the fourth pillar is fasting the month of ramadan so how many months do we fast per year only one month and this month is the ninth month in the islamic calendar we fast it by worshiping allah azza through refraining from the things that nullify fasting from the break of dawn till sunset how long would that be it depends on the region it depends on the season so if it were to coincide with winter daytime would be very short like eight hours ten hours in some places maybe less but it but if it coincides with summer time it can reach up to 21 or 22 hours and this is a lot however allah does not mandate something except that the people are capable of bearing and of tolerating and performing so allah does not burden us all be beyond what it can bear and this is a well-known fact so fasting ramadan is the fourth pillar of islam and it is a pillar meaning that if you take one of the pillars of the house the house would collapse it is so important that it is one of the pillars of islam the voluntary days are not mandated upon you it's not obligatory upon you to do it and we will come to show you inshallah later on the days to come the kinds and types of fasting so fasting is to fast the month of ramadan what is the wisdom of fasting allah azza is so rich so powerful allah azza owns everything that we see and everything that we do not see allah is the creator of the heaven and the earth allah alone is the possessor of everything subhanahu and those who are uh thinking otherwise should think twice there was allah and nothing was there in the whole universe nothing existed except allah it was he who created the throne it was he who created the heavens and the earth it was he who created the jinn the angels the humans subhana so what is it that he the almighty obligates upon us to fast and to uh uh put ourselves in hunger and thirst and to refrain from enjoying what is lawfully ours why why is that first of all allah azzawajal questions others and no one questions him so you have no right in questioning allah azzawajal nevertheless you may ask for the wisdom if it is a possibility because not everything we have is justified to us not everything we know the wisdom is given to us so we may ask what is the wisdom and we may find it and we may not so for example when allah azza tells us that intoxicants are prohibited for a muslim this is logical any atheist will understand why any non-muslim would quite agree because when you're drunk you do things that you regret and sometimes you don't even get the chance to regret because it's too late so it is something for your own good so we know the wisdom but when it comes to men not wearing gold and women it's permissible for them to wear and use gold so what's the wisdom is it the price because gold is expensive i can it's permissible for me as a man to wear a diamond ring which is much more expensive than gold so what is it this is something that allah azza knows why and this is part of the essence of our creation allah says i have not created the jinn and the humans accept that they would worship me so this is the soul idea of our creation that allah azza wants to favor us to bless us he gives us a chance to exist out of nothing he created us out of nothing and he gave us the chance to choose whether to be in paradise for eternity or to go to hell for eternity so allah almighty is so kind and generous that he created us to worship him and part of worshipping him is to obey him so allah azzawajal ordered us to do things and we have to prove whether we are worthy of his mercy and forgiveness when we comply and do or we are arrogant and ignorant and the best adobe for us would be hellfire and part of the wisdom beyond or behind obligating fasting among the muslims is the fact that allah azza is testing us how is allah is testing us see everything else you do people usually can judge you so if you pray people see you pray if you go to hajj to pilgrims people see you going to the pilgrimage if you give zakat the poor are receiving money and you are getting money out of your bank account so everybody can see that when you fast is nothing it is not something you do it is something you do not do and that is you refrain and it is one of the greatest forms of worship that expresses your sincerity to allah and your full obedience and observance that allah is absorbed is observing you how is that when i'm in the toilet performing wudu the first thing i do is to turn the water in my mouth it's hot humid i'm thirsty what is the thing that causes me to spit out the water that i was just turning in my mouth it is the fear of allah azza when a woman is cooking in her kitchen and she takes a taste without swallowing it of course to find whether the salt is okay or not who's watching if she takes a whole morsel and takes few bites here or there no one knows but she knows that allah is watching over her and likewise this child who can take candy and eat under the bed or in the cupboard or whatever but he doesn't because he knows and acknowledges that allah azza is watching him so one of the greatest reasons behind or wisdoms behind fasting of ramadan is the fact that you acknowledge allah is watching you and this is a test from allah azza why was it called ramadan beautiful name short quick easy to remember why was it called ramadan there are a number of linguistic interpretations and the most famous one is because when they gave the names to the 12 months of the year ramadan happened to be in summer and it originates from the heat of the stones and the rocks and and and the floor so they called it uh ramadan and fasting ramadan is one of the things that admits you to paradise fasting in general is something that is rewardable the prophet said allah fasts one day in the cause of allah for the sake of allah feasibility allah would further his face from hell fire the distance of 70 years how far would a traveler travel in 70 years allah would further and depart your face away from hellfire this far and this is if you fast one day for the cause of allah scholars say that this is a day that is voluntary so you do the math what would allah do for you if you fast for his sake and anticipating for the reward a whole month for the sake of allah which is obligatory and mandatory definitely it has a great reward allah has put a gate in paradise and called it yan so we have eight gates for paradise seven for hell may allah israel protect me and you from hellfire the gate that one of the gates the big huge gates that is a distance of maybe 40 years between them when the the gates doors are open it is called a rayan and this is only for those who fast so imagine you being called from this day from that gate with the grace of allah as wajal so this beautiful month of ramadan has lots of virtues and fasting in general has lots of virtues and the more we learn about it the easier it gets so now if someone is watching us in birmingham or in finland as one of the brothers called me from finland a few days ago saying that they fast like 21 hours and it is difficult i'm not saying that i fast here in saudi arabia for 16 17 hours and some of us may find it difficult alhamdulillah with the grace of allah but some may find that difficult so what about if it's 21 hours this means that they have only three hours to break their fast have their sahur pray that this is too little however this is what allah has decreed upon them and once they know the reward behind it and once they recognize how much allah azza has given them they will find with the grace of allah the virtues and they will find it easy for them to anticipate insha allah so now we take the first hadith in the chapter that deals with psalm from our book the first hadith is the hadith of abu huraira may allah be pleased with him he said that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said none of you should fast a day or two before the beginning of the month of ramadan unless it is a day on which one is in the habit of fasting that is voluntary fasting that coincides with that day and this hadith was agreed upon now this hadith is quite direct but there are so many benefits and lessons that we can learn from it for example if you analyze this hadith the prophet says none of you should fast a day or two before the beginning of the month of ramadan this means that if i wanted to fast the 28th of shaaban or the 29th of the prophet islam is telling me do not do that now is this prohibiting me to do it or it is not recommended what's the difference see the verdicts in terms of halal and haram recommended not recommended are five so whatever form of worship you want to do or whatever thing you have to do you have to apply these five rulings on them it's either mandatory obligatory fart this is the highest you have to do it if you do it you're rewarded if you don't do it you're sinful and you'll be punished so this is number one mandatory obligatory effort and number five is prohibited sinful forbidden if you do it you're sinful you'll be punished if you refrain from it you'll be rewarded so it's opposite to each other then number three is what is recommended sunnah if you do it you're rewarded if you do not do it you're not sinful and this has many forms and many uh uh um examples such as when i pray sunnah after lord prayer i prayed for lord then i pray two raka's these two are sunnah recommended so if i do them i'm rewarded for that but if i don't do them i'm not sinful but i've lost the reward number four which is the second from the bottom which is the opposite to recommended which is not recommended not preferred which is makru and macro is something that if you do not do it allah would reward you but if you do it if you fall in doing it then you're not sinful so if i enter the masjid with my left foot now this is something against the sunnah it's not recommended but i'm not sinful yet if i enter the masjid with my right foot anticipating the reward then this is something i will be rewarded for and number five which is in the middle and this is permissible so if i hold the pen and write this is permissible if i don't want to write this is permissible it's up to me whatever i do so these are the five categories that usually any form of worship you or a thing you do you can classify them as such so when the prophet says says none of you should fast a day or two now this is an order from the prophet allah not to do so when he tells us such an order is this a prohibition or not recommended originally speaking whenever the prophet tells us hassam don't do this it is prohibited and when he tells us do this it is mandatory unless there is another evidence that would reduce the prohibition into not recommended or reduces the instruction or order into being recommended so for example the prophet told us not to drink while standing up so this is a prohibition but it was reported that he sallal assalam drank zamzam standing up so this shows us that it was not prohibited it is not recommended and there are so many examples this is not the right time to go through it in detail so when we go to this hadith the prophet says do not he says none of you should fast a day or two before the beginning of the month of ramadan so we take this as it is for its face value and we say that yes we should not fast a day or two before the month of ramadan and there is an exception and the exception is the prophet says unless it is a day on which one is in the habit of fasting okay so the arabic text says except if a man is in the habit of fasting but a man here does not mean mean male it means both males and females so it's not only directed to men so this means that if you are in the habit of fasting voluntary fasts like thursdays and mondays like the fasting of the wood every alternate day or if you for example are used to fasting three days of every month and on the month of shabban you did not have the chance to fast them except in the last three days of shabbat in this case the prophet tells you allah that you are okay you are given the permission to fast these voluntary days and why is that there is a lot of talk about it and it's connected with the second hadith that i believe that we would not have time for uh in today's program therefore i will postpone talking about the remaining of this hadith and the following hadith till we meet tomorrow we have a short break and after the break with the grace of allah azzawajal we will begin to answer your calls if there's anyone watching and has on his mind so stay tuned and inshaallah will be right back assalamu alaikum and welcome back um you will find inshallah the phone numbers displayed at the bottom of the screen give us a call if you have any questions and by inshallah the time we get uh callers selma has a question she says i would like to know how i can draw a person in an islamic manner i think that selma is referring to the issue of drawing so if she wants to draw a portrait of a human being is this possible or not well the prophet alaihis salatu wasallam said that the most severely punished on the day of judgment are those who mimic the creation of allah azza by drawing so this is something that is not permissible in islam it's one of the major sins a man came to abdullah basma will be pleased with a man with his father and he said that i am a person that works this is my earning this is my living in drawing pictures and making portraits so he told him this hadith and that this is uh totally prohibited so the man insisted on it told him may allah be pleased with him if you must in this case you have to remove the head so that the body has only a body without any head so this is the only islamic way of drawing something in islam that is permissible that you draw an animal or a bird without having a head because without a head it is not something that is alive we have um from judea it was compulsory so it was left one but i was not knowing about this hadith just now you explain the hadith so is it okay for me i i want to know about that okay for uh bringing it up i did not elaborate a lot because the time slot was over the issue is that whenever you have obligatory fast to make up you have all the right to make it up even at the very last day of shabbat this hadith the prophet is highlighting is not including mandatory fast so women who are making up for missed fast they can fast it on the 29th of shabbat or on the 30th of shabbat there's no problem in that because this is far greater than fasting mondays and thursdays or fasting voluntary days we have murray from nigeria what can i do for you uh my question is i have a true question yes my question i have a two question the first question is that if someone used to false every monday and thursday and then and also the person is always traveling always traveling to different places so many countries can he continue doing his first thing if he can't or uh it's not good for him to to do the first thing during his journey okay second question and then the second question what can someone do to become very what can someone do to become very close to allah especially in month of ramadan or even after ramadan okay i will answer your question inshaallah we have samir from uh south sudan of course i heard that if you have a journey you can you can choose fasting and you can continue the day after ramadan but i want to right now also in the journey so how can you share tell me something about it murray from nigeria he says that he's used to fasting mondays and thursdays and he travels so it is also similar to our brother samir from southern uh sudan the ruling on fasting while traveling first of all the prophet allahu salam alayhi said a very beautiful hadith that gives a lot of hope to all of us he says portraying allah's kindness and mercy he says whenever a servant of allah azza is sick or traveling allah the almighty would record to him whatever he used to do while being healthy or residing so if you travel and you're used to fasting mondays and thursdays and you don't because you're traveling it's hard for you and you don't fast mondays and thursdays allah azza will give you the reward though you're not fasting though you're eating and having fun no problem and likewise if you fall sick you feel angry you want to fast but you are unable to do this allah would reward you for that so for you uh murray you have no problem and for you samir if it is not dangerous for you if it is not hard on you to fast and you can fast without any hardship there is no problem for you but if there is hardship or if there is danger on you or those who are with you it is a must for you to break your fast we have uh iman from from algeria i hope you have a good ramr uh i didn't hear you but i inshallah you said happy ramadan and ramadan to you as well yes i have two questions okay my husband and i moved to a new region in in algeria and when we went to prison we last night after they played four records they started to make test beats together they were saying subhanallah he will be humbly he was stuck for a lot all together in a group and then they continued to they said it three times and then they continued to pray tarawih and now we were wondering if that's okay or if that's bigger and maybe we should change the mark okay and my second question is that i am um come to that i'm pregnant and i'm deep in my pregnancy and until i'm trying to fast but i was i read a lot of different uh rulings about whether to uh just pay back the fest or pay back the best and give cydia and i was hoping you can answer that for me i will inshaallah inshallah uh um please okay okay um okay i'm missing you okay um to you and keep me in your door i will inshaallah i will choose i want to ask you when we read tarawih prayer what surah fatiha is recommended to repeat after that and the other surahs they are reading when they praise allah or do something do the people sometimes people say subhanallah sometimes they say i mean what should we say or just listen quietly and when the answers you they are longer what should what is the best thing to say at that time okay okay i will i've just read it i read about it today and i want to know what is the significance of that and authenticity and and the timing for salat what should be the appropriate timing for uh saratov and uh one more question about the sunanbrata or we call it the sunnah that are obligate like wajib or the same they fall in the same category okay i will answer your question okay i think we take like uh five minutes before we take the following uh caller and answer the remaining questions mary from nigeria he says what's the best way to get closer to allah this is all what islam is about how to get closer to allah and stay as far as possible from hell fire and this needs a lifetime it needs a whole lecture to to talk about but to sum it up and in a nutshell the best way to get closer to allah azza is to stay away from haram totally major minor big small whatever you stay away from haram the prophet says refrain and stay away from what is prohibited and you will become the most the most person to offer good deeds and the most the biggest or the best worshiper of allah so do refrain and stay away from haram and do what allah commanded you to do because nothing would get you closer to allah and nothing is more beloved to allah than the things that he mandated upon you so the minute you do this you are you are in good hands insha allah a man from algiers he had two questions she noticed that the people in algiers after every four rakah they'd say subhanallah or subhanallah or whatever in syria i prayed there and they say uh different things all of these are innovations it is easy for you to say that something is innovation because if the person doing this innovation fails to provide me with evidence that the prophet used to do it ali or his companions used to do it to do this then this is an innovation simple as that if i say that when i pray i like to put my hand on my forehead i say allahu akbar what is this i said listen putting it on the chest is um i'd like to put it on my forehead because this shows i have great iman in my heart blah blah blah this is an innovation he said why do you say innovation your wahhabis everything is innovation innovation did the prophet do it he said um maybe he said if he failed to give me the evidence then he did not do it then this is an innovation so after taraweeh after four raka's after two raka's offering salutations to the prophet offering the kirtas be whatever did the prophet do it yes or no the answer is no then it's an innovation regardless of the country that is doing it now she says that she's pregnant and she wants to know what is the most authentic opinion does she fast does she skip fasting and pay fidia expiation or does she does does not uh she doesn't pay fidya but she make up makes up for it does she combine both making up amphibian the most authentic opinion is that you skip fasting you dodge fasting when you're pregnant or you're breastfeeding until you're able to make up then you have to make up for all these missed days without any financial expiration no feeding nothing just a day for a day we have amer from saudi arabia actually i i live overseas okay and then i have i'm facing a problem with giving my sadaqa after every juma i can see people like non-muslims they they're in need okay what kind of sadaqah are you referring to the thing like i don't know if i'm allowed to give them this sadaka or not usually i don't give so i try to find muslims good i will answer your question any more questions we have uh sabrina from algiers yes yes sabrina uh yes yes i'm listening to you uh yes i have a question about my mother is a canadian okay okay she was christian she was christian before she married my father and then she became a muslim okay and well she had five children including me of course after two years ago she uh filed for divorce and uh my terrorist report she came back to canada because we were living here in algeria before that and now she became a christian she came he became a christian again okay so she's not a muslim anymore she said that the the main question is my father is asking us her children to stop talking to her and um because it's haram and i don't know so i'm kind of confused there when it comes about your mother you know it's not easy to do that and i don't know if it's haram or not okay i will answer your question inshallah we have um aisha from nigeria yes i love you for the sake of allah my husband has fertility problems he he cannot give but unless we do that but we have a child he's like 13 years old so when i'll tell him let's do it he'll say no he's not ready for it to not be extract if i wait patiently am i going to be rewarded from allah or i should ask for divorce i didn't get your first question aisha your husband you're unable to have children from him yes he's his health problem he's what in the faculty okay okay okay so the doctor said we should go from we should do practitioner baby but he refused so if i stay with him will i be rewarded with allah from allah if i stay patiently and my second question is yes did you get the first one yes yes i i got you second question okay okay the second question is i promised yes i'm with you i'm listening okay i hope i shall send you her a second question again aisha from saudi hello yes i invite you as well correct or not okay and my second question is i when we recite if we don't follow the mud rules we will it will be sinful or not if you do not recite what mud rules uh not elongate the mother correctly four and three and six and tajweed you mean should we blow on our hand and wipe wiping on our bodies is correct or not okay thank you you're welcome okay we will um okay we have amina from kenya i think and this is the last question so that i can answer this before the end of the program amina my question is can i follow the tv baby when i'm praying at home alone in there can i follow him to follow who you want to follow who okay uh maybe i'll try my level best okay now we will not have any questions and try to answer what we have uh from zero to 60 in less than five seconds inshallah um she says that the ruling on taraweeh when people are reciting taraweeh and she sees them reciting the fatih surah but then the dua she is referring to du al-qurt when the imam says allah and people say i mean and sometimes they say subhanak sometimes she's asking what is this all of these are baseless you either say i mean or you just refrain from uh mentioning anything so when the imam is asking allah allah mahdinafi that guide us among those who guide you say i mean but when he praises he's praising allah you don't say anything as simple as that some people think that it is okay to say etc but this is a basis to my knowledge and she says sometimes they prolong the sujud and record what to say in it well very easy you praise allah azza by saying this and the description of the prophet's prayer salallahu the same thing you have lots of duas that you can say invoking allah subhana rabbil and you can ask whatever you want from this world and in the hereafter so you say oh allah forgive me oh allah pay my debts oh allah cure my illness or allah guide my wife to be realistic or guide my spouse to be generous etc whatever so all of this is uh possible for you and you should not stay silent umina says what's the ruling on salah it's an issue of dispute among scholars some scholars authenticate the hadith and the majority say that this is not authentic such as etc they all say that this is a fabricated hadith because only allah reported it and no one else ever done this specific ritual and it's strange and it's not like other prayers therefore it is not true what is the time for duha prayer from sunrise about 10 to 15 minutes from sunrise now it's about six o'clock two minutes to six o'clock in judah time up till five to actually uh up till ten minutes before the adhd this is the time for doha prayer you can pray within whatever you want she is asking about the sunanna rawati and she said that the sunnah prayers that are obligatory and this is not correct it is sunnah because it is voluntary but it is highly recommended because the prophet as islam did not leave them except when he traveled and there are 12 raka's in the hadith the prophet said assam whoever observes these 12 rakaas in the day and night allah would build him a mansion a castle a house a big a house in jannah and these 12 raka's are two raka's before fajr four raka's before so once again two before fajr four before the two after the maghrib and russia these are 12 rakahs i'm from saudi arabia he's saying that he studies overseas and he gives charity whenever he can but sometimes it's difficult if not impossible to find muslims so it is is it okay to give a non-muslim charity that says yes any person who's in need general charity you can give it to them but be careful not to give it to some of the homeless who would go and probably buy a bottle of scotch you don't want to do this so try your level best to help those uh who are in need whether muslims are non-muslims of course the pray our priority is to help our brothers and sisters who are muslims but if there aren't anyone in need then yes you can give it to the disbeliever sabrina says her mom committed the act of apostasy i pray to allah azza in this blessed month of ramadan that he gets her back to the circle of islam and he gets her sanity back to her head after tasting islam and then just wasting all of this for materialistic things the question is her father tells her that she and her siblings must bycot their mother not to talk to her not to speak to her and some scholars do say this but my personal opinion is that you shouldn't as long as she is not abusive against islam she is not attacking islam and she simply just changed her religion this is an act of apostasy she's in hell forever she does like this by you communicating with her trying to bring him back to the circle of islam to the fold of islam trying to give her to change her mind about what is happening maybe allah azza would bring her back you never know but try to please your father and not disconnect with your mother meaning that don't go and face your father head on telling him no i'm going to do this i'm going to do that be diplomatic with your father try to call her yani behind his back and inshallah may allah azza will return her back to the fold of islam ayesha from nigeria she says her husband does not um conceive well actually he's not the one who conceives but yeah he's either has a a problem with uh fertility and and she wanted to opt for baby tubes and he refuses the ivf so she says what should i do if i am patient with him am i going to be rewarded i says definitely yes you are going to be rewarded but sometimes a woman reaches a stage where she says i can't go on i want to have offshore mega of my own and if there is a possibility and he's not even trying in this case if she goes for divorce this is her right and she can do that without any problem aisha from saudi arabia she had three questions maybe yes the first one what is the ruling on a person who performed or assumed haram but not from the mikka lots of people come from riyadh from the mam from india from egypt from uk from whatever and they land in jeddah airport without wearing the haram they go to makkah and then they go to masjid aisha or to the tennaim and they assume their haram from there this is wrong they should have assumed haram from the mercat while they were on the plane so they have two options either they go back to the mikhat and assume their from there or assume their haram from masjid ash or whatever but they have to slaughter a sheep as an expiation so this is wrong the umrah is intact amra is correct but this person has to pay expiation by slaughtering a sheep and distributing the meat to the poor people of haram she's asking about tajweed so there are certain uh vowels that are extended and prolonged so like for example this is correct and his recitation is correct and there's no sin on him none whatsoever she says that there are some dua do we blow and wipe our bodies with no the answer is you do not do this as it not it was not reported last question amina says that praying tarawih behind someone i did not hear who that someone was so i would assume that she she is praying taraweeh behind the tv screen where it's being broadcasted live is this possible the answer is no you have to be in the congregation so if you have your child your son or your husband leading the prayer and you're praying with him in the same room this is okay if you have an adjacent message and they're praying congregation you want to pray with them in your room this is not permissible because you're not with them in the masjid this is all the time we have until we meet you an hour from now next tomorrow inshallah i leave you wassalam while watching the new moon it felt like a good enlightening this day is all right as the first thought always the night with family around the nice meal we're making one i feel how nice it is to be so neat to those i love whenever we think of ramadan all the good things that we need to do and plan it's not always easy but we'll do the best we can"
