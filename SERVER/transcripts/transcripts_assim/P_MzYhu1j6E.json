  "title": "Religion vs Culture: where does Islam fit in? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "a serious topic and you need a lot of time and a series of lectures to expand upon it however it is essential in our belief as muslims you see islam is a holistic religion unlike what some people may think that islam is only rituals that we perform or mystics that we feel or growing a beard or a sister wearing a hijab these are all parts of islam but islam is a holistic system that covers every aspect of our lives whether small or big allah says in the quran what translates to say indeed my prayer my rights of sacrifice my living and my dying are for allah lord of the lords lord of the worlds lords of everything what does that mean it means that it's not only your prayer that counts in islam it means that your life your death everything related to it is included in this holistic religion and islam other than other religions different to other religions it gives a believer honor and dignity it makes a muslim youth among all denominations because an essential part of our religion is to go different and against other religions allah says in the quran what we recite every single day not less than 19 times guide us to the straight path the path of those upon whom you have bestowed favor not of those who have earned your anger or of those who are astray so we ask allah to guide us but to make us far apart from those who gain allah's anger or those who went astray that is why if you find a muslim in america or in europe or in the far east or in arabia or even in siberia you will identify him as a muslim you will tell that he's a muslim because his identity comes straight from his conviction it comes straight from being a servant of allah something that he is proud of announcing he's not ashamed of being a muslim he's always happy to proclaim i am a muslim and i'm happy to be muslim this is why he can't be identified anywhere he goes to always abiding by sharia never evading it or diverting away from it now when we come to customs and traditions when the prophet is the message of islam he did not come to eradicate everything he did not come to rebel and change everything that people were used to he himself said i was sent to perfect to complete the best of moral conduct what does perfect and complete mean it means that whatever was suitable with the sharia we can keep and whatever was not compliant with sharia sharia came to overrule and change this is why example the prophet said said about the pre-islamic era he said i witnessed a treaty in the house of abdullah and this treaty was so honorable if i were to be called to a similar one in islam i would have responded and answered the arabs in quraish they wrote a treaty where they would honor and avenge anyone who was oppressed and they would give the rights back to those who were wronged so the prophet isaiah when he was given the message he did not come and canceled this treaty because it had good things in it that was accepted by the muslims oh by islam and islam came to find the arabs having a number of good ethics and conduct such as bravery courage generosity good being good to your neighbors honesty and fulfilling your promises and keeping them so islam preserved such good things and gave it a step higher by awarding those among the muslims who abide by such noble characteristics and a well-known fact when islam comes when islam is introduced to societies it is not confrontational islam doesn't come to create a revolution islam comes to fix what needs to be fixed but it is based on sovereignty because islam rules and nothing rules it islam is superior and it prevails and nothing can prevail it and this is why if you read quran which is something we rarely do you will find that the quran criticized a certain people blamed them and showed us their wrong doing when they decided to follow their customs and traditions against islam allah says and similarly we did not send before you o muhammad any warner into a city except that it's affluent said indeed we found our fathers upon a religion and we are in their footsteps following so why did you reject the message of prophet muhammad ali because our forefathers followed a particular religion a particular custom a particular tradition and we're not willing to abandon our heritage this is something that sam doesn't accept unless it goes with islam that prevails over all may allah be pleased with him this man was the nephew of khadijah been traded so the prophet was married to his aunt he was old and it is said that he lived 120 years 60 in jahiliyyah pre-islamic era and 60 years islam he came to the prophet and said oh prophet of allah there were things that i used to try to get close to allah by at my pre-islamic times so i used to set slaves free i used to feed the poor i used to um connect to my kinship and try to help them so do i get any reward for all of that the prophet sallallahu alaihi salaam you have accepted islam and all goodness that you've committed in the past is valid what does that tell you it tells you that islam does not come to cancel everything whatever good you had before accepting islam is going to be there for you you're going to be rewarded for it hakim hazam said that in the pre-islam era i set a hundred slaves free for allah and i had a hundred camel with their load on it for the cause of allah and i did the same in islam he did this also after he became muslim setting a hundred slaves free which is a fortune only billionaires can do that and to load on camel's back food and merchandise and the likes fully loaded and then set it for the cause of allah to the poor and to the needy now when societies are introduced with islam we find that islam comes to channel their needs control them and to observe them so islam comes to control things under the umbrella of being slaves of allah and this as stated earlier governs all aspects of life so when we want to compare customs and traditions on in the light of islam this topic is so huge and vast that we can't do that in a lecture and i will show you few examples and you can relate to that and this is only the tip of an iceberg only this you could see but underneath the water there is a mountain where islam came it related to people's needs so it did not come to stop and prevent all types of celebrations as it did not open the door for all types of uh um celebrations to be allowed so it's not partying all night long and at the same time it's not a monastery that you just go there and worship allah in the sahih the prophet when he came first to medina he found the people of medina celebrating two days so he asked what these two days that you guys are celebrating so the muslims said these are two days of our traditions and our customs our forefathers used to celebrate and we are continuing this habit and this custom of celebrating them the prophet said allah has substituted you with better than these two days so islam came to stop all types of celebrations all type of festivals so there's no diwali there's no nairoos there is no christmas there is no new years there is no valentine there is no mother's day there is no birthdays there is no mawlid of the prophet there is no celebration of the middle of sha ban there is no celebration of the miraculous night journey all of these are not part of islam yet it is deeply rooted in some societies and communities so what you what are you going to do follow sharia or follow your whims and desires this is a dividing line and islam when it was introduced to the people of quraish in mecca the prophet alison did not tell the companions to change their wardrobe he did not tell them okay now we have to change everything we wear we have to be unique when we walk in the markets so that whenever someone sees us would say oh they are muslims no this has nothing to do with that everybody was normal wearing their same clothes the same turbans riding the same mules or the same horses or the same camels everything was normal they were arabs living among the arabs but islam came with guidelines to the things you make where so these guidelines are so many that we would require a number of lectures to talk about for example islam said to us that when we wear clothes it must not be see-through because then if you can see the skin underneath you can see my aura that i'm not wearing clothes what's the use of that it should not be tight exposing a person's hour especially for women and you can tell and see that happening in things in parties nowadays women wear miniskirts some wear shorts somewhere see-through that you can see the underwear underneath and they say it's okay because we are among women this is not okay islam came to protect women and to protect the one who's wearing such indecent clothes and to protect those who are watching so these are prohibited in islam you can wear everything but unfortunately when you follow your whims and desires and not sharia you only see these few haram clothes and refuse to wear things among the guidelines you must not imitate disbelievers in what you wear specifically generally speaking you might not you must not imitate the disbelievers and everything that being said most of those who are interested interested in argument not in learning this oh why you're wearing a watch you're you're meeting the disbelievers i hope they don't make a meme out of that i'm wearing a watch and so is two in muslims so wearing a watch is not part of the disbelievers but if i were to wear something that only the disbelievers wear nowadays most disbelievers wear a bracelet and lots of the youngsters men unfortunately wear bracelets wear the necklaces this is not permissible because this is a feature of women and it is a feature of the disbelievers some of them wear threads and bracelets and tags designers things and all of this is what imitating the disbelievers if a woman wears a dress that is only worn by the disbelievers and she goes out wearing a saree for example exposing her belly and back muslims don't wear this this is something for the disbelievers they never go out wearing this and so on so by the if a muslim puts a red dot here no muslim does this so imitating the disbelievers is totally prohibited in what is known to be for the disbelievers only um among the guidelines it should not be a dress that draws attention and makes people point fingers at you so imagine if i come to uh the lecture with a thobe which is pink no arab would do that and why are you doing this well it's a new trend i just wanted to be famous recognized no islam says don't draw attention in such a fashion because this is an illness in the heart it shows that your heart has a problem and this is why you want to draw attention to yourself you must not as a man wear silk or gold oh why is islam so restricted everything is haram who said it's everything sarah islam tells you don't wear silk wear any other material on earth whether it is polyester whether it's cotton whether it's wool whether it plastics whatever petrochemicals who cares pure silk is haram for men full stop what about gold chair i love to wear a gold watch wear plutonium wear diamond wear anything you want but not gold also your dress should not exceed as a man your ankles this is a major sin why it's not a business you're a servant of allah you are a servant not a master your master tells you do something you say now you start to question why book your seat with satan in hell fire because allah told him prostrate he said nope no can do why he said i'm better than him you use your logic with sharia you end up in hellfire it's your choice three easy very convenient we are servants we do what we are told islam doesn't tell you to do this particular thing so how to wear my hair sure if you don't have a hair well beside the point but if i were to have a how to wear my hair you can wear it as you wish what's the length whatever is appropriate in the community so if we are in a tribe or in a city that all men prolong their hair and braid it there is no problem in doing that for men but if i am the only one who is unfortunately growing my hair long and i wear tight jeans and i sometimes wear in a ponytail or a mule tail if you want what is it i've seen brothers doing this some of them are wearing this thing that holds the head back like women do i don't know what they call it a ribbon or whatever i see what are you doing oh sure prolonging the hair this is the only sunnah you figured out and is it a sunnah in the religion or sunnah of the community of the traditions and customs islam tells you not to shave your head as hazar so shaving the head and like mr t this is totally prohibited in islam shaving the sides and keeping the top like the marines totally prohibited in islam you must not imitate the haircuts of the disbelievers some of them make a globe or a football or a designer or something that is we all of this is haram in islam you have an identity allah ordered you and the prophet ordered you alice islam to honor the hair to fix it to put oil on it to make calm to make it representable but not to imitate the disbelievers and this draws us to a lot of the things that the people do out of customs and traditions which are major sense plucking the eyebrows or shaving it or cutting it nowadays trendy is microblading which a lot of women do without asking not knowing that this they are cursed for removing the hair for microblading which is a form of tattooing when you start to slash and draw and get the blood and put something inside all of this hara but picture it's the customs when you start to apply tattoos oh any skin that has no internet is ugly subhanallah those who make tattoos are cursed lots of the youngsters now fall under peer pressure and they have a tattoo here or a tattoo or a tattoo at the back of the neck or on their chest or breasts or a trump stamp what is this everybody's doing customs and traditions this draws you to be cursed sharia comes to prevail and this is what a proper muslim does well i'm interested in getting a tattoo let me go to the tattoo parlor no no no as a muslim i have to research what's your ruling on tattooing it's a major sin your curse for that no tattoos this is following while following your whims and desires you start to justify for yourself ah it's not a tattoo it's only for one year and then it fades away okay did you ask no i don't need to ask i know my religion you know you don't know even the difference between a hadith or an ayah if i quote you a hadith and i say which surah is this if i recite the hadith to you and i say which story is this um i don't memorize the quran you don't even know the difference between a hadith and i and you now you want to come and give fatwa many cultures have cusses and traditions that are pro on the part of islam for example in some country malaysia a beautiful country indonesia my father's country whenever i go to indonesia i've never visited i was invited um whenever i go to malaysia people come to me and say sometimes they shake my hands and they do this oh what are you doing you're not allowed to bow to a human being whether a king or a president or a ruler or a sheikh bowing is totally prohibited yeah but it's the customs share you if you go to nigeria or to some african countries they squat some of them they bow some african countries they prostrate they make sujud i've seen this with their kings subhanallah are you muslims oh this is customs and traditions we can't change those no you must it's not an issue of whether you can or not prophet said if i were to order a person to prostrate to someone i would have ordered a wife to prostrate to her husband and the prophet also indicated to us the danger of such customs and traditions what he said in in arabia for example if we are like five people sitting and someone comes in the tradition is that we all stand up to shake hands and greet him and if one of us or all of us did not he is offended not knowing that he is not following sharia the prophet says ali whoever loves people to stand up for him let him reserve his seat in hellfire whoa so what about standing up for the national anthem is totally prohibited you don't stand up except for allah nowadays whenever the muslim countries they play the national anthem actually the national anthem is haram it's music but everybody stands up and what are you doing what are you doing maybe next year you're going to do allah are you going to pray for the national anthem well sure everybody's doing it back in europe back in asia back in who cares these are kafirs so this shows you how deteriorating the level of commitment to islam in the hearts of the muslims nowadays now culture in our communities in our marriages marriage is something we all have to do not my age but we have marriages do we follow sharia or whims and desires definitely not sharia this is not islam when we have free mixing the whole nine yards when we have music women sometimes you find women in hijab but remixing with cousins and relatives in-laws laughing and sometimes you will find catastrophes what is this oh she's dancing with the bride or she's dancing with the groom he's not a mahram they dancing on music and she's hijabi what kind of hijab are you guys doing this hijab is a cultural thing it's not islamic she's not wearing it for the sake of allah but because everybody is doing so and this is our country our heritage if she was committed to hijab she would not communicate with non-mahrams let alone dance let alone touch let alone do these heinous things people have the tendency to change religion and substitute it with their customs and and traditions they have this tendency and if you were to object oh but this is haram what will your father say oh you want to change your traditions you must be this or you must need that and he starts to question your islam whether it's or not and the the measuring stick is not quran sunnah rather it is what people are doing this is the norm this is the islam we know put them aside they're not the true islam no there are so many customs and traditions that conflict with islam they're not acceptable at all when it comes to honor customs and traditions related to honor what kind of honor islam honors honor islam promotes honor but we come to find that a father orders his daughter to marry her cousin and if she refuses he kills her what are you doing she's tarnishing the reputation of the family she has no right to marry outside of our tribe but all of your tribe men are rubbish they're not real men they're guerrillas the barbarians they have nothing related to islam daughter is a negabi she is following the quran the sunnah without understanding of the salaf and you want to give her to this mushrik or this innovator of this ignorant you have no right to do that he said well this is my daughter either she obeys me or i kill her we have what is known in some countries as honor killing there's no honoring killing but whenever they doubt that their daughter spoke to a relative or to a neighbor or thought of getting married to someone from another country the only way to erase such shame is by killing her which means that those culprits would go to hellfire for their major sin and they have nothing to do with islam definitely they have nothing to honor customs and traditions that go against logic that goes against moral conduct that goes against our ethics some have no jealousy in some countries i wouldn't name them they have a sign they claim to be an honorable sign what is it in the wedding night the husband puts a white handkerchief and if it is stained with blood this is a sign of purity and honor and he comes out and he shows them as a flag wallahi this is a disgrace and a man who does this is not a man he's not fit to be called a man you expose your intimate things with your wife to the public so yeah julia just wanted to prove that she's a virgin and who told you that virgins believe they say in the first night this is diabetic never done by the companions of the prophet nor the tabbing nor the tabula what kind of a muslim are you and what kind of a disgrace you're bringing to the girl's family let alone your own family because your sister is going to go through this your daughter is going to go through this humiliation degrading of women williams and desires or sharia you're not following sharia you're not related to sharia so is the case with the traditions and the customs we have to slaughter 50 sheep and 10 camels and 5 cows for what for the wedding chair we have 50 people coming i'm gonna feed them all of this no but is the customs that we throw such parties and if we don't then the tribe will slander us and speak ill about us who cares about what the tribe says what does islam say um we don't know sure but we were not interested at the moment all of these shows you or all of these things show you how far we are from islam forcing a woman to marry against her will is totally prohibited in islam whether you're the father or the grandfather a woman came to the prophet isaiah and said my father married me against my will to his nephew so that he would protect his honor so he claims and not be shamed by me so the prophet says this is not permissible your marriage is void if you don't want it which means that he gave her the will either to cancel such an invalid marriage or to prove it so the woman said no i accepted the prophet of allah but i wanted you to clarify to the women that have a right to reject such marriages how many women are forced are blackmailed are pressured by their parents to marry someone they don't like and in the 90 of the cases i see it ends up in divorce but only after having two or three children so what did the family gain by that destroying the life of this girl having two or three kids being divorced in their house wouldn't it have been better to give her the freedom of choice and to marry someone she accepts rather than being forced in conclusion allah says in the quran and this is a beautiful verse that you and i must look through it and decide whether we are believers or not whether we are among those who are heading to jannah or those who are hypocrites heading to hellfire what does allah say but no by your lord allah is swearing why does allah swear in the quran he doesn't say anything except the truth this is to highlight the importance of what's coming afterwards but no by your lord they will not truly believe until they make you o muhammad judge concerning their over which they dispute among themselves and then find within themselves no discomfort from what you judged and submit in full willing submission the customs and traditions you have in your country in your community are they according to sharia or to the whims and desires if they according to the whims and desires what are you gonna do about it are you gonna continue to follow your whims and desires or you're gonna draw the line which is by the way the straight path that differentiates you that separates you from all others the path that leads you straight to jannah the path of the prophet al-islam and the companions and that of the tabernacle the path of the righteous guided ones what is it gonna be follow this sharia this beautiful religion or lower your head in shame and disgrace and follow customs and traditions that go against sharia this is what defines you as a muslim and allah azza knows best allah foreign"
