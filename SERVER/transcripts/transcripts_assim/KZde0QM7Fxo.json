  "title": "Demonstration of how loud Salam & Bismillah must be when entering house? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "could you please be kind and make a voice demonstration on what's the minimal voice loudness of saying bismillah and salaam when entering a house can it be whispering or does it have to be somewhat louder well you cannot hear this properly usually it has to be said loudly because if you're saying salaam to someone who's not in the house you're usually saying it to the angels so you say assalamu alaikum warahmatullah to yourself and to whomever is in the house and if you whisper it would it count if there were any of your relatives they would not have heard you and they would not reply to you so you would say it not in a shouting voice normal voice bismillah and you close the door so that the devils would not be able to enter and allah azzawajal knows best you"
