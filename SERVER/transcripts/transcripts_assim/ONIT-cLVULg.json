  "transcript": "Ibrahim from Nigeria. Sheikh, is it possible for a Muslim to ask for tomorrow's favor from Allah? I don't understand you. What do you mean by asking for tomorrow's favor from Allah? Like asking or praying for future provisions from Allah. Who can you ask it from then if you don't ask it from Allah? Yeah, I heard from a scholar that you only ask for what you need at a particular time. No, no, this is totally bogus and baseless. Akhi, we have only one Lord in this universe. We have no one else to ask. So I would ask Allah Azza Wa Jal for today's provision, for tomorrow's provision, for ten years provision, for whatever I want because He is my Lord. And He told me, ask me and I shall respond to you. Who restricts me from asking Allah Azza Wa Jal? What this scholar said to you is totally bogus. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days. And bi-idhnillah Azza Wa Jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
