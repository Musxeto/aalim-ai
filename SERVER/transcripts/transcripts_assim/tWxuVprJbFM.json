  "transcript": "my little child it's 10 11 months old often Crossing in front of me I try to stop him with my feet or let him play somewhere else but he keeps running in front of me what should I do is my brain wallet yes 100 your prayer is valid there is nothing wrong a child Crossing and playing in front of you does not interrupt your Salat if you can pray in a a place where if he would wear to play would go behind you that's good if you would do like the prophet used to do is approach the wall in front of you or the chair so that he would not be able to pass in front of you there's no problem with that and if you let the child go uh in front of you there's also no problem in that inshallah"
