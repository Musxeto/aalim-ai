  "transcript": "which happens in some cultures so instead of the father giving the ijab and the kubul saying i give you my daughter in marriage the groom says i accept her marriage this is called ijab and kubul proposal and acceptance instead of the the father doing this usually the imam does it so the imam cannot do it without the authorization of the father even if the father is present and the father is just watching the imam can't do this hijab and kabul with the groom without the father authorizing him so if the father says i authorize you imam to do the hijab or i authorize my father or i authorize my elder brother or i authorize any tom dick or harry to take my place in giving the hijab the proposal this is totally permissible and legit and there's no problem in that"
