  "title": "Is my prayer valid behind an imam who prays on an elevated Mimbar podium? saah",
  "transcript": "the imam prays on uh an elevated member the imam prays on a podium or a little bit elevated from the people the prayer is valid but it is makroo and some scholars say that it is haram yet there are uh evidences that the prophet saws led the prayer while offering it on the member and coming down to make sure and then climbing it up so that the people would see him and learn from him so i don't know what is the reason for this it is highly not recommended to be elevated from the other worshipers of the congregation but the prayer there is still valid inshallah"
