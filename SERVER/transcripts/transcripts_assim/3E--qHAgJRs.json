  "transcript": "[Music] thirdly if someone proposed to marry a muslim both are in a foreign country and her family approved it is it okay in islam to call or introduce her as a friend not as a fiance now this is a little bit overboard they're not allowed to communicate to begin with and they're not allowed to chit-chat or date or go for a coffee or to have a meal together just because her family approved their engagement he's a total nun to her and all the time they're spending in all the chit chats they're having these are sins compiling over them over their shoulders and they have to pay for it and by the way a lot of such engagements end in breaking up so yes he does talk to her family and they say yes we approve the engagement but the marriage did not take place they consider themselves fiances and they date they go out and sometimes they even have intercourse because she trusts that he is her man and after a year or two of engagement they break up because this is what they see in the west this is what's happening in america and europe celebrities getting engaged for a year or two to their fiance and they you see the rock if you like it put a ring around it so he gets engaged to her they live like man and wife after two years maybe she even conceives and gives birth to a kid or two they're not married yet and all of a sudden a change of heart a change of winds and they break up so the woman now is not even divorced but she was consumed and used and thrown like a bone to the dogs islam does not allow or permit this islam protects both the men and women if they want halal engagement they know the procedure and they have to get married and allah knows best"
