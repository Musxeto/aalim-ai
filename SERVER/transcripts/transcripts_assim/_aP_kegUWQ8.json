  "title": "Can we call ourselves Athari or Salafi? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "suhail from malaysia i have a question alhamdulillah allah has guided us to know that we follow quran and sunnah through the manhattan but now with these new divisions and with this new al-qaeda is it permissible for us to say that we are assertive or we are yeah so is it permissible to say this in case of uh of confusion between ashara and mathuridia and more in regards of calling yourself a name this is not part of the sunnah and sheikh means says that it is not permissible for someone to call himself salafi so he goes around people say i'm a salafi i'm a salafi no we are all part of a sunnah al-jamara simply to segregate ourselves from the people of innovation but if we were cornered what type of is that then we may say that we follow the akita of the salaf but we don't go proclaiming that we're salafi or we're atheri or we're this or that because this becomes part of labeling and like claiming that i am from this party rather than from the mainstream of islam so yes again you don't have to identify yourself uh more than i'm a muslim i'm from jamaica i follow the quran the sunnah with the understanding of the three favorite generations"
