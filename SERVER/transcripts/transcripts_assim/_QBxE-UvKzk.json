  "title": "Ocd about doubts in number of sujood, rakahs & mistakes in recitation - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "whether i said it or not the most of the prayers i pray i performs do the sub so how uh and also up on the number of such does i give so how can i be cured the issue of ocd is greatly dependent on you allah says in the quran the plotting of satan is weak so allah azza is telling us that allah is telling us in the end of surat ibrahim that when the people of hell fire may allah protect you and me from being among them when they come to satan and they complain and blame him for being in hell he says to them and he gives this in hellfire he says allah has promised you and fulfilled his promise while i promised you and failed you betrayed you i had no power over you except to call you and you responded so don't blame me rather blame yourselves i'm not going to help you and you're not going to help me all what he had over them is to call them and they responded the same thing happens to you oh brother with the ocd shaytan calls you now you have a choice of two either to draw the line and say enough is enough i'm not going to answer you whatever intrusive thoughts i'm getting i know after identifying that this is not an angel giving me good advice this is satan trying to corrupt my iman my prayer and my life so you draw the line and say i'm not gonna respond to you and move on you find compelling force telling you what if it's right you have to put your foot and say it's not right i know what he's doing he's my enemy he could never give me a sound advice and you have to stop this number two there is no prostration of sahu for any mistake you make in recitation so if you make a mistake in fatiha or in the surah you repeat that you correct that or not there is no sujo for that number three and finally if you every single salat doubt the number of raqqas you performed or the number of sajdas ask yourself this am i a muslim the answer is yes how long have been doing this meaning praying maybe 15 15 20 30 years allah knows depending on your age in this case this is all from shaytaan what to do ignore these doubts yes sheikh but i don't know whether i prayed three or four whether this is my first sujud or the second sujud aki act upon your gut feeling you will always have a gut feeling act upon it and move on and don't offer you the sahu and allah knows best see"
