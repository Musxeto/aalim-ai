  "title": "Hadith about where Najd is - The Horn Of Satan - Assim al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "can you please clarify about the heavies on nest so i can clarify it to my my my uncle because i know it's referring to um and i know it's referring to iraq and iran but they just won't listen okay now as for your um uh question about your uncle stating that where the horn of shaytan is and that this is the devil's homeland meaning that saudi arabia we've explained this so many times and i think you've seen my videos and my explanations over that and you can find it easy inshallah on the internet and it goes without dispute among the early scholars of islam so you go back to the early scholars of islam when there was no saudi arabia to prove to you that najd in the hadiths of the prophet of islam where all the calamities and tribulations and fitan came from would be iraq and iran till date so there's no way in comparing these two places with actual naj that we have which refers to the central area of saudi arabia and allah zojo knows best"
