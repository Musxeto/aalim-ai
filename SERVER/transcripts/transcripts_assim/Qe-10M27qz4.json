  "transcript": "[Music] about jannah he's going to try his maximum to do all the possible things to actually attain that goal right but if you tell the same thing to an adult who has grown up right so this this idea of jannah of course you want to get it but slowly but surely he he doesn't uh have that you know the joy in in uh i mean like it possibly does but it doesn't have it to that level that a child has it so could you please give us some tips on how to attain that joy just like the child and and try our best to do to attain the gender and etc inshallah abdullah he says children when we describe to them jannah they're so anxious to get there and so motivated while adults don't find the same motivation why i hope i understood his question correctly the reason is that adults have more temptations than children so when you tell children that you have to pray on time you have to fast you have to give charity you have to be kind there's not a lot for them to fight that's why they accept islam and implement it directly adults have oh if i do this i have to skip clubbing i can't party i can't do booze i can't do drugs i cannot watch haram i cannot listen to haram so shaytan puts a lot of barriers in front of them and they think that they have to give away a lot of their desires so this is why they're not tempted however if you go to the adults and intimidate them with hellfire and remind him of what they are to expect what awaits them in their grave the torments and the punishment and on the day of judgment in hell fire this usually works with the vast majority of adults because when you use the carrot and the stick usually the stick is more effective than the carrot to most people and allah knows best you"
