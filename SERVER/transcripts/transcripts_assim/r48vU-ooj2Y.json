  "transcript": "uh I have a question uh is there need to to prevent intrusive thoughts like I have a lot of talks whenever I read the Quran whenever I study or even when I walk or I walk uh I live basically in my thoughts so how can I stop this I don't personally know any such Dua other than to say whatever these intrusive thoughts are about they usually come to cast doubts about your Islam about Allah about the Quran about Prophet Muhammad Alam so in order in order to stop and prevent them you just say I believe in Allah and in his messenger also reciting the last Surah of the Quran chapter 114 Surah Nas so this also gives you a boost to stop these Whispers and blocking it by not paying any attention to it would inevitably uh uh terminate it inshallah after some time because shatan will give up and will tell his thugs to back off for three four months until you let your guard down and he attacks again this is a vicious cycle that is ongoing until our souls depart our bodies unfortunately"
