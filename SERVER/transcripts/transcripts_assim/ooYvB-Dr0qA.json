  "transcript": "to pray before behind those who had come to kill him some say that it is permissible to pray before those sufis who have deviant true well you don't have to go that far to indicate a ruling the default is anyone whose prayer is valid for himself his prayer is valid for those behind him that's a rule of thumb what does it mean if a person if a disbeliever comes a Christian a Jew or someone pretending to be a Muslim a Jersey or someone who nullified his Islam and was labeled as a kaffir for claiming that something in the Quran is wrong he doesn't believe in toxicants or Haram you show him the Quran he says I don't believe it's Haram so such people even if they pray for themselves their prayers are invalid therefore you cannot pray behind them and your prayer would be invalid as well if a person is deviant he is an innovator he innovates things in Islam that are not part of Islam but he is still a Muslim so he believes in the maulid and he throws them Outlet every year or he believes in Innovative prayers or ascar or tawasul Etc that does not reach or Mount to shirk such a person is a Muslim if he prays his prayer is valid therefore you can pray behind him and your prayer would be valid as well but is it the best thing for you to do of course not if there is someone else who's following the correct apida and does not innovate you have to go and pray behind him rather than picking that person but if you do not and you insist on praying behind that innovator your prayer is still valid and Allah Knows Best"
