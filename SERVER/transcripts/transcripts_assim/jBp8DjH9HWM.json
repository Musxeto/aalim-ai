Wa'alaykumussalam Wa'alaykumussalam Wa'alaikumussalam Wa'alaikumussalam Wa'alaikumussalam Wa'alaikumussalam Wa'alaikumussalam Wa'alaikumussalam Wa'alaikumussalam Wa'alaikumussalam Wa'alaikumussalam Wa'alaikumussalam Wa'alaikumussalam Wa'alaikumussalam Wa'alaikumussalam Wa'alaikumussalam Wa'alaikumussalam Wa'alaikumussalam Wa'alaikumussalam Wa'alaikumussalam Wa'alaikumussalam Wa'alaikumussalam Wa'alaikumussalam Wa'alaikumussalam Wa'alaikumussalam Wa'alaikumussalam Wa'alaikumussalam Wa'alaikumussalam Wa'alaikumussalam Oh, you know that only one is okay. No, no, no, no, no. Naqshbandis are hardcore Sufis who believe that something is craved and written on their hearts, and they believe that your prayer, your dua is not accepted until you visualize your Imam, your Sheikh, and he visualizes the Prophet, and the Prophet sends it to Allah. So it's a matter of impact and effect. Among so many innovations and sometimes so many shirkiyat in their cult and their tariqa, so definitely it's not permissible."
