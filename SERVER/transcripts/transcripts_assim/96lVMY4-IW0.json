  "title": "Can I hold the glass with my left hand & support it with my right hand to drink? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "as i mostly eat with fingers and not spoon so the right hand is obviously dirty so is it okay to hold the glass with the left hand and support it with the right hand or palm to avoid getting the glass messy what mona is saying is my hand is greasy because i'm eating with my fingers and when i want to drink something i cannot touch it with the right hand because it would make it messy so what i do is i take the cup or the glass with my left and i put my greasy right hand underneath and i drink and this is not permissible it is a trick because the hand that you're drinking with is the hand which if you were to remove the glass would fall so if i removed my right hand i still can't drink but if i removed my left hand the glass would fall so i'm not using the right to drink this is just a trick to bypass the prohibition of drinking with your left hand and allah best"
