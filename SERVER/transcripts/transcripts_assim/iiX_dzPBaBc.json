  "title": "If parents force daughter for Khula, is it valid? (Forced Khula or divorce) | Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "says if parents are forcing daughter for huller is that color valid by court first of all the issues of divorce and khuler the parents of both sides have no say in it so the father of the wife has no say in demanding divorce or for his daughter this is something between a man and his wife so the question doesn't make any sense if parents are forcing daughter is that valid by court the answer is no unless the daughter goes and demands huller in front of the judge without any indication that he's she's being forced by her parents the judge is a human being he sees a woman coming and demanding her from her husband he does his due diligence talks to the husband talks to the girl try to reconcile but she's adamant and insisting on her how would he know that she's forced there's no possibility so if she applies for her and is granted it she has no right to come after one month and say judge i was forced prove that to us and he can't accept what she's saying without any proof there is and we spoke about this before in some of our courses and we said that claiming that a person is forced to divorce or to do something haram or to break an oath the claim of being forced has to be real and genuine otherwise it won't be accepted for example a person claims that he was forced to divorce his wife that's why he divorced her we say how were you divorced and he replies by saying someone said to me if you don't divorce your wife i'm gonna throw rocks on you so the judge says did he have rocks around him he said no was he capable of throwing rocks so no he's so thin he cannot carry rocks so why did you divorce he forced me no this is not acceptable someone says my wife forced me to divorce her she said if you don't divorce me tomorrow i'm going to throw myself in the river this divorce is invalid actually the divorce has taken place is valid why he wasn't forced she threatened to throw herself in the river tomorrow yeah tomorrow not today so this is not a krahn this is not forced um or pressured forcing of i don't know what have you that doesn't leave you any room to maneuver someone has a knife to your neck if you don't divorce i'm gonna slash your throat this is real threat a woman on the 10th floor hanging from the balcony or threatening to throw herself from the window and i know that she would do such a thing this is a valid force or a valid um excuse to do whatever you want and it doesn't take effect therefore if the daughter was not forced as i've explained to ask for her then the chore is valid if she was forced by real threat genuine threat that is going to happen inevitably in this case the holler is not valid but she has to clarify all of this to the judge"
