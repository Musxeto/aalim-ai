  "title": "Is Yoga permissible in Islam? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "rana sent us our first question of uh tonight she says is yoga permissible now yoga is something that some people consider it as a philosophy others consider it as part of a religion and some look at it as merely exercise and if you go to the origin of this yoga you will find that it originated from the hindus and adopted by the buddhists and they considered it as translated into their native language to be a union and they claim that they through these practices connect with the universal soul with the supreme spirit so they say that this is a union between the body the heart and the spiritual uh and the universal spirit when and they refer to that to allah azzawajal may allah be exalted through this and some muslims prohibited it totally and others said that it is completely permissible and others looked at it as a form of exercise if you look deep into it you cannot miss the religious origin of it where it praises the sun and tells you to face it when it rises and sets and you repeat it's 12 names through a number of repetition claiming that brings you focus and concentration by sitting idle doing nothing claiming that you're meditating by prostrating on your eight parts of the body in poses like animals if you look at all of this and the concept behind it you will reach the conclusion without any doubt that this is prohibited first of all because it goes against the of tawheed the issue of uniting with allah azzawajal the issue of being as one with the universe etc all of this is contradictory to islam and its teachings the worship of the sun and if you are unable to concentrate on the sun and this would definitely harm your eyesight then you may draw the sun on your wall if you're doing it indoors the recommendation of being sort of exposing your chest back and thighs and and the more you make it exposed the better plus there's so many things related to it and even there are more dangerous concepts than that of making all religions correct and this not only kills islam it kills all other religions because whether you're a christian a buddhist a hindu a seer a jew you're all right and this is illogical not a single religion says that you can embrace any religion you want each and every religion tells you that my religion is the only religion accepted otherwise it's foolish to accept their religion as a religion if it is something for everyone to take or leave therefore the fatwa is that practicing yoga is not permissible it is harmful for the body not everyone can do these stretches it can cause injuries of course despite the numerous problems in akhida related to it that goes against monetism against the hate against the religion of islam one may claim and say okay we don't believe in any of that we just adopt the exercises the answer would be the prophet said allah woman whoever imitates a people he would be part of them among them with them so you can take any kind of sports that is halal with no problem you want to to do aerobics no problem you want to exercise cardios you want to go to the gym you want to uh do weight lifting bodybuilding all of this is okay you want to pick up squash tennis badminton no problem but when it comes to such exercises that are related to such a religion this becomes prohibited and allah azza knows best"
