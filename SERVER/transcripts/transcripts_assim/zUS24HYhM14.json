  "transcript": "[Music] what is lailatul cutter was the quran completely revealed in night of lailatul cutter and what are the encouraging acts we should do in this night now lailatul cutter is the night of decree and it is one of the last 10 nights of ramadan and this begins from the sunset of the 20th day of ramadan so if today is 20th the sunset or the mashup is an hour from now once the Sun sets this begins the last 10 nights of ramadan lady that of qatar is one of them and the most favoured night is the 27th but this is not a well-known fact it has to be on the 27th like a lot of the Muslims believe and also it is most likely to be on the odd nights that is a 21st 23rd 25th 27th and the 29th of Ramadan the nights and that is not the days and this night as Allah has described in the Quran in a surah named by this night that it is better than a thousand months [Music] Laila to Audrey hiren min health official this one single particular night is more important and better than a thousand months and scholars differ one of their explanation was that Allah has given long life to previous nations so the Jews came like three thousand years before us and they've lived for so long the people's lives would be like two hundred years maybe three hundred years which means that they could fill it up with forms of worship far greater than the 60 or 70 years that we live on earth nor him peace be upon him lived nine hundred and fifteen years and some say he lived longer than that he remained giving Dawa for nine hundred fifty years but he lived more than that so they had long life and the ability to fill it up with good deeds while our lifespan is short so Allah is compensating us by giving us a night in a year that is equivalent to 83 plus years of Deeds and good work if we succeed in worshiping Allah in this night which is few hours on like 810 hours this would be better than worshipping Allah in 83 years or more so this is a glorious night the sunnah of the prophet alaihi wa salam is to offer night prayer the whole night whenever that last 10 nights of ramadan will do whenever they entered the prophet used to tighten his apron or waist wrapper scholars say that this is a metaphor for not having any intimacy with his wives and others say no this is a metaphor for trying to do his level best in word for forms of worship and he used to wake up his wives thirdly he used to revive the whole night with night prayer over these last 10 nights so what is to be done well the prophet's sunnah a distillate of salaam was to offer arity calf an anti calf is to seclude yourself in the Masjid and not to go home so you spend that last 10 nights in seclusion in the Masjid worshipping Allah reciting the Quran making decade making dua praying night prayer and PMLA and you make a lot of Doha as mentioned before to make a lot of Vicker you try to isolate yourself from other Muslims so that you would not engage in chit chatting gossiping etc something that is not useful for you but rather focus on worshiping allah azza wajal and cleansing your heart from the impact the rest of the year had on it 10 nights and days you spend and devote entirely for Allah and this was the way of the Prophet Harris on to Silla you [Applause]"
