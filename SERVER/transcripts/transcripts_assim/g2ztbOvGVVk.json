  "transcript": "the second question is about a woman who marries an UNM Muslim we know she is a zani she's a fornicator the marriage is invalid but are the kids Muslim or disbelievers by default the rule of thumb among Scholars is that the child follows the most honorable of the two religions so if we have Christianity and Islam by default whether the father or the mother are a Muslim then the child follows Islam because it is the most honorable of the two religions and hence if a woman marries a non-muslim man regardless of his religion and the children are born definitely they're born out of wedlock because the marriage is inv valid but they are still considered to be Muslims and treated as Muslims and Allah Asel Knows Best"
