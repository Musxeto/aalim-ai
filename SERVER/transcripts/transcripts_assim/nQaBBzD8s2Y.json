  "transcript": "this is important to know that there are differences between holla and divorce for example divorce number one and divorce number two the inter period is three monthly cycles if she's not pregnant while Haller is one monthly cycle similar to the third divorce if a man divorces his wife for the third time she waits only for one monthly cycle and then she can marry again but the first and second divorces she has to wait three monthly cycles color is exactly the same as the third divorce in the sense that she's awarded holder today in the evening she gets her menses five days later she's pure the sixth day she can get married to another man boom no problem also in divorce one and divorce two during their inter period she is considered to be his wife and if he wants he can revoke the marriage reconcile with her with or without her permission she has no say in it he's the one who divorced he's the one the own he's the only one who has the right to revoke the marriage and get her back to the marriage institution or whatever if she refuses it has no value in Houla once the holder is awarded a couple of weeks later the man says I changed my mind I revoke my collar no no done deal it's over so what to do the woman herself wants to go back in marriage with him this is a different situation you can propose to her guardian and if he agrees then we can make a marriage contract with a new maja with two Muslim male witnesses it said the fool the whole nine nine yards but other than that no you cannot revoke the holder as you wish so this is Yanni almost everything that we need to know about what's in color and I think we should move on to the questions you"
