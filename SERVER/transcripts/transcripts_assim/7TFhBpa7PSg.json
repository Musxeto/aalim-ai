  "transcript": "Ibrahimah from Guinea Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Allah reward you and your family Sheikh Barakallahu Fikah Sheikh my question today is also related to Qulwah In some situations we do not exactly have a choice of being alone with the opposite gender What I mean is for example one day a woman entered in our house yard And I did not know her, nobody was around us I had to ask her like what she was doing there And I could not just Your line is breaking Ibrahimah I cannot understand your question Except that if a woman comes in And you're asking about Qulwah I think So if a stranger breaks into your house A woman And you say oh I'm in seclusion The right thing to do is I leave the house You'll be crazy She'll rob you, steal the house and leave Rather you should Due to necessity Kick her out Restrain her from entering and doing whatever she wants And call the police, do whatever is needed But do not of course leave her to do whatever she wants in the house Thank you"
