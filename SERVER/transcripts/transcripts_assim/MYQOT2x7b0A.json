  "transcript": "Muhammad from India. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Barakatuh. Yes, yeah Sheikh my question was when offering congregation prayer and there is noisy situation like crying of an infant during the entire prayer and I am not sure what I am reading due to noise Sheikh how to do how to deal with this situation? When a person is praying in congregation and due to the distance between him and the imam or due to external noise he is unable to recognize what the imam is reciting the scholars say that in this case you should recite your own as if you are praying in a silent prayer because the voice of the imam cannot reach you so you as if it is Dhuhr or Asr."
