  "title": "Taking loan from So Called 'Islamic Banks\" - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "the rial will be taken from my salary so like two to three years because I asked them decided to Sharia compliance and his Islamic okay any more questions no that's my question I will answer you in sha Allah brother Yusuf is asking about acquiring a loan from ncb National Commercial Bank or Al Ahly Bank as known and he said that it is Shariah compliant and they told him that this is Islamic and he's asking is this truly Islamic well each one claims to be Islamic so you cannot take what they say for its face value until you scrutinize the process that they are doing first of all Islamic banks do not lend money because Islamically when you borrow money you have to give the money as it is any increase would mean that this is interest or in Islamic terminology this is RIBA usury and it's totally prohibited it's one of the seven major sins in Islam so how would the Islamic banks try to divert and avoid falling in such a major sin uh-huh they do not lend you money so you don't get fifty thousand reals and you pay two thousand per month they don't do this to you because this is cleared river with interest what they do is an actual halal transaction and that is they sell you something so for example if this pen costs in the market 10 riyals it's mine I own it if I sell it to Tom for 10 and for dick for 20 and for Harry for nothing no one can complain out of the three because it's my pen I can sell it in any price I want this is my property therefore what they actually do the transaction the halal transaction it should be as follows you come and buy this pen from me and this transaction called power rope so I'll sell it to you though the market price is 10 riyals because you are unable to pay it cash I'm selling or not lending you so I'll sell it to you for 15 reals you agree we sign a contract we put the terms we say that you have to pay two thousand or whatever a month the price is fixed fixed at fifteen there's no way even if you go to prison or hospitalized I cannot as a bank say oh you skip to three months we have to increase it from fifteen into sixteen no the price is totally fixed at fifteen this transaction is hella so what is the catch here uh-huh the catch is that not all so-called Islamic banks deal in an Islamic way they have a Sharia board some of them have a Sharia board in a five-star hotel and they display to them listen we want to sell this we want to buy this this is a transaction we want to do and the scholars look at it as in black and white and say yeah this is okay no this is not okay you have to change this haleh's okay signed stamped and delivered now the bank that is not truly Islamic would take this fatwa and hang it on the doors but the transactions are not in accordance to what is in the fatwa in the sense if you go to a so called Islamic bank that is not dealing islamically correct you say I'd like a hundred thousand dollars a worth of cash this is oh this is on Islamic so what you do is it we will sell you something okay and then you take that something and sell it elsewhere or to make life easier for you we will sell it for you so I came to get cash so I said well this is okay so what do I have to do okay listen this is a contract whereby we will sell you ten fifteen hundred tons of iron ore of copper or a X number of air conditioners or wheat or rice or whatever so sign here that you will buy it for a hundred and twenty thousand from us you have to pay us a hundred twenty so I sign then they bring me another contract and say okay this contract you authorized us to sell that X amount of money to any buyer who comes in providing that it is within the range of 100 thousand so when I sign and in five minutes time 100 thousand is in my bank account Wow that was quick this is an invalid transaction why because I did not see the product myself I did not acquire the product and take it into my possession thirdly they sold it before me taking it into my possession and without me checking if there it exists or not and there are reports that some of the Lowe's dubious Islamic so-called Islamic transaction banks or financial institutions do not have the product this is why you get the money in like five minutes or 10 minutes this is impossible if you have like 1500 tons of rice in a location as they claim in your warehouse first of all you have to go and check it you went to their warehouse and you found it second of all do not authorize them to sell it because this is not permissible take it and put it your trucks and take it to anywhere else even if they advised you no problem but you are the one who's actually obliged to take it and possess it then sell it with any price you wish this is not happening so the actual 1,500 tons of rice in that particular plot is being sold and bought from like 30 or 50 branches in the country and this is the area we have 1500 tons of rice and that branch in the mam says the same in that in Mecca says the same data seemed says the same on the same pile of rice so they sell it and buy it only on paper and this is totally prohibited this is River no doubt in that therefore my friend Yusuf I would really suggest that you look into their process do they have the commodity that they want to sell to you before any commitment from your side if yes did you see it if yes once you sign it will you be able to take it yourself personally and dispose of it or sell it elsewhere with a lower price if yes then the transaction is halal"
