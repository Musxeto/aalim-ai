  "transcript": "this is a beautiful Dua again to be said the   Prophet (Peace and Blessings \nUpon Him) Islam used to say um o Allah knower of the Unseen and the seen \nthis is only in Allah subhanahu ta'ala's hands   creator of the heavens and the Earth so you are \nattributing these beautiful attributes to Allah   and calling Allah by his beautiful names and \nattributes Lord and Sovereign of all things   I bear witness that none has the right to \nbe worshiped except you I take refuge in you   from the evil of my soul so now I'm acknowledging \nI have my own demons I have my own evil thoughts   that are within my genes I seek refuge \nin Allah from them and from the evil   now I'm seeking refuge in Allah from Satan's \ncrafts and works and shirk because part of   what evil does what Satan does that he asks \nme to associate others with Allah azzawajal   and I seek Refuge as well from \ncommitting wrong against my soul   or bringing such upon another Muslim so I'm \nasking Allah azzawajal to harness me to stop   me from doing what is harmful for myself so many \ntimes we desire things that are Haram that are   harmful for ourselves but we still want them and \nif we were let alone we would do it and commit it   over and over again this is why I declare that \nI am helpless I need Allah's help to protect me   from bringing such strong things to myself and \nfrom bringing such upon another Muslim beautiful   Dua if we manage to say it and contemplate upon it \nthere will be a lot of good in our day and night"
