  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] bismillah r-rahman r-rahim wa salatu was-salam ala rasulillah Hakeem welcome back for another episode of life's enormous we will be discussing the importance 'as of child rearing the child and tribulations they're very choose and most importantly what is to be said about child rearing from the karana from the Sunna that we may keep in line this tradition and that we may rear our children in a way that is pleasing to us promote either and in accordance to the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad SAW rely on to help of this endeavors we have Shaykh awesome Luqman Hakeem who is a teacher at that Academy a teacher at KIU and he has been a mmm and teacher for over 30 years I said ah Malik until the Holy Quran Allah who sit down but Allah he over a catcher and just looking for having I mean oh yeah thank you for coming Sheikh today we would like to begin our session of talking about breastfeeding and its importance is a lot of men over Haman hamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallam about akamaru theorem attending i'll i mean sayyidina muhammadin wa ala alihi wa sahbihi ajma'in am a value in islam you'll find that sharia the law of this religion gives all their do right so each individual in islam has rights as each individual has obligations now children who are newly born don't have any obligations because they're not accountable for their actions due to their young age but they have rights and these rights unfortunately don't have advocates to demand them and to protect these children this is where the beauty of islam is illustrated when we find that islam puts regulations for this child to ensure a safe haven a righteous upbringing and taking care of this child's welfare so even when we look at the way a child is brought up not only through breastfeeding but also through personal hygiene also through size and characteristics of nature Islam covers this so that a child grows up in an accepted manner in fashion to be a healthy individual and to be a productive individual it goes without saying that when a child is born he is in deep need of being fed properly he's in need of nutrition's to grow and this is in all types of newborns animals fish humans mammals whatever they all need this Islam governs how a child is taken care of and it distributes the responsibilities so a child is born the mother can say it's my responsibility and the mother can say I don't want any responsibility the father can do the same yet Islam tells us Islam forces the father to be responsible for financial provision definitely he's not going to be breastfeeding his child because physically this is not possible now the mother who conceived and gave birth to that child Islamically is not obliged breastfeed her own child and this might be shocking to a lot of the viewers but this is the Sharia law this is what is mentioned in Quran if there is a dispute between the spouses then another woman would be responsible for suckling that child and it's the father's duty to give her money so he's actually renting her services to take care to suckle his child the mother is not obliged to do that but in normal cases this is what is happening mothers by default usually take care of the children and give them breastfeeding so Islam has governed this and not only that Islam has also governed the minimum and the maximum time allocated for suckling so the minimum there's no minimum if the child can suckle for three months four months and then eat solid food which is difficult usually but if this happens there's no problem the maximum it's an issue of dispute among scholars some say that two years twenty four months is the max but the most authentic opinion is that thirty months which is two years and a half is the max unfortunately we have mothers that go on to suckle their kids until they're four or five years of age and I've seen such any incidence which is quite weird in that natural at all so scholars say that two-and-a-half years is the max for such suckling okay there a preference and as far as a mother a suckling our child it was opposed to another one is there like a certain wisdom I've read in certain places before they said something about their creating a certain specific relationship between a mother and a child things that are passed down from our DNA to the child such and so forth there is a lot of benefits and it is scientic science typically proven that a child finds only tranquility and comfort when his mother breast feeds him simply because he was in her womb for nine months he's been hearing the same heartbeat he's been in the same environment so when she circles him he feels the comfort and and the tranquility but in regards to human DNA and the anti viruses and the strength that a child gets from the breast milk it seems that it's it's in both and it is also important to note that breastfeeding from someone who's not the mother has a lot of rulings in Islam okay so if a person is suckled by another woman five meals when he is within the age of twenty four months he becomes a son to that woman and this cascades to all of her relatives so her husband becomes his father because he's the generator of such milk and their siblings whether born before suckling this child or after they are his siblings by default and this is why the Prophet said that is awesome yo mama nerevar my mu'minin Nessa which means that through suckling the kinship and the relationships of muharram and nan muharram is cascaded exactly as it is cascaded from real kinship so yes he becomes a son to that woman who suckled him five times or more when he was below 24 years months of age and her sisters become her his aunts her brother's become his uncles and now prior to this the age the maximum age if a mother were to feed her child without breasts breast milk like for example we have Similac a service or any things is there any Islamic ruling on someone leaving breast milk and replacing that with Similac or powdered milk or something of this nature this there's nothing in Islam that prohibits this or even more there is nothing in Islam that does not recommend this so it's a issue of personal preference some women don't find the milk that is sufficient for the children so they are forced to go for formula milk other women don't want to change their physique and outer appearance so in order to keep and maintain their figure they don't want to this is up to their preference there's no pressure in Islam at hamdulillah it is always recommended to go through a natural breastfeeding because this is way way better healthier for a strong child but again there's no recommendation not no prohibition and it's according to the preference of the mother herself okay even with the advent of technology terms breast milk bags and in this nature is there any ruling with regards to that are you referring to pumping milk out of the mother or general milk banks both okay there's an issue of a difference of issues here because if a woman manages to pump out milk from her breasts and put it in a bottle and feeds it to her son or to anyone else this is suckling because it's human milk that is given milk banks on the other hand is totally prohibited the concept of milk banks is every woman who has given birth and has milk she goes and donates milk such a donation when mixed with other milk means that there might be a prohibition of a movement becoming his mother through suckling and we don't know that and this means that her daughters are his brother and this is Danny totally prohibited to participate to take in Islam mmm so the issue was through what develops then to be a Muharram for someone and they wouldn't know this is the issue of Muharram is what mainly people use suckling for so me and my brother we have children then just newborn and we live in a joint family or we love one another he's my brother is my sibling and we don't want in the future to have problems with the children so I instruct my wife to breast feed his children and he instructs his wife to breast feed my children so my children now are his children through suckling and his our mind through suckling when they grow up their siblings and brother and sisters excellent thank you so much for this information Sheikh we're going to pause for a break and continue to afterwards with some more questions around breastfeeding a suckling of this nature Sharla viewers stay tuned for a second segment of life's adornments what we're discussing the topic of breastfeeding and all its virtues and all the rulings that come along with this stay tuned - allah o allah assalamu alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh [Music] Salam alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa laqad - welcome back to our second segment of life's adornments we are discussing breastfeeding its virtues its benefits its rulings and how do we go about breastfeeding providing our breast milk for the child in a way that is according to the Quran and Sunnah so we would like to pick up as the chef's you mentioned meals 5 meals that a child that has 5 meals then becomes the Muharram are the one that provides them the meal so how what are the specifications the details of five meals it if it's less than five meals does it still count how do you go about navigating that so anyone who does not know Islam would think that you guys are talking about appetizers main course and desserts this is a meal no we're talking about a meal when suckling a child who's below 24 years of age in Arabic it is rubber and it's the same rhyme as watch ba and watch by means meal so the scholars have differed in identifying a meal some of them said that if a child takes his mother's breast and starts to suckle and then he leaves it on his own either to take a breath or to look at something and then goes back again this is one meal by their definition he could finish five meals in less than half an hour which is not authentic the authentic a most attentive case that when a child who is hungry takes the breast and suckles until he's had enough this is a meal and this means that he may finish in a day or two or more now having said that the origin of the theme of the prohibition was 10 meals would make a person an individual a child a son of the woman who suckled him this was initially revealed in the Quran this was a verse then it was abrogated from the Quran from 10 to 5 as mother aisha said then it was abrogated from the recitation of the Quran and it was kept as a ruling so abrogation in Islam is found in the Quran manners of an ayat in a nun she had a tear I mean how with Lena so abrogation is different types either one taking away the ruling while the recitation remains or taking away the recitation while the ruling remains three taking both ruling and recitation so for the first taking the ruling out while the recitation remains as in Allah saying yeah you her Lavina a man who litter Abu Saud Ottawa and to Chikara oh you who believe do not approach prayer while you are intoxicated now this was abrogated when intoxications were prohibited totally but the recitation remains the ruling is no longer its abrogated the opposite which is the ruling remains but the recitation does not exist this applies to five sucklings five meals prohibits as in the hadith of Aisha so the ruling now is there but there is no iron the Quran if you look for it it was abrogated likewise the hadith lo cannellini Adam worthy and means they have la ilahe ma la - Ian if the son of Adam would possess a valley of gold he would seek a second one this was an ayah but it was abrogated so there's no recitation but the ruling remains the third type of abrogation is when the ruling and the the I itself are abrogated they're not found and the ruling is not implemented and the scholars give the well-known famous example which is ten meals of suckling a prohibit so the ruling was abrogated and it is what five and the recitation is abrogated because it's not in the Quran any longer so this is what we look for in the suckling that prohibits that it is a mean the child takes the breast or the bottle providing that to the mother filled it up with her milk and he consumes whatever fills him up and stops this is a me excellent now with regard so that you mentioned two things one the time period which is under 24 months don't know that the prohibition is within two years two years 24 months yes so if the child is 24 months and a week and the fifth suckling was after he finished 24 months this does not prohibit he has to be five so contain so there was a method regarding if a man drank the breast milk of his wife by a lot of unfortunately Muslims asked about this intimacy between the spouses everything is allowed except for what Allah has prohibited so when a man says what's the ruling on a husband fondling with his wife and maybe by mistake or even intentionally drinking some of her milk would the prohibition be applied here sir is no because he is over two years of age but is it normal for grown-up men to do such a thing this is debatable okay moving forward we have talking about things that assist with a system woman and producing the flow of breast milk are they things that she could eat I think that she should do you know all of these things are not mentioned in the Sunnah so the default is it's hella okay unless proven to be medically harmful so if there is a type of food or a type of a medication that would generate breast milk for a woman who wants to suckle her child there's no problem in and in doing this likewise with all other ingredients that people consume so someone says chef I I have these capsules and they claim that I can it can help me grow a few inches or centimeters taller is this permissible let's look at the science if doctors say that this is not harmful there's nothing to prevent you from doing this isn't this shape changing the creation of Allah no this is not this is something that enhances you whether it makes your bicep bigger or your physique different as long as it's not harmful or Haram ingredient the the sky's the limit okay now we mentioned a technique and in the first stage where the date or something sweet is put into our mouths after the period of breastfeeding are there anything and these fools or any prophetic tradition that a child should take in this stage to you know increase them and say their health or I don't recall anything in the Sharia yeah it's just normal food so after they're breastfed they can eat bread they can eat vegetables they can eat meat whatever they can consume this is good for them and it helps them and it would be any good if you can seek the advice of a medical doctor yes but generally speaking honey dates and milk are part of the ingredients that the menu yeah at the time of the prophetess erm was always containing them yeah was their issue or incident rather with our mother Asia or the Latonya where she wanted to breastfeed someone in order for them to learn from her mmm it was okay after you open the Pandora Box again okay see unfortunately people with no knowledge tend to jump the gun and we are enemies of what we don't know so many times we are impulsive in taking decisions and this is not part of being a student of knowledge you have to refrain don't express your emotions look into it objectively not with your own notions and and preconceived ideas be open to everything study it then come up with the conclusion so what is this issue most people in the Muslim world due to their ignorance make fun you said yeah yeah I have a driver that I've brought from a faraway country and now he's driving is a house driver and I'd like my wife to breastfeed him so that he becomes her son well what we argue what are you talking about this is a sunnah about it now he don't play around soon so first of all you have to feel a lot second of all you have to refer to the sources authentic sources of the sinner third of all you have to consult scholars to explain to you what is difficult for you to understand but to make fun and ridicule this may take you out of the fold of Islam so people tend to object no no no I don't accept this this is not logical this is this is not up to you and me who set the time age of two years to prohibit this individual so that he becomes a Muharram to his mother who suckled him it's a large origin it's the Prophet Allison so the issue of prohibition whether it's 18 months 24 months 30 months 60 years it's not in my hand or yours it's up to a large order to decide now having introduced it through this way we go back to the prophetic sayings and teachings and sorry it was reported that there was a man by the name of Abu Hanifah he's a great companion from Mecca migrated so he's a mahadji his father is behavior Rabia one of the vicious enemies of Islam who was killed in the Battle of Badr HobNob er Scheib Nura BIA all of them were killed so Abu Hanifah accepted Islam his father did not like this his sister did not like this hint betrayed by the wife of Abu Sufian the mother of mahalia may Allah be pleased with them she accepted Islam all of them are terrible Salaam Abajo de fer had a slave boy a child whom he bought and then he loved that child so much he set him free so the child's name was sad him and Salim was mola a believer this is a connection yes and they both migrated to Medina Salem was one of the most learned people in Quran and the Prophet Alice's am instructed the Muslims to take the Quran from za diminish a bit from Abdullah heaven was rhodium no in Omaha from sadly Moda before they fire nobody will cap these four so sorry used to lead the prayer and behind him was Rama hot pop before the Prophet migrated to Medina it shows you how learner he wasn't now Sarah was a young boy Abajo de fer had a wife her name is suheyla been to so high if I'm not mistaken she is the sister of Amal Nasir hail the one who negotiated the soul hudaibiya but this is not our topic when she noticed that Salim was about to reach puberty she noticed that Abajo de fer her husband was not easy in salim coming in and going out while she's in her a normal clothes in home because now he's becoming a man he's reached puberty so she complained to the Prophet as soon as she said o prophet of Allah we raised him up and because we raised him up we don't I don't like the look at abu hanifa now for this the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam told her to breastfeed him so she said he's a grown up man what do you mean breastfeed him she said breastfeed him five meals now this is an authentic hadith we have no argument with that you don't jump to conclusions and say how did he was breastfed is it directly but she's none madam no she could have put it in a cup and he could have drank of it this is an exceptional case not found in anywhere else in the Sharia and this is why mother Aisha whenever she wanted people to come in and learn from her she used to instruct her nieces to breastfeed them in the same fashion not directly through a copper guy and the rest of the mothers of the believers rejected that I said no this is a specific case only designed and tailor-made for Salem and Abajo de fer not for anyone else so if you understand this you get to understand how things move and go on there's a cooperator shake for the information very beneficial knowledge to know masha'Allah we thank you again for this episode for the things that your goodness or wisdom and your knowledge we're gonna end this episode here in Charlotte Ireland continue in our next episode of life's adornments thank you viewers for tuning in we hope that you'll receive much
