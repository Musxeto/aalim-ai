  "transcript": "consider subscribing from India my question is that when I am praying my cat comes and sit on the prayer mad is it okay or should I push it aside or can I move a little aside a cat is a pet that the prophet Allah once saw in his home he went to a vessel and gave the water to the cat to drink from it and he said this is among this pet this animal is among the animals that come and wander around in your homes so it is permissible to keep to Pat and to allow it to come and mingle with you which means that if a cat comes and sits in front of you while you're praying there's no problem in that inshallah however try not to step on it or prostrate on it because you will squeeze it to death rather when you want to prostrate just remove it aside or put it between your prostration spot and your knees and there is no problem in that and your prayer is valid insha Allah"
