  "transcript": "for some seconds and then i started recycling as soon as i started the amounts with the beer and he went to the pool and i mistakenly said all but i did not complete it so i then recited the fate and the name came up i still went to the pool then followed the imam i forgot if i decided that properly is my salah landed should i repeat my players as the time of the shah is still going on okay i will answer inshallah muhammad from india his imam was a ferrari imam in india probably he was a tata imam he was praying so fast so quick that he could not even say subhana rabbi subhan if this is the case and everybody was complaining then repeat your prayer your prayer behind this imam his prayer himself is invalid but if everybody else was okay and you had a heavy slow tongue it was your problem in this case what you should do is look into your prayer if you were late because of your own shortcomings you have to pray again if the imam himself was fast and everybody acknowledged that he was fast his prayer the imam is not valid but you and those with you because you had no other choice you're really in the salat your delay of going into record while he is coming up and being delayed for this reason insha allah your prayer is valid and you don't have to repeat it so let me repeat again if he's too fast everybody acknowledges it your prayer is valid but don't pray behind him next time if everybody was fine with his prayer and his speed and you're the only one who is finding him too fast you have to repeat your prayer you"
