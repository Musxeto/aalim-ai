  "title": "Doing a sin while the athaan is going on, is this a sin in itself1",
  "transcript": "Zainab from Pakistan. Sheikh, I wanted to ask this question. I will not go in details, but if one is doing an act that could be a sin and Adhan is happening at the same time or one is listening to a meeting which is Islamic. So is it a sin in itself? The sin is a sin. Whether the Adhan is going on, whether the Qur'an is being recited, whether the Sheikh is on YouTube giving a lecture, this has nothing to do with your sin. Now what doubles or triples the sin if it is accompanied by mocking and ridiculing such rituals. So a person is smoking, that's all. The Adhan is being given and he continues to smoke. This has nothing to do with the Adhan. And if someone says to him, Akhi, the Adhan is being called, and he says, yes, I'm repeating behind the mu'adhin. He says, yes, but you're smoking. He said, this has nothing to do with the Adhan. He said, no, you're mocking Islam. He said, no, I'm not mocking Islam. I love Islam. I love the Adhan. I don't intend any disrespect. So again, this is from Shaytan. It has nothing to do with the Adhan or with these rituals. And Allah knows best."
