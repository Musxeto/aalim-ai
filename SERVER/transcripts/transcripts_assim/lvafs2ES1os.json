  "transcript": "he's a finance teacher sometimes he has to teach the concept of Interest he says is he allowed to do this teaching well unfortunately there are so many topics in our schools and universities that do not go with Islam but in order for us to progress if you have the intention of teaching these subjects with these topics with the intention of having our finance and economy progress in an Islam way then I see that it's okay for you to do this providing that you always warn your students about things that are not permissible for example if you teach them about complex interest rates anyone who studies economy has to go through this this is okay teach it teach them how they do it and always set examples to them that these uh institutions deal with RBA interest is a major sin every single class keep keep on brainwashing them uh warning them from dealing with such uh uh transactions I believe inshallah your work is okay"
