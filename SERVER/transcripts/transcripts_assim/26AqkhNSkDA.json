  "title": "Is speaking about Scholars dead or alive correct",
  "transcript": "i wanted to ask regarding um the other brown speaking about you know scholars alive and were passed away so i mean recently some people they uncovered fatwa and they started saying that he made blunders and mistakes and it's an aberrant uh fatwa um so i didn't i don't know in my heart i don't feel like this is correct but could you tell us like you know is this kind of speaking of the scholars is that correct or not okay i will answer it from canada that says there are people who would go and dig in the old archives of great scholars of islam such as sheikh al-bani and come up with a fatwa that might be wrong and they start to slander him to speak ill about him to criticize him well this is too generic but it's a rule of thumb no one is qualified to criticize someone of the magnitude and the weight of sheikh except someone who is similar to him in rank in knowledge and in a position so when people random people come and talk ill about sheikh al-bani for a fatwa he has said this is unacceptable it's exactly like when someone comes nowadays and says o abu hanifa the great imam he was this he was this he was this he was this and he discredits him like he is a pupil in elementary school what is this this is imam abu hanifa who spoke highly about him imam shafi he said all scholars are children in need of imam abu hanifa's knowledge who praised him who took knowledge of him all the great scholars and and so on so for you to come and discredit abu hanifa to discredit sheikh al-bani to come and discredit sheikh bimbas the great mufti the grand mufti and you one of the great scholars of islam and he said oh yeah he said this fatwa that went against the predictions and the theories and the facts of nasa so we discredit him he's this he's that this shows how an ignorant imbecile such people are you don't pay attention to those so when people speak ill about great scholars of islam you have to look into them read their cvs look at what they had presented to the ummah if they are qualified so if when shaykh nathan speaks about sheikh al-bani and says something about a fatwa or criticizes it yeah they are heavyweights it's muhammad ali versus fraser no problem but when someone comes and no one and he talks without any credentials without any knowledge without any uh solid background about great scholars of islam why waste your time listening to such people it's simply not logical and we don't give them room to grow and flourish when we criticize them when we say oh this guy said something about albany these people are fame seekers they're not scholars but if a scholar speaks about another scholar and he's just and fair and feels allah azzawajal and speaks the truth it's not pure jealousy or peer pressure then yeah we may listen to that but someone who's a nobody speaking about a mountain about a big beacon of light like albani or bimbas or i mean you have to ignore those and not even refute what they're saying or not even make room to what they're saying because they're nobody they don't even deserve the recognition and allah azza knows best"
