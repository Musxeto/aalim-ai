  "transcript": "thank you hmm alhamdulillah dear brothers and sisters met on the 11th year of the first Quran that was revealed to him with six men from al-hazraj tribe coming from yesterday or what would be known in the future as Medina he took from them the Pledge of Allegiance and they accepted it and he sent with them one of his best companions to teach them the Quran to lead them in prayer and to call others to Islam foreign who was with him and he stayed at his house together they went from house to house from tribe to tribe calling people to come and join Islam once they went to the tribe of Benya Abdel ashal and they gathered men to call them to Islam heard of this asked his friend who said to go to go and deter them to stop them from whatever they're doing and he justified this by saying you go because it happens to be my cousin and I cannot say bad things to my cousin took his spear and went there with one objective and one objective alone and that is to stop them and if he had to he would attack this Foreigner who came from Mecca to spoil the men of Medina the minute as I had saw him coming he told his companion musab that be aware this man is one of the leaders of his people and if you do well with him this would affect the others could care less because he was doing Allah's work and he knew that Allah will support him the minute that's how a minute or said walked in he started shouting swearing yelling at them and telling them to stop what they're doing very calmly without shouting back and this is how the Muslims should learn whenever they are presenting their case told him why don't you sit down and let us present our case to you if you see something you like alhamdulillah you accept it if you don't we will leave to the place we came from how does this sound to you was a logical person he was not like the pagans of Mecca he said this is only fair I will sit and listen he put his Spirit on the floor and he sat down as they explained Islam to him and recited some of the verses of the Quran and immediately they could see it on his face he said what are the actions needed for those who wanted to embrace your religion so they told him it was easy go wash perform obligatory Revolution clean your clothes or wear a clean clothes and say the testimony so he did that and he became a Muslim and he told them that I'm going back to one of the greatest leaders of our tribes to set even more and if reversed to Islam you had you have it made so he went there and Saturday was sitting on his companions and the minute he saw usaid coming he told his companions by Allah he came with a different face then he left from here this is not the same man I can see it I can I can sense it and subhanallah this is exactly what Islam does to people it transforms them completely to the good side that is and you may ask the parents that they're children reverted to Islam they will come to you and say your religion is a great religion my parents my kids used to beat me my kids used to shout at me they never respected us and now they are supporting us they're giving us money they're obeying whatever they say whatever we say and they give us the amount of respect that was not found there before this is Islam when a Muslim becomes a Muslim he's 180 degrees or maybe 360 Degrees transformation takes place at him he becomes truthful he becomes sincere he never breaks a promise he is not violent he is not shouting he tries his best to call others to Islam this is exactly what Musa did with website going to Saad and sad immediately began attacking what have you done so usaid said exactly as you told me I went to them I spoke with them and they agreed to go away and not to continue what they're doing so sad calm down a little bit but then Jose told him by the way I heard that beniharita its arrival tribe are trying to kill your cousin Assad just to humiliate you so I came immediately to tell you and warn you now this was widely spread among the Arabs as we said before they had so much pride in them and their relationship with their next of kin and relatives was so strong to the extent that they were ready to die defending their loved ones and their relatives even if their relatives were the aggressors was Furious when he heard that this tribe was about to attack his cousin in order to humiliate him so he took his spear and went immediately to that location given to him by usaid and the minute he went in he saw Musa and Assad sitting among the men they were trying to call he knew that he was strict he knew that he was fooled because if Hussein told him go and listen to them he would not have done this so he had to trick him in this way started shouting swearing and yelling at them and he addressed was addressing his cousin Assad because he felt that it was he that was preventing him from doing whatever he wanted because if he were not if he was not to to be there he would it would have been easy for him to kill Musa to attack him to hit him to do whatever he wanted so as I said the same thing to him exactly told him sad my cousin why don't you sit down and listen to what we have to say if you like it alhamdulillah that's great if you don't we will give you a promise that we will leave your city and Village and you will not hear of us anymore so sad a logical person too said this is acceptable he put his Spirit down and he sat down and just as they were presenting him with Islam reciting the verses of a Quran what do you expect happened the same thing happened with usaid he immediately showed it on his face his acceptance of Islam and he told him what would the man do to embrace Islam they told him it's very simple say the shahada go have a total bath change your clothings and you are a Muslim and this is exactly what he did when talking about it's not enough to mention his name in five minutes 10 minutes half an hour was one of the greatest Companions of the prophet he embraced Islam went immediately to his house and to his people he met his wife he told her what do you think of me she told him you're my husband that he told her then I will not talk to you at all until you embrace the same religion and she became a Muslim he went in the same day to his people and gathered them what do you think of me I told him you are our leader you are our master then in that case I will not talk to any one of you until I die until you embrace the same religion that I have followed and it was sunset all the people in his tribe converted and converted to Islam because of this single man foreign this man has wonders behind him the prophet Allah said that when he died the Throne of Allah azzawajal trembled out of Joy because he was coming to the heavens did and a number of years what a lot of men could not achieve in a lifetime his age in Islam did not pass 10 years he only was a Muslim for less than 10 years and then he died as a martyr but look at his achievements look at the support he gave to the prophet and look at his fingerprints on his tribe where they all embraced Islam because of him we have a short break so stay tuned um if you're 18 or if you're 18 if you've been Muslim for 50 years or five minutes this is a show for you you know when five times a day our foreheads touch the ground in prayer we beg for what's most important in our

looking for something that will make you think maybe even touch your heart and is the show for you and welcome back was one of the greatest Companions of the Prophet Allah with less than 10 years in Islam he made things that a whole tribe would not be able to achieve even if they spend their lifetime trying to he was the main reason for his tribe to convert to Islam he was one of the greatest supporters of the prophet alaihi wasallam he was the prophet's judge when an incident took place between the prophet and the Jews and he gave the verdict that Allah azzawajal as the prophet told us gave from above seven heavens reverted to Islam and started also spreading Islam by himself this was the case and the scenario on the 11th year and the months that followed where Musa was Paving the road for the prophet salallahu to come to Medina almost every house in F rib which was to be called Medina afterwards almost every house had Islam in it and everyone knew what Islam was and that is why on the 12th year of a of of age of Alberta where the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam uh began being revealed to on the 13th year the 12th year we had the six men coming to the prophet sending with him on the 13th year which was months before the migration of the prophet and which was the last of him being in Mecca 73 Men came to the season of Hajj of pilgrimage we start in this case I have a question okay what's the difference between the people of Madina yesterday because the prophet peace be upon Him stayed there 13 years and they become Muslim very hardly but Mars and the people of his service became Muslim very easily what's the difference they are tolerated pupils no it's not this it is due to the structural a a composition of Mecca the people of Makkah as you all know were the descendants of Ishmael which meant that they've been living in Mecca for centuries and centuries with their main objective was to care for the Kaaba and to receive the pilgrims that perform Hajj so they had this honor in them of being the protectors and the keepers and the custodians of the Kaaba that is why this prevented them from accepting another religion coming to them and you have to remember that the people of Makkah did not accept Judaism because Judaism and Christianity came after Abraham they remained worshiping on the Abraham abrahamic religion They didn't accept Christianity so when the prophet saws came though they knew he was truthful and what he was saying was the religion of Allah yet they could not accept it because of their arrogance and because of the roots preaching to Ishmael the people of Medina on the other hand were not as Noble as the people of quraish secondly they were expecting a messenger because of the threats of the Jews the Jews kept on threatening them that we will kill you we will attack you we will wage war on you under the flagship of this messenger whose time is very close now and that is why they were ready thirdly they needed someone to unify them while the people of Mecca every tribe and every family had its leader and they were content they were happy to be as they were in this regard the people of Medina and above all of course Allah azzawajal Almighty wanted the people of Medina to be the carrier of the message of the Prophet salaam and he wanted them to be the supporters of the prophet and that is why they are called which means that they are the supporters and the ones that assist the prophet sallam in being Victorious on the 13th year the people of Medina thought that it was not logical for the prophet Allah to be moving from one place to the other feeding on his life being susceptible for torture and humiliation they thought this is unfair us being here in Medina enjoying our lives with our children safe and sound what the prophet sallam is in Mecca being tortured and humiliated so they decided that to call the prophet sallam to migrate to Medina 73 men and two women on the season of Hajj on the season of pilgrimage they came with their people from the house and from the hazrat they came among the tribes and they could have come among 300 400 or more men and women for pilgrimage but through the night these 73 men and two women came out of the tent you know trying to go unnoticed to meet the prophet salallahu the prophet came with his uncle because was afraid that they may do something wrong to him though alabbas was not Muslim at the time so some narrations say met with them and heard what they had to say they told him o prophet of Allah we would like to give you our Pledge of Allegiance and this was called the second pledge of allegiance of Allah and he took the oath from them that they should protect him and then they should support him and that they should comply with the instructions and Orders of Islam they accepted this and they wanted to give him the Pledge of Allegiance when Assad who was working real hard to call all of them to Islam stopped them and said o people watch out we left Medina with one purpose and cause we definitely know that he is the messenger of Allah but now before we give him the Pledge of Allegiance you have to think twice if you give him the Pledge of Allegiance this means that you are putting yourself and your families in danger because all of Arabia will be against you so think twice they did not they immediately told him Assad stay away from us let us take the Pledge of Allegiance from the prophet salallahu because we know that we are on the right track Assad was not in doubt but he wanted them to be sure once they gave the pledge of allegiance that there's no going back and the minute this took place the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam told them that insha Allah if you fulfill what you have promised then Allah will reward you with Jannah with paradise and this is all what they wanted so they came to the prophet that Islam again and said o prophet of Allah assuming that Allah azzawajal Grant you give Victory and we know he will grant you victory we have treaties and we have allies from the Jews now once you come to Medina we're going to separate all these treaties and cancel them and we will detach ourselves from our allies the Jews so once we do this we will be on our own it's just a simple question would it be possible that if Allah Grant you Victory and people all accept your call would it be possible that you will leave us and go back to your hometown you go back to Makkah to the prophet sallam smiled and say never ever I will always be with you till the day I die it is the life that I lead in Medina that I will also conclude it in Medina and this would happen this is exactly what happened the prophet salallahu after migration he had the chance to stay in Makkah when Makkah was conquered on the which year was that uh it was not the ninth it was it it was on the 8th of Hijra the prophet sallallahu on that night on that on that year he could have stayed in Mecca and that was the concern of some of the ansar the people of Medina when he conquered Makkah they said the prophet saws will forget you because now he has his City he has his people and relatives he will not come back to Medina and once the prophet saws heard this he comforted them and told them no I will come to Medina this is my hometown which is Medina so the prophet comforted them and told them that he will stay in Medina and will not leave them at all the minute this meeting concluded described this and said Say by saying I'm looking at their faces and I can't see anyone that I know which means that they were all young in age they were the youth and not the elderly and again this is one of the things that we should always concentrate on is that Islam is greatly accepted by the youth and not by the elderly because old people are born and raised on the customs and the Traditions that they find it difficult for them to abandon and leave and that is why Abu Talib did not accept Islam while the youngsters are in the mood of change they would like to accept anything that they are convinced with and they are strong and their belief the minute they believe in something they go all the way to back it up and that is exactly what happened with these ansar those who came from the Medina they went back to the tents but the pagans heard about this attempt there are narrations that Satan himself went to the pagans and shouted to them haven't you heard what happened with Muhammad and those who came from Medina so the following day in the morning the dignitaries of Mecca went to the tents of the people coming from from Medina and they spoke with the leaders the first generation have you met Muhammad has he proposed to you did you accept his proposal and the leaders who did not attend last night's meeting swore by Allah that nothing of this happened and that they did not meet anyone and this was truth because they did not meet the prophet it was the second generation who met the prophet Allah I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program so until we meet next time insha Allah I say hmm mm-hmm"
