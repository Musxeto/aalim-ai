  "transcript": "Sayyida from the Netherlands Assalamu Alaikum Salamu Alaikum I have a question. In Ramadan, can we eat and pray 30 minutes after Adhan? Are you referring to Maghreb? Yes So, the answer is, it is permissible to pray after you finish eating. Because the Hadith stated that whenever supper is served and Isha is called for, begin with your supper and then go pray Isha. So, and also the Prophet said, Alayhis Salatu Wassalam, there is no prayer perfect in the presence of food. And a person who fasted for 16 or 18 or maybe more hours, when the food is served, his mind is totally focused on the food, not on the prayer. So, there is no problem in eating, and that would probably take maybe 10, 15, maximum 20 minutes, maximum. Unless you want to chit-chat and have a good time and drink coffee and tea afterwards and some halawa or bastila or the likes, no, well, hold your horses. The prayer time is very short of Maghreb. Sometimes it's 50 minutes, sometimes it's an hour after sunset. So, if it is between 20 to 30 minutes, this is fine, but one should not exaggerate. Yet, one has to eat and fulfill his need, so that when he prays, he is not distracted and Allah knows best. For more information visit www.osho.com"
