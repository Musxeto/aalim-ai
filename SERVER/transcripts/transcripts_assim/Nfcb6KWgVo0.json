  "transcript": "thank you I have a little time so and you were in your last session or so you want to set uh to look through a woman okay and I read so many articles and watched videos of you and others saying you have to lower your case you must not look at them okay you know it seems like two years or so two years ago or so I found out about this and since then I just and this caused me into massive crop this was out of the reason it's just some people said to me I should go to um a psychiatrist and information about me was sent to the government because of this you could write a book about this so it got me into massive social trouble because I didn't do it they think I was insane also even though I have extremely good grades and now it also I got humiliated people laugh at me at school now should we now do do this or not because I told other people to do it many of them got to weak I personally I know no muslim whom I can but certainly say okay he does it Eunice what did I tell you uh look through but so many others say I have to look down so why are you coming to me good something else why why are you coming to me if you know my opinion you have two opinions one says lower your gaze don't look even if your teacher speaks to you even the women and living in Germany or in France or places where they're hostile against Muslims you're facing trouble you're facing hostility and you're saying that what should I do the other opinion which I told you for those who are unable to coexist and live you should not look eye to eye you should look through them as if they do not exist and don't focus on the person in front of you but they cannot say that you're not looking at them because you are looking at them but you're looking through them so I gave you the solution you insisted on taking the other people's opinion what should I do why are you coming back to me so actually it's a no-brainer living in the west when it's hostile against Muslims and you do have to encounter and interact with females Islam tells you to lower from your gaze not all of it because if you want to lower your gaze you're gonna hit the Lamppost or you're going to have an accident if you're going into the mall you're gonna trip and fall on your face if not bump into women because sorry I didn't see you I was lowering my gaze this is hardship that Islam tells you not to put yourself into you have the right to have the first gaze which does not mean that you're concentrating and looking and getting closer and your photographic memory knows exactly how the woman is shaped no it's a random look so there's a woman I just look at somewhere else that's it but if I have to encounter my professors my teachers my uh maybe someone I'm dealing in business with I have to look but again I don't look them straight in the eyes and smile and flirt and try to crack jokes so that there would be some chemistry and then my place or yours no this is not acceptable look through them so I told you how to make life easy you insist on taking the other opinion again why are you coming to me Knows Best"
