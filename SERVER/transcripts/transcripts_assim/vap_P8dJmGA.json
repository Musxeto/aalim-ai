  "transcript": "Suleiha from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah My sister is single parent and does not care about her children. She is going abroad for work so I decided to take care of children. My husband does not have any problem with that but he does not want to leave with them so he said that you take a house for rent, leave there with children and when they will be asleep or at school then come to our home. So this is permissible. Jazak Allah Khairan. Wa Jazakum. This is not an ideal situation. It is like being a carpenter while your door is broken. Instead of fixing people's doors, start with your own door as a carpenter. Now taking care of your nephews and nieces is a good deed at the sight of Allah but wasting your own family and neglecting your own husband's rights and your children if you have children that is totally illogical. May Allah Azza wa Jal reward your husband for being so tolerant and kind but this is not ideal. He may accept this one month, five months, then he would definitely consider getting married again to someone who would take care of him. Maybe he's so kind and good-hearted person that he's unable to voice his concerns and frustration of the situation but this does not mean that you turn a blind eye to what you're doing. You have to evaluate the situation. If their mother doesn't care for them or about them, you shouldn't be more concerned than their own mother. Focus and prioritize your tasks and if you have enough time you may devote that for them and Allah knows best."
