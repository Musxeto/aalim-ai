  "transcript": "Hyder Ali says can a man sign a pre-nuptial and a prenup with the wife before marriage stating that they will both hold only their own possessions in case of a divorce this is not found in the Muslim country this is found in the kafir country when a man marries a woman and after 10 years they get divorced she takes half of the estate half of his car's half of his wealth why is that they said she shared with this is nonsense in Islam there is nothing as such so if you are in the West and you're getting married there is no problem at all in signing such a prenup so that you would avoid the possibility of someone taking your wealth unfairly and there's nothing wrong in that insha Allah"
