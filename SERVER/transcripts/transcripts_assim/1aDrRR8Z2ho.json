  "transcript": "a brother in the west works for an airline he usually has to sell and book flights for people so there are times when those people are women traveling alone sometimes he's assisting women with traveling alone when he helps them to book their seat assignment or baggage most of these women are usually non-muslim since in islam it is haram for women to travel alone my friend is wondering is his income halal jazakallah hiranshi zak the nature of the job is to sell tickets the nature of the job is to provide a service how people avail this service is not my downfall it's not my responsibility i'm not ordered in islam to investigate when a woman comes books a first class ticket from los angeles to new york that i say um are you traveling alone by any chance it's not my job to check whether she's married or not whether she's going to meet a boyfriend or a cousin or this is none of my business i'm providing a service likewise when somebody comes to my shop and buys a bottle of water or even worse buys ice cubes i wouldn't dare and ask what are gonna use the ice cubes for whiskey on the rocks and then i refrain from selling it no you just sell this is halal products it's like selling a knife if someone slaughters some someone with it it's they're not gonna sue me because this knife is used to cut meat did cut bread to use in eating and cooking and if he went out of his way this is his problem so his income is halal"
