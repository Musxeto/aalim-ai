  "transcript": "Arabi from Bangladesh and it's great that check your website started to working I asked questions there too Sheikh my question is um is it permissible to watch motivational seminars which contains free mixing sometimes the cameraman shows the woman and if not can we hear the seminars if sometimes the woman's voice comes like the shout or sometimes the talk can we watch this kind of videos just audios or the videos okay first of all it is permissible to watch motivational seminars or lectures that we may benefit from them in this life or in the Hereafter whether the presenter is a Muslim or a cafe there's no problem in that now if this seminar or lecture is presented by a male then you have no problem even if the camera goes every now and then to the audience and shows random uh footage of women because this is unintended so what you do is the same what you do outside in the streets or in a mall when a woman comes in front of you what do you do you stop going to the mall no you lower your gaze you look through you go somewhere else no problem and if the speaker is a female it is not permissible for you to watch even if she is giving an Islamic lecture and nowadays this is the trend mashallah some sisters come on videos and in in conferences and they deliver lectures to men and the men listen eagerly masha'allah with all due respect there are no men to lecture you only this sister oh she has something other Scholars male Scholars don't have I bet you of course she does but islamically this is not permissible men should listen to men now women can listen to men and attend lectures of men because this was the norm at the time of the Prophet Islam and the fitna of men over women is far less than the fitna of women over men so this is not permissible for you to watch motivational seminars or lectures of the opposite of of women random laughs or sounds again this is not intended you can ignore that and move on insha Allah"
