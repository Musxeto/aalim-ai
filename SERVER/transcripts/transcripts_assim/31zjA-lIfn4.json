  "transcript": "[Music] pillars of marriage what is meant by pillars of marriage every thing in islam has pillars has conditions has mandatory things has voluntary things so scholars segregate scholars classify things in order to make things more easy to uh they want you to open the door yes yes yes so marriage as anything else as everything else has what is the first pillar the existence of what of the man and woman is it a pillar how can you have marriage a brother comes to me and says i need you to make a marriage contract okay bismillah where is the wife doesn't exist but make one you have to have both man and woman if someone comes and says i'd like to marry sister uh khadijah said masha allah okay where is she she died two years ago you have to exist they have to be there then the second pillar is the existence of the offer proposal from the guardian we always mix things up we always think that i as a man propose my uncle can you give me your daughter in marriage he says yes the islamic way is the opposite the one who proposes is the guardian so he says my son i give you my daughter in marriage and the man says i accept her marriage and that is why it's a big issue in the books of they say that it has to be initiated by the guardian and it has to be initiated as told to you yesterday with two words only here the the man making the contract does he have you say these words in arabic or do you say it in your language raise your hand okay and your language five and the rest are not married or they forgot or it's a nightmare don't remind me don't remind me no you have to remember you have to okay probably it's a different school of thought however the majority say you have to have this initiated in this fashion the offer proposal has to be from the guardian which is called ejab in arabic so it's hijab it's always like this hijab and kabul acceptance is from the groom i used to always consider a groom due to my english which is very bad i used to always say broom so the broom has to he has actually a broom he becomes at the end of the marriage a broom his wife sweeps the floor with him anyhow alhamdulillah the acceptance has to be from the groom now the majority of schools of thought say it has to be like this to the extent that they say if it was not said in this way your marriage is void you have to repeat the marriage again yeah and by the way this is not the only thing that requires hijab and kabul what also requires hijab and kabul transactions so if i go to the market and the man says i tell him how much is this he says one real so he said uh and he said i'll sell it to you i he has to say the hijab i what does hijab means no yes good in arabic jawab means answer ijab means to obligate from wajib from so what do you mean when i say i sell you this is hijab i'm making it mandatory if you accept khalas it becomes mandatory so i say to him i sell you this for one real and he says i accept or i buy or okay palace it's done and this in transaction as stated before it's a world of tongue islam it's sufficient for me to sell my car to mts without having the car with me without him giving me the money if i say to him i sell you my car for a million rupees because he might say yes so then if i tell him 10 000 rupees he said yes and so he says i accept transaction is done call us three days later he said tell you what i've i changed my mind he cannot change his mind as long as we have departed i went out and he went out transaction is finished he said he i didn't receive any car your problem you want to take the car take it now take it tomorrow the transaction has been done finalized likewise in marriage now the majority say it has to be in this format however sheikh islam even [Music] say that this is not authentic it happens the transaction the marriage with whatever people agree upon so as long as it is acceptable and there is the consent it happens so if i go and someone says sell me this for one real and i say i accept now the ijab took place from the one buying and transaction is correct if the man says to me uncle give me your daughter in marriage and i say i accept it's okay it takes place but just to be safe it should be the other way around you should always make it from the guardian and the acceptance is from the groom among the conditions is that they must be free from obstacles that prevent them from marrying such as being and uh okay existence okay now there are conditions these are not the pillars pillars we threw off what is meant by conditions a condition is something that is required in a contract in a form of worship if it is not present then the contract is void but if it is present the contract may happen and may it may not happen meaning i'll give you an example of conditions of prayer one of the conditions of prayer evolution so if i say allah i did not perform wudu is my prayer valid no if i go and perform wudu do i have to pray no i may pray and i may not so in arabic they say that the definition of adam which means that a condition is what if not found then this means nothing is found if wudu is not there then prayer is not there it's not accepted but when found that does not mean something has to be found or not the possibility is there let's see one of the conditions of marriage is that the absence of obstacles so obstacles such as being mahram one of the conditions i cannot marry my sister i cannot marry my aunt i cannot marry my daughter-in-law my mother-in-law so we have a number of mahrams seven from uh your blood and seven or so from marriage as mentioned in surat anur so one of the obstacles is being a mahram and how is it possible to be a mahram either through being married to or from or being a blood relative or from suckling if i have a sister if i have a woman that her and i were suckled by xyz a woman when we were be below two years of age so now we're we're what we're brother and sister this is one of the uh obstacles that prevent me from getting married among the obstacles is that i marry a woman in her edda how is that a woman was widowed and two months after her husband died i propose to her she accepts i get married what's the ruling of this marriage it's void because it there is a clear obstacle which is that she is in her edda anything else i think this is inshallah clear any any questions about regarding this condition okay i'll try to make it as quick as possible today inshallah so that we have we tried to finish early and at the same time i believe we have a very long list of questions backlog so even if we devote large time to answering it maybe inshallah it would be beneficial the second condition is that we must identify the people getting married specifying the man and the woman with a description that makes it clear to the witnesses so if a man comes and says sheikh i'd like to marry your daughter and i say i accept or i tell them i give you my daughter in marriage and he said accept and in the wedding night he doesn't know which daughter and i bring him any of my daughters for example is this acceptable no there has to be a specific person or a specific description so i tell him if i have two daughters i give you my youngest daughter in marriage no problem because this is a description that you cannot say no youngest this is the youngest i have youngest and oldest i don't have a third one they have only two so one and two it has to be specified and it has to be pointed out so that the witnesses if they were called into court and they say did you witness the marriage yes who got married i don't know who's the father of the girl this is the father of the girl girl how many girls does he have did you see her no do you know her name no this is not allowed this is a condition that she is to be specified why so that there is no confusion happening even when you buy and sell there are three types of because this is all contracts there are three types of or three reasons that a lot of transactions are haram they're based on either or these are the three reasons main reasons that any transaction would be haram what do we mean by riba interest we don't have to go into this meaning that there is a margin of error of confusion so if i tell you this is christian by the way very expensive i sell you what's in my wallet for five rupees how many would say i'll buy everybody now is this permissible in islam no because i can open it and there is nothing in it and i can open it and there's a hundred thousand rupees in it this is haram this is likewise if i have a cow and i'm in a country other than india where i can sell cows you can say kaoji okay hamdulillah so i have a cow and the cow is pregnant and i tell you i'll tell you what's in that cow's womb for 100 for 400 rupees permissible no why you don't know if it's a twin if it's alive if it's healthy you don't know what what the outcome and even if i am happy with the hundred rupees once it gives birth to a healthy little cow how would i feel devastated because if i waited i could have sold it for a hundred thousand maybe or less or more in marriage it's the same thing you go and you propose and they accept but you don't know which one you're marrying there is one that is beautiful and there is one that is blind and there is one that is insane so what will you have this is unknown to you and that is why it is haram for you to cons to go through such a marriage without a description one of the conditions that is required the acceptance so if one of them did not accept the marriage contract is okay providing they approve what do we mean by acceptance that the boy accepts the marriage sometimes you go and work in canada or in america you come back home for vacation and the father says alhamdulillah i got you married last year to so-and-so what what kind of a a gift is this is your wife take her no i did not give you the power of attorney and i don't accept her marriage the marriage then is void likewise it happens with the girls a lot so the father says to his to his daughter i gave you in marriage to our neighbor so-and-so can the father do this no the approval of the girl is essential and that is why the prophet salaam said that the virgin is to be ordered and the non-virgin is to be requested and asked and the compa and the companions asked more and the prophet said the diversion acceptance is when she does not comment and scholars say that the majority of virgins and young girls when their father say wallahi so and so proposed to marry you so what do you think usually a virgin who's young and shy and bashful would look down and smile nowadays how much does he earn how does he look no i have to know does he have a car does he play sports does he enjoy traveling i enjoy i want one a lot of the virgins are like this nowadays they're so outcoming they ask questions that make the father blush i don't know i can't answer these questions the prophet was talking about the norm where such girls are usually bashful and shy and they don't comment so that is why scholars say their acceptance is by not saying anything this is approval but if she starts to to cry she doesn't say anything and she cries and cries and cries is this acceptance no the scholars say you have to look if some there's something wrong in what she's doing then definitely i will not pressure her but she has to approve of it and that is why at the time of the prophet a woman came to the prophet and said o prophet of allah my father gave me in marriage to his cousin or to his nephew to his nephew so that he would elevate any humiliation because he's his nephew his blood and no one is giving him in marriage so he forced me to marry him the prophet said allah he has no right to do that and you can if you wish reject the marriage it's void to that extent the woman said no i accept the marriage or prophet of allah but i wanted my sisters to know their rights this is your right now the girls so many times i've mentioned this yesterday and i mentioned it today again so many times they are forced if the father does not fear allah azzawajal he insists and he's angry in me shout and he may beat her you have to marry this one ah man i've committed myself and i will not accept uh no for an answer you have to you make a must and she says i'm forced no you're not forced don't destroy your life do not obey your father but this is a form of worship i'm getting closer to allah if i if i uh obey my father not in this if your father tells you sweep the floor sweep the floor a form of worship if he tells you do the dishes do the dishes if he tells you don't go to school do not go to school you have to obey him if he tells you marry someone you do not want do not marry him you will be destroying your life now this is a very sensitive question who among the sisters now is married against their will masha allah that's good or they're lying but inshallah no nowadays alhamdulillah people are more educated they have more fear of allah it's very rare it may be found in saudi arabia in villages in tribes that live in the desert where would the girl go no other alternative but nowadays alhamdulillah people are more educated they fear allah more so alhamdulillah however this does not mean all forced marriages are bad because even if she was forced the father knows what's best for her and after a year or two she says it's like allah her father for such a man this happens the same happened with aisha she was married to the prophet when she was alas 60 years of age and the marriage was consummated when she was nine did she complain she was blessed with such a marriage because it was the right choice now i had a point in my mind i wanted to elaborate on but among the conditions to have two witnesses or more and the majority of schools of thought they say two two witnesses or more but sheikh al-islam even says that the two con the two witnesses are not enough and what is supposed to take place is the declaration because if i get married to a woman and i bring my cousin and my second cousin to be witnesses and no one else knows is this appropriate or accepted no the prophet ordered the companions to announce the marriage with what is this duff with a duff which is a a musical instrument and all musical instruments in islam are forbidden with the exception of duff in three situations marriage read and recep receiving someone of dignitary of high status in islam we receive them so not my brother who studies in america he came i play the duff no he has to be someone of importance in islam like a king like a scholar like etc but not any tom dick or harry so the issue of two witnesses is not intended that what is intended is to declare now someone may ask okay sheikh i have one wife and if i marry a second wife she will kill me or she will make my life hell so what is the ruling if i go and marry someone and her family know and i declare it in her family but my part of the family don't know anything about it and i live like this is this marriage correct come on don't be chickens is this marriage correct yes the declaration is done when i say declaration i don't have to go to russia and say alhamdulillah i got married i declare it to a group of people and they know but is it advisable no i have friends a lot and every three or four years i discover that they've been married for five years i don't know except after four or five years and when they announce it it would be very late it would be too late because the harm has been done his first wife is seeking divorce why it's not the marriage she says it's the betrayal five years i don't know about him getting being married and now he tells me therefore if you want to get married put everything on the table regardless of the consequences in arabia we have another area in syria and and elsewhere they have customs you know the the the old jahilia way of thinking they say that the groom on the wedding night he brings a kitten and he holds the head of the kitten and the body of the kitten and splits it in front of the wife so that she knows who the man is one of the friends he said i did this and she took the kitten and she did this in front of me and since then alhamdulillah we have no no problems so no okay if you want to do it some of the brothers and i'm not advocating marrying a second wife but i'm not opposing it at all it's not it is not a delicacy it is not something accessories that you buy and put in the it is a hell of responsibility i know and when people ask me what do you think it's the five minutes at the end of the night it's five nights it's too long it is not it comes with finance it comes with care it comes with love it comes with fairness it comes with children and it is a lot of headaches so if you have the patient's intolerance do it and the money sorry money is very important if you don't well be pleased and satisfied with what you have because it is not something uh easy so i'm not the advocating and i'm not defending i'm not stopping a lot of the brothers as the sisters call and tell me they say my husband in the morning in the afternoon and before we go to bed he tells me i'm going to get married i'm going to get married and this has been going for the past 10 years and nothing happened the prophet says allah has decreed that you make a son on everything for either so if you slaughter an animal make it quick will you hid the ahadukum shafrata and you should sharpen your blade and you should comfort your sacrifice now this is in in regard to what to sacrificing if you want to get married do the same don't kill your wife every single night i'm going to get married i'm going to get married she has to be beautiful she has to be thin she has to look nice she has to do this everything that is not in your wife you're saying to her no haram this is haram and unacceptable you will not ever agree to your son-in-law to do this with your daughter or to your brother-in-law to do this with your sister so likewise do not do it if you have to do it plan it do it in your head once it's going to be done next week tell her i love you i do love you but i have to get married this is allah's right to me and no one is asking why are you getting married no one is supposed to why is your wife ugly not even business this is personal does she have any problems health problems why does do i have just to justify myself when i get married in my invitation card i say i'm getting married with my second wife my first wife have have has the following one two three four five just so that you can come no so but i know most of you inshallah we will not do this but just in case you you think of doing it it is not an easy thing and if you want to do it don't torture your wife conditions the acceptance of her guardian now if she accepts but the guardian does not accept the marriage does not take place in england or in english they say it takes two to tango of course time going is haram except between a man and his wife on nasheed without any duff you can do this but you cannot dance on music music is haram you cannot dance with someone else and you cannot do this so if a man proposes to a girl she accepts the father refuses marriage is is not void it should be stopped the opposite the guardian approves the girl refuses it should be stopped it cannot be forced they both have to agree there are circumstances that can be overridden in regards of the approval of the guardian when is that if he performs what is known as to refuse without any justification or without any legitimate justification there is so if a father refuses his daughter to get married to a man because he wants her to work and to support him this is adult if he refuses a man though is he he is from the same culture from the same sect but because his beard is long and a lot of marriages were postponed or cancelled because of this and the sisters write to me then again yes this is adult and a woman has the right to go against her father if the man is god fearing is good and if her father is continuously refusing but i got an email a few months back from a girl who's 17 years old and she says that and she started her mayhem like saying i would like to go and complain about my father to the kadhi because he's refusing my marriage to this man and she describes the man she's from india and he's from pakistan i believe this is a big problem here so she says i'm going to complain to the to the khadi because he's a different sect he's from pakistan my father is refusing to give me in marriage to him does she have the right no why she's young she's 17 and this is the first man to propose when would the father be doing adult when five come or ten come he's whistling from me okay so if if this is what's happening if he stopped or rejected five or ten people yes but if it's the first one or the second one and legitimate reasons he's afraid that if he gives his daughter to for marriage maybe he will go back to his country and then they would abuse her because she is from that country or from that country by the way the the email came from england and they originally are from and the boys originally from but they live in england they're british yet they still have this jahilia in them if it's a country and a country it's understandable but if you're in the same country and you've been living there and you'll still live there for the rest of your life this is unacceptable so the guardian has to accept and approve the person proposing however not anyone can fit the description of guardian there is a list of conditions for a person to be a guardian for example he has to be seen so if your guardian is insane if your father is 120 years old and he doesn't know the directions he doesn't know who you are sometimes you know with these diseases alzheimer and and etc may allah protect us all and our parents and our loved ones if some of them some of my friends call and say my father has reached this age i come to the room and i say my father everything is fine he said who are you and i say i'm your son what's your name he doesn't know so can this one given marriage no he does not have his sanity also he has to reach the age of puberty a woman came and says sheikh i have no guardian i'm a muslim revert my parents are kafir and the only muslim in my family is my seven years old boy can he become my wali the answer is no can he become her mahram in travelling no he did not reach the age of puberty a lot of the sisters ask the same question i have my brother he's 13 years old i'd like to travel with him from here to mumbai is it possible is it permissible one of the sisters asked me a question on my facebook i think three days ago saying that she lives four hours away from chennai and she would like to come and attend the course but she does not have a mahram her brother will take her to the train station and someone else would receive her in here is this permissible and i said yes if it's my course it's okay no it's not it is not permissible for a woman to travel without a mahram this is the fatwa from the prophets not from my pocket salam he is the prophet is the one who gave this fatwa so the age of puberty is important you cannot travel with a eight or nine years old child but he would or she would be something to break this seclusion so if i want to go into a taxi she says and i have my nine-year-old child with me is this okay or am i being alone with the taxi driver the answer is it is okay though he or she did not reach age of puberty but they are sensible they can hear and listen and they can understand if anything fishy is taking place so that yes they break the seclusion sisters are not liking this anyhow freedom he has to be free nowadays everybody is alhamdulillah free but before it was a possibility that the guardian is a slave and his daughter is free so in marriage can he become her guardian the majority of scholars say no and some scholars say yes because if he is sane and caring the decision might be his because he would care for his daughter and he would only accept those who are good for her but the majority of scholars say no he does not have the right to make decisions for himself does a slave have rights to make decisions for himself no can a a a slave buy and sell for himself make trade no because he belongs to his master so i am the master he wants to go for hajj he doesn't have any hajj if he was freed he has to make his hajj for islam as a free man but as a slave he has no hajj no jummah sit so i sell him and i buy him he's my slave also he has to reach the state of what is this he has to be wise and mature in arabic it's called rust he has to reach the stage of rust does anyone have the name of rashid here rashid means wise and mature and this is a condition required in most forms of transactions and also in the form of worships what is meant by uh mature and wise is being able to select and choose the right thing that is why if a man does not have this in him his transactions are void if a man is not mature and wise we all know that he spends unwisely and he wants to go and buy something scholars say that the contract is void and he's called safi he spends without any recognition without any thinking and likewise in getting a lot of men are like this unfortunately someone talks to him he meets him in a restaurant and he says sheikh give me your daughter in my it's yours do you know the man no do you know his name what he does no how do you accept says i'm a man he requested something i give it to him this means that he is not mature in that wise that's why he cannot give that in marriage he has to be male male as in m-a-l-e not in m a i l someone says no male male means that if a woman is separated from her husband and this happens a lot a woman is divorced since twenty years she raised her only girl and she loves her more than her life and and someone proposes to the girl so the girl the woman refuses to take the approval of the father they've been separated for 20 years the girl herself does not care about her father he didn't ask for her for 20 years and the mother says i will be responsible for the marriage processions i am the guardian i will give my acceptance is this permissible the guardian has to be male and he has to be from the same religion so river sister who embraced islam and accepted it alhamdulillah a brother proposes so we say okay stop here we will have to go and seek the approval of the guardian she says my father is hindu okay your grandfather do you have any brothers see i see one christian one jew what is this any muslim relative of yours she says no no muslim relatives does she seek the approval and consent of her father a lot of the river sisters live with their fathers they live with their families and their families are very good to her when it comes to marriage she says i cannot get married until my father approves of it you have no right to do this your father has no right on you at all because he is not muslim so how what what could i do you go to the muslim judge in your community the muslim judge he becomes your guardian and he says that this man is usable or not sheikh we live in america we don't have any muslim judge what to do go to the islamic center the biggest islamic center that is respected and go to the imam and the imam assumes the position of your guardianship the prophet says the sultan the ruler is the guardian to those who do not have guardians in our courts here hanafi school of thought we come and say we don't have a guardian and the judge say you are your own guardian so can i marry myself the answer is the prophet says there is no marriage valid without a wedding so you have to tap shaykh okay let me ask this question sisters who married without a wali no no don't be shy masha'allah they're all suffering okay i know that there are because i get a lot of emails what to do if a woman married without a wedding if she believes that this is acceptable to her madhhab and the mother of her husband and they believe and follow this school of thought and not to beat round the bush some scholars say that the marriage is correct however it is extremely important to just theoretically make it again by the husband who has been married for 20 years going to her guardian her father her brother and telling him give me your sister or your daughter in marriage and he says okay two witnesses are there khalas just to be on the safe side but if one wants to initiate it no the marriage is void this is unacceptable because the prophet saws words come in front come ahead of any school of thought as muslims one of the most controversial conditions is that he is trustworthy and what is meant by trustworthy in arabic it's called ada he has to be trustworthy if you go to the books of 200 or 300 years ago you will find that none of us is considered to be trustworthy imagine one of the things that makes a person a person not trustworthy is to eat a sandwich in the street 400 years ago it used to be considered part of the things that a person's testimony would be rejected if you eat a sandwich in the street why because this is unworthy of someone trustworthy this is something that only low people do nowadays can we apply this condition mcdonald's will sue us kfc will kill us and everybody is eating in the street so nowadays it's okay five six hundred years ago to be like this would not be acceptable you have to wear a cap you have to wear a turban nowadays it has nothing to relate to islam because the prophet did not do it actually he did not instruct us to do it so why should i cover my head i'm not a woman i don't i can go this like this in public and nowadays the scholars say part of being trustworthy is to abide by the islamic law in your appearance because this is how i judge you do i know what you do when you go into your house and close your doors no so how can i classify you as being trustworthy or not by your appearance so if someone is shaved they say he's not trustworthy why because this is a clear disobedience to the prophet saslam if someone smokes he's not trustworthy if someone works in a bank he's not trustworthy says if you apply this nowadays none of us can be trustworthy and he said then then this condition is not acceptable because a lot of the time shaving the beard has nothing to do with my love to my daughter this is a sin by itself but i have great love to my daughter and hence i would only choose the best for her so shaykh and this is the most authentic says that this cannot be measured precisely so a person who smokes a person who shaves his beard a person who has sins that appear on his uh exterior does not affect his choice to his daughter and hence they consider it not to be as specific i can propose to a girl and her father is working in a bank interest-based and i would not say excuse me uncle please can you ask your son to come you're not trustworthy or uncle please stop smoking and then i can propose to you or uncle no as long as he cares for his daughter and he chooses the right thing for her then alhamdulillah now we move on to [Music] the rights of the wife how much time we have an hour okay the the trick here is marriage you have to understand this huh marriage is built on two pillars these are my pillars not marriage pillars one to recognize your responsibilities and obligations to to know your rights now the gents and the ladies they all know their rights and this is all what they know they never think of their obligations they never think of their responsibilities so this is devoted to who gents or ladies no no no this is devoted to the gents now this is the rights of your wife you have to know them you have to fulfill them you have to honor them and some of them are found in the characteristics of a husband so you will find some duplication but now this is what you have to put as a compass in front of you when you want to treat your wife learn your obligations one protect her from hellfire this is your number one priority how to do that gents how do you do that teacher islam good more they don't know how to protect her from hellfire because they're you know scanning all the things they want is no this takes her to hell this takes her to help this thing what can i do the first thing to protect her from hellfire is to take her out from my father's house where she sits and mixes with my brothers this takes her to help directly non-stop flight i don't want this so i'm not going to tell this to the sheikh the second one she has to cover but if she covers then how will she live with my brothers and my mother will be angry and whenever she puts the hijab my mother says always take the hijab they're like your brothers this takes her to help me she come on what's what else uh she works with in a mixed environment with men she has friends and this is a very quick way to help come forget this i don't want her to pray fajr because if he pray praise fajr on time she's going to wake me up and then i will not be able to go to sleep after fajr and i have to work at nine o'clock yeah okay everything is in your life is taking her to hell can we change this well i can't sorry i cannot with the price you're paying me maybe okay you have to come up you have to come up with ways to protect your wife from hell are you doing this does allah tell us to protect them from hell what is the ayah the sisters know it more than the brothers from hellfire this is instruction of allah mentioned twice in the quran so you have to protect her from hellfire and this is done by a number of things a number of ways the best is teaching her but there is the second best which is a must is implementing it in my wife i could teach her islam from a to z but if i don't practice i am the first one to be thrown into hell she'll follow she's saying she's adult she has her own intellect so allah says in the quran and instruct your family to pray and you have be patient you have to be patient and tolerant so as a husband it is your duty so many times you see men with their wives and they're not covered properly why don't you ash i told her so many times she refuses no it's not khalas you will not leave until you cover you will not leave home until you cover you not go out until you cover you have to do this are you crazy i told her this and she said who'll stop me and i was afraid and she left you have to be a man ahi you have to be a man in order to have a happy marital life this is the norm huh this is the norm as an 80 years old englishman was interviewed after having more than 55 years of happy marriage he was asked what's the secret of your marriage you know english men are very cold and you know mashallah they speak in a very nice way he said it all started in our honeymoon we went to cyprus and we had a tour where we had to climb up the mountain so we rented two mules and my wife's mule was very stubborn so it didn't move my wife looked to him in the eyes and said one and we went up in the way in the middle of the way there was a very short passage the mule was reluctant because it was afraid so my wife got off him looked him in the eyes and said two and while we were coming climbing up he made strange noises and started to do bad things she came out and shot him in the head and i was outraged it cost money and this is an animal so i told my wife why did you do this she looked me in the eyes and she said one and he said i never repeated that again for 55 years they have been living happy now who's the man this is a very big problem you have to protect your wife from hellfire even if she counts up to three it's your responsibility so it is not an excuse i told her not to do this and she did it no you have to show how a man and a strong leader you are now if you're not then your marriage has to have marriage counseling you have to sit with a sheikh or a brother and your wife sit together and speak and try to solve this problem because marriage cannot go on like this the second okay the eye is is there okay secondly one of your wives right over you is that you provide for her and you give her her allowance you give her food you give her shelter you give her clothes you cannot simply marry and have an easy ride she's rich her father is rich her mother should give her money her relatives should give her this and that no this is own the attitude of a leech you know leeches it's an insect that clinches to your body and sucks your money this is the husband if you have a husband like this always instead of saying oh honey say olich to him because a man does not tolerate this allah explains this in the quran clearly men are the protectors and maintainers of women because why does a man have the kiwam over women allah mentions the two reasons one because allah has made one of them to excel the other who is to excel man now sisters say no we're equal no you're not equal yes we have equality in islam we do not have equality in islam my wife said we have equality in islam i said the only way i see equality in islam is that next year i become pregnant this is there's no equality in islam there is fairness and there is justice but there is no equality if i say that a woman should work and i will sit home this is equality she said yes this is equality i said no this is unfair what is fair that they use at home and i work so this is fairness and justice and allah says and males are not unlike females so allah excelled man over women this is a fact at the side of allah in jannah this is different because your deeds are different than our deeds like but in this life no one would say that a woman is better than a man in general men are better than women now there can be a woman who is equal to a thousand men like aisha for example may i'll be pleased with her there are a lot of women who are much far wiser than their husbands their sons their fathers but in general terminology generally speaking men are better than women that's why men lead the prayer that's why men lead countries that's why men have double the inheritance of girls when they are brothers and sisters sometimes no the women have more but i'm talking in the offspring so that they would assume their responsibilities they excel the other and because they spend to support them from their means so if a man does not pay if a man does not support his family some scholars say that he does not deserve to be obeyed because he is not the guardian he is not the protector and he's not the maintainer so how to provide for her what is meant by providing for her sisters food basic needs shelter no providing is now this will come afterwards inshallah this is part of the rights i'm talking about provisions and maintenance so it is financial support and this in totality usually is identified by food shelter and clothings the essentials uh what are the rights of a wife over us he said and this is the answer to a specific question so know your rights but at the same time understand this as limitation of your rights so what are the rights one the prophet says feed her when you feed yourself so i eat you eat i don't eat you don't eat i eat an apple you eat an apple but when i eat an apple don't tell me that you'd like to eat a cow so jani be realistic in what you request feeding okay type clothe her when you clothe yourself so i have to buy uh clothes i'll buy you clothes of course women's clothes are far greater i think than men isn't it yeah we wear those we have five six lobes and that's it you my men hear suits and trousers and blouses and [Music] easier than you okay and you do not say to her may allah make your face ugly and that you do not hit her now this is not part of providing it's part of living and we will come to this inshallah later on so the prophet mentioned four things these are her rights the two the first two is financial the second two or the last uh two points are mental our way of living so you don't abuse and at the same time you don't physically or mentally mentally by saying may allah make your face ugly and then he retracts this and says uglier than this it can't be you are not allowed to say anything about your physical about your wife's physical appearance that hurts her feelings and you may not also hit her but hitting her has conditions and we will come to inshallah hitting the women not coming and come to hit them but we will mention inshallah when it is permissible and when it is not and i believe i think it's in the next slide any questions regarding this comments bye it goes without saying that it is charity to put food on the table no matter what you spend on your family you will be rewarded even for the morsel of food you put in your mouth and your wife's mouth our religion is great if we understand it if you have the good intention everything you do is for the sake of allah and you're rewarded if i drink coffee so that i would clear my throat and be able to speak loudly loudly and people would understand me this is my intention when i'm drinking coffee i'm getting reward if the brother making the coffee now i see the brother is going out if the brother making the coffee makes it with this intention he is subhan allah rewarded and that is why intention is extremely important in our religion the prophet says an arrow you know an arrow three enters jannah because of the arrow the one who makes it so he's in the factory you know sharpening it making an arrow straight he's in the factory he's in his hometown he's not at war the one who handles it to the archer his job is collect giving the ammunition and the third one is the archer himself three enters the jannah so imagine when you cook food to your husband though he does not deserve it though he's ugly he never showers and his mouth smells but i'm doing it for the sake of allah azzawajal when you do this wallahi or two or three hours in the kitchen is all for the sake of allah and you reward it for every minute but when you do it because you're forced why do you cook my mother-in-law will start nagging and complaining i just don't want to listen to her voice you're not doing it for the sake of allah you don't have any reward for that one of the most important financial rights of the wife is to give her the dowry it's not in the arabic i don't know you put it okay it's not in the arabic so probably i did this because i had a question in uk about the dowry again we've spoke about this anyone has any comment on the man instructing to be given so and so and so before the marriage like the jahiliyyah dowry any of the brothers sisters and don't worry and voice your opposition if you don't like this you can say it's not fair all of my brothers got so much money when they got married now when it comes to me because i'm a salafi i'm i have a beard now i don't get any any rupees haram if you have any doubt raise your hands alhamdulillah okay good so this is one of the most important financial rights this is islamic one of the most financial rights of a wife is to have her own separate house like it or don't like it this is your problem i know a lot of you especially in india and pakistan i have tons of emails of complaints check i have to live with my in-laws i'm their servant if one day i wake up and i don't cook my mother-in-law treats me very badly and she complains to my husband and my husband comes and shouts at me this is not your right she has the right of her own house whether you like it or not check i cannot afford it why did you get married seriously why did you take her from her parents house where she was honored and she was respected and brought her to your family's house if you can't afford it you don't need it so what do i do sheikh one of two the first one which is the best option move out even if to a small room and a bathroom it's her own house second option take her approval and consent with pleasure even if you have to kiss her feet beg her please stay my mother is wrong i know you are the queen of my heart you are this and that please stay and tolerate yes spanish there might be a third option which is if you can isolate her in a chamber in the same house of your your father with a separate entrance with a separate kitchen so that she can be completely isolated from the house this is permissible and she has no reason to refuse she cannot refuse because this is her special private quarters i know this doesn't go down well with the gents this is your problem this is islam you have no right and it is completely haram for you to live in the house and your brothers around here well i got an email i can show you emails tons of emails a sister says that i live with my in-laws and my brother-in-law and i'm wearing the hijab this hijab which is accepted in so many countries not to me i say this is the proper hijab but we will not go into this discussion she says i cook with my mother-in-law but my brother-in-law also cooks and he comes to the kitchen with me and my mother-in-law to cook with us and i said to my husband this is not acceptable i'm wearing hijab and he insists on coming he spoke to him so many times and he still comes he stops for a day or two and he still comes not evil so he thinks he wants to help he likes to cook but this is evil and she says what to do what do you think i should tell her jens what do you think i should tell her yeah she has to ask for her rights now i know a lot of i'm not going to ask for who has his wife living with his brothers and in-laws because you will be forced to lie but i know this happens no matter how life difficult how no matter how difficult life is you have to give her her own separate chamber or house or place to live in the hadith said do not hit her do not say may allah make her face ugly so this is only happens with the worst of people no way a proper man would say this no matter how ugly his wife is on the contrary the uglier she is the more respectful he is the uglier she is the more respectful he is because he does not want to if if i if my wife is uh miss universe 2008 she is the most beautiful woman on earth so they say and i say how ugly you are will she be offended she will not say you think i'm ugly 100 million person think otherwise but if she is a little bit or extremely ugly and she is aware of that and i say may allah make your face ugly and this does not come out except from the worst type of men this hurts a lot because she knows and she acknowledges this it is forbidden to beat the wife unless it's the last resort before divorce and demolishing the muslim house before we go to this let's stay a little bit may i sit down for a while i'm getting old okay men gents when uh okay not when do you abuse your wife mentally cursing saying you're not beautiful criticizing all the time raise your hand please okay okay no they're not afraid women cannot see them but they are ashamed we're not afraid of this we are ashamed and this is problematic to be ashamed of the people not to be ashamed of allah azzawajal you have to fear allah you have to know that you are not allowed to mentally abuse your wife either by criticizing how she looks how she smells criticizing her actions in a bad and negative way unfortunately a lot of the husbands a lot of the brothers only see the shortcomings and they always criticize and this is unmanly you have to avoid any criticism and as mentioned yesterday always try to complement always to try to look at the pri bright and positive aspects if you wish to have a happy marriage and happy ending now coming back to physical abuse who among the sisters approve of some time in the marriage in order to protect it a man is entitled to not beat until he breaks her bone or i need to spank to reprimand physically his wife who approves of this raise your hands please one two three four five six seven eight nine ten and everyone is thinking a little bit huh and the rest do not approve of it who disapproves of it okay we have seven so we have 17 sisters only and the rest are passive either they did not understand the question or they understood it but they're afraid to comment on it either negatively or positively men let's see now who approves of resorting to physical reprimanding as mentioned in the quran in order to save the marriage in order to huh as mentioned in the quran yes okay masha allah we have like 20 almost 25 who is against completely in any term in any way hitting the woman you raise your hands twice the first one the second one so in the quran we is mentioned but you still you don't want it okay okay good good now i can say this because i'm not in europe huh i'm not in america if i say this in america they will arrest me unfortunately we say things and we have to be diplomatic but this is online also they can still be arrested no problem this is quran allah says what beat them now if you look at this sequence those who have no islamic background even if they're muslims those who are influenced by the media by equal rights by women are equal to men by this and by that they would say i do not accept this they even go a little bit further and look and dig in the arabic dictionaries to find and to try and find something that does not have the same meaning of barbara meaning to beat so they invent a new word i think someone did this and they said no daraba in the quran does not mean to beat it means to counsel to anything why do we do this because we are under the influence of the west they come to you and say this is not human rights who said who gave human rights who put the human rights individuals this is the creator of the human rights allah azzawajal so he knows who he has created more than anyone else and besides human rights is something yeah and he's so funny we would need a lecture to talk about it so we have animal rights and animal rights are have more rights than the humans look at the syrians they are being tortured besieged killed annihilated completely from the face of the earth what did they do what is happening nothing nothing they will not do anything so where is the human rights where is the human right when you come because of a terrorist attack that thousand and three thousand killed though i believe completely that no terrorists were involved i have two brothers of mine captains airplane captains saudi airlines professional with more than 30 years experience i pray in the masjid where the whole neighborhood are saudi airlines pilots it's the the whole neighborhood was given to them by the king 40 years ago so they built their houses so they're all experienced the pilot of the king one of the most experienced pilots two weeks after 9 11 was praying with me aisha and another senior pilot they were sitting next to me and i said to them do you think that two weeks after 9 11. do you think that this is possible that people from the mountains of torah who can barely speak a word of english who failed in their uh regardless is it possible to be executed they said funny you should ask shikhasam you know simulator a simulator is a machine that looks like the cockpit of an airplane you go inside you lock the door and it moves like an airplane you put the programming of a city and you fly and the turbines the air the rain everything you want you put it in exactly the same they said to we last week or a few days before we went into the cockpit and we put the programming for new york city and we flew at the same time in the same environment sun you know all the skyscrapers and moving around and we're targeting the twin towers he said the first time i missed i went again the second time i missed the third time i managed to hit it to go inside and this is a professional pilot so i don't believe that they do it but let's assume that they had done it what was the penalty in human rights 1.5 million in iraq approximately a little bit less in afghanistan is this legitimate is this right and then you come to speak to me about how i should treat my wife you come and speak to me that if i spank my son you take him away and you put me in jail what kind of mentality is this a friend of mine's daughter and her husband were in america and the child you know saudi childs cry a lot like your children and the child was crying and the woman was in the house she's my friend's daughter i know this really personal and all of a sudden big banging on the wall on the door open up this is the police she was in her normal clothes so she said one minute and she went to the room to get something properly dressed they broke the door and they went inside and arrested her not any handcuffed her and interrogated her on the spot and they left why because the neighbor called and she said there's a child crying and i think she's beating him what kind of human rights is this so no one has the right to tell us about our religion no one has the right to tell us this is allowed this is not allowed no one is allowed to tell us that your religion has this or has that this is my religion no one has the right to tell me what to do now coming to the issue of beating the wife islam forbids it completely that you beat your wife unless but generally speaking it is completely haram the prophet said alaihis authentic hadith a lot of women came and visited my wives last night complaining that their husbands beat them by allah they are the worst of allah's creation this is the prophet saying okay so this is the guidelines never ever beat your wife with the grace of allah i've never laid a hand on my wife she always beats me but alhamdulillah i no no i was joking alhamdulillah she's okay she doesn't beat me anyhow this is the norm now quran tells you that something abnormal i am married i have children my wife all of a sudden blew a vein or a pipe or some nerve and she's acting weirdly she's abusive she does this she does that and i what to do i'm unable to live with her how can i sustain the marriage well very easy islam tells you advise her so i should give her counseling for two weeks three weeks my love this is haram allah tells you this you're disrespectful the prophet says so and so you are sinning i don't want you to sin no you do this my my love listen to me this is haram this is not how life can go on you keep on advising her for two three weeks not one day this does not work and she is disobedient she is rude she is not treating you well second stage stay away from her in sense of intimacy you have to abandon her scholars say abandon her in bed meaning you do not sleep in another room you sleep in the same bed but give her your back the wife says i hope this stays for long sometimes it it doesn't work most of the time it does because women if you neglect them they feel weak and why is he neglecting me maybe he's seeing someone else maybe he's thinking of someone else maybe this or that so they even if they don't want it they enjoy the fame they enjoy that they are requested and demanded and wanted so if you don't want them you don't request them you don't call for them it has a strong impact on women normally women huh any proper normal women so you do this for three four weeks i know that the second day you will feel weak no don't feel weak be a man be a man first week second be a man don't because you're trying to fix your marriage if you become weak this will go six seven more months without fixing so after three four weeks this doesn't work and she's still disrespecting you she's still disobedient islam allows you to hit her however we are informed how to hit her so after three four weeks of this and three four weeks of that do not take your boxing gloves okay islam tells me i can beat you bang bang bang jabbing her and hitting her no islam tells you hit her but do not leave a trace what do you mean not leave a trace if i do this it's going to get red islam tells you don't do this do not break a bone okay i cannot leave a trace i can break a boat islam tells you do not break what do you mean how do you want you to beat her even abbas may allah be pleased with her with him said beat her with a miswak are you kidding me i can do this all day long and nothing happens it is not the physical abuse that is intended it is the mental reprimand because if you do this it's not going to hurt physically it's going to hurt mentally and this is what is supposed to do to do journey to have that look you've reached a stage where you made me do this after three four weeks of not of advising you three or four weeks of not having intimacy with you you leave me no room but to resort to the last resort and that is beating you as mentioned in the quran in this gentle way the prophet says do not hit or spank the face this is hara and that is why sports boxing is haram because it involves hitting the face and this is not permissible so if i cannot leave a trace and if i cannot break a bone and if i cannot hit her face might as well live with her no you have a lot you're allowed to reprimand her in this gentle and loving and caring way if nothing takes place and nothing materializes you bring someone from her family someone from your family to try to solve this issue nowadays i don't know of anyone who's resorting to these islamic means immediately the wife complains my husband is beating me and i talked to the husband he said sheikh i advised her for five minutes and i abandoned her in bed for two minutes and then i beat him i did what the quran said no the quran did not say this quran said that you have to follow this procedure in order to keep and preserve your marriage therefore it is the last resort because out of experience all sisters all women who were divorced now they're divorced we approach them and ask them sister if you were given the chance to be married again and avoid divorce by advising you abandon you in bed and beating you would you accept they all say yes i would have accepted but unfortunately we did not have the islamic knowledge and we immediately got separated and separation is very very painful and it's very very hard for a woman and a man unfortunately people are not following the right methodology of uh marriage as instructed the rights of a wife allah says in the quran as to those women on whose part you see ill-conduct admonish them first then refuse to share their beds and last beat them lightly if it's useful but if they return to obedience seek not against them means surely allah is ever most high most great and that is why scholars say that if you admonish if you advise them abandon them the third stage which is beating them if they scholars say if you know for sure that beating them will not result in any good thing it becomes forbidden understand so if i advise and i abandon in bed the last stage is to beat her but i know my wife and if i beat her it will not result in any good she will not be reprimanded on the country she might beat me back in this case islam tells you do not beat her because it's useless there's no use of it so avoid it the prophet says in hadith fear allah with regard to women for you have taken them as a trust from allah and intimacy with them has become permissible to you by the words of allah your right over them is that they should not allow anyone to sit on your furniture whom you dislike if they do that then hit them but not in a harsh manner again this is an evidence from the quran and an evidence from the sunnah of the permissibility of resorting to such action of course after taking all the precautions and the necessary uh conditions at first providing it helps if the woman is defiant and there's no way that she will change and i know this and she knows this then resorting to beating her is unacceptable okay and the right overview is that you should provide for them and clothe them on reasonable basis we went through this before atta said i said to bin abbas what is the kind of hitting that is not harsh he said hitting her with siwak and the like so don't bring a baseball bat or a hockey you have hockey here and say i will reprimand her no this is too harsh and this is second part of the ayah not to ignore her except in bed not to abuse her verbally especially by insulting her beauty or her face the prophet alaihis salatu said the believer is not a slanderer one who curses a great deal one who indulges in obscenity or who in engages in foul talk so many times i come across problems with or between the spouses that the husband is abusive always cursing always and i know of my own relatives aunties and uncles where i used until now remember that whenever they want to reprimand their son or their daughter they say may allah hurt your father and mother i could not believe this who is the father he is the one who's cursing you're kissing yourself what is this he said no no it's not intended the prophet says aslam do not supplicate against yourself may allah kill me do not supplicate against your children and i've seen a lot of girl of women cursing their children when they're angry with them may allah make you paralyzed may allah kill you when they're angry do not supplicate against your slaves do not supplicate against your own wealth some people driving and the car is not working properly what do they say why does this happen the prophet says do not do this because you do not know maybe you will supplicate and the gates of paradise are the gates of heaven are open and allah would answer you would you like allah to answer your when you say may allah paralyze your son no so don't say it likewise a muslim does not engage in obscenity not with his children not with his definitely wife i had a friend who was a teacher at school and i counsel them every now and then my friends and colleagues this was about 15 20 years ago and once he was telling me i have a problem with rage and my wife has a problem with rage as well i told them this is haram and the guy is with the beer he looks practicing but he's not apparently he said last night i fought with my wife she threw the ashtray at me barely missing my head i threw the coffee pot the thermos and i was successful in hitting her in the in the head two stitches and i said i laughed you serious he said well you always do this every week twice three times and i was shocked and i was telling him are you really serious well i'm serious this is how we live we've been married for 12 13 years now what kind of a life is this when it reaches to that level between the man and his wife they say oh sheikh we do this but we love each other i don't want to be even close to you or to be loved by you stay away from me this is bad the the relationship between a man and his wife has it is the most honorable the most romantic the most delicate what did allah describe the man and woman in the quran how close can a man be to a person more than his wife remember the hadith when the prophet salallahu salaam calmed the ansar in hunain you know her name the prophet gathered so much money and he gave it all to the quraish and the ansar who were in need said muhammad found his relatives so he forgot us not saying this out of objection to the deen no but they said that this is the norm so the prophet gathered them and only the ansar no muhajirin and he addressed them in very beautiful nice words that make you cry so i'm not going to do it because i don't want to cry i don't cry i don't have hearts men do not cry do not have feelings so the prophet said why are you angry are you angry because the people went back to their homes with camels and cows and sheep and you go back to your homes with muhammad don't you is this not enough for you you could have said i need didn't i come to you when you were astray and allah guided you with me when you were poor and allah made you rich with me when you are so and so uh uh disunited and allah united with me why do you say this and they would say allah has the favor upon us and the prophet and then he said you can say and people will believe you you could say you came to us kicked out and we took you in you came to us poor and we give you our money you came to us with no army and we protected you by allah if you said this people will believe you but are you angry that people would go with the camels and the cows and and you go back to your children with muhammad and they started to cry and then the prophet said and this is what i wanted to say the people are the outer garment and the ansar are the inner garment so the women are our inner garments they are the closest people to us and also the men are the closest people to you and that is why the rights of women over men are huge and the rights of men over women are even greater so you should acknowledge this insha allah to be fair and just between the wives this does not apply here this is a big problem being fair and just and allah azzawajal instructed us in the quran to be fair and just and if you're unable to be fair and just then marry one only so a lot of the brothers marry a second wife and they cannot afford it and they're unjust and unfair you're wrong in marrying her haram you shouldn't do this being fair in what what kind of rights financial basic needs time which is very essential meaning you spend two nights here one night here no it has to be two nights two nights one night one night one week one week one month one month you have to be really equal it is her right financial needs you buy a dress as a gift you have to buy a dress as a gift but if this one has to go to the hospital cesarean operation this one says i want the money you have to give me the money no i don't have to give you the money there is a different difference between what is essential and what is a gift likewise if i have children university high school kindergarten the one that goes to a kindergarten or lower classes i give two reals one for sandwich and one for juice some people give ten one for sandwiches one for jews and one for cigarettes i give only two reals the one in the high school i give five reals the one in the university i give 50 reals because he has a car he goes and fuel and he has more responsibility so is this a gift no this is allowance but when i come in eat and when of ramadan we give gifts so i give cash and i give the six months old as i give the 27 years old the gift is the same and this is not fair six months old doesn't know what to do with the money yeah it goes to my pocket it's okay but you get the same because a gift likewise wives a wife that has 10 children is not a wife like has two children i buy groceries here more than i do here the one that goes to school different than the one that doesn't the one that needs hospital is different than the other so by being fair and just in basics and financial needs what about intercourse do i have to be fair and just no why because this is something in accordance to the feelings and you this is not something that you can control so someone you may love to stay with someone you may not as much and this is dependence on apparently when it comes to fairness okay we have to pause here and for the questions a break okay regarding the eligibility of wali if father and mother are divorced can the wife become the wali for her daughter during her wedding what is the answer any woman a woman can never be a wally never is it possible for a woman to become a wali for another whether it's her daughter mother or sister the guardian it's a condition it has to be male by the way there are more elaboration but i did not have time i do not have time and it's not a course when we say well he has to be a man a male it has to be prioritized in a certain condition so if she has a father brothers sons grandfather uncles she cannot pick and chooses one of her brothers because she loves him you'll be my wally it has to be the father the father is not there the grandfather both are not there then her brothers who are eldest and then her sons and then her uncles and etc of course we have it in the format of brothers and then the sons of the brothers and that is the nephews not available the uncles and then the if cousins uncles are not available then the cousins so it is not your pick and choose your paternal uncle can be your well your maternal uncle has nothing to do with you my father and mother have separated i was raised with my mother and her brother and he is like a father to me for 30 years he has taken care of me now i want to get married and i have no father i have no paternal relatives at all only my uncle he cannot be your wedding the judge becomes your wedding so this is i have a grandfather but he's my mother's father he cannot be your wali and he will not inherit from you because there is it has to do with inheritance but this is very long topic so what is the ruling of keeping your nikkei what is the ruling on keeping marriage in the mosque there is no preference to it it was done it can be done but it is sunnah to do it the answer is no in saudi a lot of the people where i lived and also in makkah they go especially to the haram to make the marriage contract so the men in the boys family the men in the girls family they go let's say prayasar there they go to asar from all the way from jiddah and they pray answer and then they go to the office for marriage contracts and they make the marriage contract there why do you do this they say barakah and this is not correct yes if they're both from makkah and they would like to go to the court or to the masjid to make the marriage contract they can do it but to travel all the way no this is not a part of the sunnah what about here you do it in the masjid okay why a masjid is not a place of celebration so it is not the sunnah that we okay inshallah on tuesday today is uh sunday on tuesday after maghrib we will meet in the masjid and make the rich this is not part of the sunnah i all of us the majority of us make our nikah in the house or we go to the court so that officially it is registered and over with but to do it in the masjid and then go to authenticate it authenticate it and the court this is not part of the sunnah again can i communicate with my would be fiance through emails by keeping my wallet in cc no see i'll give you i i'll give you a short answer well not a shanta answer actually i'll i will explain this a little bit further what what is the ruling of communicating with your spouse what's the ruling on that no she's your spouse husband or wife yes of course you have to do this okay let's go a little bit lower what's the ruling on communicating with your fiance with mahram even with mahram your fiance is a stranger to you so your fiance if he's a man he's like me talking to me is like talking to him and if she's a girl she's like any woman on the street talking to her is like talking to any woman on the street can i talk to any woman in the street no you can if there is a necessity if she is a nurse if she's a receptionist if she is selling something and i want to buy i can talk but i will not crack jokes i will not compliment oh mashallah your dress is very nice this is not acceptable therefore if i have a fiance i'm engaged to a girl can we talk no unless there is a necessity such as i'd like to buy the furniture for the living room and she cannot come with me so i called her salaam alaikum very strict it is a different way of talking salaam alaikum alaikum salaam i'm buying inshallah today the furniture you'd like it brown or blue says well what is the carpets colors you said it's green so they know i'd like it to be yellow if possible because this goes okay straight forward now don't call her 10 times a day asking about the color of the toothbrush what about the dishes what about be this is between you and allah so if it's a necessity yes now is supposed to be there no when someone calls the house for example does my daughter have to say come daddy come i can't answer the phone unless there is a mahram no for necessities yes this can be done so i hope this explains the relationship between a man and his future wife you do not engage in cordial talks and emotions and okay i love you allah for the sake of allah and i love you for the sake of allah now this is not acceptable be straightforward and only in necessities in real reasons a question from islamic university malaysia a non-practicing girl proposed to marry me i accepted her unconditioned that she starts to practice islam but she left me without marrying as i repeatedly asked her to practice islam it makes it makes me regret that i was not patient what should i do now first of all i do advise you to practice islam you're the one who's supposed to practice islam a girl proposes to you and you instruct her to practice islam and you continuously communicate with her and every time she you have to practice islam and now i don't know what to do you practice islam from day one she comes and proposes to you tell her sorry you have to talk to my father talk to my guardian who's the man don't follow the footsteps of shaytan what you're doing is following the footsteps of shaytan for the purpose of tawa i follow the footsteps of shaitaan until i reach the destination set to me by shaytan there is a question in islam q a by the way islam q a is the best website available yani i vouch for that islam has many many extensions in saudi it's banned but we have now info so it's not working alhamdulillah the site is very good the site is trustworthy i use it a lot i with the grace of allah have communication with the owner is a very respectful brother and a scholar in it in one of the questions it says i gave him advice for the sake of allah and we fell in zina what is that websites communication blogs forums and they exchange advice for the sake of alleged islamic and he thanked her and she thanked him and it developed a little bit until they fell in relationship what is this do not follow the footsteps of shaytaan so be aware ahi if someone proposes to you like a girl who's not practicing why do you look at her to begin with if you're practicing would i look at a woman who's not practicing or consider her for marriage never i would never pick someone like that i would pick someone who is a student of knowledge who is mature who is mashallah practicing so you have no right in asking her to practice and then you're worrying what should i do now no you should cut all communications all the sisters again i have this brother proposing to me and i'm communicating with him through email i'm telling him i'm asking him to do this and that he's not doing it what should i do you should practice islam you should have no communication with the opposite sex none whatsoever not through emails not through same essays not through any form of communication because this is haram honolulu the question after marriage the wife comes to know that her husband is a gay will the marriage be invalid as a marriage contract it is valid he's man he's male now his wrong practices do not affect the marriage as a contract unless she knows that he is a fornicator a man who continuously fornicates this is invalid likewise if he commits lonely and openly this is uh homosexuality this is invalid allah says a fornicator female is not to be married except by a fornication fornicating male or a mushrik now scholars say how do you understand this it's very simple if i know that this woman is committing zina and i go and propose to her i'm one of two either i am by accepting her as she is without repenting yet i marry her i believe that this is okay then this makes me a zany because my marriage contract is invalid or i believe that what she's doing is halal then i become a mushrik because i have nullified my islam this is the most authentic interpretation of this ayah and therefore if you married someone thinking that he's good and then you discovered that he has some secret sins or hidden agenda being gay for example or homosexual uh rather than gay in this case your marriage as a contract was valid but you have all the right to separate from him and i do not believe that any woman in her right mind would stay with such a a a person with such a pervert because he is a faster he is not a straightforward believer so she should ask for separation if she have she if she has evidences she can go to the islamic judge and ask for a separation and the the judge would void this contract another question from islamic university malaysia i am 30 years old man currently pursuing my master degree couldn't get married yet as i do not have income to support family what is your advice if a person does not have income to support the family you should not marry but what do you do you don't have it you don't have means to do it there is not mandatory upon you until you find the means to do this as long as you're doing your masters so that inshallah you'll have a better income inshallah be patient for a year or two and fast you must fast so that it would deter and curb your desire for having sex and also look if you can find someone who would marry you this is good unfortunately we look for the ideal and perfect situation a man who's doing his master's is probably 23 years of age correct he's 30 you're all a thief and not married until now i will not say that what um said may allah be pleased with him okay if he's 30 years of age and he's unable to get married financially in normal uh circumstances you have abnormal circumstances in the sense that you don't have to marry someone who's 20 or 22 years of age look for someone who's 45 years old and not that beautiful but can afford to support you would you be able to find such a woman or not what do you think huh men women yes there are women who are who were unfortunate uh and were unable to get married now that she is 45 she's 50 years old she can afford any husband she wants but no husband wants full stop 50 years old what should i do with that as a 30 years old man and you want something to stop you from doing haram 50 years old woman who is willing to marry you and he is not the extremely beautiful but any there is still some something i need two five six seven percent left would do the job would it if you are yeah we have us they have a saying in in in english any airport in a storm would do so seriously be realistic if you want to get married and you're unable financially and you don't find someone who's young being able to marry you you have no problem marrying someone who is old because it's demand and supply so the supply is not there the demand is there so you can do with whatever it means you is possible knows best next question is it mandatory for a woman to get married can't she remain unmarried marriage i don't know if i said it here or somewhere else marriage can be mandatory it can recommended it can be permissible it can be disliked and it can be haram forbidden it depends on the person a person who if married will not be able to support his wife and at the same time he neither physically nor financially and this would burden her and make her resort to haram marriage in his case is haram a person who has financial means who has the physical ability and knows that if he does not get married he's going to fornicate marriage in his case is mandatory and so on so now we come to this girl this sister she says i don't want to be married is it haram we look into her why don't you want to get married she says my mother is 70 years old my father is 80 years old they need help and i'm on the only child i'd like to remain with them and help them no problem don't get married a woman says that i was engaged before and my engagement broke and i started to hate all men and i don't want to see any man and i think that they all are all bastards and they're all don't fear allah no they you have a problem you have a problem that has to be solved a woman says i'd like to be what is the word in english celibate celibacy what's the adjective i know the noun whatever whatever you know what i mean she said i want to be like this for the rest of my life only worshipping allah what do we say no this is haram the prophet said whoever chooses sunnah other than my sunnah is not from me you cannot do this for the sake of allah you have to get married and we mentioned this in the very beginning of yesterday's talk and the benefits of marriage so it depends on the situation there is not a specific answer remember that there are so many great scholars who did not get married such as they been tamiya never married and now we but now i was young why he died like in 37 years of age 40 37 depends you know gregorian or hijri so whenever i want to make myself younger i say i'm 49 because in gregorian i'm 49 but actually in history i'm 4 50 yeah 50 plus i'm old okay following question do you have any online question if nika is done but marriage is not consummated and the groom is not yearning still studying should his parents give income to his to the bride truth should the parents give income to the bride should the parents give income to the bride if she if the if the marriage is not consummated and she still lives with her uh parents why should i give them money i should not give them i should not give her allowance until she moves into my house or the marriage is consummated and that is why he has no right to say okay marriage contract is done so we're not man and wife i should demand my rights you demand your rights have a house give her money provide for her then you demand your rights but as long as she's in her parents house and the official marriage is not taking place though on paper you're married though you can talk to her speak to her sit with her but it is not uh proper to have any relationships with her until she moves we'll take this inshallah final question rest maybe after we'll have a questionnaire session throughout later today we'll cover as much as possible a father consults with his daughter and she accepts the alliance all the arrangements are done and just before the nikka the girl wants to get out of the marriage for no reasons can the girl exercise her right bringing humiliation to the parents the marriage contract is not done not then yeah of course definitely definitely and this happened a lot the marriage is agreed upon engagement takes place halas the wedding night is set a week before the wedding night and the contract the marriage contract the girl says i have cold feet i don't want to continue what is the appropriate way to do the approach thing to do for the parents if the boy is good if he's has nothing wrong with him and if the girl has no reason apparent reason then in this case they should continue to pressure her and advise her in a nice way just before i came i spoke to a brother of mine a friend and he's a businessman i don't call him except once every blue moon and i called him ha how's how are things alhamdulillah how is your daughter doing because he invited me to her marriage contract uh signing a couple of months ago and he said subhanallah you called because we have a problem what's the problem he said that the girl doesn't want the man only three days ago she said i don't want the marriage the marriage is next week i don't know what to do and the funny thing is that the boy is her cousin so he's not a stranger and i ask her her mother ask her her grandmother because she's the grandmother of both boys and she says both of you are my children what what's wrong she said i don't know but i don't want to marry him so he's saying what should i do i told him if this is the case take them take her to makkah and this is what i always advise people who have evil eye envy or magic they come to me in the hundreds for me if i do i become very rich because people get rich like this i never make rupiah to someone i don't know and i tell them if i do look here for you the gin and me will come to you it will double so i advise you not to come stay away but those who come to me i tell them go to makkah there are a lot of streams and the streams are very small and narrow little water but i have a roaring and raging river do i take water from the streams or from the river and allah has the highest example why do i go to individuals when i have allah why do i go to a shaykh where i can go directly to allah and ask him so i always tell people go make umrah to purify yourself from sins now this is not sunnah don't think that this is sunnah this is a way that i believe is good because umrah purifies you from sin after you finish umrah and cut your hair go back to the kaaba pray two raka's and after you finish the two raka's raise your hands praise allah offer salutation to the prophet hassam and then supplicate now the best place on earth is haram and you are at the best time praise to allah and worship him and supplicate not doubting that he will answer you don't say oh allah if you want do this if you don't no pray and you are certain that allah will respond to you will cure you by allah everybody is being cured by this i have tens of of of similar situations a brother from india came to me once in my masjid saying sheikh duruk i have this headache that paralyzes me i'm a supervisor in a construction company i cannot work and i don't know what to do i cannot go and move i cannot do anything and i told him stop listening to music or watching movies in your campus in your campus where you where you live he said i'm a practicing muslim i don't listen to music and i don't have a tv set and i pray five times in the masjid the reason was when i got this offer i worked for two years in saudi then i went to my home in india and they have a lot of asset they have a lot of any evil eye so they didn't enjoy my high salary in my high position so did this to me i told the brother go to makkah and do what i told you to do he went three days later he came how are you subhanallah it's gone completely look alhamdulillah this is allah he came ten months later she hits back what to do i said the same medication you need a new prescription the same one so he went and a few days later he came handle it's gone a year later he came it's back i told you what to do whenever you have a problem resort to allah the almighty and i can stay from now until maghrib telling you about the the the funny stories that happened to me personally one last one because i don't want to waste your time a man and his wife newlywed he came to me shivering in the masjid what's wrong he said we have something wrong in our house what is it he said yesterday last night usually we wake up in the morning we find in the kitchen you know someone has drunk coffee and made sandwiches cheese in the table and i asked my wife did you do this no you did this there are people eating and this is scary he said the most scary things that blew our mind out was last night last night i was sleeping next to my wife and i sheikh i see this big scorpion and he did this this i said no there's no scorpion maybe it's an octopus so no no it's a big scorpion walking on the wall and then it came on top of us on the ceiling and i did this i held my wife and she said are you seeing what i'm seeing so it's not me only she also seeing it don't know what to do we were crazy i said go to the haram and ask allah israel to purify your house that's all following day he came to me and said alhamdulillah it's all gone nothing is in the house this is not me this is you if you believe in allah azzawajal if you supplicate to allah wallahi no matter how bad it is allah will fix it because he's the provider allah has billions of his creation other than us but we have only one allah to resort to so supplicate from your heart and allah azza will answer your call okay until you begin okay we move on to point of being fair uh we we might we've been through this huh any questions any thing that is unclear the following points number seven not to disclose her secrets especially ones related to intimacy and we've gone through this yesterday so the most major sin is that you go and disclose your intimacy issues with your friends all your relatives well i did this with my wife i did that with my wife and uh she liked it she didn't like it i didn't like this i didn't like that this is completely forbidden but also part of the rights of the wife that you do not disclose her secrets to your in-law to your parents for example it is unwise for you to go and complain my wife doesn't cook well i suffer he doesn't know how to iron my my clothes my house is dirty she yells at me she raises her voice to me you cannot say this and disclose such secrets to anyone part of her rights is okay this is the hadith that we've mentioned uh yesterday they will give the notes right so we i don't have to repeat this hadith is any uh clear inshallah part of his rights her rights is helping her round the household and we said that this is sunnah it is unfortunate it is extremely unfortunate that muslims don't do this the kafir do this strange the kafir who do not believe in allah they share their responsibilities in the house not because it's for the sake of allah but because they believe that they are equal i shall may allah be pleased with her when asked about the prophet was how was he in the house she said that he was serving his family until it was time for prayer he used to stitch his throat fix his sandals and milk his goat imagine the greatest man on earth who has the armies to go and conquer wherever he wants he does this on his own house in his own house now do we do this do we share with our wives maybe some of it selectively but do we do it for the sake of allah or because we like cooking or we have this fantasy of washing dishes i love to wash dishes for allah no no but i enjoy washing dishes maybe but whenever you do it for allah you are rewarded and you get from allah azzawajal for that number nine help her in the house with the children and not leave them for her completely we gone through this yesterday this is her right now you have no right in saying that no you do this you do that as they are her children they're named after you so they are your children as well and so many times i don't know about here among the men who have children how many of you allow the wife to choose the name of her own choice masha allah one two three four okay how many of you choose the name of the child not her only three and the rest lister don't have child child children and uh the women who among you chose the name of the children they are far greater 30 they choose whose right is it the father although she did the dirty work nine months tired pain agony yet at the end of the day she doesn't get to name the child why because it's the father's responsibility now it is your responsibility but you have to be be fair in the sense that give her a list of names acceptable if she's if she chooses for example godzilla he says no i'm not going to call my son this name it has to be a proper name you have a choice between or shaytan as our friend in delhi no it's your responsibility to choose a proper name but give her a wide variety it's unfair to call your son by your father name and your daughter by your mother name and your second son by your grandfather's name and your second daughter by your grandmother's name and not to call any of her of your in-laws like this and you have to be flexible in that so don't leave the children to her not doing anything while only requesting and assuming and demanding your own rights she has rights as well allow her to go out wherever knee dead such as visiting her family friends and masjid and shopping this is permissible so why restrict her movements do we have any of the ladies that their husband restrict their movements to their parents okay one which is very bad maybe more but the sister said does any of you gents restrict his wife from going to her parents i will not say it i will not say i certainly believe that you have no right in preventing your wife from seeing her parents or visiting them now you have to be fair in my city we have drivers so the women go out and come as freely as they wish to their parents to do this is wrong to restrict this not to go except once once every 10 days or once every month is completely wrong because she lives they live next door so you have to have the balance when is it advisable not to allow her to go when she changes meaning my wife goes to her parents house the whole week she is perfect just as she comes back she starts did you demand things why don't you uh change the furniture why don't you increase this why don't you bring me this why don't you take us on vacation why everybody is doing this and not us and i noticed that every time she goes and meets with her sisters or her mother she changes as a man as a protector of the family in the house do i have the right to prevent her or not yes i have but before any amputating a limb try to use antibiotics try to treat it maybe show that there is hope give her advice give her mother advice tell her that this is not acceptable she changes i'm trying my level best to please her but she is doing something that is unacceptable if this does not work then you have the right message it do you have the right to prevent her from going to the masjid no the prophet said alaihis do not prevent women from attending the masjid however if she is wearing tight jeans and an open abaya and so do we have this they wear tight jeans and an open abaya and they walk like superman and you can see everything what kind of hijab is this so we're covered abaya yeah but close the abaya if you expose everything halas might as well take off the abaya she says no i'm going to the masjid if she goes to the masjid probably dressed but mashallah has a ton of perfume so whenever she moves you you see heads turning this is haram you as a protector you must prevent her from doing this she says i want to go to the message he says sit no not sit as a dog and he sits in the meaning and you do not go haram you have to stop her but if she is in normal circumstances the masjid is close she is wearing normal islamic clothes no perfume and she wants to go you give her advice you tell her it is not recommended for you to pray in the masjid it is best for you to spray in home she said i want to pray in the masjid go this is halal shopping oh she actually doesn't go shopping okay you do the shopping i don't do the shopping so who will shop it's okay if we have a place that is well taken care of no one will harass or abuse her to go and do shopping is there's nothing wrong in that insha'allah number 11 he must not allow her to get okay this is when we finish with this uh to feel jealous and protective towards her we spoke about this and the prophet said alaihis salatu that jealousy is divided into two types one of it allah abhors allah hates and that is when a man is jealous of his or to his uh family without any reason of being jealous like the man who is jealous whenever she is on the phone and when he comes she hangs up this is normal but he's jealous and he is suspicious allah does not like this and does not approve of that number 12 to fulfill her sexual desires because she is a human being and marriage is based on fulfillment of sexual desire no no we did not marry for this with all due respect what did you marry for said we married so we have a muslim family and children is it by correspondence dear wife i'd like to have two boys and three girls exactly preferably on a to 10 years duration this is part of life this is something that allah created in us and this is one of the most beautiful relationship between a man and his wife so it should be an art the way that a man and woman fulfill their halal desires some men neglect their women for long periods of time why do you do this i don't feel like it yeah but you don't have the right not to feel like it you must feel like it if you don't fake it pretend you like it but she is a human being that has her own desires and she has a uh feelings to be fulfilled and if you don't fulfill it someone else will and there is a lot of stories about cheating about going into haram because of the neglection of because of the neglect of men to their wives this is a responsibility you don't feel like a divorcer don't let her be in a fire for simply because you do not uh like it this is number what 12. number 13 you should praise her efforts and thank her this is her rights when is when was it the last time you expressed your gratitude for food for bringing up the children for keeping the house clean for giving you a good massage when was it the last time ages ago why because you believe that this is her obligation yes it is her obligation but what is your obligation your obligation is to thank her the prophet says he who does not thank people does not thank allah and the closest people to you is your wife and that is why you always have to be thankful and appreciative and the more you do this the more she loves you more and one of the reas one of the greatest ways of appreciating your wife is to look at your shortcomings this is what i do with my wives i always say this honey i brag about it when my wife cooks food she's a horrible cook alhamdulillah and but every now and then she cooks gudyani mashallah but usually it would be once or twice a week that the food is bad i come home tired hungry the food is on the table alhamdulillah half an hour late as usual because i have a very strict schedule you know i have to know when to sleep when to go out when to so usually i tell them that 1 30 is food to be served it's served at 2 o'clock spanish no problem i eat the food sometimes it's uneatable it's not good for human consumption however i say bismillah the children are there we're talking we i eat one two three spoons i eat a lot of salads the main dish is there but i eat a lot of salads and we talk nothing is changing she's observing me you know she's looking at me in my face and um and alhamdulillah and i i leave she said you didn't eat i said yes i ate i'm full i have to go to the club after an hour i can't eat a lot i have to have be light she says the food you didn't like so no it's good she said no it's not good the food is lousy why do you lie to me why don't you ever tell me that the food needs salt the food needs cooking why do you never criticize my food wallaciolos tell me tells me this why you never criticize and every time i dodge the question here and there and at the end i told her listen i don't criticize your food because you don't criticize me when was the last time i took you out to the beach to the corniche you know just just in the car with the children she said six months ago it's it's 20 minutes away from my house and i never take them because i have no time i'm selfish i'm so-and-so i tell her when was the last time uh i took you out on dinner you and me one by one not with the children with the children maybe once a month twice a month but you and me last year when was the time we traveled together i don't remember so i tell her i don't bring you a lot of gifts i don't make you the richest woman on earth i don't take you places i don't buy your furniture every six months i don't do this and i don't do that and you don't complain you want me at the end of the day to complain about food you spend three hours in the kitchen cooking by allah would not be a man so always be appreciative look at yourself in the mirror before you criticize your wife because you have more shortcomings than her if you remember this wallah you will be the happiest man on earth because you'll always be appreciative of what she does and she also knows how you think and she will appreciate what you do but the minute we start demanding our rights it's my right to have good food check yes but is her right also that you attend the wedding of her cousin and you're not doing this so it's a lot of mutual rights and finally number 14 allah says and live with them honorably in arabic this is a an order from allah you have to live with them with something that is acceptable ma roof what is the definition of maroof is something that people acknowledge that is good your wife you have to live with her bill mahruf don't make any strategies don't have any hidden agendas a lot of the time the men become devious and they think of how can i get back at her she did this okay i'm not going to comment inshallah one week later i will tell her so and so and women are poor they're mesquite after one week when you say yeah you said so and so a week ago she gets hurt because she said it then forgot it you did not forget so you have to live with them honorably you have to treat them in a fashion in a way that is acceptable to them this is the last point in the rights of wives any of the men don't like this raise your hands okay this is fair and if the women think that this is acceptable okay yes no hands is there anything missing do you think that you have rights that were not mentioned fulfilled inshallah now we come yes unfortunately to the rights of the husband and i have 10 i have only 10 points the rights of the husband less than the wives they have 14 you have 10. however the rights of the husband are far greater in magnitude than the rights of the women why because allah azzawajal places a lot of responsibility on the wife to be the weakest link so the wife is the leakest wink link link she is the weakest link in the sense that it is her responsibility to ask and seek the pleasure of the husband who may not be willing to do the same it is her right because allah made him her way to jannah and not the opposite his way to jannah is his mother but her way to jannah is her husband so we begin and insha allah let's hope that allah grants us success in giving the right thing number one it is his right that okay and they the woman that allah says have rights over their husbands as regarding living expenses especially similar to those of their husbands over them as regards of obedience and and respect to what is reasonable ay bilma roof but men have a degree of responsibility over them so who has more rights the husband this is in black and white now the thing in brackets is not from the quran it is what the translator put into it first of all the obligation of obedience a woman must obey her husband no matter how you feel because if i put myself in your shoes it would be small i wear 44 you probably wear 36. if i put myself in your shoes and it's a big shoe i will probably think that why should i obey him he's like me i'm a man i'm a woman he's a man why does he have so much right why when he tells me you don't do this or do that i must obey when i ask him please do this or do that he doesn't obey what's the difference the difference is divine the difference is from allah this is not for me or you to say if my and allah has the highest example if my ceo the manager or the head of my company says you are a supervisor and your colleague is your manager i cannot say why halas this is the system if i am driving and and the police traffic police tells me stop i have to stop what does he have more than i ha that i do not have the power authority so who made the man in authority allah azza so we have to submit our will now this does not mean that the men abuse this authority as mentioned in the rights of the wife allah azza says men are the protectors on the ayah you know in surat and nisa are the protectors and maintainers of women means this is the ayah what did he say ah the protectors meaning i think i've skipped this that is she should obey him in matters of obedience that allah has enjoined upon her and obey him by treating his family well and taking care of his wealth this is interpretation of ibn what does that mean it means that they or she should obey him in what allah instructed her to obey him and part of that is to be kind to his family and to protect his wealth and this is part of his rights what do we mean by protecting his wealth a woman in so many families i don't know about here a lot of the men give the money every month to their wives to control the expenses of the house do you do this here huh raise your hands two three women two three same two three okay this is normal huh normal no problem if the woman is masha'allah wise now if she's not wise you will come on the fifth day of the month and she tells you i need money i gave you for the whole month said well i spent it where i gave something to my father something to my mother and i gave charity and i give taffy the quran and i bought new shoes the shoes are too big so no this is not permissible you have to protect his wealth and not do anything in his money without his permission this is part of his rights over you making herself obey available to her husband and this is extremely important the sexual rights men are in far greater need than women and this is why the prophet is as in the hadith of the prophet said when a man calls his wife to his bed and she refuses and he goes to sleep angry the angels will curse her until the morning subhanallah it's very very important to the extent that the prophet tells us but what happens is prophet of allah if a woman calls her husband to bed and he refuses nothing because any normally speaking women are not like men in when it comes to such desires they have it but it's not as strong men go blind they can't see women are masha'allah more mature more wise it is extremely important for a wife to know the husband's rights it is not permissible every night to say uh honey i have headache no this is not permissible you have to try your level best to please him because by pleasing him when he goes to work when he works when he goes out of his house his chastity is preserved he doesn't look around he lowers his gaze he is focused on his work and in uh evolving this society the muslim society if this is missing then the balance will not be attained not only that in another hadith the prophet said even if she is working on her furnace if she's cooking food on the furnace and he calls her she immediately must comply and come this is narrated by bukhari muslim by the way so it is agreed upon there is no way someone could doubt this authenticity by one of his rights is that she protects her chastity and his honor why do we say his honor not her honor when she met when you marry a man your honor becomes his so if you do anything that is not honorable it's not affecting you it's affecting his reputation and that is why if a man accuses his wife of adultery what is the process if he does not have witnesses yeah they have to do lian you know what's going on four times he says wallahi committed committed four times and the fifth time he says and may the curse of allah fall upon me if she did not commit now what protects her from being punished she swears four times while i did not commit well i did not commit and the fifth time she says may the anger not the curse which is much greater may the anger of allah be upon me if i committed this is in the case of what in case of the man accusing his wife of adultery okay what is the process if a woman goes into her house and finds her husband committing adultery with another woman what to do the same thing same thing no why this is unfair he came and saw a man with his wife he had this lian as mentioned in surat and noor but if i come and find my husband with another woman and doing adultery i can see it but i have no witnesses i cannot say anything if you go and complain to the islamic judge that he committed adultery on your bed in your house he will flog you a hundred lashes on your back why sheikh scholars all agree upon this by the way why because in the issue of a man accusing his wife this deals with his with his honor because she might conceive and the the child is attributed to the husband in the case of the husband committing adultery this has nothing to do with the girls or with the woman's honor it does with his honor so you have to bring four witnesses to testify otherwise you will be flogged so the honor of a husband is far far greater because it combines his honor and the honor of his wife so she should take care of that sisters don't like this we can tell by their memory so we have this uh okay and this i also on this ayah also refers to the same issue allah the husband's absence uh what allah orders them to guard moving on to number four not admitting anyone whom the husband dislikes in his home this is basic rights you as the husband have the right to tell your wife do not allow so and so in my house for example my house my wife has a friend and this friend is very bad she travels alone without a mahram she goes to lebanon every now and then on her own coming back with photos look i went to this club and i did this she admittedly knows men her cousins she mix freely and my wife talks to me about this hypothetically this is not true but this is if this is the case what should i do i should tell her do not associate with that woman that is a bad woman and she said no i love her she's my friend i tell her you do not go and that woman does not enter the house end of story it is his right it's his obligation you cannot do this it is not permitted for a woman to fast the prophet says assalam without her husband when when her husband is present without his permission or it to admit anyone to his house without his permission you cannot so if your husband says don't allow your father to come to the house it is it is his right you have to obey him don't allow your mother to come into the house i don't want any of your family to come into the house it is a must upon on you to obey him now he is sinful if he does not have a legitimate reason okay why are you preventing your father-in-law to come to the house i don't like him he will be punished on the day of judgment because he instructed and orchestrated the severing of the kinship for of his wife's side but she has to obey him my father is dying and i like to visit him no you don't go out you are obliged to obey him this is allah's instruction to you he is the one to be punished this is severe yes but without rules and regulations life cannot go on you have to have strict rules and regulations to be followed so that life would go on number five save his money and not spend it without his permission and a lot of the sisters say sorry i cannot do this i have to spend no spend but make this with his permission so a lot of the times women take money without permission and do good deeds and the husbands do not approve of it this is haram if the husbands approve of it and give you a general permission this is halal so many times i get groceries and i buy in bulk because we have a big family and my wife says can i give a portion to my mother my mother like this fruit my mother likes this piece of meat my mother likes this can i do that and i tell her you have an open permission do not ask me but do not give her everything can it be fair i give her what is acceptable normal and she has an open permission if your husband gives you an upper permission yes but if not and you know that he gets angry with it you cannot do this and it is not permissible the prophet alaihis allah said a woman is the shepherd of her husband's house and children and she is responsible for them and also okay now there are two hadiths in bukhari that may seem to conflict with each other one of them is that a woman is not allowed to pay without her husband's permission and the other one says that if a woman gives sadaqa charity without her husband's permission allah would reward her so how can we combine easy the first one he requires permission the second one he gave her an open permission not a single permission for each incident so in the second type yes whenever she spends from her from her husband's money he is rewarded and she is rewarded as well number six you should upbring his children in a good way and this is extremely difficult why because upbringing the children is undermined by the care and love of the mothers so many times the mothers would give in to the pressure of the children and she would do the wrong things and i have so many similar incidents where the mothers were the cause of the destruction of their children a mother has a 16 years old child the father is trying to discipline him and trying to make him on the straight path sometimes he's a little bit rough but still for his own good the mother without her husband knowing gives the boy 50 reals 100 reals 50 hours and the boys goes and buys cigarettes buys drugs buys movies and the father is wondering where is the money coming from where is it coming from it's coming from the mother so she is the one who is killing her own son by adhering to the pressure by listening to his complaints and feeling sorry for his tears these are crocodile tears you should not listen or obey so you have a responsibility to bring up his children in the appropriate way otherwise it will not become a good thing one of the worst thing that may happen in a family is when you discuss or argue in front of the children this is extremely bad a woman does this professionally masha'allah so the boy goes in or the girl goes to her father and says father i need this or that and the father says no she says i'd like to spend the night in my aunt's house and the father says no and the mother pops up why not she's my sister let the girl go they have fun they always enjoy themselves and say no no i'd like her to stay to study she can study there and the girl is watching the boy is listening they're arguing in front of the boy so whenever the man says something the wife breaks his word this is the worst thing that can happen as a man i would usually when she says this let's see we will discuss this later and later after the kids leave i start putting on my boxing gloves never talk to me or break my word against my children you have to honor my word and respect my word even if it's wrong talk to me afterwards but to disagree with me in front of the children you are making my respect on the floor they will never respect me even worse whenever they have something and i say it's wrong they will go and lobby like the israeli lobby in america they will lobby with you until you come and force me to change my mind this is wrong you have to upbring his children in a good way and the best way is to respect him even is wrong he's your father you have to respect him not leave home without his permission it's like visa credit card don't leave home without it you cannot leave the house without his permission am i a prisoner the answer is yes you are a prisoner yes the hadith clearly states that you are a prisoner what hadith in the tenth year of hajj when the prophet gave the khutbah he said to the men and fear allah and these women with you because they are prisoners of war in your house what is the meaning of prisoners meaning that they are unable to leave without your permission they are unable to receive anyone without your permission but they are doing it willingly because this is marriage so the prophet is saying don't abuse your right as a man because they are prisoners of war no but honor them so for women yes you are a prisoner this life is a prison are we in jannah are we in jannah the prophet said allah dunya is the prisoner of a believer and it is the heaven of a disbeliever this dunya is the heavens of a disbeliever correct you know even hajjar one of the great scholars of islam he was a judge he's the supreme judge and the supreme judge in egypt where certain clothes in the 8th century so once he was with his guards beautiful clothes expensive masha'allah and a jew stood up and came to him this jew works in frying fish you know if you work eight hours in you know when you fry something how is your hair my wife usually does this towards the bandana and wears the mask and where's something protective what is this i'm going to fry so why are you doing this oh if you fry everything comes the smell and you you have to shower and you have to do this so she is very protective smell and the the vapor of the oil so the man stood in front of this judge and he was a jew kafir and he looked bad he smelled bad and he said sheikh i'd like to ask you about a hadith your prophet says dunya is the prison of a believer and the paradise of a disbeliever you're a believer and look at you what you're wearing i'm a disbeliever and look at my paradise what is this even immediately answered him he said yes the prophet said the truth allah what i am enjoying in this dunya compared to jannah if i enter it this is a prison what you see this is a prison compared to the narem of jannah and what you are suffering in this world compared to hell if you go to hell this is paradise the man said he accepted it so you are in prison but this prison is your way to jannah try to make your prison a beautiful place you have the means as a woman to make your husband like a ring in your finger if you know how to control him if you know how to deal with him men are old children they are big children if my son i don't have sons but i'm hypothetical if i speak to my son and i tell him eat this food my son will say i'll not eat the food so what do i do do not touch this this is not good for you he'll start to eat men are like this if you say i want this no no i want this i demand this no come to them in a very nice way honey uh i don't know what do you think do you think i should do this or should do that i need your opinion i can't make my mind he will immediately surrender have empty whatever you want you choose you can make this prison you can make your prison a garden but the problem is here you as a man can you make you can make your life wallahi the most beautiful life ever this is a transient world we it we're here for specific time how much time do you have we have like 30 minutes huh it's a specific time on life utilize it enjoy it to the limit don't restrict yourself and say no my life is miserable my husband is unable to change i am doomed i will go to hell might as well commit suicide why look at the bright side you have lots and lots of positive things in your life don't restrict yourself to a one form of thinking expand your the horizons expand your options and choices and you will find that life is beautiful type what is this the prophet okay this is number eight one of his rights is that you should seek his permission to fast voluntary fasting the prophet said allah it is not permissible for a woman to fast when her husband is present except with his permission agreed upon buhari muslim now one would say why well this is it has to do with point number two fulfilling his desires sexual desires but if he has no desires then there is no need to do that however i know that the majority of men when requested by their wives 99 they would say fast i would not stop you from worshiping allah however you should ask his permission if he is away do you ask his permission no the prophet says he is present he has to be present if he does not have the ability to have intercourse he's impotent he's 95 years old for example and he's unable to have sexual relationship does she have to seek his permission no it's going to say no she doesn't because he is incapable of doing what he wants to do and there is no reason for stopping her if he's fasting does she needs his permission no he's she fast with him if he breaks his fast okay she then has to take a new permission or she breaks her fast if it's in ramadan does she need her his permission if she is fasting mandatory fast such as making up for ramadan or for oath or for expiation does she need his permission no no no she doesn't she doesn't need his permission she may delay it for example one says it's never it's a pledge that if allah cures my child i will fast tomorrow and i'll accuse a child she comes to war and the husband says red flag i want my rights then she does not have to fulfill his rights because this is mandatory upon her she has the right to postpone making up from for of ramadan ishmael is used to delay making up of ramadan until sherban but not because it's not permissible she voluntarily did this so that she would uh give the prophet isaiah what he needs how many hours do you have 25 good we can finish inshallah in three minutes number nine showing him gratitude and not denying his kindness that's a long slide prophet said allah give in charity to who to who to the women who is that who is he addressing the women when was this address after eight in eight khutbah the prophet used to give the khutbah and then he used to walk to the women and he addressed them once and said o give charity okay men give charity so what's what's what's a big deal he justified this by saying for you are the majority of fuel of hell the majority of the people in hell are women true or false true why because in nature women are more than men not because they are sinful remember women by count are more than men yeah for example my house they're 15 and one man so at the end of the day the percentage is there men die quickly because of women heart attack stroke blood pressure diabetes you name it and if you look at the men and interview them what's the problems my wife did this my wife did that my wife did this while women masha allah they outlive men i believe you know a lot of widowed women to the extent of 10 to 1 compared to widowed men correct or false how many of you know this ratio women widowed two word men ten to one okay a lot here a lot women outlive men because allah created them this way imagine if my wife dies may allah forbid they don't understand and i have to raise the children would i do a good job if i die she is the perfect one to take care of the children so this is mercy from allah so they are the majority of fuel fire due to their sins but mainly due to they are much much more than with men that is why allah permitted us to marry up to four because there there is always surplus a woman with dark cheeks stood up in the midst of the women and said why justify allah why are we the majority and the prophet justified this by saying because you complain too much and are ungrateful to your husbands then they started to give their jewelry in charity throwing their earrings and rings into bilal's cloak your clock is ready let's collect donations huh is this true ladies do you complain a lot raise your hands be truthful huh okay gents do women complain a lot yeah this is human nature this is human nature but it is dangerous because the prophet tells us it is one of the reasons of women going to hell so you have to try your level best to train yourself to coach yourself not to complain and we all see this so many times a very righteous practicing masha allah excellent in knowledge muslima would make this mistake why do you do this why do you always go to your mother's house you never sit with us you never do this you i i did this and that for you in the past no you never do this for for me you did this for that and she keeps on nagging she keeps on complaining and if asked in times of trouble how is uh your husband like alhamdulillah no he is he doesn't do enough this is unacceptable in islam this is one of the reasons of a woman going into hell you have to be appreciative you have to thank him you have to praise allah azza for what he has granted you and inshallah we will come to later on in the means of increasing the love this will be also mentioned or discussed again finally one of the rights of the husband that you advise him and you show him uh the right way um may allah be pleased with her on the occasion of her debia when the muslims did not comply with the prophet's order sallallahu sallam to shave their heads and to take off their haram she gave advice to the prophet what did she tell him in front of them go and shave and look what they do immediately the prophet went out of his tent he asked the man to come and shape once he started shaving the muslims almost killed one another they almost killed one another why they are so hasting to shave to one another and comply with the instruction or with the doing of the prophet where did he get this from from the beautiful advice of om salam now seriously speaking to the gents if your wife advise you see the sisters you know huh if the wife advise you do you accept this i i see heads nodding i see arms doing this yes or no yes one two three four alliance excuse me excuse me do your husbands accept your advice raise your hands masha'allah they cannot lie then there is masha'allah human nature men are arrogant by nature there are arrogant they will never ex accept an advice from a woman especially the wife why because they think they are inferior to them they're insects we can step on them seriously women are like this allah created them so that we can step on them how do you feel like this i know a lot of men would find it extremely uh acceptable for a child to advise them for a friend in the office to advise them for a share to advise them for their cousins to advise them their appreciative the minute the wife speaks or say ah but this is haram immediately they start to grow you know horns and it becomes red in a tail and a fork they become devilish why and they become defensive like the cat immediately she is telling you why not go to the first row of the masjid the call for advan was ten minutes ago by the time you go and reach a matching it will be akama why don't you go and attain the first tech beer what would the husband say what do you know i know when the akama is why do you remind me do you see i'm going to a nightclub i'm going through the masjid where do you think i'm going why why are you fighting no she always does this to me type she's she's insulting you she's reminding you what that girlfriend is she is reminding you to go and get the reward of the first row of the first bill yes but she's always accusing me as if i'm not going to pray you're too sensitive you accept worse things from people but you don't accept a small advice nasiha from your wife subhanallah is this a proper movement no i tell you he's not what would this mean who behaves in this fashion do if his wife practices the hadith what hadith the prophet says absalom may allah have mercy on a woman who wakes up in the middle of the night performs wudu and goes to her husband wakes him up to pray to raqqa's night prayer and if he doesn't wake up sprinkles water on his face and if they pray to raka's they will be registered with allah azzawajal this arrogant man if his wife wakes him up honey let's pray with you together what time is it fajr no no no night prayer go away i want to sleep and she wants to do the sunnah so she brings a little that that was the last thing she saw for four days boom is this acceptable where is your love for the sunnah seriously speaking who among you prays to rakhas at night with his wife alhamdulillah okay very big problem if the problem is from you you have a big problem alhamdulillah but if the problem is from him you have a bigger problem because this means that your husband needs a lot of counseling so you have to start to write your strategies how to change my husband it's not something that you switch on and off your husband if he's like this it's not an injection or a pill he takes and masala he becomes good no this means i have to make a strategy maybe six months to a year long on how to change his perspective how can i change his mentality how can i have him accept what i say to him sometimes if you go directly to your husband and say do this or this is haram don't do this he'll become arrogant and he will refuse sometimes you have to show as if you are ignorant yourself i don't know what's right this or that and the problem if you have a smart husband said ah you want me to no no no no i will not accept this al-hasan what hussain may allah be pleased with them so a man an old man performing evolution in the wrong way leaving parts and they're young kids so they discussed it with each other and went to the man they said uncle i have a dispute with my brother i don't know we don't know which one is in compliance to the sunnah in wudhu so please be the judge and one performed buddha the other was better they're both performing the sunnah so who's the best uncle he said my sons you have taught me how to perform he wasn't doing the word properly so they invented this way so be polite in advising you as a wife you're smarter allah allah in the quran said that the shaitaan our friend the shaitaan has weak plotting for women he said so your plotting is far greater than shaytan's plotting use your heads use your strategy use your intellect you become inshallah the happiest spouse and wife ever uh okay i think this is enough yeah so we went through this uh advise him you have to advise him innovate make means of good invitational login we have 10 minutes we can take few questions shall is there any questions online we'll check it up till i get a question you said that it is not the duty of a woman to look after her parents what happens when a couple has only daughters and after their marriage the parents are left alone this is a problem but again allah tells her to obey her husband so it is not the problem of the daughter the responsibility of the daughter is to take care of her husband and her family to obey her husband if she is able to convince her husband alhamdulillah personally speaking with the uh grace of allah once again this is a call from now with the grace of allah azzawajal i give an open permission to my wife to go take care of her old and needy father and i gave her that for about two three years she used to spend the whole day and i was very happy because she would leave the house empty and she's cool i have no problem with that but seriously speaking yes i will put myself again in her shoes which is much smaller than my feet and i would put myself if my mother or father were in the same position would i ask her permission and would i want her to allow me to spend more time with them and the answer would be definitely so i would like to treat her the same way i would like to be treated but if your husband not son if your husband insists or no i want you to stay home to take care of me to take care of my children it is an obligation what happens sheikh if my father and mother don't have anyone except me then i have to choose between my husband and my parents this is your choice if you want to see color separation if it reaches to that extent this is your right this is something that is not black and white but if there is alternative alhamdulillah try to divide work between you and your siblings so one week for each and this would become one week one week a month inshallah it is bearable question from online a person is afraid of committing cena and wants to get married however he doesn't have means to get married can he take a riba based loan to get married no he should fast or he should borrow or he should take zakah riba is unacceptable at all to the extent that i personally asked sheikh hamid may allah have mercy on his soul i told him i have a friend and he was diagnosed with an illness and he needs an operation and no one is willing to do the operation free and no one is willing to lend him money can he borrow with riba to save his life and the said no i said sheikh if we are stranded in the desert and we have no food except pork or a dead meat or a donkey can we eat from that he said yes it's stated in the quran what's the logic i have a an illness and i need to be operated and no one would give me money except the bank with interest so isn't this similar he said no i said this explain please he said when you eat from that pork are you going to survive the answer is yes i will not be hungry i will not die of hunger when you operate can you guarantee that you will survive or the operation would be successful i said no and then he said this is not permissible at all so for this brother getting married is not as critical as having an operation online you discussed about seeking permission for voluntary fast is it only for the fast or does it apply to other nawa field ibadat no no no the hadith is clearly pointing for fasting however if a woman wakes up in the middle of the night and wants to pray for three four hours does she have to seek the permission of her husband no but if he wants her she has to interrupt her her prayer because the prayer is voluntary and answering him is is mandatory like in the story of juraj you know the story of juraj his mother is calling him juraid and he's saying oh allah my prayer or my mother and he neglects his mother scholars all say he must have interrupted his prayer and answered his mother and this needs explanation you have i'm praying at my house voluntary prayer and my father calls me or my mother calls me should i interrupt or not no you have to explain you have to elaborate if i know that my father or mother would not understand that i was praying and they will be angry with me i have to interrupt my prayer but if i know for sure that if i continue my prayer and after i finish i told them that i was praying sorry they will acknowledge and have no problem with that then i must con continue my prayer question from islamic university malaysia if before a man promises a woman's father that after marriage he would allow her to continue her studies and he breaks this promise is it permissible for the girl's father to demand that his daughter should be sent back to him in order to her complete the studies the question is clear a condition that is permissible mentioned in the contract that my daughter has to continue or complete her studies and the husband to be agreed after the marriage a year or six months this husband says no i don't want you to continue your study you have you have to stay home does the wife or her father have the right to demand this the answer is definitely yes yes it's it's a condition you accepted it i changed my mind changing mind divorcer they they and i don't i don't know but i don't believe that a sound woman and a a wise woman would request her divorce rather than completing her studies but it's her right if she made it the condition the man has to honor that condition if he doesn't she has the right to demand separation in some place there is a custom of the husband staying with the wife's family and his in-laws is this also justifiable please explain as for justifiable in the means of halal haram is it permissible for a man to stay it at his in-laws house or the opposite for a woman to stay at her in-laws house the answer is yes there's nothing haram in it it's permissible but it is it the ideal thing to do it depends sometimes your in-laws can be the sweetest people on earth and it's only your mother-in-law and father-in-law she they have only one daughter so there is no problem of mahram and you live with them they give you your quarters and they honor you and they feed you they take care of their daughter and their daughter take care takes care of them what is wrong with that has a beautiful life i don't i don't mind doing that but if there are other sisters in law in the house if the father and mother in law always humiliate me son when will you get a job son when will you do this do that dude this would cause a lot of friction no this is not needed have your dignity and honor live elsewhere but if they are ideal masha'allah they're perfect there's nothing wrong with that the other way around it's the wife's right so if you want your wife to stay with your parents it's her rights if she waves uh waivers that right she says okay i know i have no problem but if she says no i'd like so many times a woman would like to wear something sexy for her husband how can she do this if the house is not hers she can do it in the bedroom bedroom she lives in the bedroom she sleeps she stays there 24 hours it's not a nice life to live so she needs to have privacy and she cannot do this except in her own house and lana's best does your wife have a right to refuse or aspen's fish for her children to go to go his house wish what kind of a husband's fish is he yes sorry what what kind of a wish for our children to go to go waves because a man has two or more wives does the wife has the right to prevent her children from visiting their stepmother and the answer is no she doesn't it's the decision of the husband you have no right in telling me where and not to take or not take my my children she says no no no you married the second wife i don't want my children to see her that's your problem you may not see him i may not force you to sit with my second wife or third wife but you have no control over your children because this is their stepmother i'm their father they have to know each other my friend is getting married to a person not knowing that he is not well mannered man but he prays he fast and does have beer too so should i inform her parents to inquire about him i am sincerely worried yes you have to it's a must a lot of bad marriages takes place because of your betrayal to your friends i get someone asking me uh do you know so-and-so said yes i know him he proposed to my sister what do you think of him i think to myself i know that he drinks alcohol i know he fornicates but inshaallah allah will guide him i said no masha'allah is a good man inshallah inshallah and after the marriage she discovers two weeks later she divorced whose mistake is it i testified falsely and this is a major sin you have one of two options if someone asks you the best option if he trusts you if someone comes to me shaykh asam do you know so and so and i say yes i know him he proposed to my sister what do you think now i know that this guy trusts me he knows that i am not proposing to his sister so there is no conflict of interest i tell him do not give him married marriage he is not good he says why i said listen you ask my opinion he's not good zero i'm not gonna back bite him but if he does not trust me if i'm a stranger to him and he says what do you think of this person i have to tell him if i tell him don't give him in marriage he may not believe me i will tell him no this guy drinks alcohol this guy has a very bad temper he i know a friend of mine he uh reorganized his facial features after a fight i he curses a lot he abuses his parents i have to say this because this is my responsibility when i want to ask about someone proposing to my sister or to my daughter how would i want him to answer me it's the same thing usually by the way when i uh ask people about people proposing to my daughters i would ask them the final question if this man proposes to your sister would you give him a marriage if he pauses i know i understand some of them says yes yes i will give him a marriage no this ah means is no good them all of them alhamdulillah would immediately say yes by allah if i had the sister i would give to him this means that i accept your testimony a sister lives with her husband and his mother-in-law and father-in-law yeah for her mother-in-law she made a mistake here okay in our society it is very common for the man to live with his parents even after marriage the sisters problem is even though she has her own bedroom and bathroom it is very difficult for her to adjust with her in-laws food habits and other general habits her husband understands but it is very difficult to move to a separate accommodation as it will break many hearts please advise the same the same answers if you are unable to uh to adjust if you are unable to uh uh suppress your feelings and and and and get acquainted with their habits and traditions you have the right to request to leave and the husband is comply to provide you with a separate house and you should compromise come on don't let your husband be stuck between a rock and a hard place give him options so you have your own bedroom and bathroom and you're unable to adjust to your in-laws customs try to isolate yourself a little bit don't throw yourself 100 try only to have lunch with them breakfast and dinner have it in your quarters on your own terms one day with them one day alone try to do something that would make life more pleasant to you but at the same time would please your husband as well what is the ruling of giving quran as mahat and giving tea and biscuit and samosa as walima which is not a proper food claiming simple marriage scholars differed but as you know our point of reference is the hadith of the prophet and in the hadith the prophet salallahu when one of his companions proposed to a woman who wanted to give herself to the prophet and the prophet assam did not want uh her the man said oh prophet of allah give her to me meaning that let me let me uh be the one who uh marry her and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said do you have anything to give her and she and he said no i don't have anything so he said ali go and fetch even if you can a ring made off of iron and the man said i don't have any i can't even find a ring of iron and then the prophet said allah do you have anything of the quran and they said yeah i know and so and so so the prophet said i give her to you in marriage with what you have from the quran meaning that you will teach her so this is the uh easiest and clearest evidence that it is permissible to have the quran as a mahar now regarding biscuits and tea and coffee as being a walima there isn't any specific food to be cooked when the prophet alaihis married i'm not able to recall he made some wheat and some bread and no meat and some dates and he made a walima but in the hadith of abdul rahman ibn awf may allah be pleased with them when he got married the prophet told him make a walima even if one one sheep so if the prophet says even if one sheep means that this is the minimum acceptable of course though to those who can afford it because could have afforded when he came to the prophet islam he told him how much did you give her as a dowry he said i gave her the weight of a date's seat in gold and subhanallah as if you take money from the mountain and he the prophet thought that this was too much too expensive i got a question yesterday from one of the sisters i i i it's in my laptop and she's saying that the mahar they she gives to the man is 17 something which is four grams in gold what is it something in weight like sovereign yes she says she she gives 75 sovereigns plus 100 000 rupees i forgot the question i took my calculators in how much i would make so 4 grams meaning 300 grams of gold plus 100 000 rupees 300 grams of gold that is a lot of money and it's given to the man this is haram this is extravagant and it is not permissible to contr to have this as a a part of the uh marriage so the best and the best the better the the cheaper the the fewer not the cheaper cheap is not a good word the less costly marriage is the best it is for inshallah their marriage will take one question online can a husband can a husband deny his wife from having children for a time length of two or three years his reason being the other children are too young and the wife should learn more about islam to teach the children can he force her to use contraceptive against her will to stop her from getting pregnant pregnancy is the right of both so stopping the pregnancy must be mutual it cannot be one-sided i got a question two nights ago from a sister who's a revert and i was shocked she says i have three children and my husband insists that i use contraceptives because he doesn't want at the time being any children and she says this is normal she says i've been married for three years here so she has two-year-old child one-year-old child and a newborn child she's a revert and she wants more and the husband is putting the brakes he said come on three years married and we have three children so she asked me what's the ruling on cheating on him and not taking uh contraceptives so allah i i said to myself i wish our wives our all our women that were like this the more you have children the more allah will provide for you and the more you will rest is that true or wrong the no the more you will rest the more daughters you have the less work you do in the in the house the chair they contribute seriously if if they're boys then the husband will rest you go the great bring the groceries you take your brother to school and you do this you do that and you're like a king in the house so the answer is the ideal answer is it is not permissible for one spouse to force his opinion over the other it has to be a mutual decision so if the woman wants uh more children and the husband says no let's wait for a year or two this is permissible and i advise her to listen to her husband unless she gives him the approval to get married again and i don't think any woman would do that so i i assume that this is best for the children one year to two years pause is very good so that the mother when she gets pregnant again she is fit and strong i apologize because it's going to take one or two minutes for me to explain this okay providing i can understand it take your time uh there are places i won't generalize it but at least two three cities that i know or maybe towns the normal situation over there is when a daughter is married they are given a house so these are people who are very religious they are very religious they run madrasahs they run jamaats and masha'allah but they fail to recognize that this is a dowry when i when we keep telling them they say no it is just a house it's just a gift the problem here for me is maybe my understanding could be wrong so i wanted to clarify everybody in that place gives a house as a gift does that become dowry my opinion is yes because it is it is no nobody asks nobody talks about it but it is implied it is just implied in the air that you have to have a house for a daughter each four daughters four houses people who are rich they say i have the money i am giving people who are middle class one house they can build other house shamelessly they ask for money it is okay with the people who are religious it is okay with the people who are not religious for every other religious aspect they will fight but for this they are unanimous everybody is silent why the reason they give is sister my daughter will suffer in the husband's house sister i can't let my daughter to go to her husband's house there will be problems so i call him to my house every single man has no problem these are religious men who have no problem to live with their wives and they don't take it as a burden even if it's a burden they will struggle and give five houses but they won't say no this is a dowry this is un-islamic the question is understood you took two a minutes and 75 seconds so i was joking i did not count that but it was approximately i got your question and your concern is in its place when it becomes the norm among the people they don't declare it's a dowry but they practice it it becomes a doubted but this similar question was posed to me through the internet through i don't know somewhere recently they say that they register the house in the name of the girl so the father of the girl is giving his daughter a house so if a divorce takes place the husband does not take anything in this case it's not a dowry is it no because i i am the the owner of the house my daughter is the owner of the house so i have no problem the problem is when i give the man something this becomes a dowry so if my understanding is correct then this is inshallah okay is it permissible for the man to go and ask and beg and consider it an insult if someone does not of his relatives or friends give him something is it permissible no it's not permissible you have to have your dignity so i don't want my my daughter to suffer well choose someone who would not make her suffer make it a condition uh when someone proposes that she does not live with your parents she lives in a separate house no matter how small that house is as long as it is a respectful and they they call it bait shari bait a house that is accepted islamically then it's okay i hope this you're telling even if the house is in the girl's name it is not a dowry no but everybody is doing it like dowry is when i give the man money the sovereigns the rupees the car it's all in his name this is dowry but if it's if i'm a rich man and my brother a son-in-law is renting an apartment of four rooms or three rooms and i come and say listen i'm giving my daughter a gift the whole furniture is on me to my daughter so if anything happens when my daughter is divorced may allah forbid she takes everything this is halal but if the woman does not have a house she is not proposed at all i won't give the background of what is happening that's right sister please sister it's not an argument time you post a question shake answer no sorry i just said we have to carry on we have other questions just one minute one minute please the if if a girl does not have the house she will not have proposals it is to that degree this is wrong this is a wrong practice that we have to fight however i cannot fight this wrong practice by asking a father who's wealthy not to do any good to his daughter i cannot fight a mistake with another mistake two wrongs never make a right so we will have to stand up and and face the people and say this is wrong you should not make this as an instruction a woman who is unable to her father is unable to furnish her or give her with a house should not be unmarried you should brothers should propose practicing brothers should propose but at the same time i cannot go to a father and say okay stop supporting stop doing stop giving your daughter anything okay you have to embarrass me put my other glasses i think okay this is arabic but it is for poor arabic and i'm unable to understand it uh this is a comment that she is benefiting from what i am saying alhamdulillah and this is not my own saying i am not i'm not inventing it this is quran and sunnah and some personal experience now we move on to we will try to finish as quick as possible we don't have much left alhamdulillah [Music] we would like to know how to increase the love between the spouses how can we increase the love i i hear brothers remembering there isn't any love what do you want to increase it doesn't exist anymore not only there is there has to be so to those who increase love or okay this is the first point very good now how to increase the love if you want to impress your wife bring her diamonds bring her gifts and if a woman wants her husband to be pleased with her she gives him gifts the prophet said this this is a hadith so it increases the love without any dispute about that but now you have to choose the right gift you don't come after a month when you're traveling and say my dear wife i married someone to help you in the house what kind of a gift is this no you don't do this as a wife you do not give for example your husband paste and toothbrush as a gift this is not a gift this is an insult why are you doing this because my mouth smells bad he is not stupid so you should find something that suits him a small thing they would adore a lot i'm telling you about my experience with brothers if you buy a necklace that is chic beautiful and not not necessarily expensive wallahi they adore it but be careful this is a warning take a picture of it with your mobile and keep it with you and every few nights look and memorize it because one day she will come and say to you how does it look and the shoes no it's not the shoes the hair no it's the dress and you say beautiful she says very you know cunningly what is beautiful and you say i all of you all of you so no no specifically do you recognize it and they will come and haunt you i know so you have to be witty you have to be quick and you remember what you give her and believe me they will be proud for 10 years i know this with my wife she's always saying do you remember this watch of course my honey she said you brought me this watch on that year when that okay definitely definitely so try to remember the gifts men don't care what life you give them 100 gifts and you remind them you give me i don't remember women are very sentimental always and this is killing us men you know my wife comes said do you know what day this is i suffered for 15 years and then on the sixteenth year whenever she asked me these questions of course it's an anniversary she knows i don't allah i don't know what year i married i don't know what is the date i don't know i don't even remember it because we are men we don't women they know when the first child was born in which hospital what was the day they know when you first engaged in the engagement and when was the contract and when the marriage was consummated everything that is yes and the dress should you remember this yes of course how can i forget so you try your best to cater this need now this is not a deficiency in women this is how allah created them now a good smart manager a good husband knows how to exactly do this now shaykh you said anniversary is it permissible to celebrate anniversaries in islam question is answer is no it is not she's not celebrating she's asking do you know what day it is but it would definitely add a lot of value if you show that you remember not bring a present not bring red rose not bring a cake because all this celebration is not permissible in islam no birthdays no anniversaries the thought of it is good inshallah okay what else oh or before yeah okay assigning a time to listen to one another hadith um you know this hadith it's a beautiful hadith long hadith very difficult hadith for us arabs it is extremely difficult why it's more difficult than the classical arabic it is the top of arabic is so complicated that we have to have a dictionary to read it and this was a story that the aisha may allah be pleased with her was telling the prophet along hadith about 10 women sitting together each woman describing her husband and the language described is so short to explain it you need a page or two for each woman and the qualities of men and how this man is so angry the whole this man is so tolerant how until it came to um and to read the hadith with this language it's a page and a half i will not listen to my wife for a page and a half one line maybe two lines maximum but allah a page and have this a lot of time the prophet was listening and then he commented uh omzara was married to a man was perfect man his everything is excellent but he saw another woman so he divorced her and married that woman and then she was married to another man and that man was so generous he gives her money without any expense and he does whatever he she wishes him to do but she loved the first one and she said whatever this man did could not be compared to the first man so the prophet is commenting to aisha and saying i shall i will i am to you like abu zarah to um the first husband to you i am in generosity in love and care i'm like him to you but i do not divorce because abuser divorce his wife scholars say that this is extremely needed among the spouses and if you ask the women they complain painfully that their men do not listen to them they do not have quality time is this true sisters raise your hands your husbands almost everybody why i know we do not like chit-chatting we find it difficult to chit-chat and she's speaking to you and and your mind is saying what is this fm radio am radio can i change a channel so what what do you do you open the newspapers mm-hmm and she's speaking to you and some of the yani wise and witty women when this is happening she says you're a donkey you do you're a monkey you do not understand and he says yes this is very bad this is very bad men the i'm talking about myself the minute i enter the house i open my laptop i have questions questions questions questions i have to answer and these questions are a lot but with the grace of allah it increases my knowledge if i don't answer questions my knowledge drops so i have to research every now and then something that i thought it was right when i researched it it was wrong i correct it alhamdulillah but this gets on the nerves of my kids when my mobile rings in saudi it always rings alhamdulillah questions and while i'm eating while i'm sleeping not sleeping i am lying down resting while i'm reading while i'm asked it's always bluetooth i never carry a phone because it's easier i can have two hands so i answer and the minute it rings my daughters start to fight with me don't answer it's full time don't answer sit with us i'm sitting with you i never leave home i never leave home i'm all the time like a woman in the house only if i go to masjid or if i go to the gym every now and then or to do shopping i don't have friends i don't go out it's all circles of knowledge and coming back because i don't like to but actually when i'm at home i'm not at home i'm with this with that with answering and this is bad that is why so many times i try to discipline myself turn it off now it's food let's eat let's talk you have 25 minutes seriously 25 minutes sometimes i increase it to one hour one hour i leave oh we didn't sit with you two hours oh come on it's just like five minutes they will never be fed up with you they will love this from you so you have to have this quality time i'm not talking about the children i'm talking about your wife she has to have someone to listen to because if you don't don't do this she's going to resort to something else her friends her mother her family and you don't want this communicate with your wife likewise the women must listen to the men when this is rare the women have to remember that allah created one mouth and two ears what does that mean you should listen more you should listen more so give him time to express this is difficult no way that you will be able to immediately open the heart of your husband it needs a lot of training so don't interrogate him don't investigate let him share every now and then few things with you and by time inshallah he will open up and speak and then you will have a beneficial dialogue i personally envy those who can sit with their spouse over a cup of tea seriously i have in-laws i have brothers-in-laws who masha allah sit for two hours and three hours just chit-chatting with their wives come on be a man man what is this and he said the most beautiful time in my life is when i sit with my wife and have tea and some biscuits or go to a hill a restaurant there and a nice view and no one is with us and we're talking talk about what see people differ there are people who express their love by talking there are people who express their love by actions you should know that your husband loves you and you should know that your wife loves you but the different way of expression makes a difference sometimes i want my wife to express it verbally but she doesn't she pres expresses it in actions by sacrificing by refusing to go to places she loves because she wants to stay with me i have to be appreciative of this and likewise with the misses among the ways that increase the love something that we lack we miss the warm reception when arriving departing and on the phone the husband is met usually by smiling knockouts i leave my house i travel a lot to the uk and i said this in the uk and every brother said i go to the hotel and the receptionists women they are selected women with a big smile i go to the street and i see billboards dressed or undressed with a big smile i go to the office if i work in a mixed office and the secretary the colleagues the women always good morning good morning big smile i come to the house at the end of the day tired and i find a big frown why are you late the sink is not working you should have fixed it one week ago you always go to your mother you always play cricket you always do this what am i going to do there is no food in the refrigerator and i did not put my bag yet i'm at the door and she said i know you're tired put your bag and i will continue this is extremely wrong you will never increase the love you will decrease the love and you will increase the hatred a woman a wise woman is never like this a wise man is never like this the prophet he is the most man of all men before going to salah he kisses his wives and urwab nazir said to aisha when she said this hadith that the prophet islam may have kissed his wife and went to salah without performing wudu he said he's her nephew he said by allah it's you right and she smiled in in bashfulness you know i don't have to say this is how you should meet each other the children in the house had never seen a father kissing his wife why oh kids don't kiss her french kiss a case on the cheek a case on the forehead it it it gives emotions but when you're from far away coming from travel after two three weeks trip i say salaam alaikum how are you stranger to you the kids are there embrace her kiss her yeah miss you when you go to prayer when you come from prayer sheikh wallach is not uh how do you recuperate recuperating reciprocating reciprocating yeah she's not reciprocating i'm doing it and she's that's it do it for a week and you will find the difference when she calls on the phone yanni okay let's let's make a survey who among the brothers is received by his wife with greeting and when he departs is also a given farewell in a nice and beautiful way one two three four five six seven eight okay nine nine huh okay sisters who is received by the husband when coming and leaving by the husband's initiative not you coming to him he is coming to you and greeting you okay we have like seven six but the f two third here not a single hand then you men have a problem yes we don't have emotions shared they sell you know ram chip that has emotions you can install this it's not very expensive we come to the phone how do you receive your wife's phone call when it comes no yes no okay what is this i know some of the brothers on his mobile phone you will find conan the investigator you know the cartoon film conan do you have it here or not conan is a japanese investigator who was a grown-up man took a portion something and made him look like a child but he's an investigator a private pi so the brothers have it ah i said who's this conan this is my wife why did you put her name conan said you don't know my wife others put a ringtone ambulance or emergency so all everybody's ringtone is normal but when you say he knows that this is his wife this is now okay you may laugh but this is not laughable this is true and it shows you what's in the heart jani i know brothers who write on on on on the mobile my love the love of my life you know words that would make us men he's feminine i know sisters related to me that write about their husband this this is how it should be one of my brothers whenever he he's not going to watch this uh whenever he uh calls his uh or his wife calls what is this yes honey yes i love you too and i will yeah yeah oh no did this happen oh he's so emotional he he contributes which is extremely great it shows you what a good man he is we should have this among us because if we don't then we have a big problem in our houses when when the feelings dry the love leaves you have to keep you know watering the tree otherwise it's going to die and that is why i know people in their early 70s and they have so much love between them it's unbelievable they love each other yeah 70 years well i would i don't know but they have this love why allah bless them by these beautiful words and that's why allah azzawajal says in ayah 53 in surah israel tell my servant to say what is best why allah says it is shaytan's worth to make problems and feuds among them so always say the good thing and the best thing to your wife of course you have to include in this avoid interrogation do not interrogate your husband do not interrogate your wife don't make them feel under pressure make things go and inshaallah your life would be better the minute he enters the house okay this is the same complementing your partner individually and also while with the relatives and considering the partner as a blessing of allah who among you men compliments his wife constantly in front of his parents and and in-laws as well alhamdulillah masha'allah sisters who compliment her husband in front of her parents and also in front of his parents oh very little no very little it's considered to complaining and being not being uh grateful watch out i find it one of the best ways of capturing the heart of the wife no matter what happens when she when her parents come i compliment her above the skies seriously and even if i fought with her or i was displeased with her after her parents leave she comes and apologizes and kisses my head and says i'm sorry i don't know what to do why because of my reaction what my action to her i remember my my father-in-law once may allah have mercy on him he died last year he was with me and his daughter i see we're married with 27 28 years now alhamdulillah it's like lifetime alhamdulillah and he i was you know joking with him he's getting a little bit older than i am but we have really a bond between us and i gave him two lines of poetry beautiful lines they are the only lines i memorized i say to anyone everyone in arabic it says by allah the son has never risen nor sit down except mentioning you that is my wife my loved one is coming with my breathing and i've never sat down with people except you being the subject that i speak about in arabic it's very powerful my father-in-law's eyes watered and he said enjoy akbar do whatever you want i remember it till today he said do whatever you want with this love do whatever you want i don't do anything but look at the joy i entered in his house with less than 20 seconds can you do this doesn't take much shaytan takes a lot oh how can i make him happy he did this to me he did that to me last year he instructed this when i wanted to get married he put obstacles in my body you will never you would never live if you have grudges controlling infesting your heart you'll never have a happy life not only with your spouse but also with your neighbors with your relatives with on my facebook page i think three four days ago a man came to me and said i i wrote this i don't know if you have read it or not i don't advise you to go to facebook by the way but i wrote this and i got a lot of feedback of people i appreciate it people are so sensitive one came and said i have not spoken to my brother in 15 years why he said allah he he invited his friends for awalima and he didn't invite me so i'm punishing him he said okay and my cousin i haven't spoken to in 10 years why he said i went into a a room he was there he didn't stand up to to greet me he greeted me while sitting down like i do i never stand up usually to people when they come in the prophet did not love this ali sosa and he said you know i have five children i didn't speak to my wife since the third child the two children i don't know how they came i think it was on mute definitely vibrator would not do and there are people like this there are people who make you feel under pressure when they're with you oh i can't say this i can't say that if i do something i can see it in their faces why if you like if you are like this you will not live and you will not make people live with you change yourself be more flexible accept the shortcomings of others so others would accept your own shortcomings do not compare a lot of the problems that happen a lot of the love is gone when you compare compare what when you when i compare between my two wives if i have two wives and i go to one and say ah this one doesn't know how to cook like the other one this one does not know how to be hospital like the other one women are different one is so hospitable so generous that when guests come to my house i feel ashamed because of this generosity and they feel overwhelmed the other one is normal coffee tea and that's it and if i say no no no need for coffee she she doesn't insist the other one no she brings food from outside she brings this catering to honor me so if i compare i start to love someone and hate the other if a woman compares her husband to my brother-in-law is much better than my husband he takes my sister all the time out mine doesn't he gives her jewelry mine doesn't he does this she only compares the good things but never compares the shortcomings which is very very bad this decreases the love what to do it's a reality it's a fact put your hand on the eyes that seize the good things in others and look at their shortcomings and compare a sister called me and said cher my husband never ever said to me i love you it's okay do you know my wife she said no okay what do you want so he never showed his feelings and i want to seek divorce from him and she complains about these things feelings and i said to her okay let me ask you a question what are the good sides what are the good things about him she said no mashallah is practicing he's a cher he is very very generous he's very very kind he always treats my family in an excellent way but he doesn't have feelings sheikh i tell her allah you should be beaten with a slipper or with a shoe why sheikh why is that i said i received last week calls from women complete complaining that their husbands abuse drugs another one she broke into tears because her husband commits adultery in her house and he told her she's practicing woman by the way and and she complained and she complained she complained he told her do like i do and leave me alone and she committed adultery she is crying blood i can't see her she says sheikh i am wearing gloves i am wearing hijab in my family i am the sheikh i am the ayalima but i fell in this calamity because of my husband she started to cry you know hysterically and i'm telling this sister who's complaining about the lack of feelings i say are you crazy with a man like this you're thinking of divorce what happens if allah azza gives you the real true calamities so do not compare the good things between your husband and the others do the rest do do do the opposite compare the worst things with the good things of your husband then you would start to appreciate the nerma the blessing likewise for the brothers my wife is this and that she's not i don't have feelings to her and i don't think that she's beautiful i'm thinking of marrying okay let's look at the good sides what what about uh your wife oh masha allah she is my mother adores her my father loves her she she is very generous good cook a while ago i was driving a man came to me and gave me from behind high and low beam this is to open the road the whole was so open so he kept on horning and and and doing this i parked and got off to fight i'm i'm and i i'm scary when i'm in the car i'm small but if i come out people and the guy says himself okay it's a fat way it's not a fight okay no problem what do you have shaykh i have a problem i want to divorce my wife said why he said i don't have love for her well this happened in the street i said you don't have love for her how long you've been married he said two years and and plus and i have one daughter and i say okay what are the bad things in your wife i said nothing very religious very kind not extremely beautiful attractive my parents love her she loves us she loves me a lot so i said yes so i don't have any feelings for her what kind of a stupid man is this i told him you watch satellite channels he see yes i have it at work this is why you see all these red white blue colored women coming to you and you start to compare so you don't know how much allah azza has blessed you with and that is why because of your sin the minute you compare this is what happens lower your gaze appreciate allah's gift to you and the guy immediately says now come to think of it look where shaytan is driving me so do not compare among the things that make love increase is when you make your wife feel that you are moderately jealous jealousy we spoke about that i'm not gonna reinvent the wheel make your wife feel jealous because sometimes women do things deliberately to make you jealous and if you don't show your jealousy they will go to the second level and the third level until something bad happens you should always show her that no i don't want you to talk to your cousin male cousin my wife comes to me said can i speak to my uh my aunt's husband from her mother's side he's like 80 years or 75 years old i just want to give him salam islamically is it permissible especially when he calls how are you uncle so-and-so nothing is wrong with that i said no you don't speak to other men you want me to speak to other women immediately she smiles she feels that i'm jealous on the contrary he's 85 years old what is he gonna do but show her that you're moderately jealous and at the same time sisters you have to do what let him feel that you are a woman that you are feminine that you are weak you are vulnerable because if you do this if you show him that you depend on him he feels his manhood he feels that i'm a man and she is the one that needs my protection but if you don't do this you nag him you argue with him and you maybe fight with him he doesn't feel he doesn't see the reason of you becoming beautiful even if you're the most beautiful woman on earth if you don't have feminine in you i married a woman mum that didn't marry another man so you make him feel that you need him ah can you carry this can you do this it may burden him a little bit but he feels that when he does this and you thank him that he has done something that is good you should to increase the love you should cooperate you should devote time for the family do light activities so many times if you sit with your wife and buy a cupboard for example that you self-assembly do you have this like ikea so we do this at the home bring it i can pay a little bit more and have someone do it but it's fun when you sit with the family with the kids and you do it this yani increases the love if you start to discuss the future with them for example if i want to buy a new car i don't need anyone to advise me i know cars they don't know cars but i still insist to sit with them and say um khalas my old car is old i have to sell it and i'm thinking of buying a new car what about if i buy this car or do you have any suggestions they say yeah buy a rolls royce no buy an aircraft no and i said um yeah okay but the roads are not very good so i narrow it i narrow it i narrow it until they suggest the car that i want to buy ah well that's a good idea and i buy it think about the impact how would they feel they will feel that we've contributed in a decision that was very important to our father or to my husband and this is uh good number eight quality time we need a lot of quality time and this is spent with the spouse away from the children try your best for me it's easy alhamdulillah i brag about this because allah blessed me with it in saudi we're blessed romra time is open everyone comes from the whole world but there are two months in a year that no one can come from out of saudi arabia to make umrah so the month of muharram and safar hajj is over everybody is going back haram is empty madina is empty as well and also in the month of shawwal after ramadan this is the time where the rates are very low for us muslims for us saudi sorry we're all muslims no saudis are bigger muslims you know this is the season for us so i can get a very expensive and beautiful and five-star hotel room with cheap money i take my wife for one night no children spend the night there i take her for dinner in the restaurant it's gonna cost me an arm and leg i know but it's okay and i the one who serves her you do not move i bring her the food and it's very difficult it's very difficult especially in the breakfast i know i need eggs okay can i have some toast okay right i serve her 24 hours it's me serving it's not serving it's just in the restaurant but this leaves an impact eight to ten months later she remembers it why because this is quality time men spend your money wisely a night or two like this with your wife alone no kids no computers no laptops nothing just for talking and sharing some of the love this ignites love for a long long time the balance in being close and keeping your distance you have and i'm talking about the sisters in staying close and keeping a distance and dressing the brothers the brother is always by nature what keep their distance by nature they call us you stay there i'll stay in my room one week no problem a month five years alhamdulillah keep your distance on the contrary the sisters if it were to them they would put handcuffs to the husband so wherever he goes she goes with him she wants to be close to him now islamically no you have to put a line don't stay too far away every now and then come close and you do not choke him do not choke him and stay in his throat let him breathe give him some room not a lot of room but give him some room give him some time for himself and this adds a lot to uh the love insha allah the prophet says in the hadith love your loved one a little bit because some someday he might become your enemy and hate your enemy a little bit because someday he might become your loved one your ally and this is being a balance and in between among the great means of of increasing your love is sharing the pain and sharing the joy what is meant by that my daughter's father-in-law died yesterday or today so she's sad i tell my dog my my wife uh listen i'm sorry for your father anyhow don't think about lunch i'll eat outside in the afternoon i have to go to the gym and in maghrib we have a gathering with the with the friends so you go in for the morning is this acceptable how would the wife feel devastated my father dies and you go to sit with your friends and go to the gym and play football and watch tv no you have to share with her although you don't have any feelings pretend oh no no no i'm not going to the gym how can i he was so caring and loving i loved him as a father no no i'll be with you oppress yourself and also enjoy when he is happy when your husband is coming alhamdulillah i succeeded in securing a business deal alhamdulillah he's happy and you say why are you happy see i i managed to do this deal alhamdulillah will be getting money what will we do with the money will you give it to me nothing as usual you're going to put it in more investments and it's going to take more time to do jobs and and she kills the joy in me no you will not increase the love like this you have to share the joy and the pain and number 11 taking talking passionately and using love words that express the feelings now this is not on the phone huh this is in life when she comes in the room and no children are there give her a few hints it's us our time i'm waiting for asha give her give her something to feel wanted to feel desired you also when your husband comes out of the bathroom you know after having a shower doing this in front of the mirror a lot of the husbands do this pretending there is something i need a magnifying glass to see what are you looking at there's nothing if he does this give him a passionate word give him a word that shows that the fire is still on he said what fire we have fire extinguishers and it's nothing nothing no you want to increase the love you have to work for it and you do not have to say what is true lie if you have to fake it if you have to because this is permissible in our religion using preferred nicknames that are favored by your spouse this is important the prophet used to do this what did he call aisha the one with the red cheeks because she's very white and and she has red cheeks which makes her more beautiful so you should call your husband in a similar way fatso what's happening is this appropriate calling him shorty him with the name that he loves so call him boss some women call their husbands baba or abuna out of respect which is nice because but does this mean that she's giving the heart if he says go and ask mama so am i making her my mama no these words may be beautiful if he has a nickname for example my wife always my second wife not my first wife my eldest daughter his name is arwa so my second wife always calls me abu aruwa why because she knows i'm proud with my eldest daughter she she doesn't call me by her eldest daughter she calls me by my first eldest daughter because she thinks that this is any something that would make me happy so you should choose the best way to call your uh uh wife or spouse in a in a nice way your wife's name is uh fatima you call her fufu fifi or bb or whatever any name that she loves but don't always call her the name fatima yeah maybe this is a little bit give her a name that you both agree upon and they like playing and joking the prophet salallahu used to put the piece of food the morsel in the mouth of fatima and also he used to eat from the same place she ate from you have to joke and play with your spouse now this is something that is not very likable to the men they're very serious remember the prophet raised with aisha may allah be pleased the prophet used to eat from the same place she ate from used to drink from the same place she drank from which shows the love that she never forgot may allah be pleased with her not only that unfortunately a lot of the men have dry feelings they never play they never joke what does he say he says a wise man an intellectual man a man of scholar when he is among the people he should display his wisdom but when he is with his wife he should be like a child leave your wisdom in the masjid this is what he says why because in the house i'm not a scholar anymore this is what the prophet used to do with his wives and this is why they love each other but if you're seriously when she says honey call me mr assange don't use such words what life is this no you have to share a lot of easiness in the life you play and joke and all of this would add a value among the sisters who can't see you who is complaining from a frowning face and no smiles in the house raise your hands one believe me lying you're lying seriously the brothers who among you in the house rarely smiles or jokes and all the time is serious raise your hands it's impossible i know i receive hundreds of calls tens of thousands of emails i know you are lying or you're not watching yourself or you're laughing inside crying outside a lot of the sisters complain of this you have to joke you have to smile you have to share a lot of the playing and joking with your wife and your children as well saying words of encouragement and complementing your partner's effort while turning a blind eye to the partner's shortcomings this is one of the greatest ways i'm going to sit down this is one of the greatest ways of increasing the love which is the last point the wisest of men is the one who pretends to have not noticed and the dumbest and the most stupid of men is the one who indicates and shows and points out every shortcoming so many times your wife may do things that are wrong and you do not approve approve of them neglect your son your daughter may do the same if you stop at every single point you will lose them a sister called me a few days ago i don't know if she's watching or not this is a possibility inshallah she will forgive me she was complaining about her inability to communicate with her daughter and she says i cannot i'm unable to do this and i told her you have to force yourself and you have to ignore a lot of the bad things that they're doing in order to focus on the highest things so if you want your daughter to pray and if you want her to fast wear abaya wear gloves cover her face not listen to music not watch tv and not to have chatting or blogs or whatever can you do all of this on the spot you can't and if you continue to don't do this don't watch yourself when you this is not our topic our topic is not children our topic is parents or spouses but with the children when we notice ourselves if i notice myself i will list down hundred don't don't don't and maybe two or three dues so i am policing my children in a very bad way and that is why they are not accepting what we are advising them to because all what they hear don't do this no do that and we never take their opinion we never encourage them to do something that is good when my 10 year old daughter has a fight with my six-year-old daughter and the six-year-old comes in complaining she hit me she did this i shout at my ten year old daughter and i say why did you do this she's his younger sister she says she did this she did that she justifies i'm still angry because six years old or five years so what do i do i say did you pray for i am punishing her by praying this this is not the time to order her to pray of course i'm going to order her to pray but when i say this in this context she's going to relate praying as a punishment so likewise we have to try our level best to uh always look the other way with your spouse not every single thing wrong she does i'm going to no you did this you did this no don't do that likewise the husband no interrogation no picking the shortcomings and neglecting and you must also encourage so when my dog my wife makes food she puts the food i finish the food sometimes i forget my daughters remind me indirectly so they say masha'allah mama the food was good may allah bless your hands and the other one says may allah bless your hands the third one says may allah bless your hands i i get embarrassed if i say that i would be only parroting it so i would say after i finish masha'allah the food was great and so on this means that i i show my appreciation the three or four hours of work in the kitchen are justified now when i get groceries from the uh supermarket i pay a lot and it's a lot of of things to carry i don't have boys to carry it with me so i it's me going up and down going up and down and i bring my uh the things that i put it what does my wife say masha allah we have brought tired and made you a lot of trouble may allah bless you and increase your money increase your health what do you think i feel liar no i would feel very happy satisfied because i did something and i was complimented on it so you all the time not only your wife also your colleagues also your children when your children do something good always say masha'allah my youngest children's they're not going to watch this and they don't understand english i have a 10 year old 11 year old daughters one of them i called her usually the young guy the young guy why she's not even interested but i want to bring it up in her the other one always asks me questions why do we do this why is this haram why is this halal okay and masha'allah she understands 100 and she immediately implements it and she calls people to it so i encourage her whenever she does this masha allah when i go to my mother's house and she comes to me this is my beloved daughter masha allah i hate embracing girls but this is i have to do this i have to do this i have to i have no emotions but yes so you have to encourage if you want results the more beautiful words come coming out of your mouth you will find extreme benefit out of that complementing the food the clothes the appearance in general how beautiful or handsome one is so even you sisters when your husband is going to work he's fixing the tie masha'allah you look handsome sometimes you may tease him if he's overdoing it dressing going to a party to a any islamic party uh wedding or something you take skir jacket in the suit you show him some jealousy why are you doing this no no no no don't wear like this people will think that you are the the groom no don't do this he feels how would he feel he would be embarrassed when you say like this because he loves it likewise a man does to his wife which he is dressed masha allah what is this he reminded me of you 75 years ago without the wrinkles without uh overweight masha'allah no this yani you try your best to uh add value to her okay then we have to choose to increase the love what they love so i have six or seven types of cologne i know she hates this one i always put it on no i choose the cologne she likes and she chooses the cologne i like i choose to wear what she loves to see me in and i also would appreciate if she if she does the same to me see it is a shame a big great shame and you tell me if i'm right or wrong men tell me if i'm right or wrong isn't it a shame that my wife in the house wears normal clothes but when she goes out to a party she wears excellent clothes and makeup and she wears her hair when i see her says you're not going anywhere you're staying i cannot let you go but why doesn't she do this to me do you do you find the same problem that she dresses or overdresses when she goes out but in the house she doesn't dress properly raise your hands only one i believe you have a problem in sincerity you definitely you would not be in this class if your wives were dressing properly you came here to know what's happening and now you're lying you're saying that everything is masha'allah maybe subhanallah assume so it is a problem it is a problem that i always put my cologne and dress nicely to the people and not to my wife on the contrary she is the one that i should look good for her now this comes with manhattan respecting your partner's choice and method of thinking is it a must that i make my wife follow every single thing that i believe in she has to if i see haram she says haram if it says she says no she is not a cloned from you she has a different personality a different way of thinking yes you are the man if you say that this has to go it has to go but you cannot convince me that this is the way it should be if she has her own thinking and you differ with her try to convince her but if you can't respect her choice and this indicates that a woman is a human being in islam we know and acknowledge this in all civilizations in the christian uh church few hundred years ago they were in severe dispute whether a woman had a soul or not we know now alhamdulillah she doesn't but no no she does she does she does she does so islam honored women islam honored women so you as a man should respect the way she thinks also she should also respect the way you think this is your choice you bear the consequences but i tried my best you don't want alhamdulillah i respect whatever you choose okay respecting people's family uh people's affluent feelings what do you mean by respecting her feelings don't say whatever hurts the other do not say things that hurt sometimes the men have an art of hurting the feelings and the women may share the same art and this is wrong and this is bad so many times the brothers say things they don't pay any attention but it leaves a scar in the heart no scars on the body may heal scars in the heart how can you fix that being saying sorry it will never go likewise you should always try your level best to respect their feelings and avoid what be what might be humiliating not only that you have to respect the feelings of the family of your spouse and never say bad things about them as this leaves a big scar in your uh parents-in-law heart that is very difficult to remove and this is obvious a lot of us hear stories of course none of you abdullah have it i'm not going to ask you again a lot of the people say that my father-in-law did something and i will never forget him i'll forgive him for that and in so many times you do things to your father-in-law that would not be forgettable and life becomes more and more difficult because your wife has to choose between you and the man who is her father who brought her up who she only saw goodness out of him so don't make her make that choice stay away from destructive jealousy is this only for women mainly mainly it is for women but men also have it and it becomes so destructive that this jealousy becomes suspicion and maybe accusations and this destroys the life let alone the love between the spouses and finally turn a blind eye to mistakes and shortcomings sheikh we've mentioned this again we mentioned this right deliberately we mention it again because life does not go on without turning a blind eye don't focus on each and every mistake do not become a fly why fly falls only on trash so when you are a fly you only see trash no you have to ignore some of the sad things the bad things so that you may increase the love a little bit how much time questions because the last session khalas will take maybe 5-10 minutes and leave hisham we have two sessions and i will not go through the second one this is me apologies what to do yes touche yeah but this is one of the advantages of being a chef you can afford it i will not go through the second session because it involves a lot of yani uh rated x material and i don't feel comfortable discussing it you can see the notes inshallah it will give you an idea as for the first session now means or ways to reduce fights and tension it is a result of means of increasing so this is the opposite but with a little bit of change and alteration so we will go through it inshallah in a very fast uh pace number one i'd like to reduce the fights and tension between me and my wife what is the best way to do that to acknowledge the fact that a calamity is the result of sin why why do i fight with my wife why aren't we in love as we used to because there is sin between us not sin between us meaning i made a sin she made the sin allah through the hatred or the tension in our life may allah have mercy on his soul said i can recognize my sin in the behavior of my wife and in the behavior of my right my camel my horse if you write it go into your car and it doesn't work it breaks down why is this because of your sins muhammad even was from the taberin and they used to be able to count their sins because they were very very few now if i have a fight with my wife or my car breaks down i don't know so there's so many of them i cannot identify and this shows you the life we are living seriously this affects your marital life your sins i know a brother practicing brother masha allah but he has a weakness he always fights with his wife and not only that he says when i fight with my wife shaytan takes over me i said how say i leave the house angry i get in the car i put music to the lousest so that i can not think of my wife you listen to music what is this he said i never listen to music only when i fight with my wife now who's doing this shaytan is taking over him and that is why when you get angry what did the prophet say so if you have a fight with your wife what should you say listen to music so this is shaytaan taking over and taking control it's important that you live in the present time of reality instead of the past try not to change the world and to live with its shortcomings you want to reduce problems live at the present time do not live in the past what do we mean by do not do not live in the past uh where is that okay it will come in number five i will not elaborate so many times people think and compare you're not like the wife i married 10 20 30 years ago and she says you're not the same man i married five or ten years ago why because they're living in the past you think that the woman who was young and um immature who was pure who it was a novice huh she will stay like this no now after 10 years she is more wicked she is more experienced she knows the ins and outs you're not the one i married no try and live with the present don't live in the past and at the same time do not look at the shortcomings look at the good things so that life would continue thirdly always learn how to apologize even if you're not wrong even if you're not wrong apologize why why do i apologize she's wrong no you apologize no i'm not going to apologize yeah he apologized for me please just do it for me when you apologize when you are not wrong there will not be any problems because a hundred percent of the cases you're not wrong while 100 percent in her case she's not wrong who's wrong and this happens everywhere i am always right this is not the case with a shafter may allah have mercy of with him he says my opinion is most likely right with the possibility of being wrong and your opinion is most likely wrong with the possibility it might be right if you treat your wife like this you will live in harmony and you will have lesser tension and fights but if you're always saying i'm right and when i talk to her she says no he's wrong i'm right then you have a problem okay there is a hadith that i have here in arabic that is very beautiful authentic the prophet says should i inform you about your women in paradise she is the loving the fertile and there is another word which is the old raima and also another word i usually make fun out of it it's called and this is only used with enemy the fierce enemies so when i say to my wife and i laugh with her and when i say the prophet asked us to marry al-wadu del walud i made a mistake and i took a leduc it's not funny when she reacts to that but alhamdulillah so who is the prophet says she is now this is the movement of jannah she is the woman once being wronged to who's being wrong to her the husband the husband is doing her wrong he is the aggressor the prophet says she would take his hand and say i will not close my eyes until you are satisfied with me come on he's the aggressor he's the one who should apologize the prophet tells us that is why she is among the women of paradise she is the one who was wronged yet she goes to her husband takes her hand his hand and says i will not close my eyes until you are i will not sleep until you are happy with me and forgive me what kind of a woman does this is there a woman who can do this i know there are no no seriously i know there are women who fear allah and do this and i've seen like this alhamdulillah but of course the majority would jump on his stomach until he is out of breath but this is uh what it's it's beautiful see you have to manage by there is something in management called management by objective management by what is your objective okay very good also reduce and eliminate fights so you want to to reach jannah you want to eliminate your your stress and fighting this is what you have to do but if you look at it and then look for the result it's it will not be easy to implement look at your objective what is it janna go and ask her for forgiveness what's your objective reduce the tension and the fights i don't like fighting i don't like shouting i don't like nagging go and ask him for forgiveness even if he's wrong this will make life much better insha allah among the things that you do to reduce it is up uh suppress your anger so you have to repress it suppress it and do not let it show do not let it come out and this is not only in marriage in every aspect of life when people come and curse you and say bad things to you what happens to you my blood boils and then what i have to react why because if i do not react they will think think i'm a coward if i don't react to what she says she will think that i'm not a man i have to prove to her who is the man among us this is one i said this in before so i'm not going to say it again i don't know i said it here or getting old i say a lot of things i don't remember where i said it anyhow so you have to remember whenever you repress your anger you're always on top you have the upper hand and whenever you express it and say the word khalas you become enslaved to what came out of your mouth you cannot retract it you cannot pull it back it's gone so whenever you do this 10 minutes 20 minutes later everything will cool down you will appreciate this alhamdulillah i did not act upon my anger number five limit your dispute with your spouse and do not open old files and old problems so i have a fight with you we have a heated discussion regarding me not caring about your feelings for example or me not going to visit your parents i don't want to visit your parents why oh do pulling and taking what usually happens out of experience we're discussing something that deals with the kids all of a sudden the mrs opens the archive six years ago in five months you did this and that you said this and that what about your mother when she did this and did that what about you when you slap me on the face subhanallah we're just discussing an issue and she makes how many thousands of issues does this reduce tension or increases it it increases it severely always be objective always limit your dispute to what we're discussing don't bring old files one brother complains that he's been married for so long but whenever anything happens with his wife she tells him you did this and you did that long ago like 15 20 years ago so i asked him okay why don't you repent and stop doing it he says i stopped doing that thing 15 years ago but every time we fight she brings it up i had a sister rivert calling me saudi and she said that she was married for about 20 years the children mashallah the husband in the first four years of their life was very ignorant all the time spending it with his friends 24 hours only come to sleep wake up go to work come and change and go with his friends she says i am a river i was hurt i was suffering i cried i cried i cried and now i want divorce i say why she said i can't love him anymore okay i spoke to the man i told him give he let him talk to me he spoke to me the man is saying he's explaining him see i never listen to one party i have to listen to both and he says all what she told you is correct but this changed three or four years ago since the past four years ago i stopped completely seeing any of my friends i took her to geneva to paris to london i give her money i uh take her for umrah i go i'm a busy man he's an influential person and she doesn't want to change she stays good one week two week anything that happens between us she says you used to stay with your friends you and she brings the whole fan i spoke to her again and she said yes i cannot forget cher i told her you cannot forget seek divorce separate she said i don't want to separate because where will i go in my native country i don't have money then shut up and sit down sometimes you have to be rude sometimes you have to be rough one of the sisters maybe you heard me call her in the break she sent me four or five emails having a problem with her first nikkah which was completely void over the phone the husband to be with a maulana and two witnesses none of them know her and she said yes i accept and then her father knew her father is alive her brother is alive everything is wrong so now she's married and she has kids and she is sending the sending me emails and asking me she has a problem i i answered her once she sent another email i answered her twice she called me twice in saudi i answered her on the phone and explained her don't worry she says i have problems i'm afraid i'm depressed and she called me now just before the break and i was completely rude i'm not usually rude no i am but seriously i'm not usually rude and i said listen you have to see a psychiatrist don't call me again you don't need a sheikh you need a psychiatrist because you have a problem i told you your marriage is void and you're married and you have children and you're still thinking and worrying about the first marriage the first marriage is void it did not take place the witnesses don't know if you're fatima or khadija or or or lina or whatever name you are they don't know you don't have any knowledge of you neither under mawlana is not qualified to give you a marriage while your father is alive so this is completely gone and you insist on calling me do not call me unless you have a proper question i'm sorry so you have to listen to both people sometimes it's you don't need a sheikh you need a psychiatrist sometimes you don't need a shaykh you need a marriage counselor to sit with you and with your husband if you have a problem and you are unable to communicate you have to bring someone to listen to both of you and tell you you're wrong and you're right but limit your dispute to today don't open old files because this would not help number six do not involve others unless reaching a dead end especially who the parents especially the parents never involve your parents the minute your parents are involved in a dispute this is the first nail in the coffin why because they keep on coming and coming and asking and why did you do this why did you do that you too don't include your mother in any of your problems unless it's a dead end a sister tried to communicate try to complain my husband what you're asking me is haram i cannot do it and he forces her to do something that is not permissible it's haram she complains he's not listening i'm going to talk he's not listening she can't talk because we've reached a dead end but in i have to go and talk to my mother why you're always complaining about my food your food is disgusting i have to complain no i have to go and talk to my mother and the mother comes and says why should you do this you should do that your mother goes to the girl and says why did you do this to my son you should change your way this would cause adrift this is not advisable at all number seven be gentle lenient say go say and easy going and do not hold to your opinion look the other way around don't always say simon says you have to obey whatever i say khalas you have to do no always make it a two-way communication this reduces the tension and as i said be smart you can drive the other person around until he reaches what you want to do this is what he said my opinion is right with the possibility of being wrong number eight do not only look at your rights what is what this is the problem why do we have tension in fights i always look at my rights i demand you fulfill my rights this is a problem you have to know that also you have obligations so fulfill this and request that when does the problem expand when you think and magnify things believing that they are your rights where they are not this is a big problem when you you when you as a man say no she should have had she should have done this she should have obeyed me she should have lived with my parents it is her my right for her to live and you magnify it and you make it a big problem when it is not your right so always try to avoid looking at your rights without anything else to reduce tension and fights solve the problem don't run away from it we never face problems we run away if you don't face it it's not gonna be solved it's like someone who has cancer and every time he takes panadol panadol the pain will go but the illness is there you have to face it head-on you have to solve the problems from the roots so that it would not come back again and again and again a lot of the husbands and wives have a problem they fight for a day or two they are tired and weary and they kiss and make up but the problem remains one week it resurfaces and the same happens life cannot go on like this let's stop sit down and discuss the solution but how to discuss the solutions by being frank honest and by not beating round the bush so many times we're not sincere we lie we do this just in order to win an argument no this does not solve the problem this increases the tension so be frank if you're wrong say admit it i'm wrong i apologize don't lie and say you did not do it you did it and you have to bear the consequences of what you had done and try not to beat round the bush don't be aggressive what is that meant by aggressive some of us when we fight when we argue we keep on pushing and pushing and pushing until we break the other person now in real life this is not acceptable between the spouses it is even worse so again turn the blind eye look the other way don't insist for a sister for example your husband did something wrong you keep on reminding him fighting with him making uh uh his life miserable nagging what do you want i want him to apologize is he doing it no he's not doing it does he look as if he admits it yes he admits it he said this what do you want more no i want him to say i'm sorry and she keeps on doing it until she's she's divorced don't be aggressive don't always attack as a man when you come home you told your wife so many times don't leave the laundry in the bathroom on the floor so when you come don't say didn't i tell you why didn't you pick it this is being aggressive you remove it yourself look what happens afterwards huh she you every time you keep on moving it this is over by the way huh no no no they will change i'll give you an example and i'm giving you an example i'm the most horrible person you could meet i have a driver who's responsible for cleaning in front of the house when it's windy a lot of bags and newspapers are in front of the house and it's windy so i told him once if you can clean it because this job he said well i cleaned it yesterday but it's windy and this is what's happening okay next time i went to prayer i came back i collected the bag and put it on myself and put it on the side following salah i did the same third salah he said stop he told me stop why i'll do it you don't do it okay i don't mind but do not be aggressive imagine if every salah you don't have any shame in your face come on i'm giving you salary why aren't you doing this well life would be miserable to him and to me i will go frustrated to my house because i had this friction with someone and i would feel bad about it i would not treat my children well i would not treat my wife well because of what i did no don't be aggressive let life go by inshallah you'll be happy choose the right time for everything allahu akbar among the men does your wife talk to you about problems at the right time raise your hands if not i think they don't answer english does your wife speak to you about the problems in the right time if not raise your hand only one and he's not married that's a that's a problem then i have a problem in my marriage as well my wife speaks to me always on the wrong time always at the bad and worst time so if i tired i want to sleep she says sitting on the bed i have something i want to talk to you about and i said honey now said yes now you're never free every time i want to talk to you you're always on your computer you're always out you you're making dirt i can't find time to talk to you when do you want me to talk to you do you think i'm gonna sleep afterwards let's let's pray night prayer i can't go to bed after what you had said khalas or when you eat bismillah you want to eat and she starts talking you did this you did that you did this all of a sudden you don't feel hungry anymore why aren't you eating i'm not hungry oh you're not hungry because i'm speaking to you huh [Music] now the husband is the same but in different occasions when she's happy no to have a beautiful life without fights try to choose the right time for everything this is life times of happiness you have to be happy times of sadness you have to be sad you cannot be sad all the time and you cannot be happy unfortunately all the time among the causes or ways acknowledge the fact that people may differ are people similar no women are from venus men are from mars they are from two different planets they are not related at all to each other she loves things you hate and you love things she hates so it can never come together so you have to appreciate you have to acknowledge that they are different than you once you recognize this you know then that the moods are not the same you know acknowledge that it's a woman's nature that she is jealous some of the brothers are very frustrated my wife is jealous whenever i discuss a second wife what is this no if she's not jealous she's sick or she hates you but this is purely natural now the jealousy that is not permissible that causes her to do something haram a woman this was reported about eight years ago unfortunately when her husband married a second wife what did she do she went to the wedding and she burned the whole place and about 10 or 20 died the first wife what would we say jealousy no this is haram jealousy is a feeling what you act upon is what you will be punished now the prophet when the man came to him and said do not become angry he said advise me do not become angry do not become angry is it possible that you don't become angry if you're walking with your wife and someone touches her pinches her and you say alhamdulillah prophet said do not become angry is this logical when someone insults your religion insults your prophet said no problem i'm not angry no what the prophet meant do not do something that is unlawful in accordance to your anger but he doesn't he did not say don't become angry because if you don't become angry you're not a you're not a human being so if someone angers me what is my reaction if i go and killing a mosquito with a cannon this is what we're doing someone says donkey the funny thing is in uk and america they consider this to be something nice you're my dog you are my dog and arabi if you tell someone you're my dog may allah have mercy on your soul a great insult to them you're my dog and you're my friend i don't know if he wants to say you're my enemy what will he say anyhow someone swears at me says a bad word at me what do i how do i react i kill him haram this is do not become angry if you must you say you as well you're too and this is mentioned in the quran if you want to punish then let it be similar as long as it's permissible anyhow acknowledge the difference in personalities number 14 be content with what allah has given you when a woman sees good she praises allah what is the meaning of being content if you're always happy and content with what allah has given you do you think you would ever have fights would you have fights with your husband never why because whenever you say to yourself he didn't do this he didn't bring me this and then you think no but he brought me this and this and this alhamdulillah and he did this and this and this you will be always happy you will never ever feel deprived or this is not working it's working but only as a fan i think i have to turn on okay and also if you add to this if you see something good you appreciate it what about if you see something bad how can you be content with that if i see a bad characteristic with my wife she's jealous extremely jealous how would i be content i would say all women are like this if a wife sees that her husband does not share his feelings with her how can she she's angry she's depressed but then she satisfies herself by saying all men are like this call us she feels content and finally be wise be wise and look at the conclusion and not the actions a man always does something because he thinks that this is the action should that should be taken and he does not look at the conclusion and then he regrets it like a woman divorce me divorce me divorce me divorce me actions actions action actions my sister what is the conclusion you're divorced oh you divorces me he divorced me he doesn't love me you've been asking for it for half an hour what do you want me to do think of the conclusion being a man do not be as i always say in my lectures do not be an ak-47 what is an ak-47 it's a klashnikov so by means divorce and in arabic it means a bullet so he is an ak-47 he gives talaq everywhere in arabia i had students 16 years old he says you will do this that if you don't do this i'll divorce and i say are you married no so what is this is it sheikh everybody in my tribe says this and they divorced on the list once i went to a brother and he said you sit down meaning if you do not sit down i'll divorce my wife and i told him i told him one of the scholars say said that this happened in their village a group of people visited someone and it was time for their flight so they said okay excuse us we will leave he said no you have to eat lunch said no well we have a flight to catch so he said alaya you will eat meaning if you don't eat i will divorce my wife of course they don't mean the divorce but they say it the majority of scholars say talaq takes place and they said well you divorce or don't divorce we're leaving it's not your our problem we have a flight to god she said okay then give me one second and he went in and he brought his ak-47 seriously and he said by allah you will eat or i will kill you i'm not going to divorce my wife what causes you to do this why do you play with your why with your marriage and put it as a condition for someone to eat or someone to fix your tire or someone to this is ridiculous so be wise look at the conclusion and with this we conclude our session inshallah now this is intimacy between the spouses i am shy to go into this so i will not go into this if it's men only then we had no problems um the benefits of intercourse as even kayem says you will find it here it is reproduction discharging the fluid that may harm the body if not coming out and attaining physical pleasure enjoyment this is the best in uh marriage and then you have what do you have uh of course when you add to this the intention you get double reward the enjoyment and and the reward from allah azzawajal what else can this be among the etiquettes is that a one it's advisable to have foreplay before going into intimacy you have to have at least half an hour before having this intimacy of foreplay of playing of enjoying yourself because otherwise and it's not going to work except from one side uh okay the prophet used to allah generally play with his wives from the scholar said that is highly recommended to have foreplay okay anything that pleases the spouse is permissible anything but there are two things that are not permissible that is when she is in her monthly period and also what is known as anal sex this is haram we have a problem with oral sex i will not go into dispute of that you can read the notes inshallah okay tell us yeah you will go through this inshallah okay the supplication bismillah it is highly recommended to say before having intimacy because this prevents the shaytan from affecting your offspring the sunnah is if a man wants to go back after uh uh once again he should have a shower if russell if not then make evolution as the prophet said allah and this is much much better and finally russell this is tough russell is mandatory if a person ejaculates woman or man or once penetration takes place and with this i conclude my session muhammad how do you like what how much time we have now 17 16. no problem any any kind of questions as long as it's parental guidance yeah he is there uh it's a common question there is a lot of confusion about the way uh the in the concept of talaq right the the triple talaq there is a confusion some say that it takes effect some say it is not so you can clarify on this inshallah okay regarding talaq divorce i will i cannot take the time to explain the difference opinion of scholars so i'll give you the most authentic opinion talaq is divided into two types talaq that is sunni and talaq that is bidet and the majority of scholars say that the talaq takes place as well but the difference is that when a person does it he's sinful what is the meaning of talaq well to know this you have to go to the talaq asunni what is the talaq of the sunnah this is two ways one to divorce the woman while she is pregnant this is sunnah meaning not recommended but if the talk takes place is he sinful no is it according to the sunnah yes the second way or the second talaq of are you with us guys we'll repeat so you're not with us so you've lost it try to concentrate this is when it comes to first very it's like mathematics if you miss it it's gone the second talaq which is sunnah is that you can inflict you can do the talaq when she is in her state of purity providing that between the state of purity and her last menses you did not have any intercourse why is that because if i want to divorce my wife now we're angry and i want to divorce that islam tells me hold it what should i do wait until she gets her monthly period six or seven days and then she showers and becomes pure and she is ready for you as a man to have intimacy with now you want to divorce a divorcer what will happen if if i want to divorce and say no i'll wait half an hour one hour it's gone if it remains if i'm still angry and she gets her menses and i haven't slept with her for a week and then she gets her menses two weeks and she's purified and she gets a shower and she comes out of the shower i'll divorce the next month inshallah so allah is putting barriers so that this does not happen unfortunately all men khalas once they want they divorce this is haram a divorce that takes place while she is in her menses is bidri is haram a divorce that takes place in her purity but you slept with her yesterday or five days ago in a purity that intercourse took place this is haram this is bitter you have to wait now does the happens or not it's an issue of dispute the majority the vast majority of the um say it happens it does not happen so can i choose and pick no you have to go to the judge because he's the one who made your nikah he's the one who answers you in your nikkah depending on your country among the bid it allah is to give more than one talk at a time i hate my wife so much and this is one from metallica what's the ruling on that the most authentic opinion this is only one talaq so i called my my wife in the morning and we had a fight and i said you anti talent and i hung up in the afternoon we called again and i said again you're talk and then i spoke to her father and i said your daughter is five actual one although on separate occasions why the second divorce cannot take place until you revoke or reconcile so if i say in the morning and your talik and in the afternoon we reconcile you're back again my wife and the evening i give divorce these are two not one but if in the period of the edda today tomorrow or next week without reconciling good morning good afternoon this happens takes place what one divorce any more questions okay for the wonderful sessions we had today yesterday inshallah with this we're going to continue this session but not here and you can inshallah all uh come along with us
