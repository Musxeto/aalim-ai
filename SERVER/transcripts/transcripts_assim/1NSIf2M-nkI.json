  "transcript": "[Music] brother has the this mic [Music] alhamdulillah [Music] I think I need a mouth guard just to protect myself very dangerous my old my old age these teeth are very expensive so what was the title What's the title of so we're talking about the importance of mental health and the health of the brain the heart and these psychological things and the psychiatric aspects of it needs an expert I'm not an expert in this I'm not a shrink I'm not a psychiatrist but what I know is Islam so in Islam we know that Allah says in the Quran the day when there will not benefit anyone wealth or children but only one who comes to Allah with a sound heart all what you have will not benefit you bank accounts cars real estates children wives it's not going to benefit you the only thing that's going to benefit you on the day of judgment is what your heart now the prophet Sall alai wasallam told us in theth is Muslim Allah does not look at our bodies nor our wealth rather Allah looks at our hearts and our Deeds this is what Allah will hold us accountable for so our hearts again is a priority in our lives to purify them to cleanse them to ensure that our hearts are healthy purifying the heart is is the message the core message of prophets of Allah all of them MSA said to Pharaoh M said and say to him would you be willing to purify yourself and this purification is not something that you can attain without Allah's will so you can be rich you can be healthy you can be wealthy you can be influential but all of these factors are a gift from Allah Allah gives this Dunya to whom he loves and Those whom he doesn't love so many times we look at the richest man in the world he's a cfir why did Allah give him this we look at the strongest man in the world he's a cafir Subhan Allah all these muscles all this power we look at other European countries cafer countries they're handsome beautiful healthy wealthy everything is going for them why this is Allah's will he gives dun he gives health and wealth to whom he loves and Those whom he doesn't love but be certain that Allah only gives Iman only gives Islam only gives purification of the heart to those he whom he loves you are among the luckiest on Earth because you are gathered in a Masjid to listen things that may get you closer to Allah things that may change your life and admit you to Jen things that may open your eyes and save you from Hellfire how did this happen oh I chose to come no Allah guided you to come because there are thousands and hundreds and tens of people who failed to come and they instead are watching a football match or a tennis match or a movie or listening to music or sitting idle home so if they've lost this opportunity so this is a gift from Allah to you this purification of the heart comes only from Allah who says and if not for the favor of Allah upon you and his Mercy not one of you would have been pure ever but Allah purifies whom he Wills so if Allah purifies your heart Allah has chosen you the most that corrupts our hearts is what sins these sins tarnish our souls and hearts makes them black makes them hard Allah says no rather the stain has come covered their hearts of that which they were earning these stains come from our sins and there is no Prosperity on life on Earth there is no progress there is no success except for those who purify their souls and hearts Allah says he has certainly succeeded who purifies himself but how do we PR purify ourselves purifying yourself requires a lot of work likewise you want to go and build a healthy body you eat well and you work out you cannot simply sit on your backside like I used to do and bring someone from the Far East you know a driver or a janitor or you know someone to serve in the house and I take him to the gym I let him work for 2 hours sweat then I take a shower and alhamdulillah I rest huh do I have muscles he was the one who's working out yeah but I paid for it will I grow any muscles no to purify yourself you have to work hard how to do this first of all you have to cleanse your heart from anything that may negatively impact it such as oh there are a whole list R showing off arrogance Pride hatred enmity Envy anger stinginess being a coward all of these tarnish your heart makes you the worst of the worst unfortunately lots of us Muslims may have these things and some of us may have all of these things you know Muslims around you whom you say whoa this guy this dude is bad news I'm not getting close to him why oh he's really bad and this person whom everyone else avoid he is in real danger because he'll come on the day of judgment broke he doesn't have anything what does he have to show up for nothing he filled his heart with everything bad he's always envious giving people evil eye he's always holding a grudge against each and everyone he always has negativity filling the air around him so this person needs to purify his heart if he eliminates these negative feelings and bad things then that was step one there is step two then he has to fill his heart with good things that would make his heart shine and resonate such as sincerity such as generosity such as truthfulness honesty humbleness returning back to Allah the fear of Allah the knowledge of Allah's beautiful names and attributes if you don't fill up your heart with knowing Allah you're the most ignorant person on Earth how many names of Allah do you know oh Allah has 99 Names okay this is the Hadith whoever knows the meaning implements and uh uh um apply them he will enter Jenna how many names of Allah do you know uh 10 maybe 15 masallah tab how many of these 10 or 15 names do you do you know the meaning of the meaning no I know the names but I don't know what a means I don't know what is I don't know what is why have I know but maybe I know two or three so how do you want to enter Jenna rather how do you even enjoy Salat when you say Allah abbar and your head is roaming all over the universe except the Salat you're praying if I ask you what did the Imam recite in the first Surah in the first good you you a good student people don't know I've asked this question once in a Masjid full of worshippers full and none of them could find the answer why because it was they take time 20 minutes later the Salah was so they could not know what the IM recited in the first raak get it hopefully so we have a problem we know Islam only on the surface the Islam we know uh how how many for how many for when should we prostrate for does this nullify my Salah is my good all of this is what we know about Salah about Islam the essence of Islam how to get closer to Allah how to enslave yourself to Allah how to allow the Quran and the Sunnah to be your guide whatever Allah says whatever the prophet says he's my tutor my leader he is the one I follow my role model we don't have this in us this is why we only choose and pick from Islam what we like what we enjoy I enjoy having a long beard why because whenever there's a raw or a line and I come to say oh oh uncle uncle come so I come to the first of the special needs no this is why I like a big beard but when people come and say we need charity for an orphanage I forgot my wallet sorry but you have a big beard yes yes but I don't have a big wallet so we have a problem we have to know have we purified ourselves have we cleansed our hearts have we filled it with feelings that would get us closer to Allah how would we know we would know by the amount of psychological and mental illnesses we have H interesting do you mean that a Muslim does not have a mental illness generally speaking yes all those who study psychology and they're psychiatrist don't sue me yeah wait because they hate this generally speaking yes to an extent Allah says in the Quran those who have believed and whose hearts are assured assured by the remembrance of Allah unquestionably by the remembrance of Allah hearts are assured now we have so many illnesses mental illnesses available on the market and this is why you go to any psychiatrist even if you're a good person they'll say you're bipolar you have schizophrenia you have borderline disorder you have depression you have this you have that or the least they would say you're autistic you have autism she I'm 60 years old yeah yeah you have minor case of autism and you feel that whoo I'm not alive this is what the non-muslim psychiatrists would usually do that's why we say you have a mental illness do not go except to a Muslim psychiatrist he fears Allah and he knows how to diagnose you and he knows what is best for you but you go to any Tom Dick or Harry proac y gives you uh pills that would make you addicted to them and would make you hysterical would make you par paranoid and this is a big big problem in Islam Quran and Sunnah what are the basic mental illnesses that we would like to address we have grief and we have worries in Arabic we say Al the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam and this is part of the morning and evening part of the morning and evening which means that you have to say them in the evening and the morning every day many narrations this Hadith by itself would require a lecture but the first part of it is what concerns us oh Allah I seek Refuge with you from worry and grief this is a mental illness worry is something that took place in will take place in the future grief is something that took place in the past and this is what kills you from the inside the death of a loved one you can't get over it oh my father died my when 5 years ago okay so I can't get over it I always cry I always uh uh mourn I always suffer I always say why why what this is grief grief of a mistake you've done grief over an opportunity that you've missed so it keeps on itching and eating you from the inside if you don't treat it it will devastate you worries are something coming in the future and we have lots and lots of things to worry about how am I going to pay the rent next month how am I going to take care of a new job they gave me one month notice how am I going to get married I'm getting married in 5 six months time how is going how it's going to be my children my risk my parents my sick relatives blah things that I worry about so when you seek refuge in Allah asael then you know that Allah will take care of it so you surrender to Allah's power power and might and you're the happiest man on Earth when you depend on your intellect when you depend on your strength when you depend on your knowledge or your certificate or those you know you're the worst and the most vulnerable because this is when shaan will Attack you left right and Center also part of the mental illnesses Whispers of shatan does Shan whisper to us yes or no is anyone Exempted from The Whispers of shaan not a single one of us because this is the job description of Shan in his job description if you go to LinkedIn you will find that part of it is to deviate the Muslims from the straight path and to join and combine and recruit as many as he can in Hellfire this is the only what thing he wants what does he want you to be with him in hell now depending on First Class business or economy he wants you to be in hell it doesn't matter even next to the shoes outside the door gate is okay Enter Hell mission accomplished how there are traps of shatan there's a lecture I did in Canada or somewhere I don't know where it's called the traps of shatan watch it on YouTube it's free and you will find how he attacks each and every one of us Allah says in the Quran indeed those who fear Allah wow those who fear Allah Allah says when an Impulse touches from uh them from Shan they remember Allah and at once they have Insight which means each and everyone has this moment of weakness we get get intrusive thoughts that attack us day and night depending on your Iman I have counseling sessions paid of course I have to become rich so people come to me complaining for intrusive thoughts and each and every one of them vary in in degree some of the righteous people get intrusive thoughts from for 5 seconds and it's gone some of them get sit for 5 days it's killing them some of them get sit for 5 years they're devastated they're lost so Shan looks at the strength of your Iman and he gives you these intrusive thoughts and these impulse touches and this is why Allah says and say my Lord I seek refuge in you from the incitements of the devils and I seek refuge in you my lord lest they be present with me so they come and they overwhelm us sometimes when we are most vulnerable and weak and this is why this is the right time when you should put your trust in Allah when you should Depend and rely on Allah only then you will be able to Prevail and succeed among the mental ill illnesses that are prevailing among the Muslims is despair a lot of the Muslims come to me in despair why did Allah do this why did Allah take the one I love why did Allah made me lose my job why did Allah put so much debt on me I said you're coming to the wrong man why are you asking me this is Allah's Calamity and test for you and by the way I see it you failed miserably you said but why said I don't know I don't care who could say to Allah why Allah says in the Quran no one asks Allah why you do this rather all of you will be questioned so despair is the tag name the definition of lack of trust in Allah it is the definition of thinking negatively of Allah no M would ever despair W no M would Prophet eunus three times his name comes to be thrown off the boat he's a prophet first time no no no you Prophet of Allah how can you throw you but the the the the U the storm is heavy and the whole boat will uh uh capsize or or or drown if we don't throw someone number two his name number three his name we they threw him and he was swollen by the whale if a whale swallows with you what are you going to do uh can I go to the Executive Club please this is a whale and he stayed in the belly of the whale for three days and three nights what did he do nothing else confessing who Allah is and of his own flaws and shortcomings what happened with these positive thoughts and ideology and Vibes Allah saved him and made him better than he was before this is what takes you out of Despair this is what takes you out of your depression and this despair happens either because Allah took a a favor a blessing away from you or tested you with a Calamity or something that is evil Allah says and if we give man A Taste of Mercy from us and then we withdrew it from him indeed he is despairing and ungrateful how many years Allah Asel had made you walk on your feet how many years Allah has blessed you with health and wealth the ability to see the ability to hear the ability to eat and when Allah tests you with little things you're ungrateful and you're despairing of Allah's Mercy fear Allah and also if an evil thing happens to you Allah says and when we bestow favor upon the disbeliever he turns away and distances himself Allah gives him money he gives him wealth he turns away this is my own earning my own doing then Allah says and E when evil touches him he's ever despairing so this is yes to despair from Allah's Mercy there is no exit and there is no Lifeline from despair except by believing and trusting in Allah Allah says and Allah will save those who feared him by their attainment no evil will touch them nor will they grieve among the mental illnesses that a lot of the Muslims have today is fear fear of What Fear of Everything the fear of death the fear of Scandal the fear of losing risk and wealth the fear of the future so many people come to me and say she I'm afraid of dying a brother came to me once and in a counseling session and he said sh I have this fear of death to the extent that my wife divorced me I lost half of my weight my job is threatening me of sacking me because of my poor performance and the sad thing is I haven't prayed for 20 days why he said I'm afraid to go to the toilet to have and I don't know she I I don't know what to do so I said to him how long you had this fear he said three years shikh he said Subhan Allah and did you die excuse me I said you had this fear for 3 years did you die he said of course not sheh I'm talking to you said then who's stupid you or me 3 years you're afraid of death and you didn't die what happens if this extends to another 15 years what will you do beg in the streets please give me food I'm going to die soon this is crazy look what shatan is doing to you verily this is Satan intimidating you with his soldiers you should not fear them rather fear me but this is the fear of death that does to you fear can be crippling and negative as in this case but it can't be positive how if you fear death what are you going to do about it do good deeds so when death comes I'm ready I have nothing to fear I'm waiting for death to come so that I could meet my Lord I can meet my good rewards in in the grave I can meet Allah I'm happy to die because I have good deeds but when your fear is negative it cripples you the fear of Scandal you reap what you saw meaning you had illicit Haram relationships who did it you did it so now you repented good for you you started doing good deeds mashallah keep up the good work but I'm I'm terrified of what I want to get married but I'm afraid I will be exposed to everyone because of my previous sins and this fear is crippling me a trust Allah and if anything would surface this is a test from Allah you did it and these are the consequences of your actions but you should not let them deprive you and deter you from moving on you make Dua oh Allah conceal my sins but if Allah did not conceal your sins be man and face your consequences but if they do not show up the grace is from Allah the fear of risk you're working in a supermarket and you're selling pork alcohol and cigarettes why said Sheik what can I do I have to have a job yes but this is Haram said what can I do Subhan Allah why are you having a house through riba through mortgage it's Haram I have to live she what can I do what can you do do you have a daughter she yes your daughter is a prostitute what what do you mean well she's working the nights why she says I need to buy a new iPhone and I don't have money what can I do this is howan messes up with your head where is risk coming from Allah that you think that if you quit Haram jobs Allah can't give you because if you think this and you continue to work in Haram this means that you don't believe that Allah is a you believe someone else is and this is a grave in serious sin Allah Asel provides for 8 billion human beings living on Earth five billions maybe six of them are non-muslims that he gives them food drink air to breathe take their children to school cures their sick gives them houses gives them everything and you're a Muslim Muslim do you think Allah will not give you you're this afraid Allah made the whole world for you made the Jenna for you if you want to enter it but if you don't he made Hell Fire for you and you still doubt Allah is how many animals and you live in can in Kenya H you have the Safari how many animals do you have hundreds and millions and billions who gives them food who gives the dying a sweet Small Deer to have you know as a toothpick Allah so Allah gives all of them food how many hundreds of billions of birds flying how many trillions of fish in the ocean colors and kinds and sizes who gives this all to them gives them risk Allah how many insects you know the insects I can't even put a number number gazillion this is a new number put it in the dictionary gazillion insects and Allah feeds them all and now you individual dealing in Haram cheating lying dealing with bribes taking interest why I want risk I'm afraid you have a mental illness this fear of yours is a mental illness if you had all of your mental illness would disappear and go away and this is why we say the Islamic religious healing is the best form of healing because it comes from the one who created you he knows what fixes you doesn't he know whom he created so he created you he knows what's best for you you cannot buy a car and then go and get a Chinese manual and try to read it to operate your car it will not work you have to go to the manufacturer they know every single little detail and Allah has the highest example Allah revealed to us the Quran sent us the the Muhammad so we know the answers to all our problems in this earth through Quran and Sunnah but you have to believe psychologists and psychiatrist who are not Muslims don't believe on spiritual and religious healings they believe and depend on the biological and Instinct Instinct motivations so they refer everything to your sexual desires like Sigman Freud anything that happens oh maybe because of your mom because of your suckling her breast oh crazy this is what they think everything is sexual no no we Muslims believe in the spiritual healing so you start from today cleanse your heart purify your soul and you will find inshallah that you are on the straight path of the messengers and the prophets of Allah and you will find your salvation"
