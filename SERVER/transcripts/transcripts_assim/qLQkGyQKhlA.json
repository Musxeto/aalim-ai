  "title": "If the Imam doesnâ€™t say Ameen after Surah Fatiha, would saying it myself count as reciting it twice?",
  "transcript": "Our first caller is Ayaan from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. Yeah like if let's say that I'm praying in congregation and the Imam does not say like is a highly confirmed Sunnah but it is not mandatory nor it is a pillar of the Salat so if he drops it altogether the prayer is valid. Most likely he follows a school of thought that states that reciting Ameen loudly is not correct which is definitely incorrect by itself. and saying - he would raise his voice saying Ameen so not the following row would hear it even the row behind it the second row would hear him say Ameen and this is one of the dangers of blind following. I wonder how could you call yourself a proper Muslim when you know that the authentic Hadith which the companions delivered to us stating that the Prophet used to Alayhi Salatu Wasalam say Ameen loudly and you say no no I'm not gonna say it I'm gonna shut my mouth and say it silently because my school of thought says so. Subhanallah you'd rather follow your Imam rather than follow the Prophet Alayhi Salatu Wasalam and there's nothing wrong in that."
