  "transcript": "um Azib from Sri Lanka uh yeah what is \nthe true meaning of Tasawwuf and do we   need it in our day-to-day life I don't \nunderstand you Azib the true meaning of Tasawwuf Shiekh Tasawwul Tasawwuf okay yes \nand do we need it in our day-to-day life   I understand you so Sufism is something that \nwas innovated it was not mentioned at the   time of the Prophet (Peace and Blessing upon \nhim) or his companions or those who followed   him from the favorite Generations and some \nsay that it is derived from the word suuf   which means wool because their righteous \npredecessors used to wear wool all the time   and they relate this to letting go of this \nDunya and being modest and humble and not   trying to be luxurious in your food in your \ndress and and all of this is not part of Islam   nowadays Sufism has gone into a whole \nnew level where it's Mystic it has   serious allegations in Aqeedah and their belief \nin Allah in the existence of this universe   and the vast majority of the peers who lead these \nsects are money makers and they are among the   richest in the world and I've met people from the \nUK and elsewhere who say to me and they name names   in countries like Pakistan or India \nand they say we give them like 5   000 pounds a month and we're just one single \nfamily so they're Filthy Rich and they   talk with nonsense all their hadiths or \nmost of their hadiths are fabricated or weak   all what they say to people are tales and stories \nnothing from the Quran the Sunnah usually and   they Depend and rely on Visions I saw in a dream I \nhad this Vision I and it's all bogus so it has no   reality in Islam no relationship to Islam you want \nto become a Muslim leave these deviant sects alone   leave the labels follow Quran follow the way of \nthe Prophet (Peace and Blessing upon him) and   understand them with the understanding of the \nfavorite three generations of the companions   of the best of the the best then the tabi'een \nthen the tabi'i al tabi'een and you'll be safe"
