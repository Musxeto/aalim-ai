  "title": "Buying a house from a company that conditions fixed charge to maintain the property assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I just wanted to ask about a company it's an international company that buys you know cheap houses renovate them and sell them so when they sell the uh the houses uh in the agreement they say we sell you the house you become the full owner however the condition is that we maintain your property as part of one of our services we maintain the property for after this after these three years you actually can leave you know to to get it maintained uh by someone else or another agency but yeah so is that valid though is the contract of maintaining the property fixed meaning the amount is fixed yes it's a fixable so what is included in this fixed amount is include the repairs uh finding the tenants um you know all sort of stuff you know maintaining the property to a good standard this is problematic because the transaction of selling is okay we have no problem in that if they're asking for a commission in addition I care only about the lump sum so if they're charging me 700 000 pounds for the property in addition to a contract of services for three years that are listed because the contract of maintenance is quite ambiguous maybe throughout the year I have frequent leakages in the plumbing I have problems with the heating system and this requires that they come and fix these things unconditionally which would amount to much more than what they've received per year in the service contract if this is a service they're providing without the spare parts without the other things included they're just providing us with the service not with anything Cost Plus that might be acceptable as I said you look at the end result the lump sum you're paying for the property which is included with the three years but if the service contract is open so it includes that I pay them ten thousand pounds a year per year which includes all type of repairs spare parts changing of of of of machines or of uh um furnaces or whatever that is needed no this is not permissible due to the ambiguity and Allah Knows Best"
