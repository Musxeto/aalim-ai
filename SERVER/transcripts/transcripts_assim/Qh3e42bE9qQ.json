  "transcript": "[Music] Al we move on to the second Hadith in the chapter of purity of the book and our brother muhammadan will inshallah read for us this second Hadith narrated Abu hura may Allah be pleased with him from the prophet peace and blessings of Allah be upon him who said Allah does not accept the prayer of one of you if he becomes ritually impure unless he does what okay first of all wo is known to us as Muslims but what is the translation of Wu ablution and what is the state of being ritually impure now this Hadith is related to Tara and usually in the books of they explain what Tara is by saying first of all there is Tara which is physical and there is tahar which is moral tahara means Purity so when we talk about the moral tahara we are referring to the purest thing on earth which is Islam and that is why Allah mentioned in the Quran meaning that those who associate others with Allah are impure are they impure physically meaning that if I touch someone I have to wash my hand seven times no all what I have to do is to identify them as disbelievers and this is the greatest impurity that one may have to associate others with the creator of the heavens and the Earth subhah so let's move on to the first meaning which is the physical meaning tar that deals with the pure but even this has a moral definition to it so what does the scholars what does the jurors explain tahara by in Arabic it's a beautiful statement that rhymes four words so in English uplifting the ritual impurity and removing the physical filth and I'll explain this to you inshallah don't be uh worried and don't fall asleep uplifting the ritual impurity what is the ritual impurity is it something we can touch impurity is divid into two types major and minor so if someone has sexual intercourse if someone ejaculates if someone has external emission or what is known as wet dreams if a woman finishes her monthly period or the bleeding after delivery stops this is all considered to be something known as Al the major impurity how can I uplift this impurity by by by having by having a major bath what they call a total bath this uplifts my impurity major impurity the minor impurity is what n fides your woodoo such as passing wind sleeping urinating defecating when you pass stool what else eating camels meat these are the five things that nullify your woodoo now is this something physical if I'm in the state of voodo and forgive me I pass wind I look nobody notices ha so I go and pray can I pray no why because I am in the state of minor impurity it's not physical I cannot touch it I cannot weigh it yes but it is a description that in order for me to stand in front of Allah and pray I have to perform aolion this is how important prayer is not whenever you want you just pray you have to clean yourself you have to follow a certain ritual so that you can be legible to pray not anything that goes and therefore it is a condition for prayer to perform ablution so the prophet in this Hadith is telling us that Allah does not accept the prayer of you unless he performs if I perform Evolution then I can pray now this is the minor and major impurities and how to uplift them but what is the second part of Purity removing the filth removing the impurity and this is physical such as washing the private part touching washing the private part no no no wa okay after after passing urine or urinating or defecating removing the filth what do I mean by that what give me examples of Filth Mazi we can say the prostatic something physical physical no no phys filth NES what give me something NES pieces urine bleeding of animals if you Slaughter an animal it bleeds this is NES as mentioned in the Quran mainly speaking anything that comes out of the private parts with the exception of many of demon and we will come to mention that inshallah later on so these are all impurities in order for me to pray as a condition of prayer I have to be in the state of Purity major and minor and I also have to be clean and not have any impurities neither on my body nor my clothes nor the place I'm praying in three things so this is Purity in all the jurors books two things uplifting the ritual impurity and removing the filth or the impurity or the njasa and we've talked about the ritual impurity being major you have to take a bath or minor you have to offer Evolution and we spoke about removing the NASA from your clothes from your body and from the place you pray in and we will come to mention this inshallah now Allah does not accept our prayers if someone is ritually impure until he performs woodoo what is woo it's Evolution what is ation is it mentioned in the Quran it's mentioned inah verse number six oh you who believe whenever you want to pray you must wash your faces and your arms till the elbows and wipe over your head and wash your feet up to the ankles M we know this right okay what are the pillars of woodoo what what are the pillars of evolution how many are there four how many that which is mentioned in the Quran the mentioned in the Quran are four but are there four or five or six you don't know easiest thing to say is I do not know muhammadan may Allah have mercy on his soul one of the great Scholars of Islam said if a scholar misses or forgets I do not know he's done he's doomed whenever you ask a scholar a question he always answers it and he never says I don't know then this is not a scholar he's Superman IM Malik anas may Allah have mercy on his soul a man came all the way from the cus or from the area of chachia and the place of the East and he traveled for 2 3 months and he said I have about 48 problems I'd like to ask you because my people sent me go ahead and he gave him all these 48 he answered only 16 and he in 32 he said I do not know so the man said I traveled all this distance 2 and a half months or 3 months what do you want me to go to my people 48 you only answered 16 and 32 you do not know what should I go and tell my people tell them he said Imam Malik IB anas the head of the Maliki school of thought the IM of Medina does not know and this is a sign that he is a true scholar so if you don't know just simply say don't know if you have a hunch if you have a guest that is inallah strong you go ahead there are six pillars of woodo one of them is not there your woodo is invalid and this is the difference between conditions and pillar pillars are part of the if it does not exist your I is gone are there pillars in prayer such as intention did we say that intention was a pillar or a condition it's a condition standing up all of these are pillars if someone after finishing prayer says Ah I should have prayed four I prayed only two y inah tomorrow no go ahead and pray I forgot to prostrate go ahead your prayer is invalid so prayers have pillars woodo has pillars but we will get to know these pills inshallah after the break so stay tuned [Music] asalam alikum and welcome back just before the break we said that Evolution has how many pillars six six now okay the your vision is good because usually when I do this with the people and say how many they say four how many I say they say two and without thinking no you have to think before you talk there are six pillars four are mentioned in the Quran washing your face washing your arms till the elbows wiping your head washing your feet up till the ankles and also scholar said washing the face includes rinsing your mouth and sniffing and blowing your nose so these are four they said yes there is a fifth one what is that this is order what do you mean by order you cannot start with your feet and then your face it has to be in the same order mentioned in the Quran face first hands head and feet so this is the fifth pillar okay understood yes and the sixth pillar can I guess the sixth pillar you want to say the sixth pillar no no I'll deprive you from that I want to say it myself the sixth pillar is um sequence or continuity you may call it what do we mean by that that you do not leave a pose I'm making woodo I wash my face wash my right wash my left wiped my head and feet are left the phone rings I go out alikum Salam bye how are you what's happening what's you doing did you visit your mom yes she was asking about you how about your uncle where are we spending the night tonight there's a lecture I'm going okay and I spend like 5 minutes with the guy and I go back to the toilet okay where was I yes I had feet left I wash my feet say hey wait wait wait no good why look at yourself the limbs are dried there is no water or moist on your face or your limbs so so what so no you have to have it in sequence you have to be continuous so this is the sixth pillar of woodoo one would say okay she what happens when it's 55Â° Centigrade outside and I'm making woodo I wash my face by the time I finish my left left arm my face is completely dry I do it again no because you are doing the woodoo as prescribed not only that Scholars say that if I'm in a place that's freezing and I make wo I did my hands and all of a sudden the water water is cut and I had to go and warm and heat some water so that I can continue it would take maybe 3 4 minutes do I have to do the woodoo again no because I'm working for the sake of woodoo likewise if I'm making wood and I found that there is paint and paint is an obstacle so I brought the thinner and I started moving it and cleaning it and it took me 2 3 minutes I've look in the mirror my face is dry my hand is dry do I have to make my wo again no because I was in doing what I'm doing for the sake of my woodu therefore it uh goes on so I I think that this is all the thing that we have regarding the second Hadith move on to the third Hadith Asam Alum narrated by Abdullah Bin and Abu hura and Aisha may Allah be pleased with them who said that Allah's messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam said war to Dry Heels because of Hell Fire okay this Hadith was narrated by three great companions Abdullah Abu H and may Allah be pleased with them which means that it is quite famous but what is the origin of this Hadith the origin the prophet was not sitting there once and said by the way woe to the hills because of Hellfire definitely there was an incident what was the incident caller say the incident was the prophet was traveling with his companions in one of their expeditions and once they set Camp they all started to make W for prayer you know when you're traveling when it's hot when it's dusty when you're tired sometimes you become a little bit lazy and this is what happened to the companions may Allah be pleased with them they're performing wo but when it comes to the feet like our children if you watch children make wo you always find that this area is completely dry and their heels are not washed so the prophet looked at them and said wo the Arabic word is wh wh this word is used in the Quran a lot so what is the meaning of whale whale is an Arabic word for warning and intimidation and threatening that you'll be punished and some Scholars say no wh is the name of a valley in hell and in this Valley runs all types of of scorpions and and and snakes and so on and the water that runs in it is the filthiest water you could think of so Allah Asel is warning us of these things men that those who do not offer those who do not perform an accurate and perfect woodo they will be punished in hell why because if your W is incomplete your prayer is incomplete prayer is incomplete you're not a Muslim a person who does not pray is a cfir this is the most authentic opinion of Scholars backed by the Quran and the Sunnah Muslim the prophet said between man and kufur or associating others with Allah is abandoning prayer Abu daud narration and whoever whoever abandons a prayer is a cfir so it is great importance to know and learn the importance of w it is not a ritual that just wash and leave it's a process it's a sunah and the reward is unimaginable the prophet tells us when you offer W every sin you looked at fall with the last drop of water coming out of your face every sin you heard falls out with the last drop every sin you made falls out from your fingernails and so on so when you perform M you're cleansing your body from different types of sins so when you pray this is an added value to you by the grace of Allah so the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam is telling them I can see that there are dry areas in your heels and that is why if you do not wash it properly you are in great trouble Abu H reports that the prophet Alat wasam saw a man with this much in his foot unwashed the narration abuur said if this man dies he would have died on a religion other than the religion of prophet Alam because his prayer would not be accepted so it's a serious offense not to offer your woodo properly and unfortunately those who work in painting or construction all the time we see them making woodo with old paints on their hands their prayer is invalid women put their manures and they go to make woo you cannot this is an obstacle water has to cover all the areas mentioned in the Quran and if there's an obstacle it has to be removed of course I'm not talking about emergencies as in the case of a person with a broken arm how can he wash it no I'm talking about normal cases that people should look into so with this we conclude our Hadith we open the floor for any questions regarding to this topic or the uh previous topic if you wish yes brother it is not permitted to urinate in a standing position you're asking me or you're telling me uh I'm ask because that is what we have been thought that is a opinion majority opinion that you should not be urinating in a standing position now my intent is to clear myself as of this impurity but when I go let's say to a mall or to in an airline where there are Western toilet and I see has been used before me and I can see urine on on the on the flap now I'm not comfortable in uh using that flap but my intent is to you know my intention is to so if in that situation if a person urinates in the standing position given the intent that you know does what okay I get your question thank and it would have been simpler if you said is it permissible to urinate standing up or not and I would say yes it is simple the prophet himself in the authentic Hadith came to something like um a junkyard and the Hadith says urinated standing up so the prophet did itam you should not ask twice however there are Hadith thata said whoever tells you that the prophet urinated standing up he's a liar Scholars said that this is what may Allah with her knew but not what the prophet wasam did those who saw the prophet outside reported it and then we believe and we accept this and the answered question is even if you don't have to you can urinate standing up even if it's a clean place even if you're in house there is no preference some Scholars said that it is preferable and recommended to urinate sitting down when you are unable to protect yourself from the splashes of urine back to you but if it's secure and you know mallah that it would not go back and touch your body or your clothes urinate standing up I'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time [Music]"
