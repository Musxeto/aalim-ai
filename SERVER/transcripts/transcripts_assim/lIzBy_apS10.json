  "transcript": "Hassan from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi So I wanted to ask if the socialism or communism, this economic system is compatible with the teachings of Islam? It is not compatible with the teachings of Islam at all and as well as capitalism is not compatible with Islam at all. Islam is the perfect system. It has some from this and it has some from that. But the entire capitalism or socialism is totally or communism is totally haram and transgressing and there is a lot of dhulm in it. So with the grace of Allah when you come to the Islamic concept, nobody could doubt that it is the best of all other systems and Allah knows best."
