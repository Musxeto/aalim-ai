  "transcript": "doing great Alhamdulillah. Alhamdulillah. I have a question about attending the masjid as a man. My question is the closest masjid to my house is a 45-minute walk away and by car it's a seven-minute drive. The approximate distance is 3.5 kilometers. So my question is, is it compulsory for me to attend the masjid five times a day except the Friday prayer? The answer is no. This distance is too far for the adhan once being called from the top of the masjid without loudspeakers or microphones to reach you. And hence this is how we measure whether it's obligatory for me to attend or not. Whether the voice of the muezzin would reach in normal circumstances or not. And with this distance, definitely it would not reach. So you're not obliged to go five times a day. You're obliged to go every Friday. Now, living in a kafir country, it depends if you feel that you're being detached from your religion. Your heart is being hardened due to a lot of fitness and temptations around you. You feel that you need to energize just to maintain your identity and your Islamic commitment. I would highly recommend that you drive seven minutes because seven minutes is nothing by car to attend as many prayers as possible. But is it mandatory? The answer is no. And Allah azzawajal knows best."
