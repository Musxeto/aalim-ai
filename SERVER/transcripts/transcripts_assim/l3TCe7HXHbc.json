  "transcript": "Yusuf from Bangladesh Sheikh I I make 3D designs \nlike I make 3D interior design for the room or a   building for example and a lot of these Interiors \nhave Haram things like statues sculptures Etc and   I know it's Haram for me to make a statue in 3D \nbut would it be permissible for me to download   it to a 3D statue that someone else has made \nand use it in my design since I didn't make it,   it is not permissible to copy and paste something \nthat is Haram and consider that to be someone's   else responsibility you are responsible \nfor whatever you include in your design   so if you design a nude man from the Greek \nhistory as their sculptures and statues   a form of Art this is Haram on you \neven if you did not draw it you're   the one who is incorporating it in your \ndesign and the rizq is in Allah's hands   it's not going to be dependent on this Haram \nthing or that so don't include it and if Allah   wills it you will be granted rizq from ways and \nmeans you do not anticipate and Allah Knows Best"
