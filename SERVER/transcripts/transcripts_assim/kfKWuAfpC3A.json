  "transcript": "oh alhamdulillah and welcome to lessons in the chapter we're dealing with is the chapter that deals with purification the purification by soil or the dry Evolution and Hadith 109 brother n will read it again for us as we did not have the chance to continue and explaining what the things that deal with uh narrated by jair B Abdullah may Allah be pleased with him the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said I have been given five things which were not given to anyone else before me Allah made me Victorious by o of frightening my enemies for a distant of one month's Journey the Earth has been made for me and my followers a place for praying and means of purifications is meaning by performing tum there therefore anyone of my followers must pray wherever the time of prayer become due in another version the soil of the Earth has been made for us as means of purification if and when we do not find water in another version the soil has been made for me and my followers a mean of purification okay now the first thing that the prophet Sall wasallam was given that no other Messengers or prophets of Allah uh had been given the same thing before was that the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam was Victorious even before he traveled the Journey of one month journey and he was Victorious by Allah throwing the fear of him in the hearts of his enemies and this is not only for the Prophet alhat wasam this is also for those who sincerely follow him and this is found worldwide now we have this fear of Islam worldwide and they shouldn't because Muslims are the most peaceful people on Earth just for a handful of criminals this does not stain the Muslim uh uh uh religion does not stain the Muslim follow the the Islam the Muslims and the the followers of Islam just because of a handful of criminals look around you on the whole world in the whole world you would find that there are Muslims from spanning from as far as the Far East in China and Indonesia until the West in the US and Europe and they are peaceloving people they are hard workers yet again people people are afraid of them and why is that it is the fear of them being good citizens and spreading their religion and what does their religion call for does it call for violence no it does not does it call for uh harming others no it does not our religion governs Our Lives it tells us how to communicate it tells us how to deal with our wives and children it tells us how to deal with our neighbors it tells us how to deal with our deal with our relatives it tells us how to deal with the non-muslims and our guide in this process is the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and whoever does not follow him is not a good Muslim if a Muslim at all so in Islam when we want to talk to a Christian or to a Jew we don't hit them we don't spin in their faces we smile in their faces we try to be as kind as possible to them to show them what Islam is really about to give them the best example possible and this is a misconception that some uh Muslims have and lots of non-muslims believe they think that Islam is a religion that promotes violence and it is a religion that promotes keeping people away from others or uh uh not being able to interact this is not the case look around you you definitely have neighbors that are Muslims or co-workers that are Muslims you have friends that are Muslims and you can I I assure you that although they're not 100% perfect yet they are better than so many others so this Hadith tells us that the prophet sallallah Ali wasallam was made Victorious by o and fear not that the prophet Sall wasallam was a man of war on the contrary he was a man of peace and whenever they asked him for peace treaties he would uh comply he sallallahu alaihi wasallam was always the weak one and yet they attacked him and they went out their they kicked him out of his hometown and they went after him to Medina they did not rest until they could have terminated him and his followers so the prophet wasallam all what he did was defend himself and then he went on to spread the dawa spread Islam and he did not go to fight if you want to convert to Islam that's great you're among us you share everything with us if you don't want to convert to Islam you have to pay uh H uh taxes and we will protect your country we will protect your land you will not do anything it's our responsibility and if you refuse us to come in and spread the word of Islam then it's War it is Jihad and one would say then there's no compulsion in religion yes there isn't there's no compulsion in in religion but this is the same thing that every superpower is doing you have to dominate and they dominate their own ideologies they dominate their own uh filth and uh uh uh freedom of uh sexuality they dominate things that are not accepted in logic nor in religion but when Islam dominates it dominates countries and spreads peace so no one a Muslim cannot even hit a non-muslim without being punished he cannot abuse him he cannot take his wealth or money he cannot trespass he cannot do this he cannot do that so many restrictions just to give a non-muslim his dignity and honor he's living among us he's paying his taxation he has to be protected and he has to be given the perfect uh uh idea we have to portray to him the perfect way of being a Muslim nation and a Muslim uh uh country so this is the O and fear it's a gift from Allah and then we move on on to now the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said that this Earth the whole earth is a suitable place for us to pray so whenever one hears the aan if you are on the mountains if you are uh uh in the desert if you are in a park and you the the time of prayer has been called you pray you don't have to go to a church a synagogue you don't have to go to a a place specially designed for prayer of course unless you are in the vicinity of a mosque then you definitely go to pray with the congregation but if you are not close to a mosque we don't have to wait and say well I'm out of city now so I have to wait until I'm in the city and pray no you can pray anywhere on board a plane or a ship even if you're in a spaceship prayer is is is not void at all you cannot skip prayer five prayers every single day and night you have to pray it it's it energizes your faith it's it's something for you it's not something for Allah if you pray five 10 100 times Allah will not gain anything out of it it's strictly for your benefit Mustafa but aren't there two exceptional places where you can't pray like uh bathrooms and places where there are Graves well you can generalize it a little bit more now we're not talking about the places is Exempted from Earth because even Earth itself even if you're praying on a mountain and there is filth or impurity in front of you can you pray on this spot no you have to choose a spot that is pure that is so we we're not talking about specific things we're talking in general you don't have to go to a certain location to pray your prayer is accepted even if you're next to a mosque and you have an excuse not to pray in the mosque you can pray outside of the mosque you can pray in your house which is next to the mosque now it's obligatory to pray in the mosque but if you don't your prayer is accepted you have a sin because you've abandoned praying with the congregation but your prayer is correct anywhere you pray now in regards of graveyards and uh uh uh toilets and and and and places of of of junkyard junkyard yards and the the Hadith will come inshallah uh later on it's a different story it's and these are exceptions but we're talking about generalities now you can pray anywhere that's great and you can also purify yourself using Earth and this is and we will come to explain this inshallah on the following hadiths but if in the case of uh loss of water you cannot use water or you have scarce amount of water and you cannot use it because then you will die of thirst then you may may use the dry Evolution you also may use it if you are ill or you have something that prevents you from washing your limbs an injury Burns or so on a bandages broken uh arms or whatever and we will get to this inshallah uh later on and then the prophet says Sall wasallam about the booty or Loot and we went through that and then he says uh about the intercession and the last and fifth thing that he was sent to All humankind previous Messengers may Allah have peace and blessing upon them all used to be sent to their tribes to their people Moses for example Mustafa Moses was sent to Ben is Ben Israel the sons of Israel the Jews and Jesus uh Zaki Jesus Christ was sent to in also the sons of Israel the Jews now Abrahim was sent to uh uh the phans or the assurans or whatever tribe in Iraq he was sent to I wasn't there but I know that he was sent there uh Muhammad on the other hand sallallahu alaihi wasallam was sent to all mankind and also to the Jin so he's not only sent to humans he was also sent to Jin and sallallahu alai wasam is the Seal of the prophethood and that is why he was sent to all mankind because there will not be a messenger after him there there will not be a prophet after him and anyone who claims that there's a messenger or Prophet after him is not a Muslim he's a cafir regardless of what they say or think or do because he is the Seal of the Prophet Hood Sall wasam so he was sent to All Mankind and any objective objective uh uh uh student of knowledge if he studies objectively the Quran and the Sunnah he will find that 99.9% is false proof uh proof you can you can you cannot question it it is logical it is perfect and that is why jaali when he went to alhabash and he spoke to the king of habas Nashi Nashi was telling him what is this new religion that your Prophet brought if you listen to the things he listed it's all common sense he told them that he told us not to fornicate he told us not to do this and not to do that and my cameraman waves to me and says that this we have to pause for a break so please stay tuned and we will be right back inshallah we are covering the manners in Islam that a Muslim is supposed to have in Islam there is a strong link between having good manners and piety and then he said I guarantee a dwelling in the highest rank of Jenna for the one who perfect his manner that indeed truthfulness leads to piety to righteousness and righteousness and piety leads to J the prophet sallallah alhi wasallam used to always maintain Family Ties gentleness in Islam means to treat people with kindness and with tenderness alayum and welcome back uh as we've said that this Hadith tells us what the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam has been given and and The Messengers and prophets of Allah were not given as him the five things I think we've spent enough time talking about this Hadith we should move on to Hadith number 110 narrated The Prophet if I may interrupt do we say or why because was a companion and his father was one of the first Martyrs in Islam Yas so and who was the mother of Amar suay sumay so Sumaya and yaser they were all slaves and uh they were tortured and killed by the mush so that's why when we say AB we say may Allah be pleased with them that is Abdullah the narrator and his father Abbas the uncle of the Prophet both are companions but when we talk about one companion that is a Muslim and his father is not so we say such asdah we say was not a Muslim Malik he's one an but when we say may Allah be pleased with them please go onar the prophet Sall alai wasallam sent me on an errand then I became junob from seminal admission in my sleep I did not find water so I rolled on the soil like an animal does to perform T then I returned to the prophet sallu alaihi wasallam and mentioned that to him he sallallahu alaihi wasallam said it would have been sufficient for you to do with your hands this way he then struck his struck his hands once on the soil and then rubbed the left hand on the right hand on the right and the exterior part of his palms and his face in a narration of albari he Allah's messenger sallallah wasallam struck the Earth with his palms both hands and then blew off the dust and rubbed both of his palms over his face and hands okay nowar was sent on a mission he went may Allah be pleased with him and while he was away on this mission he had what is called the uh called uh the nocturnal emission or wet dreams it happens with everyone so he had this wet dream and he did not have water enough for him to perform the obligatory or the total bath he did not have water to perform so he didn't know what to do so he picked his cell phone and called The Prophet Sall wasallam they didn't have any cell phones and and and and he has to pray it's prayer time he cannot wait until he goes back to Medina it may take a day or two so the only thing that came up to his mind was okay I know that dry Evolution which is striking the the the Earth and wiping the face and hands is good for praying if I don't have water for the minor impurity not the major sexual impurity now I have a I'm in a dilemma I don't know what to do I have this major impurity which is sexual impurity and I'm I'm not sure if it's if this stroke is enough it seems a little bit too small for the whole body so the only thing that came up to his mind was he tried his best so he rolled on the floor on the ground like animals do and he dusted his whole body thinking that but this should suffice and he prayed and when he went to the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam told him and he told him that I did this so what do you think should I get a first prize or what the prophet s said no that was that wasn't needed all what you needed was this and he did the way that t we all know which is striking the Palms on the on the ground or on the floor on the soil on the rocks on whatever you could put your hands on on on the Flo on the ground and then he wiped his face of course there's another version that he blw so that uh you don't have any dust or uh particles that may uh you know harm you or bother you and he did this W wiped his face and His Hands that's it you don't have to go to the elbows as if you're forming a bution now there are a few things I think I believe strongly that we should you know uh uh consider imagine those who come and say tell me what's the logic behind this what's the logic behind that when you tell people that wearing gold for male is forbidden and it's permissible for females they would say why you tell them the prophet said soam said again why it's it's not logical I'm not going to accept this there are people that won't accept anything that is not logical to them and this is unacceptable from them why I'll tell you why now what's logical for me may not be logical for you now it's like extremism fanaticism if someone looks at me he would regard me as a fanatic say this guy is is Extreme everything is Haram Haram Haram Haram regardless am if I'm saying that Allah says or the prophet says they would regard me as extreme but on the other hand they would say that this person who has these characteristics he shaves his beard uh he does this he does that he listens to music he watches movies and he enjoys his life he may go to uh uh the diso um once a week he might have a you know social Drinker uh a couple of drinks here there may may smoke a joint here there he's he he prays they would say that ah this is moderate this guy is a okay but if this guy goes to the west and he lives among the n Muslims they would consider him as to be a little bit tight he's a little bit extreme why because his wife doesn't dance with us his daughters don't date our boys and he doesn't do he doesn't eat uh uh uh this or he doesn't do that there are limitations so extremism is different depending on how you look which end you're looking at likewise if you talk about logic if you ask anyone how do you feel about stealing from others they would say this is bad we we can't accept this this is wrong but if you go to a professional thief and ask him how do you feel about stealing from others piece of cake I I enjoy doing this and I think it's a good thing everybody everybody should try it but if you ask this thief about SM smoking pot it said no no no no that's bad it's bad for you it makes you do things it can make the police catch you so it's bad for the business and if you go to a junkie and ask him about drugs he's consuming they said well man it makes me high makes me good I'm okay with that but if you ask him about stealing he said Woo that's bad bad news so the logic is different and Islam tells us that everything in Islam is logical but your logic may not uh uh uh elevate to this level in every single step you may understand few things you may understand lots of things but there are things that your logic is unable unable to uh uh understand them or comprehend them so you have to follow without asking for the logic and that is why we tell people follow the Quran and follow the Sunnah don't go left right or Center just follow the Holy Quran what brings us to this is that uh the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam told us how to perform T let's go to the logic a Christian comes to me say what's your religion I say our religion is to testify that there is no God but Allah and that Muhammad is his messenger said okay tell me more I said we pray five times a day uhhuh how do you pray we do this and that he say what do you do to pray I say we perform abolon five times a day what's evolution said I wash my limbs I turn the water in my mouth I rinse my nose I wash my face and my my my feet he said how many times you do that said well the average is 3 by five it's 15 times a day God this is nice man you clean your your limbs with water your religion is a religion of cleanliness I love your religion um so you're happy you know the Christian is enthusiastic about your religion and then he says what happened if you don't have water said oh it's piece of cake you just hit the soil with your hands and wipe your face with the soil and your hands said what what you talking about a while ago you're talking about washing and cleanliness and now you're asking me to dirt my face are you are you crazy well this is Islam gee let me look uh yeah I never thought of it this way God and then you start to have your own doubts you shouldn't who told you to perform ation in the beginning Allah who told you if you don't have water to perform the T thetion again it's Allah so then you have no problem you should follow and comply with the instructions of Allah the almighty and that is why one should always stick to the Quran and stick to the Sunnah and we should not go on and on trying to find logic behind every single thing because this is one of the greatest doors for Satan to enter you will he will come to you and say okay I'm convinced intoxicants are forbidden because they blow your mind off stealing from others is forbidden because it causes the spread of chaos and uh H uh killing people is bad because somebody someone else would come and kill you but I I have this thing towards gambling I'm a P of Gambler and I I love Las Vegas you know with the roulettes and with the slot machines and with the poker it's fun man and I have a lot of money so why is it haram he's enjoying it I'm enjoying it I can't buy this I'm I don't want to take this anymore this is the biggest door for Satan to come and penetrate your faith and Iman through because then he casts his doubts onto you thinking that religion is not a perfect one your religion is the perfect one you cannot find loopholes in Islam while you can find so many in other religions and this is the power and the greatness of Islam that it is a one religion that is 100% full I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program but inshallah next time we meet we will go through the uh issues connecting and until then bar a"
