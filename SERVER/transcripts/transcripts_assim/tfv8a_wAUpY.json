  "transcript": "uh so I have a question I'm in dental school in the USA currently and as part of our training which I don't think I'll be able to get out of in any way is that we have to have some female patients if it's just for training purposes and I'm going to graduate and not accept women patients would that be okay just for the sake of Medical Training all Scholars say that doctors are permitted and allow owed to treat the opposite gender because this is a necessity whether the doctor is a male or a female they are allowed to treat the opposite gender providing that there is a necessity and in your case definitely even after graduation you will have female patients who would need a root canal or to uh fix a crown for them or extracted tooth or do surgeries and this is part of your job there's nothing wrong in that at all"
