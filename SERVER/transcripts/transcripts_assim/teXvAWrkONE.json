  "transcript": "this session is dedicated to speak about the rights of the husband which would sound and seem a bit bias but what will balance it the session that Sal will inshallah give about the rights of the wife so don't be offended because what we're talking about is pure P this is the law of Allah any feeling that is a bit negative in your heart and I'm talking to the sisters you should immediately eliminated because Allah has mentioned twice in Surah Al had told us that resentment and hatred of Allah's law would render your Deeds invalid meaning it is an act of apostasy to hate Allah's law so immediately anytime you feel such unease you immediately discard this and transform it into having said that Islam holds a very important status and position for the husband and this is what the enemies of Islam are trying relentlessly to change through their mean media through their movies through their culture through their laws and unfortunately us Muslims are weak and we're vulnerable we're ready to change and to adapt to anything just in order to blend so even breaking the head we're ready to do that it's okay I'm ready to do that Muslims are ready to to wear bracelets they're ready to wear necklaces in the first s you see men wearing NE what are what is this blending in we're weak we want to imitate so when it comes to issues of the status of man of a husband a lot of women among the Muslims are negatively affected but Islam is firm listen Allah says about the status of man men are in charge of women by right of what Allah has given one over the other and what they spent for maintenance from their wealth this is mentioned in the Quran the prophet says if a woman prays her five daily prayers fast her month that is Ramadan guards her Chastity and obeys her husband four things only what will happen it will be said to her enter Paradise from whichever of the gates of paradise you wish only four things the woman is told to do and the prophet saysat if I were to command anyone to prostrate to anyone other than Allah I would have commanded women to prostrate to their husbands wow he says by the one in whose hand is the soul of Muhammad No Woman No Woman can fulfill her Duty towards Allah until she fulfills her Duty towards her husband as a woman if I were to hear this would I say on the spot or but Subhan Allah but he does this he does that his mother did this his father did that and he's not giving me my rights he SCS me he what are you doing this is Shan kicking in your head so that you do not accept Allah's law the ayat of the Quran the prophet's Hadith be careful once the prophet saw a woman and he said do you have a husband she said yes so he said how are you with him she says I do not neglect any of his rights except those I'm unable to fulfilled meaning I'm doing the best of my ability to please him so the prophet said look at how you are with him for he is your paradise and your hell what does that mean depending on how you deal with him if you deal with him in a good way and please him and Obey him he's your Paradise he will take you directly to Jenna but if you do not do the above you will go to hell before of your because of your nagging because of of your Disobedience because of the discomfort you're introducing to his life what does this tell you it tells me that Islam clearly favors men over women correct sh there is equality no no no there is no equality in Islam between man and wife and woman like says yesterday said yesterday there's no equality if there is equality this year I will become pregnant so next year she becomes pregnant the following year I become pregnant there is no equality otherwise I would sit home for a year relax and she goes and works pays the bill and the utility bills and the rent Etc there is fairness there is so there are many many rights for the husband over his wife but but we don't have enough time unfortunately number one to obey him in everything he orders her as long as it's one normal and two there is no sin in it there is no sin we understand nobody you don't have to be a rocket scientist take off your hijab I don't like it when you go out with me and people are looking at you black and black take of your hijab no this is Central okay keep your hijab but when my friends come my cousins my brothers you come and sit with them without hijab no this is Central there is no dispute in that Haram is Haram okay sit with me and let's watch Netflix let's watch uh uh this concert let's watch filthy pornography it's you and me my wife no problem no there is a problem is simple in end of story but what do you mean by obeying him in what is normal when he says stand on one foot for half an hour Allah told you to obey me why would I is it sinful no but why would I because I want turn off the air conditioning we will roast it's hot it's 35 45Â° upside I just want this when I leave no electricity in the house no this is not no you're crazy simple as that this is not nor this is what is meant and we have a lot of evidences to that I don't think you need evidences you just need an eye opener because of time constraints number two his right for a woman to protect his reputation and to take care of his wealth and children what is reputation in Arabic the Arabs call their women what is in [Music] Arabic this is in the farewell uh Hadith the prophet said your wealth your blood and your and so it is the place where your insult affects or your praise affect this is so whatever criticism I get you're speaking in my and the Arabs consider their women folk their so any attempt to abuse them to to harass them to sler them you are attacking my so here it's one of the husband's rights that his is protected by not coming out in in not abiding by the because when other people see what will they say oh the husband is a de youth the husband does not care whether his women folk commit Haram go out with men uh men uh uh uh Feast their eyes on their beauty so this is reflecting on me it's coming back on me it's my reputation and my it is a woman's Duty as a right of the husband to protect that what does Allah say Allah says in Ayah 34 Surah chapter 4 so righteous women are devoutly obedient guarding in the husband's absence what Allah would have them guard so this is part of the husband's rights number three to Adorn themselves and to beautify themselves not to the public only for your eyes for your eyes only as a husband why because the man is also ordered to do this but this is not my talk this is Sal's talk a woman has to always be topnotch when the husband looks and topnotch when the husband smells why is he a dog is he going A Smith go no no it is the Arab advice to their daughters since 2,000 years in the literature of Arabia all women advise their daughters even at the time of the Prophet before that I son my daughter don't let him see something unpleasant and don't ever let him smell something unpleasant a righteous woman showers once or twice a day just for the sake of being clean being pure she applies body body lotion as men do men do that yes you they do that I do that do to whom do you no of course not no I don't know my wife because I like from her what she likes from me but this is not my point my point is talk about women has to always be TN why is it when she goes to a wedding or to visit someone she spends half an hour with the hair dryer in the room what are you doing vacuuming no no don't doing my hair I'm going out and he said who are you I'm your wife well I couldn't recognize you why did you look like this for me because I'm going out so she doesn't do this to me no a righteous woman does it as a form of she's worshiping Allah when she's applying makeup or taking care of her hair or wearing nice dresses or smelling nice she's doing it for a not necessarily something is going to happen but she wants award if is like this that is a righteous woman number four she confines herself to her home oh sh no this is too much I have to go to uh the mall I have to go to I have to go Avenues Avenues I have to do I can't I feel fed up I have at least take the car and go for 1 hour 2 hour drive what is this I'm no listen to what Allah says and abide in your houses and do not display yourselves as was the display of the former times of ignorance this is Allah's words in the Quran stay home what are are prisoners are you arguing with me this is what Allah says in the Quran but Allah did not say you're prisoners you can go if there's a legitimate reason but to be on the street 24 hours 7 days a week Brothers come to me and complain sh my wife I don't know she wasn't feeling good she took off and came back at 1:00 a.m. she wasn't replying to my mobile who's wearing the pants who's the man she came back at one where were you roing around down the corish I wasn't feeling good that's normal I'm a human being nor this is not normal one of you is the man and women don't do this normally number five she must not and number six number five she must not allow anyone the husband does not approve of in his home and she must not fast when he's present in town voluntary fast without his permission the prophet says no woman should fast when her husband is present without his permission and she should not allow anyone to enter his house without his permission of course she would not allow the plumber to come in she would not allow the to come in no no this is what we mean of M for example so her uncle wants to come in and the husband doesn't approve of it she has to seek permission so this is a must that she seeks permission but most if not all husbands give an open permission they have no problem I give my wife an open permission since we married 40 years ago I don't care who she admits home because I trust my wife she never asks me where she's going because I trust my wife although islamically she cannot leave the house without taking my permission but I am not a tyrant I know my wife but this is my right as a husband what about some of the husbands who prevent their wives from giving a reception to their parents they husbands that say if your father comes or your mother comes don't let them in and the sister calls it's an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion he has no right except if the father or the mother are deviant and corrupt they spoil her thinking they ask her to do indecent and immodest actions in this case yes she's obliged to obey but no no cas just because there is difference of opinion or his parents are fighting with her parents so he wants to punish them no he has no right to prevent her from seeing them or admitting them because this is bearing this in mind the woman has definitely no right to say well my mom is visiting us for 3 months and you have to host her no I don't have to host her she can go to any hotel yes she can come one day two days three days a week but more than that no this is my house so she has to acknowledge this number seven my right over my wife that she should accept whatever I can provide and not ask for the sky and this is unfortunately not the case many women demand I want this I want that financially where the husband is unable to provide for these things so a righteous woman would accept the very little that is provided Allah says let a man of wealth spend from his wealth and he whose provision is restricted let him spend from what Allah has given him Allah does not charge a soul except according to what heel has given it my is 100 KD don't ask me to provide you a a house that the rent is 100 KD where am I going to feed you from where am I going to pay the utility bills so you have to be realistic and logical number eight and this is one of the greatest rights of a husband over his wife the prophet says if a woman sleeps abandoning her husband's bed the angel curse her until she goes back so the right of intimacy this is a clearcut right you don't like him you don't feel like it you're angry because of what he said or what he has done no justification no excuse yes if you're sick and this is harmful for you Allah gives you the the option but every time the man the poor man he has only one wife and he sees so much F outside everywhere he goes there are people not abiding by the hijab sometimes even at work he's being seduced he's being lured by the co-workers and the opposite gender and as the song says I'm a family man but if you push me too far I just might Shan is there so what do I do this is the only Hal outlet and there is no retailers this is the only place I have what do I do I go to where Allah made oh I have headache oh I have to sleep early oh I do this I do that what do I do she a second wife or a third wife I can't afford it then let it be known that your wife is being cursed every single night until the break of dawn by whom by the angels and do you think Allah will respond to the Angels or neglect them Allah answers their Dua so this is a very critical point and again and again and again this is a form of worship if a woman proposes and displays herself to be intimate for the sake of Allah he's having fun she's having fun and she's rewarded as if she prayed night prayer or fasted voluntary fasting the prophet s prohibited a woman from fasting Mondays and Thursdays and uh uh the three white days unless the husband gives a okay he did not have intimacy with me for a whole month and tomorrow is Monday can I fast no he doesn't even look at me you have to ask for permission or your fasting is invalid Allah will not accept it this is how important a husband is in Islam number nine she has to and this is my right as a as a husband take care of my children when I selected a wife I did not just select a wife for intimacy I selected the mother of my children and I want her to take care of my children because I work 8 to 10 hours a day outside she sits with them more than I do she's more tolerant she's more patient and she yesterday reminded us so she's the one who has to invest and put more effort yes the father has to do some work but he's a manager so one word of him is equivalent maybe to 2 hours of the mother and he does this boys they sto they're displine but at the same time the the vast majority of the hard work is on the wife number 10 my right as a husband is that my wife treats my parents my relatives my guests well because she's my whatever negativity she attracts and observes reflects and deflects on me and my reputation and I know hundreds and thousands of men who come to me and they say I am blessed by a mermaid but she doesn't know how to swim I am blessed by a from J W when guests come to my home I feel ashamed I said what she she takes good care of them she cleans their rooms she gives Hospitality food she buys this until my guests go out with a smile from here to him they said man we had the best time of our lives she spends hours in the kitchen kicking cooking food for them after they leave I kiss her hands and feet and this is a rare commodity among women you won't find this but if you do hold on to her because she's gim number 11 she is a woman that keeps her husband's Secrets she's not roiter she she's not Associated Press and definitely not the CNN some women are like this Subhan Allah you go to the shopkeeper and you sayah your cousin got a child he just got that 5 minutes ago how did you know oh I have my sources and then you get to know that your wife was there some women go around and expose Secrets especially to their parents the wife goes my husband did this my husband did that and this this is the biggest mistake a woman can do in her life to complain to her parents about her husband because tomorrow is's going to give her a gift or buy her some gold and she's going to come embracing him the next week kissing him in front of her parents and he's the best man on in the world their parents would not buy this you've already stabed them in the heart when you complained about your husband they're not going to be happy or satisfied with him except maybe after 10 15 years so be careful of what you say number 12 of course secrets in general and specifically intimacy secrets and this goes for both men and women these secrets should not leave the chambers at all otherwise Allah would consider this or this is considered to be a major sin number 12 my rights over my wife is that she serves me and my children not like the new trend Now give me or get me a maid I don't clean I don't cook buy us food from outside why said this is my my right in Islam I had a mate in My Father's House you provide me with one or two no this is not right it is an obligation upon a woman to serve her husband and children in the house as it is the obligation of the husband to work and provide a ceiling and a roof over their heads and food on the table and pay for their medical expenses among other things Allah says and due to them that is the women is similar to what is expected from them according to what is reasonable so they want things from their husbands then they have to do their due diligence and provide their husbands what is expected from them my time is up but in a n these are again rights and this does not mean that is it and the woman does not deal with her husband Etc with 1 + 1 = 2 okay let me see no I don't have to do this I don't I don't have to do that this is not true there are other things further than rights a smile being compassionate being loving being caring it's different than you do your duty because it's a duty I have to do it so it's my duty to take you to the hospital when you're sick as a wife but can you tell by my expression on my face if I'm happy or not that would make her even more sick when I'm grumpy and taking do this close the door come sit let's go get the medicine what is this she he told me it's an obligation to take her to the hospital and do this yes but there is something further more than such an obligation which is that you show The Compassion all of these beautiful Arabic words must be included in a relationship between a man and his wife so sisters this was dedicated to you and you may feel that this is bias but as I said I'm telling you what the sh says and now you will hear from what your rights are and that the husband should be doing and I hope he's also a bit biased towards the sisters so that they would feel the balance but at the end of the day men do have an extra Edge over women and this is a given you have to understand this this is how Allah created us there's no equality but there is fairness and Justice according to the Quran and Sunnah and once you adopt this once you get this in your system and you feel synchronized W you will be the happiest woman on earth the happiest woman who sits back home with a PhD or master's degree and her in-laws and her family say go to work earn money get some cash and she says this is natural I'd like to stay home take care of my husband take care of my house do my shortes do uh what I need to do with my children this is the happiest moment in my life because this is what Allah created me for and this is what I was created for unlike those those who have to have two Souls so they work they do their Shores they cook they serve and they have to go and work 8 hours in the office or at school just for few uh uh um Dinars or Dirhams and then what where is the Peace of Mind where is the Tranquility where's the ability to do what Allah told you to do they' have lost it and I to Allah that he grants us the acceptance of his religion and he makes us a coolness to our spouses eyes and to be the best of parents to our [Music] children"
