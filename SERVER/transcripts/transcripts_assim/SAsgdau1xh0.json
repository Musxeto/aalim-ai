  "transcript": "so next question is from brother shahul hamid can zakat money be given to extremely needy non-muslims who are not enemies of islam no the only category of the non-muslims who we can give zakat is known as these are those whom their hearts are inclined to accept islam so if i have a worker a co-worker a non-muslim janitor a tribesman the head of his tribes a king a president a ceo whatever he's not muslim and i see clearly that he's inclined to islam he talks to me about positively about islam i wish i can accept islam blah blah blah and i'm genuinely thinking and considering that this guy is a potential muslim so i can give him from zakat if he needs money if he i would think and hope that this money would draw him closer to islam and accepting islam this is totally permissible inshallah"
