  "title": "I am studying Fiqh on my own but people say I need a Sheikh?",
  "transcript": "rayyan from Belgium my question is um currently I am a kind of home studying because in my area I have searched but I did not find the Sheikh or anybody who takes students to study with him so all I can do really is study on my own so for doing this I use books I use multiple books like and I use them and I compare every subject so what's in this book what's not in this book and if I have differences I look it up on trustworthy sources like Islam QA so my question is I've heard a lot of people say that you really need a share or a usted to study a subjects like this in Islam so my question is for this specific subject so using books were trustworthy and comparing and looking up trustworthy sources is that enough to study at least to know for yourself what's good from what's not good and may Allah give you the best in this world and the next I mean this is something that depends on the best of your ability for someone who's in the middle of the ocean and only finds a piece of wood to hang on to he does not have the luxury of having a a Lifeboat or a nice big raft or a small yacht this is the best he could do no one in his sound mind would say to him no no no if it's not a Lifeboat Let It Go and drown so in your case in the cafe country you live in if there are no proper Scholars or students of knowledge that he could get in touch with and contact at the moment this is the best of your ability and Allah says in the Quran fear Allah to the best of your ability and this is the best of your ability so there's no problem in what you're doing however alhamdulillah you can always access some of the scholars or the students of knowledge through telephone through Twitter through their websites and prior level best to clarify things and learn properly to again the best of your ability rather than being content with just scrolling down these four or five books that you may very easily fall into fault and learn the wrong thing but compared to the good you're getting this is negligible yes you will probably learn 85 percent correct knowledge and 15 is not correct due to your understanding due to the material is not authentic and many other reasons so at the moment you're doing uh fine inshallah but try to find someone to call or to get in touch with online to clarify these uh queries and ambiguous things that you may not have understood foreign"
