  "transcript": "yusuf from canada um jeff my question is after the father passes away i want to know who's responsible for leading the family for what this person be obeyed and is responsible for leaking the family meeting the family meaning any are they all coming together uh who's responsible for taking care of the family okay for providing for the family annie okay after the death of the father the sons don't have a guardian to begin with but they have their mother and they're obliged to obey their mother in things related to the mother not in things related to their lives and their well-being the females of the family are obliged to obey their guardian again within the boundaries of their well-being not in things that are out of the ordinary but there isn't a father figure who everyone else is obliged to obey as when he was alive after his death may allah have mercy on him his soul this is almost demolished the mother remains to be the head of the family in terms of her children obeying her coming to live close to her to be dutiful to her but they she does not have the same control as the father used to have the girls or the females in islam again they are supposed to follow their male guardian providing that he is sound in in his choices and he does not go out of the norm and he does what he does for the rest of their interest as for providing for the family this is a collective issue those who work have to contribute to those who do not work or do not have financial means to take care of themselves as in the case that most females don't have savings or an income so it's the obligation of their siblings to do so but if the siblings are unable or if the girls themselves have an income or money the boys don't have to do anything for them and allah knows best you"
