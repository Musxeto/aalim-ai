  "transcript": "from bangladesh okay say i'm sorry for repeating the same question again but the last time i feel i didn't ask it properly so when i asked you that refraining from like doing a worship in front of people with whether it would be real or not and you said that if i do with fearing showing up then it will be weird but what if someone does it by not fearing showing up but rather he's shy you know like when somebody is in like a public vehicle and like there are lots of people around him and he's making dua but nobody knows that he's making dua then he gets this thought like okay raise the hand because raising hands is better but he doesn't because he doesn't because he's shy so would that be via because he's you know like not doing it because he's shy okay apparently that this issue has caused a lot of confusing confusion among the muslims first of all the saying not doing something for the sake of the people israel and doing it for the sake of people is shirk this is a saying of scholars it's not quran it's not sunnah it's an ishtihad and maybe they had looked at it from a particular angle maybe they wanted to [Music] raise red flags so that people would be intimidated from falling into this trap of shaitaan there might be a number of other reasons nevertheless this is not quran or sunnah meaning that oh if i do not do something that's sunnah or recommended or voluntary due to a reason of the fear of people i'm shy i'm not that equipped to clarify my stance to the others when they ask me and i refrain from it this is not real for example i go to a hanafi predominantly masjid and i know this area is extreme they're extremists and when the imam says if i say i mean i would be the only one in the masjid and probably bbs called it for that and probably people would look at me in a strange way should i do it no ah you're falling into riya no i'm not i'm just weighing the pros and cons and the way i see it it's best for me not to say it so that i would blend in and then if i give advice later on people would accept me and it's an issue of ishiti had depending on how you see yourself reacting and how people are reacting to your action so not every time if i refuse to raise my hands when making dua while traveling in a bus because i don't want people to think that i'm going to blow up the bus imagine if i do this and everybody says oh extremist is going to blow up the bus i don't do that for that fear am i committing riya no i'm not the bottom line is i'm leaving a sunnah ah why are you leaving the sunnah because it's not man there to do if i do it alhamdulillah if i don't do it i'm not sinful it's up to me when we come to mandatory acts and you don't want to pray in the masjid it's prayer time and you don't want to pray until it's almost out of time because you don't want your friends to say oh he is allah pray pray for us pray for go go and pray pray for us and they make fun of you nah nah this is a serious thing and it can be and it can be more than that depending but in leaving voluntary things when there is a legitimate reason or just simply because you don't want to do it this is not a problem in sha allah you"
