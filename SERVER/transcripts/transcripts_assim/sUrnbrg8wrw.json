  "transcript": "then we have charfat she says whoever performs also on friday and bathes completely and goes early arriving early gets close and listens and is silent there will be for him in every step he takes the reward of a year of fasting and standing in prayer sheikh can you explain this hadith the hadith is authentic but it's more elaborate than this the whoever takes russell for friday and thoroughly makes russell so he cleans himself well and he goes off early to the masjid wa masha well amirkab and he walks and does not ride wadena imam you are unsold he gets as close as possible to the imam he listens he doesn't say anything or engages in anything what's the reward for this allah will write for him will accredit him with every step he makes one step allah will grant you the reward of a whole year as if you have fasted the 360 days and prayed the 360 nights night prayer so if i live like a thousand steps away from the masjid allah will grant you a thousand years of such reward this is mind blowing but who does this rarely you find people doing this they'll come five minutes just before the imam enters the masjid and they will not get this reward so this hadith is authentic and it's worthy of muslims to do it you"
