  "transcript": "smiling in the face of your brother of course and gender I don't want sisters to come and smile in the face of brothers at soccer yeah the same gender smiling in the face of the same gender your brother is a charity helping your mother in the kitchen is a charity feeding the presumption is getting very used now men are professional cooks now we know how to cook everything much a lot of work a lot and especially at these times of coffee 90 men and women around us are suffering especially those who are dependent on their daily wages and there is no work so we have to give a call check on them see if they have food if they have groceries don't think that you live it in in a rich country with suffice check on people and of course the the try to divide your day and night so that you don't get bored so if you recite for and for one hour and then you feel a little bored engage in making duaa this is the month of drop then engage in listening to a lecture then go and check on the poor and to give them charity as a father give them food give them so-and-so then engage in night prayer or praying in effort then engage in teaching someone who needs to be taught et cetera the Duat they know this alhamdulillah they've got their your any plates full they have so much so many things on their plate especially in Ramadan and with the internet they have lectures they have seminars they have participation with us or Angela we have Zee TV show we also have our programme on daily basis but as shadi said it is extremely important not to go into the loop without rectifying your Nia don't let this be a system why are you doing this Oh every day I have this and I have that and I'm doing this and I'm doing that why because I'm used to it it's a habit no do it because you are seeking Allah's forgiveness a las mercy which we are trying hard to attain and to get into a las Paradise which happens to be a las mercy as described by the prophet a sermon idea so she like you rightly mentioned right so one of the things I understood from you know that relates to the situation we are into is the fact that people would be saying yeah we're paying with fasting we're reading the Quran saying I'm gonna make the most out of this month so I'm going to do this this but they ignore the fact that in this such a situation allah subhanho wa taala because islam is balanced then there is certain that the help they can give to their parents or their families their wives their kids taking looking after them during these situations so would that also be a recommendation in terms of balancing between your dad and then also balancing when the house will work me you are not ignoring all of those important things because of the situation and as arised looking after your neighbors you know trying to see how best you can you know get in touch with the people you you know could be into a problem so that's another thing maybe people would be loading on so is that the commend it is that something that they should do they should focus on the rest of the aspects of the kind of situation it demands okay I think you're asking me see the problem is that being a servant of Allah soldier does not limit your duties only in taraweeh fasting in giving charity reading the Quran and that's it and unfortunately this might be one of the traps of shape on and you may say sure what do you mean by traps of Shaytan you're scaring me say okay Ruba Hasan attain at Haddad Sahib and not maybe one good deed would admit the person who did it to Hellfire and maybe once in would admit the person who did it to paradise sometimes when we come to Ramadan and I finished praying eleven records of taraweeh and I'm so happy of myself Shaitaan comes and says after you got credit you've just charged your good deeds book with a lot of good deeds so why not watch Netflix Susumu okay that's good so you spent like an hour or two watching something Haram listening to something Haram banking and depending on the good deeds that you had done and this is one of the greatest traps of Shaitaan don't limit Ramadan to p.m. Elaine - reciting the Quran - charity - fasting and that's it it's a 24/7 process you have to be inside out the servant of Allah Azza WA JAL and you have to diversify the ways of worshiping allah azzawajal by being kind to your siblings being kind and beautiful to your parents taking care of your children utilizing every day every hour and every minute of this month to get closer to Allah"
