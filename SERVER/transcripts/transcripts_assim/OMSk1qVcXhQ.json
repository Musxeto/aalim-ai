  "title": "Colleagues know tender bids & are quoting lower price to get project, I sign papers assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "send your question correctly Muhammad your colleagues have established a company but because they have inside information they can check all the tenders and if the lowest price is a hundred thousand they from their own company submit a tender of 95 000. am I correct in this yeah yeah if they're doing the same work and it's all legitimate the CEO all everyone else knows they are cheating but if you are not helping them in cheating You're simply know about this fact and you're a paper pusher you just get the tenders and you sign that this is the cheapest in the market but it's not your responsibility to investigate whether they have a real company or not because this is the responsibility of the engineering department to go and check their credentials and whether their quality is in accordance to their standards mentioned in the tenders or not if this is the case they are sinful for their cheating and breaching the confidence and Trust entrusted in them and Allah would not put any Baraka and blessing in their work but I don't see anything Haram from your side and Allah knows best Muhammad"
