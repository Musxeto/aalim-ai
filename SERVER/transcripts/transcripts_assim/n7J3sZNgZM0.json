  "transcript": "says does a wife need her husband's permission every time she steps out of the house what if the husband is out of town must she call him every time to take his permission the general trend is that a woman must deal with her husband with respect and obedience because this is what will admit her to Jenna the prophet saidat four things if a woman succeeds in doing them she will enter Jenna if she prays her F prayers the five daily prayers fasts her Ramadan protects her Chastity and obeys her husband she will enter Paradise from any she wants and this by itself is nothing compared to what men have to do in order to qualify to enter Jenna so we think but it indeed it's a heavy burden and a great task for women to undertake and this is their test in this life in the authentic Hadith in the incident of IFK where the Hypocrites slandered mother AA in the long Hadith in bukari and elsewhere when she discovered what they were plotting and saying behind her back she fell sick but she said oh prophet of Allah do you permit me to visit my parents this the scholars say is a clear indication that a woman must not leave her house without the permission of her husband now generally speaking normal husbands give an open permission I give my wife an open permission to leave wherever she wants to go wherever she wants because I trust her I have no problem with that however my wife till date does not go without informing me I'm going to my mom's house I'm going to do this or that I'm going to visit a friend and I say you don't have to say to that to me she said no I feel it's my obligation and this is normal but if the husband insists in this case yes you have to seek his permission having said that some men exaggerate and they make their wives live in a prison so they totally force them to boycott their family don't go and visit your parents you're not allowed to see your siblings you're not allowed to go out and the woman feels suffocated now in so many cases such relationships end up in divorce but after it's too late like after 20 years or so this is due to the woman being too submissive yes you're obliged to obey him but there is a limit when the man exceeds logic and rationale and he insists your gold that your parents gave you that my family gave you that your friends gave you you have to give it to me I'll keep it with my mom and she complies are you nuts why would you give it to him oh he's my husband Sheikh so what he does not have any right over your financial possessions say no or he may threaten me to divorce the hell with him so what it's better to live with dignity and honor and set the record straight with this man instead of him using you as a doormat yes you are obliged to obey him to honor him to be dutiful to him but he's not allowed to transgress so your financial accounts I need your ATM I have to know the password show me your mobile show me your passcode show me your emails tell me the passwords why you make him wipe his feet every time he enters the door because you're a doorm you deserve what you get draw the line and tell him listen hun we are a husband and wife I'm obliged to obey you but you're obliged to respect me and to treat me like a woman not like a servant or a slave and unfortunately we have an imbalance and this imbalance causes a lot of such problems so to come to answer your question yes you have to ask him for permission but also you have to uh analyze and see how the relationship is going so that you can evaluate your marriage"
