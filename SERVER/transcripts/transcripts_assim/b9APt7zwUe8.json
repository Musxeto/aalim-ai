  "title": "Is Science the only answer? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "hey Manila solemn anniversary learning he was happy here many today because there who am back Salam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh you may find my talk a bit boring and this is what my children usually tell me but I will try my level best and I pray to Allah that my level best is accepted our topic is is science the only answer so who would define to me what science is see I put the ball in your court so it would not be boring now you are boring study of the environment environment ecology but this is not only science this is a branch of science right so what is science what is science in Arabic so Israeli mentioned in the Quran do you have one ayah you cannot say no without even thinking any derivative over him let us not go there let us go to something you know Shama what is the first word revealed in the Quran hey Paula what does it mean read and it also means recited because the Prophet was not learned he could not read so it can mean recite to say and this highlights to you the importance of knowledge in Islam no other religion comes and tells people to learn to read to acquire knowledge if you look all over the world all religions suppresses knowledge acquisition why religions other than Islam fear that knowledge would make you reject the religion accept Islam because Islam goes side-by-side with modern-day Sciences however if you look into the or an you will find that the knowledge mentioned in the Quran is different to the knowledge we think is crucial and essential that is these Sciences any one of you was born knowledgeable raise your hands please okay why hit one masha'Allah did you understand my question I said did anyone thought there's another one there mashallah okay I'll ask a question again has any one of you born knowledgeable when you came from your mother's womb when you were one day old were you knowledgeable so all of us when we were born we could not speak we could not hear we could not see we had no knowledge at all if they put in front of us fire we would not know that it was harmful if we're a put in front of us food we would not even be able to eat it correct Allah Allah says and Allah has brought you out from the wombs of your mothers while you know nothing and he gave you hearing sight and hearts that you might give thanks to Allah so now you have knowledge go gave it to you or I'm strong I got the knowledge myself is it it's Allah he's the one who makes you knowledgeable you work Allah gives you more you don't work Allah keeps you ignorant but the knowledge comes from allah azzawajal and knowledge without action knowledge without practice has no benefit if a doctor who has completed so many years in college he knows that this is harmful this causes cancer this causes high blood pressure and this would make him die this is knowledge correct if he still smokes if he still does not work out in the gym and practice did his knowledge benefit him he will die out of what he wants people of so many times I see doctors they have these big bellies masha'Allah I don't know how they can see their shoes when they tie their laces maybe they need outside assistance maybe that's why they have assistance and a nurses they do this for them with all due respect to the medical I hope we don't have any nurses here and they're so big so fat with a packet of cigarette in their pockets and they see very bad high blood pressure you have cholesterol very high levels you have to work out you have to try to lose weight you have to get in shape you look at him say subhanAllah what are you doing you are hypocrite it's like when a share comes do you say feel a lot more and he's doing something else he's African and this is why you have to implement whatever knowledge you have and apply it in your life Allah Azza WA JAL made that clear in the Quran when he says so no o Muhammad SAW Allah Allah no acknowledge that there is no deity except Allah and ask forgiveness for your sin and for the believing men and believing women am i started with knowledge so No acknowledged before seeking forgiveness which means that we cannot act or do things without knowledge imagine someone coming to the Masjid Salam alaikum when you Muslims yes Muslim what I what you want to do I want to pray what are you going to pray I don't know okay how are you going to pray I don't know which is you know the people should know what is the problem do you know salat is composed of four raka what is how can you not have knowledge of rock rock or Qibla or salat or Ludo should know I don't have knowledge but I want to pray can he do this he has to get what knowledge and this is why knowledge has great importance in Islam unlike other religions where it tells you no separate knowledge from your religion they are different Islam says they go side by side knowledge makes people high ignorance make people low in the Quran when you heat this ayah what do you think Allah says Allah will raise those who have believed among you and those who were given knowledge by degrees Allah will raise two types believers and knowledgeable people so who are those whom am I going to elevate in degrees when it comes to knowledge the knowledgeable but what kind of knowledge we have to look into the Quran in the Quran if you read it from cover to cover you will never find allah azza wajal ordering his messenger sallallaahu are you are you seldom to ask for increase in anything would you like to be rich those who don't want to like to be rich raise your hands now people are looking behind so before I raise it no you have to take your own decision don't depend on people okay you don't want to be rich can I have your wallet you don't have good one that's a problem okay this is why no one doesn't like to be rich if I say I'll give you a hundred Katy's would you take it maybe you'll say can you make it two hundred please I want to not buy it buy the new Playstation everyone wants money do you want to become strong do you want to become [Music] someone of great prominence of a CEO in a company a manager business owner would you like to have four cars you know what what live for cars why I like to have five cars cars don't you like cars no cars only mashallah modest you don't like BMX bicycles everyone wants something and want a lot of it in the Quran you will never find such an instruction to the prophet alayhi salaatu Sarah except in knowledge allah azzawajal says in the quran and say my lord increase me in knowledge allah azza wa jal orders his messenger Ali Saleh to serve with the very best so what is the best this knowledge and no one understands without knowledge Allah says and these examples we present to the people but none will and them except those of knowledge so many verses in the Quran we read them and we pass by them without understanding which means that without knowledge you cannot understand them however what is the knowledge that we are seeking now in the Quran in the hadith when a logical craziest knowledge when the Prophet Allah is awesome highlights beautiful knowledge what kind of knowledge scholars say knowledge or sciences are divided into two types the first type is the Islamic knowledge and the second type is the none Islamic knowledge having said that we don't talk about how our knowledge no not Islamic meaning that it does not have Islamic Sciences so please also the daughters share with me what different types of Islamic knowledge do we have one the knowledge of hadith what is the knowledge of hadith no when we talk about science see very soona Sunnah is whatever the Prophet had done alayhi salat wa sallam so whatever he said whatever he acted upon whatever he saw and did not comment whatever description of his physical this is cause it to be Sunnah hadith science is a greater and more specific terminology so it talks there is masala and hadith we taught which talks about authentic non-authentic so how can we disc study the chain of narrators to know whether it's accepted or not then study the actual text whether it's authentic or not there is helpful hadith there is tough scene already the same and interpretation of it said it's a big branch of science she's good what else very good knowledge very good mashaallah knowledge of the quran which includes a great number of different Sciences such as rue du monde Quran so we talk about the sciences of the Quran which includes a lahar al Haas al mualim a loop a yet the abrogated things that came I was revealed when were they revealed why were they revealed there is the Mukti or an and there is the maddening or an and there is a Saifi and there is a we whether whether it was revealed in summer or revealed in winter and so many things there is also the science of tough seal maybe this was what you're referring to and which is one of the greatest sciences of Islam you have to read the Deaf see to understand what the scholars said about this particular ayah and there is the science of Tara at the different recitations and the way it is recited and so on okay what else do we have mentioned this the Sunnah of the Prophet we have mentioned it what else though right this is small you have to look at the bigger picture there is a science that talks about the rights of women the Sharia law but the Sharia law is composed of all the sciences if we were to say look maybe this is more what the study helps that is your Mahara voodoo how do I perform hoodoo and if I tell you now come and perform I would laughter from here until Mallory because a lot of the Muslims when I look at them when they make woudl it is so laughable people do things you know washing their necks washing their bags doing things crazy things what are you doing some people may also open their eyes and watch the inside of their eyes don't laugh this is found they people say it some people even related to other of the companies' some of the comparison it deals with Salah how to perform Salah and if you look at the people and how they perform their salat they just follow their fathers and grandfathers or mothers and grandmothers but if you ask them why do you do this and you don't have knowledge you don't have the hadith that tells you the Prophet used to do this with record once you don't know I don't know fib deals with fasting the rulings what breaks her fast and what does not of giving zakat when do I pay 2.5% zakat and 5% in 10% and 25% zakat different categories it deals with hedge how to perform tomato Quran a fraud it also deals in where I'm allowed transactions selling and buying what is RIBA and what is hot and what is Haram it deals with marriages divorces waiting period known as their it how long our custody of the children it deals with the prescribed punishment ha when shall I cut your neck if you kill someone well you have to take you to the court and the judge would say kill him sometimes we cannot kill you we pay blood money sometimes they say I forgive you all of these things when killing by mistake is compensated by D and when killing intentionally and on and on and on this is all one branch of science known as that there are Sciences that assist in these two things known as renewal Allah you cannot understand the shield you cannot understand Sciences of the four you cannot understand Phil you cannot understand hadith unless you know Arabic language so learning Arabic is not part of learning Islam but it is necessary and it is not selective or optional it is part of the mandatory things in order for you to understand so in order for you to participate in the marathon do you know what the marathon is can you participate in the marathon if you cannot walk it's a prerequisite that you walk so in Islamic Sciences you have to learn these basics such as or solar-powered if I hear the sciences of Arabic must follow hadith itself it's not an original science but it is an auxilary and helping science and above all sciences there is the size of a pea EDA what is the meaning of art either this is the most important the seed is not important certainly is not the important if you don't have this happen either what is a breeder can even really hear the words man [Music] pronunciation no no no no I sent very good masha'Allah so we have a number of scholars here in there capito is your Creed your belief your conviction of Allah and what follows that so without knowing allah azzawajal if you are knowledgeable in fill in salat you know where to put your hand on the chest or on your belly or on whatever but you don't know Allah with that count so if I tell you give me thirty of ours beautiful names will you be able I know a boy man Orihime Jeff can I go to the toilet how much you give up Allah has so many beautiful names and attributes if you don't know them then you don't know anything you don't know allah azzawajal you have a problem so this is the greatest knowledge of all to note though heat to know how to make your worship to Allah sincerely because this is the essence the Prophet came to the people and esta la tercera order them to say what which is this is our data if you do whatever you do but you associate others with Allah Allah will not accept your Avada so this is the most important thing so this is branch number one or definition number one of knowledge Islamic knowledge then then that Islamic knowledge is also divided into two types permissible and prohibited so let us look at that nun Islamic knowledge that are permissible what Sciences are permissible or third your raising hands sorry camerman illness that receives money does this I think yellow all of you when you finish you study travel travel prize the Falcon is the fastest creature the Falcon is the fastest creature I think both is but no that is the runner is printed no no he's not no no no no no this is not a sight now we talk about science foreign hobbies etc now we want to talk about other sciences that we study yes physics what else chemistry all what you need yes biology mathematics are all with calculus 101 the most hated subject to me then physics a mystery I'm okay with chemistry because chemistry is logical but when you come to physics and mathematics I if they're riddles to me though I did it in university but I hate it some people love it so these are Sciences and mathematics medicine engineering whatever is worthy right this is we're talking about Helana is it Haddad you sure no doubt no doubt right is it mandatory to turn or not yes so is it mandatory is it white chip is it fun is it obligatory yes who says yes raise your hand one two three four five six seven eight nine ten Motorola who says it's not obligatory raise your hand there's one two four five six seven year old both wrong you're both wrong why it is not obligatory and it is not not obligatory it is communal obligation what does that mean it means faulty fire if one of you does it and the Puma does not need anymore all of you are exempted and you're not sinful but if none of you does it you all sinful give us another example so that we can understand if I were a smile dies after long life and good deeds we were all died wanting whoever won't delay raise your hands please I shall die every when you will die okay a bad man dies what do we do when someone dies we the gelasa before that we do ghusl we prepare him for burial and prayer by making whistle so making whistle is a communal obligation one of us has to do it not all of us we have to go and make us really imagine 3040 people not only in his hand no give me his hand they will snatch him into pieces no one is sufficient or two so if two people wash him and prepare him for prayer and burial Palace we are all safe but if none of us take the obligation admission is not my business not my business not my visit and we leave him then we are all sinful likewise the community requires doctors who was to be a doctor in the future one two three sisters of doctors ear football players Barcelona Real Madrid okay we have one mocking if no one becomes a doctor we are all sinful because we need doctors to treat us we need engineers to build our roads and airports we need scientists to come with discoveries and medicine and and and and solutions so this is a communion obligation is it understood by this was permissible or not permissible permissible now we go to the not permissible Sciences can you give me one impermissible science we have mobile phones none of them are gifts but we can give them away some I think yes sir I send excellent answer the science of black magic mashallah very good Mohammed black magic is a science but is it so watching Harry Potter's hello now you're refraining huh no answer it is without doubt it's nice it's fun it's equal one two three four five six I don't know when it will end the guy is going to become a grandfather soon and there is still much of a Harry Potter is working his way up it is haha why is it Anna because it deals with black magic and this is go for it takes a person out of the fold of Islam sure but it is fun is for children doesn't include giving life to the dead people who died and they come back to life no people say let me see which one share three or four but it does does it not include changing the format from a being into a donkey or to a mouse or to something else and changing it to a human being things of the unseen changing all of this is covered what is very nice the flood so this science is hammer black magic what else science of alcohol science of alcohol has not been discovered yet as a sinus but we will consider it yahwah probably if you mean the knowledge of production of haram of course because in order to mix alcohol you have to order intoxicants alcohol is halal correct share alcohol it is haram to consume but it is halal to use one before getting an injection for during surgeries or to dissolve veins or to have vanilla extracts all of these are hella what is Haram is what makes you intoxicated this becomes Haram so this is why people ask me on live TV share is perfume with alcohol halal or Haram I said if you drink it is hard but if you wear it it's Hannah so you have to always be careful of what you say how would the people perceive me and understand it so yes very good production of anything however this hacking is harmful or not harmful it define it depends entirely on the objective so if you're hacking for example enemies of Allah who say that Aisha is a cafe Abu Bakr is a cafe Roma is a cafe and they're slaughtering our prophet is a lot sermon and you had to their website which is Hannah but try not to be caught because if you will be caught this is harm much further for greater than the goods or no if you know you're good I give me your number I'll talk to generally speaking hacking is not good because people do it for fun people do it to embezzle money to disrupt security in this but if it is the cause of Allah according to the fatwa of scholars and you're preventing a greater evil this is good [Music] yes [Music] no there's no problem mouthwash that contains alcohol that you spit Ashura and that you spit out then definitely there's nothing wrong in that see the issue of alcohol among the spoke aha the jurors why did they differ they differed not because it is intoxicating if you bring a bottle of alcohol from the pharmacy and you drink it you will die before you get intoxicated it will burn your inside out this is an expert in this but percentages of alcohol in drinks that makes you intoxicated but not kill you this is considered to be under the category of wine so Chalam now mouthwash the scholars differed in the early stages is it nachas or they call it na Bach or not is it not yes or not those who say it's not justice and you cannot wear alcohol-related perfumes because then I cannot pray those who say no it is not physical images it is sentimentally or mentally neji's how do you come to this conclusion it's a long argument but Allah says in the Quran in navel mushrikuna measures those idol worshipers are indeed natchez does it mean that if I shake hands with a non-muslim that I have to wash my hands seven times and one with soil no it's not not just physically he's not just inside because of his he's good for his disbelief likewise when we talk about alcohol related drinks such as wine gin bourbon vodka tequila Black Label Scotch whatever these things I don't know them you might know them from Harry Potter better than me if you know such things these are not just not physically so even if I I was accidentally yeah need someone spilled it on my clothes I still can't play with it there's no problem in that coming back to the sciences that are haram black magic manufacturing how are things another job robbing things that this is not knowledge this is action music music knowledge is haram social shocking watch boys who knew music haram is beautiful ship I love Justin Bieber music is Haram sure but is it knowledge there are academies teaching music you have soft music you had have hard rock you have blues you have jazz you have a bluegrass you have symphonies you have brass you have strings you have flute so many things you can go through all of these are watching haha who made it Halima has devotion so do we have second choices Allah made the harem so you can say why and you say why do you know what will happen to you this is Islam you submissive why do I pray for Torah card I want to make it 3 I want to make it 1 you will go to heaven Allah told you pray 2 rakaats ok I'll pray 2 rakaats but why to sustain every record once they say no you have to break to such that in each record this is Islam Allah tells you to do something you say ok no questions asked imagine if your father tells you go and get me a glass of water and you sitting there playing with your Playstation why you'll get the answer in 1.2 seconds so okay now I understand thank you and you get the whole jug not a glass so what Allah tells us to do something we do it when Allah tells us to not do something really free so music and what follows are such as acting this is halal or Haram mixing music lying pretending things all of the science if there is a great science behind it your reflection of your for your face how to impress how to do it silently how to speak and even as baba with me give lectures we did not study it but we've learnt it through a Las favor upon us and experience so we know when we speak softly and we know when we raise our voices like this and people would not be always attentive I could come in with pajama and speak about Hellfire and everybody's asleep and Hellfire is very hot it's very scary it will come on the day of judgment with seventy thousand glitches and with each leech seventy thousand angels are calling it people will have their skins out and burned and everybody though it's a serious thing and I could speak about wasting water and water is one of the great things that Allah has blessed us with nevertheless people are squandering it wasting it don't they feel bad everyone now will go and make because I got your attention all of this falls under acting in the academies but it is haram part of the sciences that are also here on the science of astrology what is astrology Salaf stop raise your hand because I can barely hear reading fate no not astronomy study of be specific [Music] not quite it's not astronomy there is astronomy and there is knowledge in the future yes it is included with both okay so it is the effect of the cholesterol bodies on the fate of people so astrology is saying that zodiacs affect us which zodiac were you born in scorpion then this means that this week this and this and this will happen to you and if you are a bull or a shark or I don't know about the zodiacs but they have strange animals you know I'm a bull masha'Allah vertically you look like one they have these you know Jody action things and the belief its science its calculations and where the stars are but the belief in it takes you out of the fold of Islam if you read the zodiacs at the end of newspapers every week just for fun Allah will not accept your prayers for forty days you prefer lower our Malaysia for 40 days Allah will not accept but if you believe in it if you go to fortune tellers and they need the palm of your hand or when you drink coffee they read it or when they do any of these things and tell you this will happen to you in the future and you believe that soothsayers sorcerers you come out of Islam you're not a Muslim anymore you have to accept Islam again these Sciences are found or not do people learn them now a lot and all of this is Haram and it is not permissible okay very good so he's talking about accounting but accounting in general finance in general is halal there is a great portion of it which is Haram that you must not practice it but you have to learn it you cannot graduate as an accountant without studying it but you cannot work with it and you cannot teach it to someone who is working with it so this is part of the Haram sciences so now we know the distinction between Sciences and knowledge is in the Quran so what science does the Quran promote and asks each and every one of us to learn the knowledge of of Islam which includes or an Sunnah fair language of Arabic etc art either at the very top what does Islam permit us to learn all other halal sciences useful sciences which you will learn in universities such as mathematics face schema stre engineering medicine Applied Sciences etc these are halong if you have good intention what do you mean by good intention I want to become and I've met so many Muslims like this I want to become a medical doctor so that I can go to refugee camps and help my Muslim brothers to treat Muslims in Africa this intention by itself would grant you the reward from day one you enter the university till year ten when you graduate imagine every day you're going to university Allah makes it be water book as if you are studying the Quran or praying not as much but you reward it because of what your intention so now when tomorrow I want to go to my school and my father or my mother wakes me up how would I be I want to sleep more or no I'm going to learn so that I would benefit the Muslims I will benefit Islam Allah would reward you for every second you do everything you learn everything you practice because your intention is for praising allah azza wajal i have a lot of things that would encourage you to study islamic studies because this is what counts at the sight of allah but is it important or not important allah azza wajal says in the quran to highlight to you the importance of Islamic knowledge Allah says Allah witnesses that there is no deity except him and so does also to the angels and those people of knowledge amah made the people of knowledge alongside with the angels alongside with himself to testify that there is no god except him which highlights the importance of knowledge of Islam the Prophet said alayhi salatu salam whomever Allah intends good of him Allah will grant him fill in religion so if you see someone who is ignorant he does not know Islam he does not know knowledge he does not know Quran should fit they know that Allah does not intend good of him but if you see someone who is knowledgeable they know that Allah loves him however what is the essence of knowledge again remember in the beginning of my talk I said that a person who comes into the Masjid and has no knowledge yet wants to pray can he pray without knowledge you cannot break so without action your knowledge has no value true or false what is the conclusion of your knowledge if I have knowledge of Quran Sunnah hadith I've read Arabic cetera what is this equal to what is the conclusion again what is after your actions [Music] I believed in it and implemented it what will it lead me to agenda before going to Jenna it has to lead you to fearing Allah and this is why Allah Allah says in the Quran in my gosh Elohim in Ramadi Andrew lemma verily that no one among Allah servants fear him more than the scholars so the essence of knowledge it is that leads you to feeling a lot if I have someone like myself PhD holder in sharia knows Quran by heart not me of course if we have someone here and he is articulate he makes speeches he make mashallah lectures very good person in speaking in knowledge you tell him what is the ruling of this is halal Haram his fat ways are good and sound but he doesn't pray fire in the Masjid he doesn't fast Ramadan well he spends his time behind TV watching movies and soap operas and listening to Justin Bieber would I call him knowledgable why because he's not implementing who is the most knowledgeable of all sinners the one who does give me name who is the most knowledgeable among all so the sinners Shaitaan why Shaitaan was with the Angels Allah ordered him to prostrate to Adam did he prostrate he was so close he had knowledge but because he sinned all of his knowledge was useless on the contrary if we go outside and we see someone working in building houses cement sand blocks he's putting it working ten hours if I come next his sweat smells his clothes are dirty and dusty his hair doesn't have hair gel he's you know not tidy and I asked him Salaam alaikum alaikum Salaam how what what degrees do you have i cannot read or write or i can barely read and write but i don't have i have never been to school how much do you have in your bank account nothing you have a card no do you have a bicycle no I just walk do you have a house no I just sleep on a mattress but he prays five times in the first row of the machine and he always saying some hannumas stuff Allah Allah Allah Allah he never listened to the music he never watches Haram he never eats hallam if someone tells him there is some money you can steal his stuff oh Allah I would never do this he doesn't do anything haha but he doesn't have like our friend PhD or memorizes of Quran or speaks beautiful lectures which one is favored to Allah resolution the second one ah why because he fears Allah this is the proper and actual knowledge that you cannot possess until you implement it's not only eating books learning from going to Imam University this is good the essence of knowledge is what which makes you fear Allah if you have great and vast amount of knowledge but you disobey your father and mother are you knowledgeable if your mother said tells you go and get me something from the grocery shop and said why me when I damn it you always pick on me you don't love me you don't like me is he knowledgeable he's in hell he will go there directly to help business class because he did not implement the knowledge of the Quran and the Sunnah so this is important for us to know that the knowledge essentially is feeling among obeying Allah and this usually comes from Islamic proper knowledge that we have and that we do so I hope that this is Allah is sufficient for today though it's a much longer sharma like mala hell Thank You chef awesome this beautiful exciting lecture if you have will have like a few minutes for questions if you have any specific question that you would like to ask you share this is a time here we have and Allah we have units palette girls any girl want to ask question okay we have three boys so my first question is about the Bank accountants thing you have like you have a job there but you know it's Haram be it's Haram money and you want to quit the job but you don't you can't find another job so what do you do so the question is there's one drink it is the worst drink it's news magnet is made up of mashed up snakes so is it halal or Haram guide me so is that a drink of which is made up of a mash snakes is is it a halal and Haram made from much snakes my question is in ancient times people used to magnify the Egyptian people so his magnifying so the first question is about the so the question is if a person has a job in a Haram place and he knows it's Haram and he wants to quit but he does not have an alternative what should he do okay if you have a picture okay and you have a frame that is smaller than the picture but you have to put the picture in the frame what do you do you cut the picture until it fits the frame correct any doubts if someone says no I don't want to do this I want to break the frame and put ducttape and maybe bring some branches of a tree and connect it with superglue and then put it on my picture how would that look very ugly likewise Islam versus our lives Islam is the frame that Allah ordered us not to go outside of it correct and our lives is the picture so when we come to practice Islam and we put the frame on the picture there are so many known edges so I have to cut from my life what does not fit Islam now in your question this gentleman who works for a bank and the bank is interest based they take River they give River and they deal with interest who provides the food on the table I don't even Allah who gives you the power to drive to the bank and work for eight hours Allah who gives food and provision to the billions of animals on earth to the trillions of fish in the oceans to the hundreds of trillions of insects birds living creatures living cells that we see or do not see who gives them food do they have education do they have high degrees they with good jobs it is Allah who provides for them our problem is that we have a choice these creatures don't have a choice they have to do now we have a choice and this is why we have gender and we have help and it's our choice that we enter this one or this one if I am working in a Haram job and I know that it is how am I have to decide today whether I have an alternative or not because if I say that no I will stay until I have an alternative this means that I do not trust that Allah is giving the risk I believe that I am the bread earner and no one else can help me so I keep on looking one year two year three years who cares I get a promotion into being a supervisor or manager general man director vice-president but I'm still looking masha'Allah what kind of looking at are you doing so the answer to your question is trust a lot if you do not trust Allah you're not his servant you're not his slave you are thinking that no I know that you provide for everyone else but I'll drag her weight my job is lucrative I'm getting so much much money can you get a job half of the salary should use definitely with Michael if qualifications I can but what would I do will have my salary I cannot live in the same house I cannot spend lavishly no no no either I get another alternative with which pays more like my job or not nothing pays as much as banks because there how long they have to be lucrative except oil industries so oil companies pay more but banks are equivalent to or a little bit less so the answer your question my friend you have to quit on the job second question happen about making dings of snakes anything that Islam orders us to kill it is prohibited to consume give me examples one snakes I took that two crocodiles there is nothing of prohibiting it or ordering it it's an issue of distribution Lions Lions we are prohibited from killing I said anything let me rephrase my question anything that we are ordered to kill or prohibit it from killing it is not permissible to consume what are the things that we are or to kill we have snakes lizards we have to kill desert yes the Prophet said Allison whoever kills a lizard from the first blow will get hundred husana hundred good deeds second blow less third blow less usually we kill it in six or seven blows why because we're so afraid of it have you seen a lesson with death it will not bite you with moves quickly with your hand yeah that's gross this is the fastest way in easiest way what will happen to your hand it will dissolve and go into start to vanish go on wash your hands with soap hand Allah no harm done okay what else that listen a dog yes [Music] scorpions I sent very good and so on okay what are things that we are not permissible or not permitted to kill no to kill pigs no we have to calculate super-fixed fix our are to be killed the most authentic opinion we cannot kill a frog which makes it prohibit to eat killing frogs is how I mean is now we cannot kill bees we cannot kill and and so on spiders we don't have any restriction in killing or not killing so it depends if it's harmful yes if it spider-man last few it's pie-der-man maybe we'll get him who cares so these things which is you're asking about scorpions there are prohibited to eat you must kill it unfortunately I've seen some Muslims using them as pets you've seen this I've seen Muslims having scorpions in their homes is your is very nice and they're not putting it in the home and sleeping with them but they're putting in an occasion they consider it to be something that is nice and in the 60s in the 70s they used to have a slogan be kind to animals should we be kind to animals go and kiss a shark not all elements you have to be kind to harmful things you have to kill but you don't go to the extreme of being kind and putting a pet or a line in your home then you will be its dinner no this is not permissible the third question was about mummifying so what is the rule on making a corpse a mummy it's in our religions totally breaking the bone of a dead person is how ominous now let alone making an autopsy or opening the person up and taking his guts out and putting stuffing him with with teddy bears and say things know that he would stay alive all of this is Haram in Islam so the mug that those pharaohs they were not Muslims in their religion maybe it's okay for us as Muslims to watch their mummies and go and pay money and say my hood and a moon Oh masha'Allah this Indiana Jones and stuff oh this is nonsense Islam orders us to respect the deceased corpse of a Muslim in this is why it's an issue of dispute whether organ donor is halal or Haram organ you know organ donations not the organ no organ donations is saying that after I die I give my heart to the needy I give my eyes I get spare parts essentially this is an issue of dispute I personally believe it's Haram because a dead person has to be respected in Islam and he has to be buried and honored and after his death or before his death can I go and sell my eye now why not it is it it mine no this organ this body is not mine it is Allah Allah entrusted me with it so it's not for me yeah yeah I don't need this take it for ourselves for you I have two kidneys yes take one I need to buy a new car no this is not yours to donate and after that is even worse than Allah knows"
