  "transcript": "the most yeah uh uh people who exaggerate are the sisters why this is mentioned in an authentic Hadith the prophet saidat oh women folk give charity for I've seen you the ma vast majority people of Hellfire he said o prophet of Allah why he said because you show your ingratitude in Arabic kufur so they said do we make kufur with Allah he say no you show your ingratitude to your husband if your husband is good to you all year round but he makes a mistake once you say I've never seen anything good from you Subhan Allah and this is something that most women not all most women do when they're angry so they neglect all the goodness in men in her husband is it possible that she never had a good time with her husband not a single day nothing no but when she's angry this is what comes out of her now the sisters they say okay but she men do this do men do this the men are saying no the men are known to be Liars the men do this religion ly we do this all the time the only difference is that Allah placed a lot of burden on women more than men so if they do this they go to hell if we do this we will be punished but not as much why because we have more responsibilities than the women we have to work we have to provide we have to uh meet the people outside we have to suffer greatly while the sister is sitting between four walls yes it's boring but she's safe she doesn't have to go to bed worrying like me ah how am I going to pay the rent how am I going to pay the electricity bill they gave me a notice if you don't pay in 5 days we going to cut the power this and that okay what about the children's school fees what about this my father is asking me for money my mother says that I did not send her her monthly uh uh allowance while the sister they have problems mainly when I going to do the uh the laundry when am I uh going to cook the Biryani it's going to be chicken or meat they have problems but the problems of the men are far greater this is why the prophet saidat in aith to prove that yes men do the same he says no believing man should hate a believing woman if he hates one of her characteristics he will be pleased with another so even men when you find that your wife is nagging I hate this in my wife yeah but she's beautiful she is a good cook my mom loves her because she's nagging she speaks a lot my mom loves people who speak I don't speak at all so my mom sits six hours with her chitchatting I don't know what they talk about but she loves her and thinks of her the world so if you hate her nagging there are so many things you love be fair and realistic"
