  "title": "Can I pray while driving? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "I live in the city where there is a lot of traffic sometimes my husband is caught in a traffic jam there is no message adhere and he cannot pull over the car while the time of Prayer is almost over can he pray while driving sometimes cars move slowly with although respect on Fatima this is not logical even if you are in the busiest of roads once the iodine is cold let's assume it's Lahore it's about two and a half to three hours for us or if it's answer it's about two and a half hours to three hours to Maghrib if it is moderate it's about a whole hour till Asia if it's Asia it's about four hours till midnight so there's always enough time and no matter how horrible the traffic is there has to be a shoulder of the road there has to be a gas station there has to be some where a person can pull over and fix his car or his flat tire or whatever there is not a possibility that he cannot park anywhere cars break down they need a place to stop at so it is not permissible at all for him to pray sitting down in the car and Allah so JAL knows best"
