  "transcript": "there are many mosques in my area and time for iftar entered according to a timetable but in the closest mosque to my home didn't give Adam so but other mosque gave Azan and we heard it so we broke our fast was it okay if the Adan is given and this is the closed Masjid or the furthest Masjid it doesn't matter because giving the Adan within the vicinity he is entrusted with his adhan so he is responsible to the fact that the sun has set and it's time for iftar you can break your iftar you don't have to wait for the close by Masjid maybe it's out of electricity maybe the mo and then is having his own iftar first maybe he forgot how long are you going to stay and wait for it so no if you hear the Adan from far away and you know it's a a down from a message you can break your uh fasting"
