  "transcript": "adil from hong kong yeah so first i just want to thank you uh you've been in you know it's been insanely helpful listening to you for what you're doing and i reward you yeah i mean give you a long life and you as well uh so i live in a non-muslim country in hong kong and i'm currently a student study so about three months ago i came across one of your videos where you said the food delivery jobs are haram if the food you're delivering is impermissible am i correct in this of course if it's impermissible it is totally haram for you to be associated with that right so after watching that video i you know i quit i stopped working there and i promised allah i said it verbally i promised that i wasn't going to work here again and now i was going to look for something else that was better and had a halal source of income but it's been it's been three months since then um i've got one or two jobs but they're you know i think in my opinion they're even worse than that so that one job has free mixing they have music and so i don't go there as well right now we you know i do i i have to help my family with with money and stuff so my question was basically if i go back to this job because i can't find a better job that has a halal source of income if i go back to that job and like i said i made a promise to allah verbally will i be sinful given the situation i'm in right now even if you did not make a promise you will be sinful imagine that you are delivering haram food to disbelievers you're delivering beer you're delivering whiskey you're delivering pork all of this goes totally against your belief as a muslim and you cannot carry these things let alone feed them to others so this by itself is sinful all what you're concerned with is my verbal commitment to allah allah i will not work in such a job this is an oath if you break your oath you have to feed or clothe 10 poor muslims and if you're financially unable to do that you have to fast three three days and the the sin of the oath is gone but what's even worse than breaking an oath is delivering such food working in a environment that has free mixing and music is far less haram than delivering haram food the music you're not listening to it you're not paying attention to it so you're not sinful for that and you're not the one who is turning it on the free mixing you can avoid by keeping it professional lowering your gaze not socializing not flirting not chit chatting just keep it professional and in in the boundaries of business then you will be fine in insha'allah and allah knows best you"
