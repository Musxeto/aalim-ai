  "title": "The Role Model (Prophet ﷺ‎) (5) - Things that made him smile - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "one of our prophets names [Music] which relates to someone who frequently smiles and the prophet salallahu was given such names due to the fact that despite the overwhelming presence of Nomads of Hypocrites of ignorant people around him always asking him always bombarding him with their questions the prophet never felt bored or stressed or showed any type of resentment to them rather he was nice when he spoke to them and he was always having a smiling face which is something we need definitely I need a lot of that we have to learn from him how he presented Islam and he was not Faking It this was his nature wasallam and he himself advised us that do not look down at any type of goodness you can do or belittle it even if you merely meet your brother with a smiling face and he said that smiling in the face of your brother is a charity and his description in the old scriptures that he was prolonging his silence he doesn't talk a lot and that he would laugh little so laughter a lot is something that is abhorred in Islam and some of it is recommended in Islam so smiling which is just the opening of the mouth without any sound and this is the minimum amount of laughter this is the best and it is desired and recommended in Islam as Allah mentioned about Prophet Sulaiman in the Quran when he heard the aunt advising the other ants so the ant is advising other ants that go to your holes so that Suleiman and his troops would not step on you without them noticing you Allah says [Music] he smiled in a gesture of Joy or laughter from what she had said and the prophets laughter was like that he would not open his mouth and fall on his back and make this big sound of laughter like people of ignorance do that wasn't his style his laughter was just a smile maybe his mortal teeth I think they call it mortal teeth with a appear when he does this with him says after Fajr prayer the prophet used to remain where he had prayed Fajr until the sun rises and sometimes the companions would talk among themselves about things they did in previous times pre-islamic era and they would laugh about some of the funny things they used to do and the prophet would not deny them said no don't do that don't talk about these things rather he would just simply smile he would also smile and maybe laugh when people misbehave with him in an incident anac tells us that while he was walking with the prophet and the prophet was wearing a cloak made of harsh wool and he had nothing underneath it when all of a sudden The Nomad came from behind the prophet Allah startling him grabbing him from his cloak and pulling him in a harsh way to the extent that it affected his neck and shoulder you can see traces of it on his skin not only that he also addressed the prophet Islam in a disrespectful way by saying give me from the money you have it is Allah's money not yours what is this such an attitude if any of us would have been addressed by it probably would made a fight out of it not the prophet that Islam the prophet looked at him and he laughed smiled at him and ordered his companions to give him something this is the character of the Prophet Allah when they portray him as a tyrant as a warmonger as bloodthirsty what is this complete ignorance you have not read the prophet's biography Allah not even one single page and this is cascaded throughout his life he would smile he would laugh but he would not as I said earlier break in laughter and fall on his back or act hysterically pleased with him said once the prophet salallahu was addressing women of quraish they were talking to him they were bombarding him with questions and complaints of their husbands of their lifestyle and they were raising their voices in his presence and the prophet as we all know him was the kind tolerant patient individual who would not hush them down or complain or say anything that would be rude though they should have respected the prophet but they felt of him as a father figure so they spoke in such a fashion until Umar knocked the door and asked for permission to enter when he did that they immediately hushed down tucked themselves up covered themselves properly and took aside so when Omar was allowed to enter he came in and found the prophet Allah laughing so the prophet that Omar said o prophet of Allah may Allah all you make you uh always in in this cheerful mood what is it that's making you laugh so the prophet said in reply to his question I am amazed of these women who were at my presence with their voices loud and talking until they heard your voice asking for permission how they all of a sudden turned 180 degrees hushed down and went to where their hijab and when Homer scalded them how dare you speak like this in the presence of the Prophet saws and do what you have done when I came in they said to him the prophet is not as rude as you are the prophet is not as harsh as you are and this shows you when the prophet Smiles I saw Sam when he laughs that our religion is not a religion of depression or of Sadness and Sorrow it's a religion of being optimistic being positive feeling the mercy of Allah azzawajal and this is why despite all of the prophets worries and his tasks at hand despite all of the things he was thinking about how to run his um and spread his darwah sallallahu despite all of that he would still have the time to joke with his wives and Companions and spread an atmosphere of mercy and optimism says the companions once said to the prophet oh prophet of Allah you joke with us as if they were Amazed by that how is this possible when you are the messenger of Allah and someone as serious as you are yet you joke with us and the prophet acknowledged this and said yes but I only say the truth meaning he would never joke while saying a lie all what comes from his mouth is truthful in an incident there was a companion by the name of Zahir and this companion was a nomad a Bedouin meaning that he did not live in the city or the town or the village he was taking his sheep roaming around the earth looking for places to graze so he was always living in his tent and he used to come to Medina every now and then to sell some of his goods and earn money and go about his own life but whenever he comes to Medina he used to bring gifts to the prophet Allah the prophet loved him a simple man he used to say Zahir is our Nomad living in the wilderness or in the desert and we are his Town folk that he comes and visits one day the prophet went to the market and saw him auctioning some of his stuff this is how the markets were who would buy this pen from me one two five okay five nobody else I'll sell it to him this is how they used to sell and buy things auctions so while he was selling his merchandise minding his own business the prophet sneaked from behind him and embraced him so the guy wasn't able to see who was that behind him and he says let me go who's this let me go then when he looked and he discovered that it was the prophet Allah he kept on going back so that his back would become in contact with the prophet Allah more rather than trying to release himself from the prophet so the prophet started announcing who would buy this slave from me the prophet is joking with him but he is a slave a slave of Allah so the prophet is auctioning him and he was joking in a very beautiful manner with this companion who was not of great importance he was just a nomad and Zahir said o prophet of Allah in this case nobody would buy me if you're auctioning me nobody's interested in buying someone like me and the prophet said but by Allah you are of Great Value at the sight of Allah encouragement positivity optimism what kind of a boost this would give to this nomad no one knows him what kind of a motivation it would give him when the head of the state says such powerful words says a man comes to the prophet and is eager to go for Jihad he wants to fight in the cause of Allah but he's broke he's Stone broke so he said oh prophet of Allah give me a camel so that I could travel and fight in the cause of Allah so the prophet says to him we will give you a child of a camel and the guy says what would I do with a child of a camel a son of a camel this is too small to carry me to battle and the prophet said and do she camels give birth except to Big camels meaning that he didn't lie but he just pulled his legs in the sense that I'll give you a son of a camel which is a grown-up full-fledged camel but the man thought it was going to be a newborn camel that would not help or suffice so I may Allah be pleased with him came to the prophet once and the prophet was eating some some dates and a bread and the prophet invited him as usual and said join me social hype started eating from the dates and we know that dates are more valuable than bread so the prophet salallahu and by the way sohaib had some illness in his eye so one of his eyes was infected and the prophet Allah joked with him and he said to him you eat dates with this infection in your eye so so hype replied this joke with another joke by saying oh prophet of Allah I'm eating on the other side with the good eye is looking so the prophet Allah laughed and smiled in his face the prophet used to smile he used to laugh but he used to warn us that too much laughter kills the heart and this is what we see among a lot of the Muslims who spent their lives watching comedy watching stand-ups listening to jokes reading jokes watching comics and reading comics just to enjoy their time not knowing that this has a very profound and negative impact on their heart the prophet said do not laugh a lot because a lot of laughter kills the heart and the prophet salallahu as I said used to joke with his wives once he met mother Aisha and when she saw him she complained of a severe migraine or a headache so the prophet saws was joking with her and said to her oh Aisha what would it be if you were to die before me and I would wash you and shroud you and offer prayer a funeral upon you and then bury you what would be so mother Aisha immediately her jealousy meter went to the roof and said oh yeah of course if you if this happens and I die before you I I immediately the following moment after marrying me I think you're going to get married to another woman and bring her to my house so she didn't think about dying she didn't think about being buried rather she thought of who the prophet saws was going to get married to and bring in her house and the prophet smiled in her face to assalam once laughed and when they asked him why are you laughing o prophet of Allah he said I am amazed by people being dragged into Paradise while being in Chains how is this possible how can people be dragged into Paradise in Chains we know that people enter Paradise willingly well Scholars explained that this is in reference to prisoners of wars concubines slaves who fall in captivity after the Jihad after the war between the Muslims and the non-muslims and they fall into captivity they are imprisoned they become slaves and sold as slaves they are in Chains but then they see Islam they Embrace Islam and they become good Muslims and they die to enter Paradise as Muslims whereas if they were left to their own old religions they would have died and went to hell these chains which was sad to them to be in captivity after being free These Chains LED them to Paradise so what an irony the prophet saws laughed about this and finally there are so many uh so much material with me about the prophet's laughter but the time it would not suffice finally the prophet salallahu used to laugh and smile when he sees his companions pursuing some of the adornment of this world once may Allah be pleased with him came from Bahrain with some money and some booty of wars and some uh Treasures so the ansar heard of that so they came and rushed to the Masjid and after Fajr prayer each one of them started standing up a little bit trying to draw the prophet's attention so that when the prophet salallahu starts to distribute some of this wealth he would remember them so the prophet salallahu smiled and laughed when he saw them do what they were doing after Fajr prayer and he said have the Glad Tidings and be Wishful and hopeful because by Allah it's not poverty that I fear for you rather I fear that Allah would open the doors of this Dunya for you and it would be widely spread within your reach as it was opened to those Nations before you and that would lead you to compete with one another like they competed with one another and that would eventually lead you to your destruction as it led them to their destruction the prophet salallahu used to smile a lot and he used to smile in the faces of his companions like tamim please with him he said since I embraced Islam whatever I encountered the prophet he would not see me except that he would smile in my face this is something we should inject in our daily lives instead of having a a grumpy face and a frown whatever someone talks to us no be friendly have a smiling face not cracking jokes everywhere not laughing loudly LOL rather be like the prophet Allah and through that we hope and wish that we will be with him in Paradise on the day of judgment"
