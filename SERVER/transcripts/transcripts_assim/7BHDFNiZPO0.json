  "transcript": "how do we answer the criticism of the Prophet marrying may Allah be pleased with her it's a long story but I'll I'll just put it in a nutshell how many times have you read that the disbelievers accuse the prophet of lying of being a sorcerer of being insane of being a poet lot this is mentioned in the Quran how many times have you heard anywhere that the prophet was a child molester never how many times have you heard any of the disbelievers in Mecca or elsewhere accusing the prophet Alat wasam or condemning condemning the prophet Alam marrying a child never what does this mean it means that marrying at this age was the norm at the time of the prophet and he did not do anything that was wrong at the time I remember going to the US in the early well in in the mid '70s and I remember seeing girls who were 12 12 years old dating men they were not prostitutes they're just in the neighborhood they used they looked old but they were 12 years old and they used to consume heroin and and and and smoke marijuana Etc when you remember when I remember such things and say Subhan Allah nobody talks about this this is normal this is what everybody does now it is quite different at the time of the Prophet first of all when Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him the when the prophet Alam proposed to AA the abak said she is your niece in the sense that she's my daughter and I'm your brother and the prophet said I know but Allah instructed me to do this and we also know through the books of history that she was proposed to before the prophet Alam so one of the dignitaries of Arabia proposed to AA when she was 6 years old and ab refused so it now if you try to measure what happened then to today's measurements it it would not be fair and lastly now whenever someone has a proposal to his daughter or to his sister he first of all looks at the benefits so even if you have a 20 years old daughter if someone proposes to her if someone who is 30 years old proposes to her you look at the advantages and the disadvantages so 30 years old 10 years older than her what about his salary what about his education what about his religion what about his looks is he taller shorter than her you you know H uh look to at the advantages and disadvantages and try to outweigh the disadvantages to see if the marriage is a fit or it does not fit now when someone like the prophet proposes to you what disadvantages are you looking at if the prophet proposes to your daughter who is inshallah one years old would you refuse or hesitate he is the perfect man now having said this one say 1 year old 6 years old well the prophet did not marry her until she was 9 years old and 9 years old she was a woman she reached the age of puberty may Allah be pleased with her and I remember one of the old Scholars of Islam she Al he's Syrian and he used to have a beautiful program in Ramadan he he lived in Saudi Arabia the last 40 or 50 years of his uh life um and he used to say he was a judge in Damascus Syria he says that I once I I looked into a case where this woman came with her family and she was seeking divorce from her husband and I looked at the woman and she was a grown-up woman and when I looked at the birth certificate she was 11 years or something like this and I was shocked this doesn't look like 11 years old and when I verified this it was truly 11 years old but she was a full grown up woman he said Subhan Allah then I it clicked and I remembered pleased with her it is the fact there are girls who Blossom and mature way ahead of time you can find one of your daughters to be 9 years old but she has the body of a 13 or 14 years old and you immediately when she's nine you cover her and I have one of my daughters who is like 14 or 15 years old and she still looks like as if she's 9 years old she's petite she's small and she doesn't she she's so innocent but it doesn't show her her age age does not show on her therefore don't listen to what the Hypocrites or the disbelievers say or accuse our Prophet The Prophet sallallah Al wasam was the best man ever to walk to Earth he was the best husband ever to marry and may Allah be pleased with her loved him so much and when he was alive and loved him more when he he died sallallahu alaihi wasallam and that is why their marriage was successful and it was a love story a continuous love story with the prophet sallam and Allah know"
