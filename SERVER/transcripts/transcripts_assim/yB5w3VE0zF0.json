  "transcript": "Nature. And if you go and look at Mount An-Nur and at this Ghar-Hira, the Cave of Hira, you will find that it's about a couple of miles outside of Mecca, surrounded by huge mountains and a clear sky. And this by itself gives you great opportunities to ponder and think. And this, by the way, was done before the Prophet received the revelation, Alayhis salatu Wassalam."
