  "transcript": "foreign and this chapter deals with prayer of rain so you're praying not for rain you're praying to Allah azzawajal asking him to send us rain and Hadith number 150 which was narrated by Abdullah may Allah be pleased with him who will read it for us the first brother on the second row went out to invoke Allah for rain he faced the Qibla invoking Allah he turned his cloak inside and out and then offered a touraga player with audible recitation bukhari and in other narration he came to the musallah okay in this Hadith Abdullah may Allah be pleased with him he's telling us how the prophet Allah prayed these prayers he told us that he prayed to rakaz he prayed them loudly so it's not a silent prayer and he also told us that it was offered in Al musallah and not in the Masjid and in it he faced the Qibla that is for supplication not in the prayer and during which he turned over his cloak and how is this done Scholars say that usually you have another cloak you put on disclose of mine and it would be to turn it the left to the right and the right to the left and you put it on so actually what was inside now is outside and what was outside now is inside why is this the scholars Justified this by their own we don't have anything concrete they said that this is part of a good omen that Allah azzawajal would change things to the best so as I am having this good omen I turn my cloak backwards so that Allah would change what's we're facing of this drought into rain but again this is what they Justified and we don't have anything concrete to make sure that this is the right justification or not but we follow the Sunnah and everybody who praise God does this if you don't have a cloak you can also change take this and turn it upside down because it would be part of following the Sunnah of course among the things that we learn from it is that facing the Qibla in Dua is recommended is it mandatory no yet they do not affect in the validity of your Dua we have Hadith 151 narrated anas bin Malik razilan who on a Friday a person entered the main mosque through the gate facing the pulpit while Allah's Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was delivering the khudba the man stood in front of Allah's prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and said oh Allah's Prophet the livestock are dying and the roads are cut off so please pray to Allah for rain raised both his hands and said o Allah bless us with rain o Allah bless us with rain o Allah bless us with rain an assaded by Allah we could not see any trace of cloud in the sky and there was no building or a house between us and the mountains of Salah anas added a heavy cloud like a shield appeared from behind it when it came in the middle of the sky it spread and then rained and as father said by Allah we could not see the Sun for a week next Friday a person entered through the same gate and at the time Allah's Prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam was delivering the Friday's khudba the man stood in front of him and said oh Allah's Prophet the livestock are dying and the roads are cut off please pray to Allah to withhold rain anas added Allah's prophet raised both his hands and said o Allah round about us and not on us o Allah on the small mountains on the hills in the valleys and on the places where trees grow so the rain stopped and we came out walking in the sun in this Hadith it's one of the prophet's miracles he was delivering the jummah when a man stood up and complained saying the prophet of Allah the livestock is dying and the roads are cut off due to what due to famine due to Drought due to the lack of water so the livestocks are dying because there is no water to drink and the roads are cut off we cannot travel without water and we will die out of thirst if we travel so the prophet raised his hands and this is one if not the only location during the Friday speech where you are allowed to raise your hands in supplication because we know that it is not permissible it is not part of the Sunnah to raise your hands in Friday's application generally except when you are praying for for rain this is permissible for the Imam to raise his hands and likewise for the followers the moon to raise their hands as well to say I mean and the prophet said three times and whenever he spoke he used to speak in three times so that people would learn from him whenever he was supplicate he would supplicate three times so Annas is saying that we looked above and there was not a single cloud and there was a small mountain called Salah and there was nothing between us and that mountain no buildings nothing the whole sky is clear the minute the prophet said this a small Cloud came like a shield like a round shield and once it took its place in the middle of the sky it spread to be number of big dark clouds and it started to rain so this is one of the Miracles of the Prophet Allah however a week later exactly on Friday while the prophet was delivering the sermon a man stood and complained in the same manner he said o prophet of Allah the livestock are dying last week they were dying because of drought this week because of the floods and the roads are cut off last week because of the drought today because of the floods and the amount of water so pray to Allah to withhold the rain from us knew that rain helps and it's a blessing of Allah as mentioned in the Quran it is a sign of Allah's Mercy it's described in the Quran as a sign of Allah's Mercy this rain so the prophet did not say oh Allah stop the rain he said o Allah round us and about us meaning not on us make it come round us so we would be saved from the effect of rain but crowned us where we have to grow the grass and the trees and the people would benefit make it around us and he said on top of small mountains on top of hills in valleys in places where rain would benefit the trees and the grass would grow so immediately Allah azzawajal answered His prophets prayer and Anna says we went out walking on or under the sun without any cloud though we were reigned for a whole week now from this Hadith we also learn something that is not related to rain something that is related to joining Salah we know that joining Salat is permissible when it rains only to join or Maghrib to Asia in this Hadith we learned that it is not permissible to join Asar to Friday it is not permissible to combine Asar with Friday why because only zohor can be combined to or by Asar and Friday is not and that is why when it rained the prophet did not Allah after jummah prayed also with them and combined it to jumwa though he did this in other prayers with him reported and other companions so this is something we learn from this Hadith we also learn from this Hadith the issue on tawasul and this is something that a lot of the Muslims make great mistakes when they don't make tawasule at all or they go to the extreme and ask everyone alive or dead for tawasu and what is the permissible tell us all that we are allowed to do Scholars say that the greatest and the most beneficial way of offering and what is urging Allah the greatest way of offering is to ask Allah by his beautiful names this is the best way of making tawasul and urging Allah azzawajal we have a short break stay tuned inshallahu and welcome back so the best way of making tawasul is through calling Allah by his beautiful names and attributes so you say I'm urging Allah so I keep on asking Allah azzawajal with his beautiful names and attributes the second way of offering tawasul is when I ask someone who is righteous and alive to supplicate for me he has to be righteous and he has to be alive so I go to this great scholar of Islam I go to this great Pious or righteous person and I say I have a problem pray for me ask Allah for me to do this or that so this is permissible why because he is righteous and he's alive and throughout the life of the Prophet Allah the companions all the times used to go to him and ask him to pray for them or supplicate for them for them and this is permissible what is not permissible is to go to someone who is deviant who is an innovator who is not a righteous and Pious person and you ask him to make Dua therefore you are allowed to ask for Wasilla through a righteous person a Pious person a knowledgeable person by him asking Allah for you it is permissible for me to ask Allah through his supplication so I tell him supplicate to Allah for me and this is permissible the third permissible way of seeking Allah or asking Allah azzawajal is through your good deeds how is that you ask Allah oh Allah I ask you to grant me a child because I pray to you Fajr every single day in the Masjid so you're asking Allah azzawajal by this Good Deed that you have done and this is mentioned in Surat and Imran Ramana Indiana United so they proceeded by saying oh Allah we have heard someone who is calling to Islam and Iman and we have believed in him therefore forgive our sins so this is putting forward your good deeds likewise those three who were trapped in the cave with a big Stone each one of them what did they do they started listing their Good Deeds oh Allah I had the cousin that I loved but I did not commit Haram for your sake if this was sincere open the gate or open the rock and a little bit was open second one said I had parents and I did not feed my kids the milk that I usually milk for them and they were asleep so I stayed next to them until they woke up and I gave them if I did this for your sake free us and a little bit of The Rock was open the third one said oh Allah I had someone who worked with me and left without taking his pay and he came few years later and he was asking for his pay so I told him look at these camels and cows and sheep that are filling the valley this is your pay take it his pay was like maybe five rupees or 10 rupees or whatever yet he invested it until it became this much and he did not neglect that man's rights so the man took it and left away the man says if I did this for your sake o Allah opened the cave and the cave was open so these are the three permissible ways for you to ask for Allah for Allah's answering of your supplication going back to the issue of seeking rain and water from Allah through prayer this can be done through three means the first one is the most famous One you all go to the musallah and you offer the prayer of foreign and the format or the description of the prayer for Reign is like the way you pray eat so it has seven takbeer in the first raka and five takbeer in the second raka is the before or after there are hadiths that say that it's before there had you say that's after so inshallah both are acceptable secondly regarding the prayer itself this is one way of doing it to go to the Muslim the second way of requesting rain is through the sermon of Friday as the man came and asked and the prophet supplicated the Third Way of requesting for rain is individually when we're praying on our own if I prostrate on my own I say Allah bless us with rain bless us with water this is permissible so there are three ways of seeking the blessings of Allah through rain is this understood inshallah do you have any questions yes brother last time we met you mentioned about the salad so is it permissible to offer Salah in a big ground or something and you said that Allah is also amazed so can you please give one example from the Quran in the Sunnah that explained that Allah or is amazed as for the first question when you say that can we pray it in an open ground No it should be prayed in the Masjid but if the Masjid is not sufficient then it's okay to pray in an open ground but the son of the Prophet Allah must be prayed in the Masjid so we don't go and collect people and go somewhere else because this would be innovating as for the word amazed wasallam had a guest coming to him and he asked all of his wives do you have anything to feed my guests they said no so he addressed the Companions and said who among you can host my guest he said I will do that he took the guest to his house who was Abu talha's wife I think she's roomiza known as her name is um the mother of anas IBN Malik so he went there and said to his wife I have hosted the guest of the Prophet Allah do we have food she said by Allah we don't have any food except this Meal which I Was preparing for my children so he told her occupy your children with anything until they sleep and the children were crying she gave them water we're crying we're crying until they feel tired and slept then he asked her to bring the food once the guest was there he asked her to turn off the light it would be dark and they pretend as if they're eating so the guest was there they pretended as if they were eating but the only one who was eating was the guests so that the food would be sufficient for them the following morning the prophet Allah after Fajr said to Abu Talha in Allah was amazed by what you had done yesterday with the guest so this is one of the Hadith there are other Hadith you all know about Allah's being happy for the repentance more than the happiness of someone who lost his camel with his food on top of it and then when he found it he said oh Allah I am your God and you're my servant he made a mistake by because he was so happy so the prophet is telling us Allah is more happy than this man so all of these are attributes of Allah yes as you said that for rain you can ask a righteous person and who is alive so a person may argue that if you want rain so you have to ask the righteous person to ask Allah so I want Jannah so how can I directly ask Allah even I need a righteous person to ask you ask Allah azzawajal for Jannah straight forward and you may ask a righteous person to ask Allah for Jannah for you or to seek forgiveness for you and that is why we always ask righteous people to supplicate for us don't forget us from your Dua what do I mean by this what do I am I looking for may Allah forgive you may Allah Grant you Jannah so this is permissible to ask people for Dua but it is a lower grade the better grade would be that you ask Allah azzawajal straight without any people and likewise at the time of Umar may Allah be pleased with him there was a great drought no one went to the grave of the Prophet sallam saying O prophet of Allah do this or do that or ask Allah for us what did they do they went for the musallah asking Allah for rain Roma address the people and he said oh Allah we used to at the time of the Prophet salaam go to your Prophet so that he would supplicate for us and now we present al-abas the uncle of the Prophet so that he would ask you for Reign come Abbas and Abbas came and said oh Allah the people have presented me because of my closeness and relative because I'm a relative of our Prophet Allah oh Allah grant us Reign and they were granted rain nobody went to the Dead so from this we learned that it is permissible to ask righteous people for supplicating to you and for rain and this is all the time we have until we meet next time"
