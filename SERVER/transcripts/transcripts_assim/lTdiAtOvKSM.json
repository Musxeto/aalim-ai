  "title": "Can we Pray on a bed or Mattress? What about Foam or Spongy Prayer mats? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "fatima says is it okay to perform salah on bed so fatima is not asking about the ruling of praying while lying down for someone who's bedridden for example she's asking about a person standing on the bed itself an offering prayer rather than praying on the ground the most authentic opinion is that your elevation your height your clearance of the ground does not impact your prayer and this is why we pray while riding on a bus which is a metre or so above the ground or riding on a boat which is on water or while we are on board the plane 37,000 feet above sea level there is no problem in that then what is the issue then the issue is whether the surface you're standing on is taking the same ruling of a solid ground or not because most of beds have mattresses on them and when you stand on a mattress you find that your foot goes down which means that the surface itself is not hard and this means that when I put my head to prostrate my head and hands are as if they are floating and they're not stable on something that is solid and hence scholars say that the prayer on such surfaces are not the prayer is not valid likewise when you have these spongy prayer mats they are selling now in the in the market for those who have knee joint pains so for them to go on their knees on the ground if it's solid it hurts and they cannot prostrate they cannot sit so they made this foam a prayer mat that is this thick which is made of foam or sponge-like material so when you prostrate it's so soft that has a padding that would not make you touch the ground actually and this praying on it is also not permissible because when you put your forehead you're not actually placing it on the ground but rather it is somewhere floating in between so to answer your question Fatima if the mattress is really hard that when you place your forehead it doesn't go down rather it stays like a hard surface then the prayer is valid insha'Allah"
