  "transcript": "hello Shake thank you very much for the opportunity so thank you for the session as well it was very great okay while I understand there are six pillars of Iman and you've been explaining to us about the day of judgment um what happens to those who have never been given the opportunity to actually know about Islam what will happen to them during Judgment Day what will they still go to hell and be punished for not knowing Islam after all Allah created them in the very beginning thank you very much keep the microphone with you sit down I'm going to answer you okay question number one do you believe in Allah yes yes or no yes I believe in God yes alhamdulillah do you believe that Allah is fair and just I hope yes hopefully this is very very dangerous why Sheikh did you ask her such a dangerous question because this is what I do when I hear a question I've been doing this for quarter of a century so before you speak I know your question I have a crystal ball no I don't but I've been doing this for so long so a lot of the Muslims have a serious problem with Iman what do you mean Sheik there are three questions on the day of judge on in your grave the first three questions that you'll be asked about are what is or who is your lord what is your religion and who is this man who was sent to you correct very good the Muslims answer one one one rapid fire the non-muslims the Hypocrites would say huh huh I don't know I heard people say something and I said it with them they will go to hell directly this is why the moment someone comes to me in counseling sessions and say I'm a Believer I pray five times a day I abide by the hijab I do this I do that but I'm not sure if there is hell I'm not I said you're a cafir go ahead she you're closing the door yes if you do not have certainty Beyond doubt like okay I have next time remote control please so that it has to go like this one this is difficult anyhow I've lost touch okay so you're here okay you're here I'm disoriented now I'm going anticlockwise the question is you have to have certainty like the DNA mother without a DNA I'm still certain that she's my mother and without evidence or proof you believe that Allah is fair Allah is just Allah is all knowledgeable Allah is wise Allah owns the whole universe Allah possesses everything in his hands Allah the almighty does what he wills and no one can complain no one can object W if you object from today until the day of judgment nobody will listen to you nobody cares if Allah tosses all the universe the Milky Way the solar system the hundreds of galaxies in Hell Fire can you complain no who will listen to you Allah does what he Wills with what he possesses so coming back to your question why did I ask you this because if you don't have this certainty you're not a Muslim if you come back to your sens and say no no no I a Muslim I believe that Allah is fair Allah is just but I just wanted to ask no problem I will answer you no worries if you believe that Allah is fair and just you you don't need to ask this question because Allah will take care of them Allah is most merciful than a mother is merciful with her own baby baby Allah is most merciful than that subhanahu besides Allah says in the Quran we that is Allah would not torment a nation until we send them a messenger Why without a messenger they have no knowledge how would it be logical to torment them and they don't know why would I torment them if they don't know no after I send them a messenger they know now I would beat the heck out of them if they don't believe the remote control anyhow in addition to that there is an authentic Hadith where the Prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam tells us on the day of judgment when there is heaven and there is Hell segments of people will come some some would say oh Allah I was I didn't know what was happening some would say I was deaf and blind and dumb I could not hear your messenger so the message did not reach me some would say oh Allah I was in the jungles of Africa or in Siberia on an Alaska and no messenger came to me so I don't know the prophet tells usam now Allah orders a neck from Hellfire to come out and it comes out opening its mouth from hell and Allah says to them enter it true believers would say Okay Allah ordered us we will enter and it will take them to Paradise disbelievers doubters those who if Messengers came came to them in this D they would not have believed they would say no I'm not crazy I just saw it coming out from hell I'm not going inside so it will snatch them and throw them in hell and I hope this answers your question thank you"
