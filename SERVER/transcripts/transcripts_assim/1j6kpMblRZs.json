  "transcript": "[Music] I will just give you glimpses of how the companions may allah be pleased with them used to deal with innovation abdullah of nama may allah be pleased with him says every innovation takes people astray even when the people see it as good abdullah al masud as jeff seid mentioned in the speakers forum yesterday the story where he went to the message in Kufa and he saw the people making innovative kind of vicar and he said one of the two either you know more than Muhammed Ali Salim our prophet and his companions or your opening a gate of Bilal and taking the people straight they said Oliver Abdul Rahman by Allah we only intended good and he said to them how many people intend good but do not attain it all innovators intended good but they would not get it or reach it we all know the reward of offering salat upon the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam yet one person in the presence of women Omar sneezed so he said sure and he said alhamdulillah what Sadr towards allah rasool allah i said we did even Amma said and i say a llama salli wa sallim ala muhammad but this is not what the Prophet taught us beware the Prophet said erase alarm whenever one sneezes he should only say alhamdulillah now those who claim to love the Prophet Allah saw - some would object and they'll say there is nothing wrong in offering salutation to the Prophet s salatu salam if I tell them if you go to the toilet is it okay if I say bismillah our women and hope they will have a law Masoli o salim ala muhammad o d√≥ billah this is wrong what are you doing Touche so it's the same thing you follow the Sunnah you on the straight path you invent some innovate something you will get people innovating other things as well a man once went into the Masjid of Medina and between a van of fire and a perma of Fechter he started to pray 2 rakaats - rakh Haj - rakh Haj - rakh Haj so sorry deep nelmieux sahib one of the greatest appearing he said my friend don't pray except two rakahs anything more is wrong because the Prophet Allah saw some prohibited and maybe some of you may not know this it is prohibited to offer voluntary prayers between Adan and Yama of Hajj or any other salat no problem pray 20 records no problem Roger only the Sunnah of rally but will fetcher and if you did at home and you went to the Masjid you do not sit you pray 2 rakat the hater message that's it so the man instead of accepting the advice he said Abu Muhammad do you think I'm praying to Allah Azza WA JAL and Allah who will punish me for praying for him look at the logic sir he did himself said said to him my friend Allah will not punish you for praying Allah will punish you for going against the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam this is the most important thing and even Omar may Allah be pleased with him it shows you how strong they were abiding by the sooner he was once narrating a hadith where the prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam said do not prevent the women of Allah the slaves of Allah from attending the Masjid this is addressed to the men do not prevent your women folk if they want to go to the Masjid so his son of the last son the grandson of Roma said by Allah we will prevent them because he've seen what the women were doing when they go to the Masjid and go to the mall and buying a Starbucks and you know flirting and doing this and that so he said colossal we will prevent them even Omar was furious and he said I tell you the Prophet says Ali saw that some do not prevent women from attending the Masjid and you say by allah we will prevent them go i will never speak to you till I die and until Rome even Omar was on his death bed his son is coming and apologizing and he gives his back to him and would not speak to him and this is why they earned their pride dignity and honor through abiding by the Sunnah not like what we do compromise after compromise diluting our Deen until it is a new deal [Music]"
