  "transcript": "is it true that jinn hug us when we are sad and this is from zade and i say zayd this is not true because we do not see the jinn and we believe in them because the quran and the sunnah tell us about them therefore anyone claiming that jinn do this and jin do that must provide us with proof and evidence otherwise we do not accept it because it's from the world of the unseen so how can someone claim that when we're sad the jinn hug us what do they do when they're happy when we're happy i wouldn't go there so this is totally bogus and has no uh basis to it and allah knows best you"
