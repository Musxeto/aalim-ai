  "transcript": "Okay, Yasin from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh my question is if somebody backbites a celebrity, how can one ask for forgiveness from him because it's difficult to reach him? Jazakallahu Khairan Wa Jazak If a person backbites anyone who is unreachable, whether a celebrity or else, there is no way other than to repent to Allah, show remorse, ask Allah for forgiveness, and make dua for that Muslim individual. And if you are in a situation when his name is mentioned, you praise him and say good things about him so that would may compensate the harm and evil you had done against him and Allah knows best."
