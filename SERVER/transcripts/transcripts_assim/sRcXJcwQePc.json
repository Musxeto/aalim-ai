  "transcript": "uh tazreen says if we were if we are in an area where the only masjid is of extreme railways doing blatant shirk should we attend jummah it's a rule of thumb that the prayer behind a mushrik is not permissible but first we have to ensure that that individual is a mushrik so if the imam clearly calls the prophet isam oh prophet of allah do this for me protect us from what calamities we're undergoing uh oh oh prophet of allah do this for that or if he believes that only the prophet knows the unseen if he believes that the prophet is hazar nazar he is around us and he hears us and he is capable of doing whatever we ask him to do and he controls the universe as if he controls and sees his the palm of his hand this is blatant chick you don't have to be a rocket scientist to know that so such in imam you definitely can't pray jumu'ah or normal prayers behind him so what to do the only way possible is to look for a masjid that the imam is a follower of a sunnah or a hanafi masjid or a shaft he masjid anything that is not bravely or not committing shirk and if this is not possible then you have to look into your area and see if you can find three or more muslims brothers who follow the sunnah who have correct akida and you guys make your own juma in a room or in a hall or somewhere so that you would fulfill this great ritual and allah knows best"
