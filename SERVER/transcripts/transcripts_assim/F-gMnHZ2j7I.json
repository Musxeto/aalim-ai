  "title": "Do cavity fillings, crowns, implants, retainers, or braces create a barrier for Wudu or Ghusl",
  "transcript": "[Sheikh: Muhammad from U.S.A. Muhammad: A few \nyears ago I went to the dentist to get cavity   removed and the dentist placed a filling in \nmy tooth after the cavity was removed. So my   question is, does this filling count as a \nbarrier in wudu or ghusl? And if it does,   what should I do about it? Sheikh: Okay. I will \nanswer you, in sha Allah.] Muhammad from the U.S.,   he says that, 'if I had a cavity removed \nand a filling placed, would that impact my   wudu or ghusl?' The answer is 'Totally not.' \nAkhi, even if you wear a retainer or braces,   this has no impact on your wudu, because wudu \nis not.. When you wash your mouth it's not like   washing your hand. There has to be no barriers. \nAnd the mouth is a different thing. So even if   you have braces, or a retainer, or put cavities, \nor a crown, this has no impact none whatsoever."
