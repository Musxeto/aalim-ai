  "transcript": "he says can you give us an advice to those who um use social media among the youth well the advice is mentioned in the quran in the sunnah this thing that you're using don't even for a second forget that allah will question you about every page you open about every glance you take about everything you hear allah would hold you accountable for every single thing on the day of judgement so imagine if you waste your time five hours some eight hours a day watching instagram snapchat twitter facebook the whole nine year tick talk then what happens you waste so much time and you gain so many sins and this is the easy part what's worse is that you are darkening your heart it's becoming dark stiff and hard that's why you're not finding the taste and the sweetness of salat of dua of reading the quran that's why you're always depressed always fed up and bored that's why you look for new things and nothing seems to be helping except digging yourself and burying yourself under more and more browsing of such social media platforms and this is a very negative sign because lots of the muslims who are drowned in such things soon would end up leaving the fold of islam unfortunately so just a reminder use the social media platforms as long as there is no sin and don't put a limit to the time but in return whatever time you spend on it spend equal time on reading the quran or offering to hajjut prayers you will find that whoa you got to be kidding how long do you open the quran every day i'm ashamed i don't know what to say no no talk to me nobody's listening 11 months and you don't open the quran but you have the audacity to spend two hours a day on social media and then you want allah to respond to your dua and to give you provisions and a good job and a good spouse and to give you good health hello there's something wrong up here you have to rethink your life because it's going down the drain so um this is yeah inshallah quick advice you"
