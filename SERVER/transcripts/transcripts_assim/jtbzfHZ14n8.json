  "transcript": "fatima from india ah my question is is it permissible to do german culture when we have fever g i will answer inshallah fatima says can we do jammer and kasser will we have a fever what is jemma and khasir jammer is to combine prayers together and pray them at a specific time qasr is to shorten four raka's into two again jammer is only to combine and assure as a set either at the time of or at the time of asar or to combine between maghrib and isha as a set either at the time of maghrib or at the time of asia fajr cannot be combined it has to be prayed on time so this is jammer combining and this is permissible for a traveler and a non-traveler whenever there's a necessity so if someone is really sick like our sister um aziza from the uk her son was sick admitted to hospital she prayed maghrib and she did not pray asia she could have prayed isha with maghrib due to her being occupied with her son not allowing the time to come out so she could have prayed maghrib then prayed for rakhas of isha at the time of maghrib no problem in that if a person is going into a test and this is once in a year and the test is at assert time he can pray for rakhas follow that by asar for rakhas and then enter the test where he would finish after maghrib and by that this is okay no problem shortening is a different story altogether shortening cannot be done except when a person is a traveler outside of his city limits so if i'm traveling from mumbai to delhi this is traveling distance the moment i leave city borders of mumbai i can pray to raka's i can pray two raka's i can pray isha two raka's fajr and must be prayed as it is it cannot be shortened so combining can be done if you have a fever and you're unable to come to pray a prayer who is uh in real pain it's difficult to go to the toilet it's difficult to perform real difficulty there's something between you and allah nobody is going to sue you nobody is going to hold you accountable except him so he knows whether you are in a necessity or not you can combine but you cannot shorten and i hope this answers your question you"
