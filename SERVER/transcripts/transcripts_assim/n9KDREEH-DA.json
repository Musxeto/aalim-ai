  "transcript": "Sad man from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Did you say what? I was in the second Raka'ah You were in doubt of what? Did I say Rabi'ul Firdaus twice or not between the sitting of two prostrations? Did you say it once at least? I was in doubt of that Okay So I continued the prayer and I was in about 50-50 doubt So after when I reached my third Raka'ah and said Rabi'ul Firdaus then I most probably thought that yes I maybe had said Rabi'ul Firdaus in my second Raka'ah And as the prayer had reached the final point I was mostly sure that yes I had said it Rabi'ul Firdaus So I said Salam and didn't offer two prostrations of forgetfulness and I was also leading the Salah so is our prayer valid Sheikh? Do you get these doubts often? Yes quite often I today also got it in Fajr prayer Ignore this and move on Secondly, saying Rabi'ul Firdaus is an obligation according to the most authentic opinion However some schools of thought consider it to be Sunnah"
