  "transcript": "us she says what's the ruling on the late payment fee and this is a frequently asked questions so people who go to islamic schools if they are late in paying the semesters fees the administration may take an interest on over that or a fee or a penalty islamic banks in muraba when you're buying something in installments i'm not talking about the muraba however it's haram because this is a very wide topic that needs to investigate each bank's transaction because the vast majority of these banks do not deal in halal transactions all what they care about is money whether you buy a property or a car or you travel for vacation they don't care they care that you give you borrow a lump sum and you return that with interest so what's the ruling on late payment fee late payment fee over a loan is totally riba and prohibited even if the first party claims that we will take the money and we will give it to the poor or pay it for zakat or it's still riva because it's a loan that had an interest occurring over it you may call it interest you may call it profit you may call it penalty it's still riba and it's totally prohibited"
