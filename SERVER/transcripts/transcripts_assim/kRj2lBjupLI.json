  "transcript": "the best way to do is after you urinate wash your private parts sprinkle water on your underwear and leave after doing woodle whenever you get the feeling that something came out convince yourself that this was the water you had sprinkled and the water that you've washed your private part with aft it's difficult but if you manage to conquer this after five days or seven days inshallah it will totally seize and disappear you would not have the feeling anymore sajid from bangladesh he says that he has a friend that has urine incontinence which he thinks he has now i beg to differ because your incontinence usually is something that is continuous there is something wrong physically so drops keep on coming 24 7 hours seven days a week but what differentiates your incontinence from whispering of shaytan is that the whispering of shaytan comes after urinating by five or ten minutes and then it stops and usually it comes when you perform wudu and you want to pray but if you just urinate and go back to your playstation or to whatever you were doing nothing happens so this is a clear indication that this is from shaytan and why do i say it's from shaitaan because you would not have discovered that you've soiled your clothes until you go afterwards and search into your underwear maybe squeeze your private part and try to see something which is all from shaitaan and the best way to do is after you urinate wash your private parts sprinkle water on your underwear and leave after doing woodle whenever you get the feeling that something came out convince yourself that this was the water you had sprinkled and the water that you've washed your private part with aft it's difficult but if you manage to conquer this after five days or seven days inshallah it will totally seize and disappear you would not have the feeling anymore because shaytan is fed up and he goes and leaves you but the moment you get weak and you try to squeeze yourself or to try to search and look it will come back again allah knows best"
