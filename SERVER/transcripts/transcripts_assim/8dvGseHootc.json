  "title": "Why does an Eclipse happen & what is the Muslimâ€™s attitude towards it?",
  "transcript": "if you look at the eclipse why is it taking place why is it taking place allah says in the quran that these are signs that allah frightens his servants with allah says and we sent not the signs except to warn and to make them afraid of destruction so allah sends these signs to frighten people and to show and display his might and power subhan now one would say why would allah frighten people it is simple because allah azzawajal is so powerful and people are so ignorant no matter how many times you tell them paradise is this beautiful paradise has this paradise has that would this deter them from doing sins but the minute you tell them whoever does this he's going to be soaked in hell and boiling oil and his flesh is going to fall would this deter them from doing sin immediately yes the minute you want to approach oh nope why because human nature people are driven by fear more than they're driven by hope and that is why allah azzawajal sends us a wake-up call every now and then for our own good these calamities these catastrophes these upholding things that are happening to the muslims they can be punishment so if there's an earthquake if there's a tsunami if there's a volcano if there's a tornado if there's floods this might be one a punishment because of your sins as allah indicated in the quran that whatever calamity befalls upon you it is of your own doing and it can be a test it's not a punishment but as you know that why did allah create death and life to test you to test you who among you is the best of deeds or qualities so it can be a test and life is a test and do you expect that you get your payroll check at the end of the month and you're healthy and your family is healthy and your neighbors are kind and your wife is loving and caring and your children are disciplined and all half of the quran and you can pray five times in the message that nothing happens to you and fast nothing happens to you and live like this for 60 years and then pass away in peace this is not the case do you think that people would be let alone to say that we believe without them being tested we have tested those who where before them and by allah allah will know those who are truthful and allah would know those who are telling lies so it can be a punishment it can be a test and it can be to reward you with it raising your level in paradise so whatever calamity befalls upon you it's for your goodness and therefore allah azzawajal frightens the people and the prophet told us that part of frightening the people is the eclipse when you see that these great huge large planets or stars all of a sudden the light disappears the light go when you see this you believe and you fear allah who is the only one who has the power to do this one might claim and say we all know when the eclipse takes place so what's so special astronomers know exactly by time and by the hour when it's going to happen so where is the factor of threatening or making us frightened scholars say due to the fact that allah azzawajal had set sunnah and a procedure for everything that it cannot go or divert or deviate from this does not mean that it is not part of allah's threatening us or frightening us i'll give you example eclipse takes place in two ways in the way that allah has created it and in the religion that allah has told us to be afraid of such a thing and therefore we should not mix them two together because allah has set rules and regulations for the universe to go by we are instructed not to look at these rules and regulations we're instructed to look at what islam quran and sunnah tell us to do and islam tells us to do is when we see the eclipse that we hasten to the masjid we give sadaqa charity we seek allah's forgiveness we repent and we pray and we feel fearful as our prophet assalam was afraid when he saw the eclipse however if we do not see the eclipse we do not react meaning if the astronomers told us that today at nine o'clock p.m there will be a full eclipse of the moon and all of the scientists agreed on this we believe them ten minutes to nine we look up and the sky is filled with clouds we are unable to see the moon how many raka's do we pray none we pray nothing why because the eclipse to us did not take place although the scientists say it's taking place now therefore what they say does not affect our fear to allah azzawajal when they tell us that volcanoes are a natural thing the plates separate a little bit earthquakes take place the lava comes out and all hell breaks loose on earth so when volcanoes happen are you intimidated and afraid or no no this is scientific what would happen you run like a crazy man because if you don't you're gonna burn to death and that is why we pay no attention to the clarification of science if it affects our iman we know that these two big huge creations of allah are signs and we know that allah every now and then deprives them from their light by the moon coming in front of the sun or by the earth coming between the moon and the sun and this only happens by the will of allah and by the power of allah we believe in it and we pay no attention to the calculations of astronomers and the likes you"
