  "transcript": "shiram from australia i was wondering about the concept of what i did and is it authentic and if so can you please explain uh what it means okay i will answer inshallah in sram from australia says who are the mujahid there is a hadith where the prophet said allah allah sends over every century every 100 years a person who would renew the deen renew the deen okay renovate the dean renovate the deed what do you mean it means that a lot of the sunnah tends to fade away and sometimes die whether in akida whether in whether in and people forget people neglect so every hundred years allah sent those who would refurbish it renovate it revive it in the hearts of the muslims they're not innovating anything new people forgot that there are two of doha to be prayed every day so someone comes and reminds the people and they start practicing it whoa good did he bring anything new no he just revived something that was dying or sort of extent so he revived it this is the role of the mujad did in the past scholars say it used to be a single person because at that time a single scholar had mastered all types of sciences to the extent that you did not know whether he is an expert in tafsir or in hadith or in philip or in usual or in arabic or in whatever so all of this means that such a person has all the qualities of a scholar nowadays the scholars say that the mujadid the one who renovates that revives things in religion can be a group of people each one in his own category and allah knows best"
