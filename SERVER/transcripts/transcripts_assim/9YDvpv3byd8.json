  "transcript": "foreign oh concluded his genre on the seventh year of hijrah as we know this is known to be ramrat al-khadiyah and some call it umrat al-qada and this name by itself made a lot of the muslims misunderstand the situation so some thought that whenever you are prevented from performing hajj or umrah for one reason or the other then it's compulsory that you come on the following year to perform that pilgrimage or ramra and they make as evidence the name of the umrah that the prophet sallam took which is and actually this is wrong means that this is what they've agreed upon so they it comes from the word takadu which means that they've agreed on this the previous year so this umrah is called by this name not because it had to be made up by the the prophet sallam for something that he missed last year no and this means that if you were prevented from making umrah and or hajj and you slaughter your hadi because of this prevention you don't have to make it the following year on the way back the prophet sallam married his last and final wife her name was maimuna bilharith and she was the sister of luba kubra which was the mother of abdullah ibn abbas the wife she was the wife of the uncle of the prophet maimura also was the sister of a sora and she was the wife of al-waleed the father of khalid ibn which makes the prophet salam married to a woman who's the aunt of abdullah nabas and khalid she was also the half sister of selma and asma the daughters of amazed selma was married to hamza bin abdullah and of course we know asmr was married to three of the top companions of the prophet and that and these were jaffa bin abi talib and when he died in the battle of motta abu bakr married her asadik and when he passed away ali ibn abi talib married her she as we said the professor married her in an area called saraf and she also died later on on the same area and she was buried in it by this we know that the marriages of the prophet sallam concluded were concluded and he married 11 and two of them died in his lifetime and those were and she was known as the mother of the poor because of the amount of charity she would give she stayed with the prophet salallahu for two or three years and then she passed away we move on to what is known as the battle of mutta and the origin of this battle was that the prophet salam had sent one of his companions and he was he sent him to the ruler and the leader of bosura and busra is a region close to damascus of syria and while he was going there he was intercepted by surah bilib naamr who tied him up and chopped his head off and this was a serious offense because messengers are not to be killed and this is known worldwide messengers are never killed they just deliver the message so the prophet salallahu in the fifth month of uh the eighth year of hijrah and this corresponds to uh uh august or september of the year of 926 on the gregorian calendar he sent an army of three thousand men to punish this man and the tribes around him and the prophet alaihis was of course 3 000 men were considered to be a very big army and it is one of the biggest armies that islam had at the time with the exception of the army that was in the battle of no that was before that when the prophet sallam had them in the battle of uh alhandak where he had all the companions and they were faced by ten thousand of all the coalition uh group so the prophet salallahu salaam had three leaders for this army he had jaffar ibrahim his cousin but before him he appointed his adopted son zaid abner and he told them that your leader is and of course he was not adopted anymore he used to be an adopted son but he was uh uh very close to the prophet and his son usama was very close to the prophet so he told them that your leader would be zaid and if he's killed then jaffa my cousin jaffra bitalib takes his place and if he is killed then abdullah takes his place now this was unprecedented before the prophet sallam never did anything of this sort before which meant that he was the feeling that something was about to happen because now they're going to strange lands lands that they've not been before and they don't have any means of supplies or reinforcement it's long long way away from the center of arabia from medina but the prophet sallam sent them it they had to go to avenge his companion who the messenger who was killed and he told them that go and raid these tribes in the name of allah read them in the name of allah read them in the cause of allah whoever disbelieves in allah you should fight him and then he told them allah do not deceive do not betray and break your promises to the non-muslims do not kill a child nor a woman do not kill an elderly do not kill a monk in his a a place of worship or a priest in his church do not bring down any building and demolish it all of these were the instructions of the prophet to this army which was the norm this was usual which also indicates to us that islam is not a religion that promotes terror or promotes destruction so whenever you see something in the media and this happens often that muslims are portrayed as people of destruction and violence whenever you see this rest assure that this is un-islamic it has no relation to the quran or to the sunnah on the contrary our religion instructs us not to do these acts the people went the three thousand men went to the destination the people of medina along with the prophet allah went out to the outskirts of medina to bet them farewell once they reach their destination it was not something they had anticipated they heard that the byzantian army was a hundred thousand troops alongside another army from the arab tribes surrounding the area of another hundred thousand and this was a great shock to them no matter how brave you are no matter how strong you are if you have an army of three thousand men standing against two hundred thousand men by no chance this would be acceptable it's it's almost like one to every seventy yeah this is something even if if they blow on them they would make this man fly out of their the breath so the companions had to reassess the situation so they started talking what should we do some of them said that we should send to the prophet sallam for reinforcement or to ask him what to do do you want us to come back because this sounds and seems to be the wisest thing to do yeah instead of throwing yourself in a battle that it's obvious it's unfair there's no uh way to match this power with that power abdullah who was a poet who was articulate stood up and said people i think that what we came for is what we are trying to escape at the moment and look at the way he puts it why wh why did he we come here in the first place we come here to die in the sight of allah in the cause of allah and now we're discussing how to escape this why should we send a message to the prophet sallam asking for his opinion this is what we came for to die for the sake of allah so i believe that we should go ahead and fight until we either we're victorious or we die in the side of allah and this is all what we want and he said it in a way that everyone in the army the three thousand of them agreed to die in the cause of allah what happened is what we inshallah will know after the break so stay tuned i say that the translation has been indirectly influenced with the israelite narrative we haven't faced any problems in our preparations we can't call it the wise you have a huge amount of initiative going on in terms of developing qualifications in different parts of the system reading helps you gain knowledge by saving them it doesn't help you at all they are all uh welcome to uh participate in the discussion and the debate about the development of qualifications what types of books our children do or should read join me for further discussion focus point a light in every home and welcome back now the armies are about to confront and engage in fierce battles but it's not logical and it can be something that out is considered to be out of this world how could 3000 stand in the face of 200 000 byzantian soldiers well equipped ready to fight and well trained this is something beyond our present day imagination but they were not normal men and if you claim that one man of them is equal to a thousand you would not be exaggerating they went into fighting and of course the first one to go into fighting was zayd even hadith because he was the leader and he was carrying the flag it was described that he went into the spears of the people of the byzantine army to the extent that he didn't even fight he just you know drove in he just rode in that is and even omar may allah be pleased with him said that i counted after the battle fifty wounds in zadine's body all in his front side nothing in his back which meant that he never tried to he never even turned his back to them yeah and he fought until he died bravely which means that he never left anyone to come back no no no it's not he did not leave anyone he did in war when you fight you attack but sometimes out of strategy you have to retreat a little bit and maybe regroup and do something and attack again did not go back not one single foot he fought and definitely he had killed like 10 or 15 or 20 of the byzantium army and then he died as a martyr along came jaffram who took the flag and he fought bravely until he was overcome by the great number of the army the enemy army they chopped off his right hand so he held it with his left they chopped his left hand so he held it with his shoulders and then they killed him and the prophet sallam gave us the glad tidings and gave his children and his wife the glad tiding that jaffa's arms were substituted by allah in paradise with wings to fly whatever he wants and that is why he's known as jaffar the flying jaffa or dulja jaffa with the two wings abdullah has turned of course as the leader was next so he hesitated a little bit out of human nature after seeing what was going on and then he took the flag one of his cousins gave him something to eat so that he would strengthen himself before battle and he just took a bite and threw it and said some poetry and marched into the people and fought till the death now the three leaders are gone yeah but the army had to has to have a leader so one of the companions came and he took the flag from uh uh abdullah after he passed away his name was and he told the people elect someone and just choose someone to lead you so the muslims in the midst of the fighting told him you're the leader you lead he said he told them by allah i don't want this i'm not the man and also this shows us that a muslim should be fair and just it's not a matter of position or a influence and power it's a matter of being fair and knowing that you are in the right place and this what what called thabit may allah be pleased with him to refuse this he said i'm not the man do you want me to take the responsibility of all these muslims and then i end up with their blood in my hands i can't do this so choose another one so they looked around and they found khalid may allah be pleased with him and as we know khalid was an extraordinary leader and he had so his resume was full of battles and and fights that he was always victorious in so you want to say something yeah i read a report that it mentioned that may allah be pleased with him he never lost in one battle in his life even before islam or after yes he was a very tactical person he knew how to fight and he knew how to put a plan that would work so immediately after he took charge he regrouped the muslims and they fought for the rest of the day but it was few hours or few minutes to sunset so the minute night had fallen everyone went back to his camp khalid could not retreat because if they retreated the enemy army would come and kill them all because when you're running it's easy for them to catch one by one you don't have a strong line of defense so khalid came up with the grace of allah with an a very genius idea so he regrouped the army and he ordered those who were on the left of the army to go to the right and those who were on the right to go to the left and those who were in the center to go to the back and those who were at the back to go to the front when day break came and they wanted to start fighting again the enemy army was terrorized they thought that they had reinforcement these are new people to us you know the right and left of of the army all had their own flags so they've seen the flags being changed and swapped new faces new soldiers and not the one we fought them yesterday so they thought to themselves that oops we have a problem they've the muslims had their re enforcement and now we're going to going to fight a new army and there there's a definitely more and more of them coming so they began fighting with lots of fear in their hearts of course the muslims did their best to fight strongly and it was reported as in the sahih bukhari that khaled when allah pleased with him broke nine swords now if you've seen the swords that you used to fight with us normal people would not be able to carry them let alone to fight with them the leader of that army broke nine swords so you can imagine the skulls that he used to hit and split into two the bodies he was an experienced warrior and this what happened with him with his swords and imagine the remaining 3000 of the of of the muslim army the enemy army was terrified they thought that even though we have the majority in a number we are outnumbering them but these are not humans they fight like lions and they're not afraid of death they're all wanting to face the same fate that abdullah jaffar had met the the previous day and khalid could sense and feel the fear in their hearts so he did not retreat but he went back a little bit and as he estimated the enemy army did not want to follow them because they were afraid that this was an ambush and that there are more reinforcements and they want to draw them in further to the desert so they've decided not to follow now imagine fighting the full day and then fighting the following day such a huge army this to some would sound to be as a defeat to the muslims on the country it's considered to be victory a victory because you know facing such a huge army and how much do you estimate died from the muslims in that battle 100 100 that would be acceptable compared to only 13 from the muslims died and we don't have a count of those who died from the enemy army but by looking at nine swords from one from from one person so you would estimate that before breaking a sword he would have killed ten at least so they had casualties in the hundreds from the byzantium army and that what made them happy to call it off and withdraw to withdraw their army now as the the events were taking place allah azza revealed to the prophet sallallahu alaihi in the status of what was going on and we are told that the prophet saw sallam told his companions once as the battle was taking place he told them with tears filling his eyes that zaydim naharitha fought the enemy army until he died then jaffar took the flag and he fought until he died and then the prophet sallam posed for a while so the ansar felt bad because this they were afraid that he would say that abdullah did not take the flag because he was among them but then he said this prophesy and then abdullah took the flag until he died and then a sword of allah a man that is known as a sword of allah took it and he did wonders with them and this is the nickname of he is known to be the sword of allah the enemy army was defeated in our calculations and i'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program inshallah we'll elaborate a little bit further next time we meet until then foreign hmm"
