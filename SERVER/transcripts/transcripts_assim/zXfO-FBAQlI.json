  "title": "If science proves that playing PUBG, Fortnite don't promote violence, can we play? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "it says that you said that pubg and other fortnights and and other games promote violence but studies prove that they do not um uh promote violence it's been on my mind to download this game and play it for some time just to know exactly what it is because i'm completely oblivious when it comes to video games i hate them i've never tried them subhanallah something uh psychological maybe i don't know and until now i i could not i know that this is one of the reasons that scholars say that playing it is not permissible among the other reasons is addictive people stay six to eight hours playing them it makes them engaged with others disbelievers relationships mixed gendering any free mixing because it's most of it done online and some of it includes betting and one of the games i think it was pubg or another game where they had a idol to pass a stage you had to go and prostrate and give sacrifice to the idol and then you move on to the following level and that caused a lot of problem in the muslim world and eventually they removed it but it shows you that these guys all what they want is money and they don't have your best of interest uh in mind so i believe that it does increase the amount of hostility and violence in children among other things so i would not say that it is halal um even if the studies prove otherwise i would say that's a great waste of time of the muslim that his feet as the prophet said assalam would not be moved on the day of judgment and until he's asked about his youth where he had spent it his time where it was wasted his knowledge what did he do with it and his wealth where he gained it and where he spent it in"
