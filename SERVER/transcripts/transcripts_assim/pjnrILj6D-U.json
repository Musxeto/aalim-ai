  "transcript": "okay I come across a Facebook post from a fellow Muslim men in our in my country expressing his discomfort with communal ifar gatherings in Masid despite being somewhat practicing he admitted that he couldn't eat like that without risking a confrontation for instance if someone were to take his favorite Mt chicken or his sh of rice he might resort to slapping them hard across the face he emphasized that eating from a shed pla with others is not his preference and he prefers to have his own individual plate with a large portion of wood I don't I don't understand what you're saying are you talking about eating in the Masjid uh basically I referring to communal Gathering where uh around four to six people shed one big plate in mid this is not communist this is Islamic where is communism in this Muslims gather on one plate and share it this is the Sunnah the prophet saidat do not eat dispersed each one eats alone like an open Buffet rather eat from one plate say bmah so that the blessing and the Baraka of Allah would fall upon it and it would suffice all of you and Allah Knows Best"
