  "title": "He told me he does not pray out of laziness & died, is he a Muslim & can I make Dua for him?",
  "transcript": "and in 2022 I visited him again. He did not pray. And before his death I used to speak to him on the phone. He said, I don't pray because I know I have to pray. I believe in Allah, but I'm lazy. So that's why I don't pray. So he died in a car accident. So my question is can I make dua for him since he believed in Allah, but maybe for laziness he didn't want to pray. What's the solution for such a person? The default, my friend, is that he is a Muslim until proven otherwise. He may say, I don't pray out of laziness, but every now and then he prays on and off. Maybe after the last phone call he picked up praying. So as long as we have not labeled him as a kafir, while providing that the conditions of takfir have been fulfilled and there are no obstacles present, the default is he's Muslim until proven otherwise. Hence, you can ask Allah for forgiveness. May Allah forgive us and him as well."
