  "title": "Found Mani on legs after doing Ghusl & repeated all his prayers while taking small breaks, valid?",
  "transcript": "and Muhammad from America? [Muhammad]: I recently \nsent in a question to your emails about the man   who found Mani on his legs after performing Ghusl, \ndo you remember that? I have 150 questions a day,   so I remember something like that which is not \nvery normal because if you take Ghusl, Mani is not   something that is glueish if you put water on it \neven for a little while it will dissolve by itself   so most likely this wasn't mani but okay assuming \nit it was, your question? [Muhammad] okay so   he performed all the prayers that he did since \nbeing in the state of major impurity for a second   time so he performed he performed them in the \norder that they originally came he performed Asr,   Maghrib, Isha, Fajr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha and \nFajr again and he took his time while using   the bathroom and performing Ghusl which means \nthat he did not hurry and he took small breaks   in between the prayers that he re-performed \nso are his prayers now valid and is there   anything else that he should do? Okay I would \nanswer inshallah. Muhammad from the U.S. says   that he repeated all the prayers that he thought \nhis Ghusl was not valid due to stains of semen on   his thigh so he repeated all these prayers like \nfive or ten of them in order but when he took his   Ghusl he took his time so he didn't make it in \none minute to rush and make up these prayers   he took his time shampooed probably \nand put some conditioner whatever   and afterwards when he prayed the ten prayers in \norder and sequence he may have taken a gap between   a prayer and two and the other to drink water and \na short gap there's no problem that it's all valid"
