  "transcript": "Hakeem from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum. Wassalamu Alaikum. Sheikh, so my question is regarding prayer. Sometimes when I'm praying I may say a word or a phrase improperly and I can't just pull out my phone and look at it on a word form to see if I'm saying it properly. So what I do is I just try to remember it. What kind of word? Hakeem, what kind of word? غير المغلوب عليهم. Okay, and I want to make sure that I said it properly. But I'm not sure. So I just wait until I'm done with the prayer and then I look it up on my phone and then I see if I did it properly or not. But sometimes I forget. Sometimes I forget which phrase it was and then I go through the whole prayer and I can't remember. I try to retrace my steps, but I can't remember sometimes. Should I redo the prayer? Hakeem, how long have you been Muslim? 23 years. And is it logical? What's your name? Hakeem. How long did it take you to say your name? A second? One second. Yes. And how many times do people ask you your name a month? Five times, maybe ten times? So a name that you do not say except five or ten times a month, compared to 23 years of Islam, 365 days a year, 17 raka'ah per day. Hakeem, this is a clear sign of shaitaan messing up with your head. Just act upon your gut feeling and totally disregard any such wiswas, because this is what shaitaan does to open a can of worms. And once you open it, it would never be closed. So save yourself, save your religion. Ya Hakeem, 23 years, mashallah, you're a veteran. You don't need shaitaan to tell you what you've said correctly or wrongly. And Allah knows best."
