  "title": "Praying in the masjid by keeping distance between people & rows due to Covid-19 - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "brother says people in our country are praying in the Masjid during this lockdown as some prominent Muftis are saying that this lockdown does not apply to mosques old daily prayers including Juma prayer will happen as normal with the precautionary measures that there would be a proper distance between rows and individuals that is six feet during congregations is it allowed to pray with such gaps between the followers or is it an innovation first of all if you are in a Muslim country that is ruled by a Muslim leader then you have to obey what the leader says and not to listen to any Tom Dick or Harry or any Mufti or any this or that because this is a crisis that requires decisive directive from the highest level so one Mufti says you have to do this other Mufti says you don't have to do this and putting the Muslims in confusion this is the role of the Muslim ruler ruler or leader he's the one who has to intervene and gives his directive so first of all don't listen to these Muftis if you are in a Muslim country you have to abide by what the Muslim ruler is telling you to do and praying in home you will be rewarded as if you're praying in the Masjid because allah told you to obey your leader and at the same time this is a collateral issue it's something that you can't take a decision which may have negative consequences over the whole country and then said whoops i did it again i wasn't aware that it will be this serious well this is your problem don't be a Rambo as I said so many times be with the Gemara of the Muslims and whatever they decide even if you think that this is not the right decision if you are in a non-muslim country and by law this is a crime to go and pray in the message you have to pray home don't let the non-muslims take this as means of attacking Islam and the Muslims and accusing the Muslims of spreading the virus and doing this and doing that now if the Muslim leader says you can pray in the masjid and then they tell you to keep a six feet distance between you and the man praying next to you though this is a big innovation and it would not protect you from the virus if Allah wills the virus to come and get you what will you do with prostrating on the carpet or on the floor where others have frustrated maybe a few hours ago so this is not logical this kind of innovation of leaving a six feet gap is unacceptable and your best better and it's best for you to pray home rather - rather than to join such an innovation and Lazo JAL knows best"
