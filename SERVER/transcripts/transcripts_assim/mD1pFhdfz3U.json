  "transcript": "uh the next question is from sister zanar should we say the shahada before going to sleep this is not from the sunnah the afghan of the sunnah are well known and you're a muslim so saying the shahada on your dying bed yes this is sunnah the prophet said teach those who are dying how to say but when going to bed of going to bed ayatul kursi cupping your hands and blowing in it and then reciting the three pulls and wiping your whole body and you do this three times uh allah means and so on all of these are part of the askar and part of declaring your islam without even needing to say the shahada because saying it would be an innovation saying it at this particular point of time which is before going to bed is something that the prophet did not do allah so either we have an authentic hadith saying that yeah the prophet before going to bed he used to recite it then we have to follow that or if we don't have this then it becomes an innovation we have one of the things we recite before going to bed which is the declaration of tawhid practical tohi i don't worship but you worship and you don't worship what i worship and alone knows"
