  "title": "Can I move to the back to avoid innovations as our Imam recites Quran after Fard prayer",
  "transcript": "consider subscribing abdullah from japan um i just wanted to ask you this one um the masjid tayatan has its own you know um quote-unquote quorum called right after the prayer ends uh our imam starts reciting italkursi then some other asgard and duan finishes with a recitation of some quran so my question is do i have to remain in my place and listen to his recitation and then do my own nascar or can i just move a little a little further away from him and then you know do my outguard and other things so basically abdullah's question is about what the imam does after conclusion of his prayer he does the atkar and he makes few duas recites the quran loudly and most likely the congregation either listens to him or repeats with him or repeats after him most likely if you ask him did the prophet alaihis ever do such a thing and he would say nope never so this is an innovation why are you doing this he said no no no the prophet had never done such a thing but because we are here in japan and most people don't know these athkar so i'm saying it loudly so that they can learn it now if you said this once in a lifetime twice in a lifetime maybe i would accept this but saying it after every prayer and for the entire the rest of your life this means that you're innovating and the prophet had never done such a thing nor did his companions nor did the tabery nor did the taber at tabi so definitely either you know more than them or you have committed a an innovation what is my role your role is not to join them and i would definitely if i were there the moment the salat is over i would stand and leave to the end of the masjid so that people would see me not being with them in this innovation if he was sincere he would have taught them one by one the zafkar on a black board and they repeat it after him one by one not in congregation after salat no he dedicates a class to do that and allah knows best you"
