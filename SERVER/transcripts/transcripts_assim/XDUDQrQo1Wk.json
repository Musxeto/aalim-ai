  "title": "Siblings depriving heirs from Inheritance | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "says for the last 27 years after the father had died and mother died 17 years ago but sometimes some of the siblings don't understand and are holding the property for themselves neither dividing the and neither selling so what islam says regarding these siblings who do not want to sell inheritance property what is the ruling and punishment for not distributing the inheritance or and property this is sinful they have no right in withholding it like this against the other heirs will if i share with other siblings a property i demand that they give me my portion of it in cash if they refuse to sell then they must buy my portion and give me my cash and if they refuse this as well then they are transgressors because they're depriving me from having my own god-given share so the easiest thing is to go and file a case against them in court and the court would force them either to sell and distribute the money or to buy those who want cash according to the prices of today and unfortunately i've seen so many similar cases and millions of dollars were wasted because the siblings are too soft take them to courts and no he's our brother he's our elder we don't want to shame him he's a thief what do you mean by you don't want to shame him if you don't want the money for yourself care about your children because if you die today definitely your children will have no right in calling for it no evidences but now while you're you're alive it's haram throwing your wealth down the drain like this"
