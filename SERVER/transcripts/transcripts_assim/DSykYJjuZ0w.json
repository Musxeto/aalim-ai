  "transcript": "Alima from France Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Salamu Alaikum Yes, thank you very much sir for everything. So I have this question like Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala says in the Quran that He is close to us more than our jugular vein. So please I would like to know the explanation in details of this verse. I did not understand the verse. Like Allah says in the Quran that He is close to us more than our jugular vein. Okay so this ayah refers to Allah's ability, Allah's power, Allah's knowledge through seeing and hearing. So Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala though we confirm that He is above everything and above His throne, above the seven heavens, yet He is closer to one of us than our jugular veins. He's so close to us that He can do whatever He wills with us. As if He is Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala truly capable of doing what He wills through His power, through His knowledge, through His seeing and hearing. So this is how Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama'ah understand this verse. Though Allah Azza wa Jal is above everything on His throne and above the seven heavens, yet He's so close to us that He could do whatever He wills Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala."
