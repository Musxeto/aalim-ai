  "transcript": "if schritt says if we have both water and dates in front of us at the time of if bar which is the breaking of the fast what should we take first dates or water suna was that the Prophet RA salat wa sallam used to take dates if available but here everyone takes water then dates first of all there is a Sunnah to be followed and if one does not follow it he's not sinful so the Sunnah was that the Prophet would break his fast on ripe dates what we call la popa so row table is not dates it is ripe it is either yellow or red with some ripeness in it it's a fruit still if not available he would break his fast on dates which is a brown or black dried one and if not available he would sip few sips of water now if someone does not want to follow the sequence it immediately goes and eats from his soup or is some Busiek or a pizza or whatever this is okay has he committed innocent no not at all but he has missed a great reward so there's no problem in sipping water this is against the Sunnah but if one wants to do it so be it it's not something that we have to pinpoint every single thing and no you do this you do that you show them the Sunnah by eating from it telling them once they are in a good mood but if they don't want to comply this is their plot problem"
