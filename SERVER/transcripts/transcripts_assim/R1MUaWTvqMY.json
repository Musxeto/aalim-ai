  "title": "Wearing different colours & layered Abaya & Khimar, is this adorning oneself? #Assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "on the side of social media that promote companies that sell hijab and modest clothing I noticed that some of the women were these long double or triple layered elegant humar and this is sometimes paired with mismatching the colors of their humar with their Abaya for a complimentary look these items aren't patterned or anything like they're quite simple but my question is if this comes under the category of adorning oneself or beautifying hijab anyways which would defy the purpose this is something that differs from one country to the other from one culture to the other some company some countries may consider this to be normal other countries that black dominates their attire if a woman would were to wear something like that that would be eye catching and that would be adorning herself against the norm so if this is done for example in the States or in Europe where women May wear different colors and these different colors are not weird in nature that do not stand out in a crowd rather it's gray blue um and the likes I believe that there's nothing wrong in doing so inshallah providing that the norm is acceptable among the Muslims and that it is not drawing a lot of attention where men would start to whistle and would look and and see something that they may like and Allah Knows Best"
