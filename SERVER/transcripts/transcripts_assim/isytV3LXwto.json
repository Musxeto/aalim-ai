  "title": "Giving zakat to servants with also an intention that they stay with you - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "says can i give zakat to my poor housemates and servants my intention is to give zakat to a poor muslim but also if i have the intention that they should work with me and not think of leaving work is it okay i give them sufficient salary for their work the zakat is not at all the amount to compensate for their work this is a conflict of interest now if your driver if you're made if you're guar a house servant is a muslim and they are poor legible for zakat giving them zakat is totally permissible because they fit the criteria the problem is with your intention if your intention is to select them specifically to give them the zakat with the intention that you retain them so that they would not look for another job elsewhere because your zakat now is becoming an incentive yes they're giving you're giving them x amount of salary which they will get every anywhere else so this is their fair wages but the problem is with the incentive that you are intending to give them and you clearly have this in your intention that it's not only a form of worship or a pillar of islam that you're fulfilling rather it has a devil intention behind it this makes it dubious and i hope that the zakat is accepted but definitely the reward of yours is questionable"
