  "title": "Non Muslims using Quran to say Palestine belongs to Israel? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Abdul Mateen from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Barakatu Sheikh, so many non-Muslims are quoting the words from Quran Surah Maidah, Chapter Number 5, Verse 20 to 26, to prove that Palestine belongs to Israel. What is your answer? I don't care what non-Muslims say. You as a Muslim have the Quran. Go to the Tafseer yourself. And this is ridiculous by people coming up with these questions of non-Muslims claim this, claim that. You have the Quran, you have the Tafseer, go and check it out."
