  "title": "Can we fix a gap in the teeth?",
  "transcript": "Insha says, 'I have unnecessary gaps between my \nteeth, so can I use tooth clips or tooth align   for reducing those gaps? Is this \npermissible?' First of all, the scholars   understood from the hadith of the Prophet, \n'alayhi salatu wa salam, that it is not   permissible to change the creation of Allah, \nAzza wa Jal, in order to beautify it more. But,   from the other hadiths, they have learned that \nwhenever a person has a defect or an abnormality   and it should be corrected, this is permissible. \nSo when one of the companions got his nose   chopped off, the Prophet, 'alayhi salatu \nwa salam, instructed him to put a nose of   silver. And after a few days, you know silver when \nit comes in contact with moist it gives a color   and a bad smell, so he complained to the Prophet \nand the Prophet allowed him ﷺ to take a nose   made of gold. So this is permissible because, this \nis removing a defect removing, an abnormality. And   having a gap between your teeth is an abnormality. \nTherefore there is no problem, none whatsoever,   in bridging that gap and narrowing it \nand, in shaa Allah, this is permissible."
