  "transcript": "Yusuf from the UAE Assalamu Alaikum Salam to Allah Okay, so my question is if I go to a restaurant and I don't say Assalamu Alaikum to the waiter and I give and take with my left hand like the money can I say Bismillah for the food? Is it Halal or no? These are two different things Akhi not saying Assalamu Alaikum to a waiter is a sin by itself and giving and taking the food or the money with your left hand is debatable if it's sinful or makrooh and not saying Bismillah when you eat the according to the most authentic opinion that is mandatory is a sin by itself so these are not related so you don't say Bismillahi awwaluhu wa akhiruhu except when you start eating or drinking without saying Bismillah and you remember in the middle or at the end so to rectify this sin you say Bismillahi awwaluhu wa akhiruhu but it has nothing to do with not saying Salam or giving or taking with your left hand with the waiter and Allah Azza wa Jalla knows best"
