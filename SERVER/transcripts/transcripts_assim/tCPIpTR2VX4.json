  "title": "Which deeds does Allah love best? | assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "knowledgeable first of all he said to the prophet I asked him sallallah alaihi wasallam which Deeds Allah loves best so what do we learn from this one we learn that the companions are so keen on asking what benefits them what gets them closer to Allah compare Apple to Apple what do you usually look up for what do you ask for I personally ask about the exotic cars price when it's secondhand I cannot afford to buy them brand new this is my obsession ah from 0 to 100 my car is excellent from zero to 100 half an hour very old very vintage very slow so people have obsessions of a brother has an obsession on motorbikes is it a ducatti or a Kawasaki a sister has Obsession on the latest Foundation is it waterproof is it breathable so obsessions the companion's Obsession was not like this their Obsession was what benefits me at the side of Allah what takes me to Jenna and therefore those who called me ate 10 times a week from Australia from Canada from America it costs money but they asks they ask straight questions she what's the ruling on this if I do this better or do that better I feel astonished because they want to get closer to Allah Abdullah Mas was like this so he comes to the prophet he doesn't say prophet of Allah should I buy property in Putra or in somewhere else no he wants what gets him closer to Allah so he says to the prophet which Deeds Allah loves best so the prophet lists a number of tasks one prayer two being dutiful to the parents and three Jihad in the way of Allah and Abdullah said if I asked the prophet more he would have given me more so what do we benefit from this Hadith first of all the keenness of the companions to ask for what benefits them and this is found in most of the Sunnah of the Prophet you always find a sahabi coming and asking the prophet Alam about things that are most beloved to Allah yet we find the answer varies why the scholars say because the prophet answers whenever you hear the name of the Prophet offer Salam otherwise you'll be stingy at the side of Allah anytime you hear the name of the Prophet Sall alaih wasallam you offer Salam you gain 10 Good Deeds Allah mentions you in the higher uh uh congregation and you get closer to Allah so the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam gives answer according to each one's individual one says oh prophet of Allah give me advice he said do not become angry why because the prophet knows that this guy is has a rage problem the other one says oh prophet of Allah advise me he said your tongue is continuously remembering Allah the fourth third one asks and he said help me by performing a lot of of sujud meaning a lot of prayers offer a lot of prayers and so on so what is the most dearer deed to Allah one to pray on time in another narration to pray at the beginning of the time we can go for a long time discussing this it's beneficial to know when to pray at the beginning of the time and when not to pray at the beginning of the time because some prayers delaying it is more preferred to Allah but if we get engaged in this I promise you we will not be able to finish not even one tenth of the course so let us focus on what is essential this is beneficial how many people in Malaysia pray on time I was shocked now people usually when they are asked straightforward questions they get defensive meaning you're not opening your heart when I say how many people in Malaysia pray on time defensive people say how many people in Saudi pray on time I'm the one who's preaching not You Don't Preach me I'm preaching you so don't be defensive even in Saudi Arabia they don't pray on time in Egypt in Syria in Morocco everywhere and this is why we are going downhill because the prophet told us the most important deed to Allah is your prayer and our prayer is downhill this is why everything in the Muslim world is downhill until we revive the Sunnah I was shocked to find that people are too relaxed when it comes to prayer I'm a traveler there's no Masjid I can pray anywhere and I shortened the prayer from 4: to 2 but what about the locals when they pick me from one place to the other we pass by masjids no one says let's stop and pray and maybe they delay the prayers and I see Muslims they're mallah their offices are open their shops are open the music is open where is Islam I don't know so if we can benefit from this that we put put as our objective to pray on time in congregation in the Masjid then we have gained 70% of the course if we can get this if we fail to pray on time if in the Masjid what are you doing having fun let's continue the problem is that the more you have knowledge of Allah the key you are to pray on time the less knowledge of Allah's beautiful names and attributes the careless you are this is a well-known fact now the importance of Salah is a lot we will not go into that except that you have to know in the beginning it was how many 50 5 and then Allah reduced it into five imagine that if we have to pray every half an hour that would be great for our course because we would have a break every 25 minutes but will anybody be able to do it no Allah the most generous made it five and even the five we have 40% discount F we don't pray on time we're at work this is how people are unfortunately those who do not pray at all are not Muslims if you do not pray at all not a single Salah you are a cafir even if you say muham 1,00 times a day and perform Haj and fast Ramadan and give zakat if you do not pray at all you are a c this is the prophet's fatwa not mine if you pray on and off you're a hypocrite you are a hypocrite because Allah described in the Quran in chapter 9ahba those who are lazy to pray but they pray they are hypocrites so it's a serious stuff number two uh no where is number two and after that he said no yeah oh I was following that's nice uh time said dutifulness to parents what is the meaning of dutifulness in Arabic it's called now the word to be dutiful is a very very large word with lots of meanings the majority of the people in Malaysia alhamdulillah and in Southeast Asia have this instilled in them the respect The Obedience the kindness the majority not all there are always black sheep in the family so Allah has ordered us to be dutiful to our parents even if they are cfir so regardless of the religion of the parent you must be dutiful to them now what is the sense of being beautiful first of all how important it is Allah has combined in a number of ayas in the Quran between and being beautiful to your parents Allah has ruled that you must not worship anyone other than him and to be dutiful and kind to your parents how strong would you want Allah's command to be more than this to associate it withed which is the essence of Islam which is the sole purpose of our existence is to worship Allah after that to be dutiful to your parents now Muslim families Pride on having their parents and grandparents living in their homes they fight for it I know families I know siblings brothers fighting over their mother where to stay each one says I'm worthy of her staying with me to the extent that there was a case in court in Riyad where two brothers over 70 years of age both went to the judge and complained that their mother should be with him they're fighting to have their parents with them and the people when it comes to being dutiful to your parents are three types one is the person who goes out of his way to be kind loving and obedient he does more than what they expect of him and he never says anything bad to them so this guy is the one who's beautiful now who is the one who's not dutiful the one who is not dutiful as the scholars say is the one who does his obligations to his parents and he does not harm them this is the interpretation of what people are asleep of being not dutiful did you hear hear me well a person who does his obligations I give my mother and father shelter I give them pocket money I put food on their table I never insult them I never speak rude to them I never but this is it obligations and staying away from Haram they say he is not beautiful the third type is the one who does does not do his obligations and he's insultive he's abusive he raises his voice he looks at them straight in the eye when speaking to them you know that this is a sin when you're father or mother are speaking to you and you look them straight in the eye so your father tells you why did you come late yesterday and you look at him and said I'm a grown-up man I can come whenever I want this is sinful you will go to hell because of this so now most of us are from category number two we do our obligations and we don't do any sins yet we are sinful for that what Allah tells you to do is to be extra dutiful extra respectful more than what they expect from you then you will be fulfilling Allah's command to you a man came to Abdullah Omar shivering shaking out of fear complaining to him and he said oh companion of Allah of the Prophet I did so many sins and he thinks that these sins are major sins so IB Omar asked him him are your parents alive he said I only have my mother and she's with me I Omar said are you afraid of fire do you love to enter Paradise by Allah if you speak to your mother softly and feed her food by Allah you will enter Paradise as long as you refrain from major sins this is how the companions used to treat their parents this is how they used to consider obeying the parents coming to hand are questions at the end of the session right any questions quickly okay"
