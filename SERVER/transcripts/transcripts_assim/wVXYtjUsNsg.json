  "transcript": "Diyar from Kosovo. Diyar Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. Sheikh if my dad who's not a Muslim died before me. Who? How does the inheritance work so? Who is not Muslim Diyar? My father. If your father is non-Muslim okay. How does the inheritance work or can I attend his funeral and stuff? It is not permissible for a Muslim to attend the funeral of non-Muslims. Whether they're parents, their siblings, their loved ones, it is not permissible because this or these rituals are related to another religion. As for the inheritance, the vast majority of Muslims say that it is not permissible for a non-Muslim to inherit a Muslim and it's not permissible for a Muslim to inherit a Kafir. And this is the majority of scholars. Some scholars among some companions say like Muawiyah Nabi Sufyan and may Allah be pleased with him and his father and others among the companions and great scholars like Ibn Taymiyyah say that the Muslims may inherit their Kafir parents but not the opposite. And they justify this by saying that the money would have gone somewhere else instead of the Muslims and Islam benefiting from it. And they say that we're allowed to marry their women but their men are not allowed to marry our women. So the non-Muslims men cannot marry Muslim women but the opposite is valid. And this is an issue of dispute and Allah knows best."
