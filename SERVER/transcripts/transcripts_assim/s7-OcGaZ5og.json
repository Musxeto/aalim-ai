  "transcript": "a sister says does wind or air bubbles that come out from the front passage break a woman's Woodill this is again an issue of dispute the Schaffer a school of thought and the Humber a school of thought say that this invalidates Moodle and they consider this as passing wind whether it's from the back passage or from the front passage it doesn't make any difference while the hanafi school and the Maliki school of thought say that this does not break the boodle because it does not come from the usual passage when the prophet used to talk about this is awesome and teach his Ummah to perform will do if they hear a sound or find the smell or an odor this was in regard to what was known to everyone which is what comes from the back passage from the anus this is passing wind that breaks the wood oh but what comes from the front passage of a woman this is an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion is that it does not invalidate the Woodill it does not affect a woman's purity and Elijah knows best"
