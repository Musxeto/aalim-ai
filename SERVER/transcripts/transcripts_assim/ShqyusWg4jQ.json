  "transcript": "[Music] I want to ask in my mind I think there's uh it's it's our responsibility as that individual so Allah ability but when we uh achieved or ahead of some units do you have any responsibility to to [Music] do something or to show something with them be a good example something like that so yes we are accountable only to Allah but we are humans in Social so we live within a community and we have a hierarchy so we have leaders we have supervisors we have normal people we have subordinates we have superiors sometimes as a community leader you do need to share with the people and this is why if a community leader for example does something wrong he has to justify it's not sufficient hey you're a community leader you're not praying Fajr with us why you're the Imam you're not praying Fajr so I'm a leader no your husband either they get out of here gave us the example once he was in eriticuff you know what is articaff in Ramadan Sophia the mother of the Believers may Allah be pleased with her came to visit him in the Masjid to talk to him after she finished it was night so she wanted to go home the prophet walked her home so he came from the Masjid to walk her home when two of the ansar were coming when they saw the prophet Allah with a woman they immediately changed their way why this is the way of the Arabs the Muslims they have respect they have jealousy not when they see the future of the sister they go and look they lower their gaze this is the Islamic etiquette excuse me for rubbing and end but we have to go back to Islam to the roots to the origin so the men when they saw the prophet as Islam they changed their Direction so the prophet called them wait wait this is Sofia my wife of course she was covered from head to toe so they said oh prophet of Allah do you think we will suspect that you are with someone else he said shaytan runs in your blood veins and I was afraid that he would throw something that he would take you to Hell Fire with so the community leader has a responsibility of being a role model I being a chef I have a responsibility being a role model I want to go to the movies and see a film but what will the people say oh look at Islam what how bad Islam is I will not do this because number one I fear Allah number two I don't want to tarnish the reputation of Islam so yes you have more responsibility than others and this is why yeah and it is an honor to be a leader or someone who is presentable in a community but it is a great and huge responsibility [Music]"
