  "title": "Is it backbiting if the employees talk negatively about the Management? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "aasif says that there are employees that keep on backbiting the management so what should I do in such cases first of all we have to analyze whether what they're saying is in accordance to their rights the Prophet says Allah is salat-u-salam motto Lulu honey you Hilary Rhoda who woke you betta which translates to when a rich man postpones paying back the loans he he had gotten then this gives his other side the one who lent him originally the money gives him the right to speak against him which is considered to be backbiting and to punish him through the law so if the management is doing something wrong if they're not paying the employees their wealth and employees are complaining and they're saying that look our CEO he is the owner of the company he is rich he travels worldwide but he doesn't give us our wages he doesn't give us our salaries how is this this is permissible because as Muslims were instructed to give people their wealth on the spot their salaries their wages on this part before their sweat dries at a JIRA agile publish a follicle give the laborer his wages before his sweat dries so this is something we have to do but if it's simply chit chatting and gossiping so whenever the supervisor comes they smile and when he leaves they say he doesn't know how to manage he does this he does that yesterday he told us to work on time and he came five minutes late this is totally backbiting give them advice admonish them tell them that this is how tell them that he's getting loads and loads of your good deeds because of what you're saying and if they do not listen leave them and be certain that the moment you leave they're going to back bite you as well"
