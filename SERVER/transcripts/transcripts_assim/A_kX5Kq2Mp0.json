So he chose the same spot where his camel knelt in or knelt down in. And it belonged to two orphans who gladly gave it to the Prophet alayhi salatu was salam. And the Prophet alayhi salatu was salam would not accept it. And he would give money in order to buy it from them so that it would not be a gift or it would not be anyone's favour upon Islam. And the companions started to build this masjid. And the Prophet himself alayhi salatu was salam participated in helping them, carrying bricks, banks of palm trees until it was set and built. Through the process the Prophet would chant with the companions that there is no life but the life of the hereafter. So Allah forgive the Ansar and those who migrated to them. Then this did not stop here. The Prophet established a bond between the Muslims. You can imagine when you see Muslim countries who are faced with an influx of migrants from neighbouring countries due to war, due to natural disasters. Some of the ignorant locals would feel jealous, agitated or maybe threatened. And racism may float and rise. The Prophet salallahu alayhi wasalam made pre-emptive measures to counter this. Where he established the bond of brotherhood among the Muslims. And how was that? He came to a certain number of companions from Quraysh, from Mecca, migrants. And each one was assigned to a brother of his from Medina, from the Ansar. And this brotherhood meant that they were real brothers to the extent that they would inherit one another after their death. So they were more than real brothers. And Abu Bakr for example was assigned to Kharij ibn Zayd, Abu Ubaidah was assigned to Sa'd ibn Mu'ath, Umar was assigned to Uthman ibn Malik. The well-known Abdur Rahman ibn Auf was assigned to Sa'd ibn Rabee' and their famous story of giving half of his property to his brother. And so on. They became real brothers. And this was for some time until Allah Azza wa Jal abrogated this by saying, but those of blood relationship are more entitled to inheritance. So the inheritance part was taken out and abrogated, but their brotherhood remained in all types of aspects. Now you can figure and imagine how was the community prospering from this and flourishing because of this brotherhood. No ill feeling, no enmity or hatred or envy, rather each one of them is trying to be as kind and generous to his brother. Not only that, even in the domestic arena, we know that the Prophet when he came to Medina, before Islam the Aus and the Khazraj were always fighting and some of the wars extended for years and decades and it was bloody, brutal and barbaric. So now after they all accepted Islam and they started to pray in the same row in the masjid. This went well with most of them, but what's in their chest is still in their chest. There's still or there are still feelings of vengeance and hatred. Though it's like little heat and fire underneath the ashes, but it's still there. So the smartest thing was to build a covenant of Islamic unity where the Prophet ﷺ managed to form a treaty that would relinquish and remove all types of hatred, enmity, animosity, malice and to purify the hearts of the Ansar as a group against one another. And this worked beautifully with the grace of Allah Azza wa Jal and they displayed the highest amount of brotherhood among themselves as well. After that, there came the instruction to fight and why was that? Had Quraysh left the Muslims be, they would have coexisted, nothing would come their way but no, this would never go down well the throat of the people of Quraysh. They started to threaten the people of Medina and they were very frank. They said to them, you've provided refuge to our people and we swear by Allah Azza wa Jal that we will fight you and we will march to you, all of us, and we will kill all of your men who stand against us and we will abduct and take all of your women and children as concubines and captives of war and that was a serious threat. Not only that, they also communicated with their own people who knew them well and said to their brothers, to their cousins, to their loved ones who migrated from Makkah to Medina saying to them, don't be deceived by the fact that you managed to escape temporarily to this forsaken land for we will come and we will hunt you down and we will eliminate you wherever you are. Such a threat only indicated a huge amount of arrogance that was resonating all the time since the Prophet became a Prophet ﷺ and it would never subside, it would never go down. Day by day, it's like cancer, spreads and grows. So in these difficult circumstances, Allah Azza wa Jal teaches His servants to have honour and dignity and to be proud of their conviction and to stand by their beliefs. So Allah Azza wa Jal sent down the permission where Allah says, permission to fight has been given to those who are being fought because they were wronged and indeed Allah is competent to give them victory. That's a promise from Allah Azza wa Jal and also Allah says, and they are those who if we give them authority in the land, establish prayer and give zakat and enjoin what is right and forbid what is evil or wrong. This is how Allah described the Muslims and this is exactly how the Muslims were when they take authority. No matter where you look, real true Muslims would do this. They would establish Salat and they will give zakat and they will enjoin righteousness and virtue and they would forbid and prevent evil and vice. And this is why Allah would grant them victory over anyone who opposes them."
