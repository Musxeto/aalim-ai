  "transcript": "[Music] my question is uh something happened to me recently so i was at the airport and i wanted to pray i was praying qasim so i saw someone praying alone thinking he was praying uh castle as well i joined him so when i joined him actually he was praying for prayers i joined the business card prayer my intention was to pray just to pray two records so i joined him while he was in his second prayer so i uh played three prayers with him and uh i after he said salaam i prayed my fault so is it okay for me to change my intention from castle to praying for says he was a traveler shortening prayers saw someone in the airport praying so he thought that he was praying he joined him only to discover that this person was praying for raka's so he completed his prayer is his prayer valid the answer is yes and if you did anything else it would have been invalid why ibn abbas was asked may allah be pleased with him the cousin of the prophet assalam why is it when a traveler prays behind a resident he completes his prayer and not the other way around and even said that this is a sunnah so even if i were to pray in a masjid and the people are residing the imam is a resident and i caught the last raka of the imam offers salaam should i pray one rakah because i'm shortening or another three raka's because i have to follow the imam the answer is you have to follow the imam a traveler always follows his imam if his imam is shortening you shorten if his imam is completing you have to complete you"
