  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] today's lesson is about pledges or oaths and this is something that is known in arabic as another and never and it was mentioned in the quran it is mentioned in the sunnah and it is something that a muslim obligates upon himself which allah azza did not obligate so to make such a commitment is something that a person is making his life without any justification more difficult because he's the one who's doing it and he's not obliged to do it the prophet salallahu advised us not to do pledges or oaths because these pledges or oaths will not deter will not prevent anything and would not help in anything taking place because usually when i make an oath or a pledge i do this because i want allah to do something from for me or to prevent me for some from something happening to me and whatever alms you give or pledges you make are known to allah and also allah said they are those who fulfill their vows and fear a day whose evil will be widespread be pleased with her said whoever pledges and this is hadith uh by the prophet whoever pledges to obey allah he must obey allah and whoever pledges to disobey allah azzawajal must not disobey allah now this might seem a little bit problematic to some because some people would say how is it that will not recommended to make a vow while allah praises those who fulfill their vows and the scholars answered this and they said to make a vow in the first place is not recommended the prophet said that allah when he told us that it does not bring any good he prohibited allah taking vows he said do not take vows so he prohibited it in a way but he also said that it is one of the means that allah extracts wealth from a miser and it does not bring any benefit or any good for you now if i were this miser i would have not sacrificed the goat i would have not given the poor money i would have not fasted i would not have fasted five days for allah unless i had something i wanted from allah so i say ya allah if you cure my patient i will slaughter iran and if my son passes the exam i will fast for five days so actually it is a transaction it is something that i'd like to have an exchange with allah azzawajal which is problematic because this is not the way you deal with allah however once you commit to such a pledge or a vow then you are obliged to fulfill it and you are praised for fulfilling it because you should fulfill what is a form of worship now this is providing that your pledge is halal by itself and we will get to know the types of pledges as we speak what are the conditions and the wording a pledge is valid only when a person who is sane a person who is an adult a person out of his own free choice makes such a vow is there any special formula for that no if you just say i owe it to allah azzawajal that i do such and such if you say i vow to allah i commit myself to do that for allah azzawajal anything that indicates an obligation upon yourself it becomes a vow one would rightly ask isn't it part of the conditions that the person making such a vow is a muslim and the answer is no it can also be from non-muslims and once they realize this or the condition they had set takes place then they must fulfill their vow evidence may allah be pleased with him came to the prophet and he said o prophet of allah i vowed in pre-time era in jahiliyyah that i performed one day at the caf in al haram in mecca so he vowed a form of worship but at the time he was a kafir so the prophet said to him fulfill your vow fulfill your vow now the ruling on vows as indicated earlier it is macro it is disliked to oblige yourself with something allah did not oblige you to do however some scholars went a bit further and said no it's not only macro it is actually prohibited it is haram to do this but and this is a choice of islam even may allah have mercy on his uh soul and this is his way of looking at it because he says the prophet clearly said it does not bring good it has no benefit in it and he said do not make vows so it should take the ruling of prohibition but the majority say that it is permissible yet makru disliked so there are rulings and types the five types mentioned here in the book are as followed one an open ended pledge and this refers to a person saying a vow without indicating it so he says i vow to allah i pledge to allah azzawajal and he does not mention anything so what is this this is an open-ended pledge it is just a pledge that he did not say whether i will give one dollar for sanaka or a million he did not specify al fast one day or a whole month i'll pray two rakai's or five thousand so what is the ruling on such a vow such a vow is considered a general oath and like when you swear and you break your swear and you do not fulfill your oath you have to give expiation likewise here because there is a hadith where the prophet said allah the atonement of an unspecified pledge is the same as atonement for an oath and we know that it is to feed 10 poor people from what we usually eat or clothe them or free a slave if these three things are not possible due to financial reasons in this case you may fast three days so this is number one number two a pledge in anger or in a non-argument and also such a pledge is treated as an oath what is meant by in an argument or in anger this is a form of vow that forces me to do something or prevents me from doing something and this is cascaded to others as well so if i want to force my wife to prepare the food at one o'clock in the afternoon she always is late so i say i vow to allah that i will fast 10 days if you do not put the food on the table at one o'clock so the intention here is not too fast the intention here is to force her to put the food at one o'clock and this is in arabic known as though there is no laj or anger or anything but it is used to compel and this is used with oaths and it is also used in divorce when a man says if you do not come back at 10 pm before 10 pm tonight you divorced and this is an issue of dispute and we went through this when we talked about marriages and divorces and said that such conditional divorce depends on the intention and usually it is treated as an oath where expiating it would be sufficient number three a pledge to do what is permissible and this is when a person for example pledges to play football so he says i vow to allah to play football or i vow to allah to walk from here to downtown now the action a person vowed or pledged is not a form of worship so i did not say i pledge to allah i will pray or i will give sadaqah or i will read three jesus of the quran or the likes rather i pledged to do something that is permissible not a form of worship if this is the case then a person it's up to him this whether to do it or not to do it there's no compulsion here but there is the expiation of what he had said like the expression of an oath because you should not play around or mess with such words when you bring the name of allah azza in vain number four a pledge to do what is forbidden and here someone pledges to consume intoxicants someone pledges to fornicate someone pledges to kill someone so in in in times of revenge i pledge that i will kill my father's killer in such a haram thing is not permissible to do and the prophet said as we read earlier whoever pledges to disobey allah must not disobey him so it is prohibited for you to disobey allah azza wajal now do i expect for doing that or should i not expiate for doing that this is an issue of dispute see if a person swears that he will commit a sin a lot of scholars say that he must not fulfill his oath and there is no kaffara for that and he is also most likely not accountable for it because let me rephrase that if a person swears by other than allah so someone says by christ i will go tomorrow to school and when tomorrow comes we say no you don't have to go to school he said okay if i don't go to school i already took an oath so i should expiate and feed 10 poor people the answer is no you should not feed 10 poor people because this was a haram oath to begin with it was not done in allah's name so you are sinful for taking one and you must not fulfill it nor expedite for it but if a person swears by allah to commit a sin he is obliged not to commit it and he has to offer the expiation for his broken oath is the same with a broken vow or a pledge when i pledge to commit a sin the answer is yes and finally the fifth type of vows is a pledge to do an act of worship and this is an indefinite act so someone says without any conditions without any um things demanding it i simply out of thin air say i pledge to to offer witcher every night this becomes mandatory upon him till he dies and this is a pledge to worship allah azza no strings attached and again this is not recommended because allah did not oblige you to do it allah made life easy you're the one who's making it difficult but now you've as you have committed yourself you have to fulfill it someone may pledge to do something which is already mandatory so if someone says i pledge to allah that i pray rohr on time so this becomes double jeopardy he has to pray on time because allah ordered him to do so and he has to do this as fulfilling his pledge so what's the difference here ah big difference if you did not vow if you missed rohr you would be sinful but there's no expiation with the vow you would be sinful and you would have to pay the expiation for breaking your vow the book all also goes on to say that the examples of pledges that must not be fulfilled and this is mostly common sense any pledge to do something that is forbidden constitutes disobedience to allah and must not be fulfilled this is logical so a man may vow that he would drink wine would he fulfill it yes there is no it is not permissible for him to fulfill it and if we go a little bit further and say that his vow is not only sinful but it can also be blasphemous we wouldn't be going too far why when someone makes a vow the word itself vow is a form of worship to allah the mother of maryam of mary peace be upon her when she conceived she said o i allah for you what's in my womb meaning to be a servant of yours so a vow is something that you get closer to allah by it's a form of worship when you vow something that allah has prohibited this is mocking islam so if one does it intentionally it is an act of apostasy it's like when you drink wine and you say bismillah alhamdulillah what are you doing if you know that this is a major sin and you know that allah has prohibited it yet you say in your name o allah i begin to drink and i praise you for this sin that i have just consumed this is an act of apostasy number two people may make pledges to dead people thinking that those people are close to allah and can intercede with him this is unfortunately common in some areas where the muslims are ignorant about islam if you go to areas where there are shrines there are dhargas there are graves and tombs and places to visit every year to celebrate and commemorate these disease these buried people you will find that the vast majority of such countries those who go there actually worship those in their graves i'll name some countries go to india pakistan bangladesh go to [Music] morocco sudan egypt syria iraq go to bahrain go to yemen most of these countries will go to mali go to nigeria all of these countries are dominated or at least have strong influence of the super sufis who are the grave worshipers so you will frequently and normally see people offering vows in egypt they have one of their biggest masjids and it's called hussain and one would say wow what is that hussein doing there we know that he was killed in karbala in iraq and his head was taken to syria so if we assume that they buried the body in iraq and the head was buried in syria this is why we have another masjid there what is in egypt because there is a grave and there are people who come and offer vows to such graves they slaughter sheep and offer it they put money they put gifts and this is all a test to their islam and their hate a story goes that a man for 10 years did not manage to get his wife conceived and he used to take umrah every month and ask allah in front of the kaaba and for 10 years nothing happened so a man told him to write a petition and to travel to egypt to approach the grave of al-hussein though he's not buried there but they still insist that it is his grave and to throw the petition or the request there being in a state of submissiveness and expressing your poverty nine months later the woman delivered a healthy baby boy one would say this is awkward 10 years he's been making dua to allah nothing happened and when he does this shirk he's blessed how is that this is allah's testing this is fitna so that it would be obvious those who follow the commands of allah and the teachings of allah and those who go elsewhere may allah protect us all and these graves scattered all over the muslim world unfortunately where shirk is being committed and this is what caused and called imam muhammad may allah have mercy on his soul to [Music] try to refresh islam and restore it back to its original form from the quran in sunnah based on tawheed after what he had seen of such signs of shirk blatant ship you go to sudan and you find though there are a lot of practicing sunni salafi muslims yet there are so many powers of darkness roaming the lands calling people to shirk it was reported that two men were traveling from one city to the other when their donkey died so they buried the donkey and they agreed to weep over the donkey and whenever people came and crossed by they would ask who are you weeping over and both of them they would say that this is the righteous practicing scholar of islam the monk who is this and that and they formulated lies so people who passed by started giving them money vows donations for the sake of this great scholar this great monk one of them had to travel so he bid his friend farewell and left after a year he came back and he found that the place had become a place of pilgrimage the ignorance came from all over the country to perform pilgrimage and he found his friend wearing a very expensive attire with prayer beads around his neck with a long beard and he looked different so he said to him how are you my friend how about if we go for lunch together my friend his friend replied with a way that he was not used to he said yes yes this is possible to go to lunch together but you have to first offer the greetings to the sheikh to mawlana wali allah and you have to offer some sacrifice and then we will go so his friend in shock looked at him and said are you kidding me we buried him together now you believe this lie and you want to make it against me we buried the donkey together and unfortunately it's it might not be a donkey that is in the grave but the vast majority of these places where the ignorance go and commit shirk with allah azzawajal they don't know anything about the person who was in this grave but it is how shaytaan messes with their hands may allah protect us all thirdly a person may pledge to do something to glorify a grave or a tree or some other object that imagines to have some special status also this is the same thing it is shirk to glorify to vow to a rock to a tree to whatever because allah azza said in the last or the verse before the last of suratur chapter number six say that my prayers my sacrifice which is the vows that people usually give and my life and my death is for allah the almighty who has no partners and with this i was ordered to declare and proclaim that i am among the muslims or among the first muslims and it is extremely important that people know the gravity of making such vows and it is even worse when such vows are made to other than allah azza may allah subhanahu wa protect us now we move on to the questions uh fatiha says someone had skin diseases vitalgo or vitelligo i don't know if i'm spelling it right or not i heard when they make dua they say allah protect us from this disease it's bad things to have it people say that a person who has such a disease that is because he is a bad person is it true the question is not clear but the telgo is a skin disease where you get patches of whiteness on your skin that is looking awkward as for the dua yes there is an authentic dua where the prophet would say [Music] four things that the prophet used to seek refuge in allah from so he says i seek refuge in allah from the telgo from insanity from leprosy and from all bad illnesses and this is a beautiful dua if you make it and you're having full conviction in allah azzawajal that he's the one that who would protect you from all of these then insha'allah you will be protected now if a person has this does it mean that he is a bad person and this is why allah has tested him with such an illness that is of course not we know that prophet jacob ayub peace be upon him had a similar skin disease that made people repel him and he had an illness for 18 years and he's a prophet of allah one eight years 18 and in the hadith prophet ayo peace be upon him once heard two men talking to one another about him so one was telling his friend look at prophet ayub man this illness that he's struck with he must have done some nasty things when he was young otherwise why would allah test him with such an ongoing illness and disease so prophet ayub heard them and he said to them by allah i don't know what you guys are talking about mentioning being bad when i was young or doing something haram but i'll tell you something one of the things i used to do before i was struck with this illness is when i walk down the streets and i see two men fighting and each one swearing to do something so like when you see two men fighting and one of them says wallahi i will hit you and the other says well i will never speak to you so they're taking allah's name in oaths prophet yup says to the two men i don't know what you guys say but wallahi when i pass by two people swearing at one another i return and i pay expiation for both of them for what they had said now he did not swear he did not take an oath but it shows you how much he glorified allah azzawajal that he would not hear allah's name been used in vain and in something like this without him going to give the expiation on behalf of the people who took such an oath so would anyone dare and say that prophet ayub was a bad person these are tests fatiha we are in this life to be tested and a beautiful advice was given whenever a calamity strikes if it's your choice do whatever you want and if it's allah's choice then you have to be content with allah's choice this is what allah chose for you why be anxious why be depressed why be saddened move on move forward and acknowledge that this is from allah and you will be content with the grace of allah azza says how to know that a person is being punished by allah or allah himself taking a test while they are facing hardship see whatever calamity strikes this is either a punishment or a test that leads to raising your rank in jannah erasing your sins and crediting you with good deeds how to differentiate how to tell which is which this is not possible it's not possible when something happens that we say ah this is because yesterday i did this or that or last week i missed this or that you cannot tell it can be a punishment and it can be a test and every punishment is a test but not necessarily every test is a punishment so there is no point in wasting your time discussing such things trying to find out whether it's a punishment or a test because there is no benefit from that what would benefit you is to repent from all of your sins to stop any forms of transgression to fulfill your obligations and prayer and fasting etc and then no matter what happens it would be for your own good with the grace of allah azza fareed khan says selling of cartoon t-shirt is haram note we are retailers not manufacturers now wearing mickey mouse or a picture of superman these are cartoons but they are drawings question do these drawings imitate the creation of allah answer is yes question do they prevent angels from entering the room therein answer is yes then am i sinful for wearing it and buying it and keeping it as it is yes which leads us to say that selling such t-shirts with the such characters is haram for you whether you are a retailer or a wholesaler or a manufacturer of it and allano's best uh zed zubair says what do you mean by broking during inheritance i have no idea i don't recall any such thing as ma says is adopting the baby not from relatives is a sin or crossing the limits of allah we are fulfilling all conditions of purdah and razzat etc i don't know what purdue or rezzat is but in the issue of adoption whether you adopt from your relatives or from abroad whether you adopt from your country or from other country the ruling is the same there is a difference between adoption and sponsorship or child support or whatever you call it taking a child into your custody raising it feeding it treating it as your children while keeping the name of the child and his father and his grandfather as it is while knowing that he is not a mahram to your daughters if he is a boy or to your wife when he grows up and he does not inherit anything from you as a child of yours this is totally legitimate and prohibited the prophet said i and the one who takes care of an orphan are like this on the day of judgment in jannah so there is little difference but they're so close to one another and this is how the person who caters and takes care of an orphan adoption which means that i change the paperwork and the boy becomes or carries my name and my family name and he is treated by my daughters and my wife as their brother and when i die he takes his share from the inheritance like my own sis my own daughters this is totally prohibited in islam changing the name is totally prohibited allah says in chapter 33 call them after their parents so if we don't know their parents if the child was found at the doorsteps of a masjid three or four days old in this case we give him a general name but definitely and surely not my name so sometimes the people call him according to the country so they call um for example muhammad al-masri muhammad this is the boy's name al-masri the egyptian yes it is a family name but it's also a description of a person from that country in jeddah they say al-jidawi in mecca they say in medina they say so it can be a family and it also can be referring to the city itself or to the country itself but to adopt someone to adopt someone and to give him his name to give him his inheritance to treat him as a mahram this is totally prohibited in islam malik assaf haan says his real estate job okay or haram real estate job is halal it's okay providing it has nothing haram in it so what do we mean by nothing haram in it what does the real estate agent do he goes checks all the properties the the the apartments for rent plots for sale buildings villas mansions how many rooms swimming pool tennis court etc intake surprises takes the key and whenever there is a potential buyer he takes him and show shows him the area the place and try to negotiate a good price for both parties and he takes his commission there is nothing wrong at all with such a job the haram comes when there is ribba so if a person deals in riba and he wants to take a property and he wants me to facilitate this property through a bank so that i would give him the means to acquire mortgage or an interest-based loan if this is the case this is totally prohibited because i would be facilitating the haram other than that yes working hard and and trying to make a deal and securing your commission is totally permissible and legit without any problem um dean says what are the best vicar i can do after far prayer the best zikr you could do is the dicker mentioned in the sunnah and there are so many of them and one of the easiest books that you can carry with you all the time is a small book by the name of muslim usually in arabic it's all in in in an orange color and i think in other languages it's in the same format the vast majority of the athcar there is authentic so it's a good thing to to carry it and to read from it in sha allah zaid zubair says i know of a group of muslims who say that the law of al-qisas was abolished by the prophet during [Music] is this true no this is totally bogus and there's nothing as such what was abolished during was the issue of revenge so if a killer murders someone then from the killer's tribe we need to murder someone so not the killer himself maybe the killer and someone else a child a an old person that would really hurt most so this was abolished riba was abolished in hijat but not this aspect is something that is well established in the quran in the sunnah and uh with the consensus of scholars of islam abachi says sadaka and zakat what is the difference i always get confused well don't be confused sadaka is a general term for whatever you give for the sake of allah and sometimes it is whatever you say for the sake of allah whatever you do for the sake of allah so smiling in your brother's face is a sadaqa a good word is a charity sadaqa you feed someone food you're kind to your mom and dad sadaka you give them money so it's a general term while zakat is a specific percentage taken from specific wealth money and given to specific people and these are the eight categories of zakat recipients so it is a percentage that can be 2.5 it can be 5 and it can be 10 and it can be different than that depending on the cattle on the livestock and it has a threshold and it has a time to give the cat on and it also is given to only eight types of recipients as mentioned in chapter nine surah verse 16. this is zakat and this is sadaka rook he says if i add and omit something in salah which says i do inside sallah before the salaam or outside salah after the salam so his question mainly revolves around a person who did two mistakes or more one mistake requires that he offers two prostration of sujud before salam the second mistake requires that he performs to jude after salaam so which one should he choose or should he do both no it seems that he should do the one before sallam because this is within the prayer and he did do something that requires doing it before salaam so this takes care of the one after the salaam as well and he only does this one before the salaam yusuf says yusuf siddiqui says do i have to say iqamah while i read the first allah at home the answer is no iqamah is highly recommended but it is not mandatory it is not part of the salat and it does not impact your prayer negatively which means that it will not be complete it is a separate thing it is highly recommended but it is not mandatory nish at mim says whenever i say astagfur [Music] it may calm allah's anger i have got nothing to lose to pass on is it or it's true and authentic the answer is no i don't know of any authentic hadith stating that saying this sticker would extinguish allah's anger and it would uh uh reduce it therefore you should not say it with that intention though the phrase itself is is a very good one you can repeat this as many times as you wish during the day and night and finally karima andeel says is it permissible for my brother of breastfeeding to shake hands with me you remember that we said there are conditions for breastfeeding so if the child breast was breastfed by a woman before he completed two years of age and he was breastfed five separate meals in this case he becomes a son to that woman and all of her daughters before him and after him become his sisters so karima if this boy is your mother's son through suckling with the conditions i've mentioned he is your mahram and he can shake hands with you he can be alone with you he can treat you as his own brother and allah azzawajal knows best this is all the time we have until we meet next thursday inshallah i leave you for him allah"
