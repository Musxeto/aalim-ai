  "transcript": "i want to know about ruling on saving other but harming ourselves i heard that we are not allowed to save someone if it is harming or it could kill ourselves but what if for example i'm sorry maybe this example is too extreme but i hope you can explain it we are in the plane and it is about to crash and there is only one pursuit left for me a child and a woman am i and this woman is christian or a non-muslim am i am i allowed to give it up the pressure to them or i must save my own life because i'm a muslim and he's a she's he's a christian what what if she's a muslim no i mean uh i'm asking you i'm asking you if she is a muslim and the child is a muslim and there is shaykh asam with you he is a great sheikh and he gives a lot of fatwas would you what is what is to be done no of course i will give the present to you yourself you're safe oh okay what if it is a christian uh a woman i will i will answer you i will answer you from indonesia he says that the concept of saving others while killing yourself well this is not logical and he's insisting on saving a christian woman i don't know why why isn't she a buddhist why isn't she jew why isn't she a hindu so he's saying i have one parachute the companions and the salaf whenever they were faced with hypothetical questions like this they would answer the question or by saying did this happen and the question said no they would say to him once it happens give us a call so likewise when people call and say sheikh if i am orbiting the earth how would i pray maghrib and where should what what should i face i said okay once you're up there in the orbit use your cellular phone and give me a call and ask me i'll give you an answer but not now therefore the concept itself whether she's a muslim woman or a man or a christian muslim or a man doesn't change a thing it is not permissible to put yourself in harm's way to save others because allah would ask you for this why did you commit suicide you should save yourself but this is again hypothetical and hypothetical questions you could say okay what about if this what about if that and it keeps on generating doubts and whispers in your head that do not relate to islam focus on learning the quran focus on learning the hadith focus on learning your akida and the in your religion and after that you may look into such things"
