  "title": "What if you cry in Salah due to worldly reasons? Is it permissible to close eyes in Sujud?",
  "transcript": "country let alone make Dua for that and Allah knows best um nura from Lebanon uh so my question is during prayer I sometimes or most often cry while and this happens for different reasons for example being hurt by someone remembering my sin then feeling remorseful or deeply longing for something and I also close my eyes during suud while making supplication uh so are these practices permissible and align with Sharia or not first of all first of all nura to cry during Salat due to worldly reasons is not something that is recommended or promoted to cry out of the fear of Allah out of the love of Allah wanting to go to Jenna fearing Hellfire fearing your own sins and being remorseful this is a very very good thing but you're normal you have no problem the moment you start to pray you think of a cousin who betrayed you or a spouse who cheated on you or of a parent who has oppressed you and taunted you and caused trauma for you and you start to cry because of this anger in you not because of the fear of Allah or wanting something from Allah this is totally uh unacceptable closing your eyes during sujud there's no problem in that inshallah it's best not to do it but if you do it there's no problem and Allah knows best we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back"
