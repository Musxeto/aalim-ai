  "transcript": "Finally, Ghulam says, is complaining to someone about Allah. Is it Kufr? Like saying, why did Allah do this to me? Why did He do that? This is indeed a grave sin and one of the major sins when a person is not content with the Divine Decree of Allah. And you have to understand that Allah owns literally everything in this universe. So if Allah were to throw everything in this universe, including the angels and the humans and the animals and everything else in Hellfire, would anyone have the guts to ask why or object or complain? No. We belong to Allah and to Him we shall return. So if He throws us all in Hellfire, He didn't do anything wrong. It's His own possessions that He can do whatever He wants. Hence, when someone comes and complains of Allah's decree and says that why Allah is doing this? Why Allah is doing that? This is a major sin. But if he exceeds and transgresses even further, it can take him out of the fold of Islam. When he mocks Allah or he says something that degrades Allah. In this case, he would have left the fold of Islam. May Allah protect us. So we should be patient and content because we believe and trust in Allah's wisdom, in Allah's fairness, in Allah's knowledge. And we know that He possesses everything. If He does something, it's for our own good, but we fail to see the wisdom behind it. We shall wait until we meet Him on the Day of Judgment and then everything would be clarified to us, inshallah."
