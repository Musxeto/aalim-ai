  "title": "Is it Sunnah to take a shower on the first day of Ramadan? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Momina says is it permissible to take a shower on the first day of Ramadan because in my country many people do this as it's as if it's part of welcoming Ramadan taking a shower every day or twice a day it's good it's refreshing is keeping your body clean and fresh it prevents your odor from harming others if you have one but connecting it to the first night of Ramadan and thinking that it's part of the rituals of Ramadan this makes it an innovation because this was not done by the Prophet as salam nor recommended yes if you take a shower every single day whether it is Ramadan or not there is no problem in that but thinking that I have to offer a rustle for Ramadan this is prohibited and an innovation"
