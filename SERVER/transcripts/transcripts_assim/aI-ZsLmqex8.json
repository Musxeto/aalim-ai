  "title": "What to do if I am forced watch videos at school that contain music? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "zinar from the uk says what is the ruling if we are forced at school to watch clips of videos that contain music either you can leave the room and this would not put any burden on your marks and your exams and your um learning process then you should do that or that would not be permitted and it would take off grades of you of yours and may hamper your learning process in this case there's a difference between listening and hearing hearing is something that happens without my will or intention as in the case when i go to a mall and they're blasting the music or i'm at a traffic light and the car next to me is blasting music this is hearing listening is when i give my ear to that and i'm enjoying following the lyrics trying to move my foot with the beat this is haram and the first is not insha allah"
