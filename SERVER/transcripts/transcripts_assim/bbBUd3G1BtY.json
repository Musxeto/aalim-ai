  "title": "Can a small area under the chin be visible in a womanâ€™s prayer? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Amatullah from Bangladesh. My question is, is it okay if little bit area under the chin is visible in prayer of a woman? If I cover that area then my khimar gets loose and may show my hair. Also because our mouths move while reciting the Quran, little bit area under the chin becomes visible. All the scholars say that what is permissible to be shown of a woman during prayer are her hands and her face. Now the area, the face, is ending here. So this is where your khimar should be covering. But if it goes down here and I can see underneath your chin and part of your neck, this is awrah exposed. Some of the sisters may try to make it this tight. If it's possible, that's good. But sometimes it just goes and covers their noses and disturbs them in their salat to the extent that the whole four rak'ah of salat, they are distracted from the essence of the salat by focusing on, oh is it here, is it there, is it fine, can anyone see part of my lower chin, etc. Which is what shaitan wants. So you have to do your due diligence. Try your level best to wear the headscarf that is already pre-tailored and fixed so that it would only expose your face. And a little bit would be negligible and forgiven inshallah, not to the extent that it shows your lower chin and part of your neck and Allah knows best."
