  "transcript": "see this is the problem when you don't abide by Islam I don't have this problem of loving someone who doesn't love me everybody loves me but I don't have this problem because I don't sit with my mother I don't give them the chance to love me or I love them back or relationships this is how I'm in Islam I do not sit with my own cousins so I don't communicate with them on WhatsApp not that I am anti-social no my male cousins their brothers I speak with them and I talk with them and I mix with them but this is what happens when you don't abide by Islam and this is what we mentioned that you will have a depressed life because you turned your back to Allah if you filled your heart with the love of Allah you will learn how would a person feel jealous of others falling into sin I could not understand this foreign this world is categorized for four types of people number one a man whom Allah has given wealth and knowledge so he's using his knowledge in what pleases Allah in spending the wealth in what pleases about amen who Allah gave him knowledge but did not give him wealth so he says if I had the wealth of number one I would do exactly like him the prophet says they are in the same level of reward with what intention he doesn't have money but he has knowledge so he says if I had money I would have done exactly like him build Masjid give charity like the third one amen whom Allah did not give knowledge but gave wealth so this man having birth girlfriends having Haram income enjoying life going here and there so it's basically correct the Fourth Man Allah did not give knowledge and did not give wealth so he says oh if I had the money this man had I would have done this and this and this and this exactly like him the prophet said they are in the same level of sin just because you intended it so I can't understand how does someone see Haram and wish I wish I could do this"
