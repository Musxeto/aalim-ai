  "transcript": "Ahmed from Nigeria he's asking what's the ruling on praying behind a person of innovation Innovation are divided into two types innovations that do not nullify your Islam such as believing in the M celebrating the middle of Shaban celebrating the night the uh of Ascension uh is on the 27th of rajab um saying uh uh Dua and supplication in congre ation after the Salah a number of the these are Innovation that do not nullify your Islam because they have nothing to do with the AA in terms of nullifying it but there are innovations that nullify your Islam so if someone prays to the the the dead like in tumbaku for example Mali it is astonishing how the international criminal court the United Nation the UNESCO are condemning the demolition of tombs they believe that 333 Saints protect tumbaku and in Islam this is Major shik this is kufur this is disbelief this nullifies your Islam if you believe that a human being let alone a a dead person in a grave can protect you from Harm's Way and they condemned this they were outraged by demolishing few Stones while in Burma the heres and in arakan in Syria all the atrocities all the killings it's okay it's an issue of dispute among Scholars but when it comes to Stones the things that go against our religion against oured Subhan Allah they all collaborate to defend these false shrines that go against Islam so if a person like this is a person who prays and calls for calls the dead or if he believes that jel can descend and give Revelation to other after the prophet Alat he's a cafir this man is a cafir he's not a Muslim anymore so you definitely cannot pray behind him but if he does not nullify his Islam with his Innovation you may pray behind him but it is not recommended"
