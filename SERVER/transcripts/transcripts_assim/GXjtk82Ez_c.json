  "title": "Revert children are tortured by their parents for embracing Islam, what to do?",
  "transcript": "Yunus from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaikumussalam Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh, in almost all democratic or non-Muslim countries Sheikh, we hear many cases where parents have reverted, tortured them, with the fact that their children had reverted to Islam. We actually hear their torture given to their children. In such case, we as being neighbours to them, should we settle the matter by talking to them, where I think they will not listen to us, or should we complain to the police against such cruel parents, and I doubt the case may get more worse. What should I do in such cases? JazakAllah Khair. Wa Jazakum. In such cases, Zaki, you should refer to the scholars of your country. They know the legal system, they know the social network that's happening, and the implication, the consequence of any action to be taken. I cannot give you my own opinion, which might not be based on facts, and then it may lead to something that is worse to that individual, or to the community at large. So my advice would be to go and check with the scholars of your country, the real practising knowledgeable scholars, InshaAllah they'll give you an answer to that, and Allah Azza wa Jal knows best."
