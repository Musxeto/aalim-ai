  "transcript": "my question is uh regarding having a a clothing brand and the website would it be permissible to have male models or should you uh just show from the Torso or from the neck down male model modeling is permissible providing there is no FNA there is no exposed so if a male model wears a suit there's no problem in that and if he wears something and exposes for example his chest or back or uh body parts no this is totally inappropriate and not permissible and Allah Knows Best"
