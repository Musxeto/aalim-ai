  "title": "Can non muslims revert 2 Islam by saying shahadah only in English or native language Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh yes sir when i saw on social media some people there some non-muslim they are taking shahada in different languages like in english and other languages is this is not innovation shahada is something that is found in islam like the quran like the words we say in the salat without saying the proper wordings your salat would be invalid if someone stands in prayer and says allah is the greatest his salat is invalid if someone recites the fatiha in english his salat is invalid and likewise to say the shahada you have to say it in arabic now what you've seen most likely is the translation and this is what we usually do when someone from the west or from china wants to accept islam and i say to him and he repeats it behind me not knowing what it means i have to explain it to him in arabic in in his native language or in english so that he would relate what he had just said so that what he had said must be done with conviction so what you've you've seen is most likely a translation but this doesn't work without the arabic he has to say the arabic and allah knows best"
