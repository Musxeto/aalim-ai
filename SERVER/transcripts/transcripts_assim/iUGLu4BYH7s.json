  "transcript": "Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Solera Mannerheim hamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa Abdi he Wallace or Academy nabina muhammad in why allah alayhi wa sahbihi ajma'in welcome to listens in fill last time we stopped at hadeeth number 59 and today we're going to go on to hadeeth number 60 so whose turn is it brother Mustafa narrated Ana's may Allah be pleased with him the prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam saw a man there was a place as much as the nail on his foot and water did not touch that place he the prophet salallahu alaihe wasalam said go back and perform ablution well now this hadith was narrated by anise anise eben Malik the companion of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam this guy's story is is out of this world he was just a kid when his mother by any chance any of you knows his mother's name okay I thought not this is another problem but that we should solve and try to solve pretty quickly this is our heritage these are our superstars whom we learn from them how to live have to be actual muslims Ana's mother is almost filleting and she is from Medina and this companion of the prophet alayhi salat WA Salam she has another story and then we gone to tales and stories and so on and we could you know drift far away from our topic but it's essential almost Elaine when the Prophet Allison Sam came into Medina she brought her kid anis and she told him Oh prophet of Allah this child will serve you wherever you go and whatever you do he is your humble servant and she was very very wise in doing this he did not pay Anna's of course but she wanted the blessing of Allah to be with Anna's she wanted Anna's to learn from the prophet alayhi salatu salam he accompanied the prophet for ten whole years he stayed with the prophetess and for ten years in his house when he traveled so he reported to us lots and lots of hadith and of course by that he became one of the scholars of Islam because he was so close to the prophet alayhi salatu salam he taught us a lot of the Sunnah and he talks about himself he says that I've accompanied the Prophet is also up for ten whole years never ever the prophets Allah Salim spanked me abused me never ever the prophet alayhi salatu salam told me why didn't you do this and that for something I didn't do and never ever the Prophet SAW seldom asked me why did you do this for something that I have done the Prophet was easygoing sallallaahu Selim he wasn't rough he wasn't tough he was so kind and I says I never touched any skin softer than his palm whenever he shook hands with him and it says I never smelled any bad odor or scent from him sallallahu Salim though they were poor they did not well actually they were not poor in the sense that they didn't have anything they had anything and everything they wanted the Prophet as a Salaam yet he lived as a humble prophet of Allah Ana's bin Malik whenever you hear the name it has to click because he is one of the greatest companions of the Prophet he is the the servant of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam and the prophet sallallaahu l'm when almost relay brought her child to him and she asked him to be his loyal servant the prophet sallallaahu I said embrace his hands and he prayed and said o Allah grant him long life grant him lots of wealth and grant him many children Anna says he was among the very last of the companions to die he said that I have buried almost a hundred of my descendants Allah Dajjal has blessed his children and his grandchildren and he was one of the wealthiest companions of the Prophet Allah said I'm due to the that a supplication that or that prayer that the Prophet Allah said I'm made for Anna's going back to the hadith Anna's may Allah be pleased with him reported to us narrated to us that the Prophet SAW a man and this man had as big as a nail it's a very tiny spot that was not washed while performing ablution the Prophet told this gentleman told his companion to go back and perform ablution again because his prayer will not be valid unless he performs perfect and complete evolution and this leads us to another point which is a lot of the painters if you paint a house or paint a wall or a door or whatever sometimes you get stains of paint on your skin and the prayer has been called for so you go perform ablution the paint doesn't go you have to remove it with a thinner whatever with gasoline or whatever but you don't do this and you pray is your prayer valid no it's not why because you did not complete your ablution likewise the sisters that wear minoccurs under or near their nail polish I say we think I don't know why they do this you know will you look at the people from the West lady from the West either get long fingernails and they put the red polish as if they're beasts you know just finishing their praise and putting their nails and then their necks and eating them alive I don't know why Muslims do this okay the Westerners may have a reason or two behind this but why would the sisters do something like this prolonging making your nails long in Islam is forbidden the Prophet salah salem told us that is it's part of nature to you know trim and chop your nails and not having them long so that they would not allow dirt to be under them nevertheless it's not a topic yet the sisters that wear nail polish if they want to pray if they want to perform ablution they have to remove their nail polish otherwise their ablution is void and it's not acceptable so the hadith tells us that we have to cover all the limbs mentioned in the Quran and in the Sunna while performing ablution with water if we skip a small portion a tiny small bit this is unacceptable if you pray and you recall it or remember it or see it then you have to pray again you have to remove it and perform ablution again and this can be imagined in cases of people working in their offices and using the liquid paper and while using it then they put the arm on the paper without noticing and then there's a an area of their arms that is covered and the water cannot penetrate it and they perform ablution they perform prayer and after they finish the prayer look at their arms and oops they find it they have to remove it perform ablution again perform the same prayer they performed a while ago once again because it was not accepted this was hadith number 60 hadeeth number 61 narrated Ennis may Allah be pleased with him alles prophet salaallah alayhi wasalam used to perform ablution with the wood of water and wash with a saw up to five woods okay this hadith we talked about it previously but there's no harm in talking about it again the prophets are seldom used to perform ablution using wood what is mud now measurements are either done by weight or by size so we have kilograms or pounds in weight and we have leaders in size so the prophet salallahu alayhi wa sallam used to perform ablution using mud one would and this is a unit of measuring the size and scholars say mud is whatever is gathered in the hands of a normal normal person so whatever I can gather in my in the palms of my hands a normal person why do you say normal person we don't want to get someone from the NBA that holds a basketball with you no tip of his fingers and say this is a mood this is six liters man I'm talking about a normal person I don't want to get anyone from a that has tiny hands and then this is a mood this is not even enough to drink no a normal person whatever gathers in a normal person's hands this is called a mood so the Prophet used to pray excuse me used to perform ablution with a mood now if I put water here and try to put it in the glass it would probably fill 3/4 of it this this big made a little bit less this is the amount that the Prophet Salla solemn used to consume in woudl and evolution it resembles the amount we use right wrong definitely wrong we consume approximately like three to four liters when we perform ablution we turn on the faucet and we start performing ablution and it takes lots of lots of water people saying people talk people chat while performing ablution the water is running and this is forbidden the amount that the Prophet used to use that is awesome was 3/4 of a normal glass I would and he used to perform total bath he used to take a total bath or a shower it's not a shower didn't have any showers but he after sexual after sexual impurity after intercourse or wet dreams or whatever and eternal emissions the Prophet used to audience asam take a total bath and he used to consume 4 to 5 woods so imagine 4 scoops to five scoops of water which is not more than three quarters of a liter let's say a bottle one liter of water he used to wash his whole body we consumed more than 10 liters at least and this shows you how far we're drifting from the Sunnah one would say well we have rivers we have reservoirs we have dishonour nation plants so why consume the answer would be because it is the Sunnah of the Prophet that is all Salaam we should do this we should try our best to consume in our lives not out of stinkiness neither but out of appreciating water appreciating the blessing of Allah Azza WA JAL and by the way this is the call worldwide for reducing the consumption of water for preserving the water resources and this was done at the time of the prophet alayhi salatu salam almost fifteen centuries ago and now people are calling and requiring this we have a short break stay tuned and we we'll be right back inshaallah questions that bother you what about issues of concern to you would you like to share things on your mind with us are you interested in solutions based an Islamic perspective please join me live in meet your advisor every Friday at 9 p.m. Mecca time here Oh Oh Salam alaikum o Allah and welcome back to lessons and fill we start by talking about the amount that the prophet alaihi Salam used to consume when performing ablution and this was wood whatever is gathered in the hands of a normal person and he used to perform total bath also using four to five moods and this is called SAR and SAR is for wood so this is the meaning of saw and I as I said that this is the prophet's way of doing it what we're doing in our bathrooms turning on the showers and you know showering for about five to ten minutes and consuming so much water this is completely in not in accordance to the pseudonym one would say so would you like me to bring the water in a bucket in a small bucket or a liter of water and then well if you can do this it will be fine that's good straight consume you to be conservative using water and the consumption of what it's it's straight but it's not that practical nowadays so if you're gonna shower try to minimize the amount you use as much as possible and try not to sink and during that because it's it may prolong your showering process this is highly 61 hadith 62 is my honor him narrated by Omar or jalaw annum Allah's prophet sallallaahu salam said if anyone performs the ablution completely then says i testify that there is no god but allah alone who has no partner and i testify that Muhammad is His servant and apostille the eight gates of paradise will be open for him and he may enter by whichever of them wishes in another version also added Allah put me among the penitent and put me among those who are purified this hadith is a great hadith it tells us it teaches us how to supplicate and again we come back to the current situation of Muslims worldwide they are drifting away from the Quran and Sunnah if you notice that Islam has governed all aspects of our life it tells us what to say when we wake up it tells us what to say when we enter a toilet it tells us what to say when to eat when a ting tells us what to say when we go out of our houses ride in our cars come back every single action of our life we have a supplication to say one would say why the complication why so many things there are no complications none whatsoever this connects you with your Lord connects you with Allah Azza WA JAL instead of singing or chanting you do these supplications to feel that you are a servant of Allah to gain the support and guidance of Allah and then you are protected you are ensured by the divine power and that is one of the things that the Prophet teaches us ra his salat WA Salam he tells us you performed evolution what should you do well pray know after you finish ablution there is a gift from Allah Azza WA JAL what is that gift ablution itself is a gift because it cleans your limbs now how many times do we wash each and every limp mentioned in the ablution process we wash it minimum of five maximum of 15 because we pray five obligatory prayers today so if I'm going to perform ablution for each and every prayer I'm either going to wash my arms face and feet once or three times so it's either 5 or 15 times per day imagine this I remember once I read it somewhere god knows where that Muslim student was preparing his PhD and his professor was a non-muslim they were living in a European country so once this student asked for permission to perform ablution so the teacher professor showed him the tub where he would perform ablution so the guy started performing ablution and when it came to his feet he raised his feet and washed his feet in this tub so the professor was outraged said how dare you wash your feet in the same place I wash my face every morning and because they're not used to this so the student smiled and said professor how many times do you wash your face I said I wash it every single morning once said professor I wash my feet 15 times a day which do you think is cleaner so Islam is a religion of purity and cleanliness it teaches us that if we benefit out of it but it tells us perform ablution we are benefiting we're cleaning ourselves so is there any added value the Prophet says yes after you finish you say this supplication what is this supplication can you read it again sambar please I testify that there is no god but Allah alone who has no partner and I testify that Muhammad his servant and apostille the eight gates of paradise will be open for him and he may enter by whichever of them he wishes now this application is that that difficult is it is the testimony it's the Kalima it's the word that by saying it you become a Muslim and it's very easy you testify that there is no God worthy of being worshipped except Allah who has no partners and 99.9% of all denominations believe this who created the earth and the heavens they would say God Allah Lord whatever but they mean the same entity la ilaha illa llah now they drift and divert when they say well he has a son he has a wife he has a father that but they all believe that it is the only one he is the one who created earth and heavens who created us so we testify this this is the first part that most of of humans believe and share that there is no god but Allah and that is why when they are in crises when they have a problem they don't go to graves they don't go to tombs they don't go to worldly things without even feeling it their hearts go upwards to the heavens they cannot imagine who they're calling but they know they know that he the Almighty is a supreme power that could take them from whatever problems they are encountering or facing ash'hadu an LA ilaha illallah wahdahu la sharika lah has no partners and then you testify that the Prophet Muhammad sallallaahu Selim is His slave and messenger he's not only his messenger he is his slave he's a human being who was sent to us like David Solomon Moses Jesus Adam Abraham Noah all the messages of love Allah he is one of the chain of messages and prophets of Allah okay what happens if I do this three easy is it simple Allah Allah messenger say says that the eight gates of heaven of paradise is open for you and you may enter which one of them you wish now of course not the military die when you die as a Muslim as a believer because you used to say this Allah so L will open the gates of heaven for you and you will enter from any of these gates how many gates does heaven have it has eight gates how many gates does he'll have it has seven gates and we hope and show Allah that none of us none of our viewers of course will get to know anything about Hell inshallah we will try our best to be in heavens and in heavens alone so if you say this supplication if you say this testimony after will do you are accredited that inshallah you'll get the chance to enter any of them eight gates and we're told previously by the Prophet Isis um that one gate is for those who pray the other gate is though for those who perform pilgrimage the third one is for those who make jihad the one is specially and specifically called a raion for those who fast so there are different gates for different sort of peoples that are known to do things and Allah Azza WA JAL would grant them to enter paradise through this particular gate due to their worships and Abu Bakr Abu Bakr also there the first caliph of Islam was given the the good tiding of the Prophet Isis am that he is among the one that may enter from any gates he wishes to may Allah be pleased with him and at the end of the hadith also there's an addition and another version where a person says o Allah make me among those who repent and among those who are purified and a Muslim always repents one would say of what I don't have any sense I don't drink I don't fornicate I don't kill people I don't steal well yet still you sin and the minimal sin that any of us could do is not to appreciate a Las blessing so if you look at something that is Haram using the gift of sight then you are sinning if you if you do not look at Quran but you don't appreciate this gift of and blessing of Allah you are sinning that is why our prophet sallallaahu Salim used to ask Allah for forgiveness 70 times in one sitting 70 times this is more than what we do in a month's time probably yet he always asks Allah for forgiveness he repents to allah azza wajal not necessarily from doing sense but you repent from not perfecting whatever worship you are doing that is why a Muslim always have this thing at the back of his head that I'm a sinful person but I trust a lot forgiveness that is why I'm thankful I'm grateful I'm going to do a lot of good things I'm going to supplicate I'm going to pray I'm going to be a good citizen and then if you die you die as a good citizen and a good Muslim and this is why we should always keep this in our minds that we should all the time supplicate to Allah and know the Sunnah and what the Prophet used to do and what the prophets are seldom used to say and by doing this you may enter paradise because ask yourselves why am I on this earth what's the reason of my creation to get my BA master's PhD to get married to have family then what then die then what is either heaven or hell so let's start from the very end from the last thing which is your destination it's heaven insha'Allah you have to work hard for it and the things that enables you to enter heavens are these things mentioned in the hadith if you supplicate say a shadow and Leila hello hello la sharika lahu al mohammed abdul rasul allah madad limit there will be no January if you supplicate this whether it's in Arabic English Tagalog French whatever whatever you say say it believing that you are communicating with Allah that knows all languages Allah subhana Allah will grant you what you're seeking what you're looking for which is paradise I think that this is all the time we have for today's program until we meet next time via Manila was Salam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh"
