  "title": "Including your deceased loved ones in your Sacrifice (Udhiya / Qurbani) - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "the Sunnah is to slaughter one now if someone says I'd like to include my parents and dog hair so I'm slaughtering two more ramps for my father and mother who are deceased we say that this is not from the Sunnah include them in your own sacrifice with your family so one sheep does it or one goat does it he says no no but I have a lot of money I'd like to do this the sky is the limit go ahead no problem but to think that is mandatory or it's highly recommended the answer is no it is not the Prophet only did one for himself and his family I serve and one for his Ummah those who are unable to slaughter will have their share in sha allah azzawajal but it is wrong to go all the way in saying that this is prohibited no this is holid what is prohibited and an innovation is to slaughter something specifically for the Prophet al-assad sana this is totally prohibited none of the companions had ever done in this nor the Tapani nor tablet a being and this is foolish because anything that you do among the good deeds the Prophet will be automatically accredited for it insha Allah"
