  "transcript": "consider subscribing muhammad from the philippines inshallah tomorrow i will start here our face-to-face classes in our university and it is a mixed university and i'll be taking the course of basic biology so my question is can you give me some advice in the start of my question which will increase my iman and where to allah muhammad from the philippines says tomorrow my university starts and it's going to be offline so i have to go to the campus i have to go to classes i have to mix with other students males and females so what advice would you give me it's the normal advice we give to all people in all different professions number one and don't fear the people meaning implement sharia in your life so whatever you do you're doing it according to sharia you're doing it according to the quran the sunnah with the understanding of the three favorite generations having said that you're not a robot so you just don't say i am going to do this according to the sharia no you have to have diplomacy you have to have wisdom you have to have fair preaching it's not like oh i saw something shariah says i have to uh uh forbid evil and i have to go and forbid it with my hand i have no other alternative i'm not going to be afraid of anyone and you go and crack the place up or destroy things or beat people up what is this i was uh implementing sharia no you weren't you know you weren't you have to have knowledge you have to have wisdom you have to have perseverance before you attempt such a thing so be really careful of what you interpret to be sharia or not and when to implement it and not so you have to always assume that the prophet is allah teaching you and guiding you am i doing this according to the sunnah if the prophet were here would he have done this or not bearing in mind that he was 13 years in mecca and he never raised a sword or did anything to provoke the disbelievers against him so you have to balance things according to the circumstances and the different situations go to the university be like everybody else nobody's watching you don't feel inferior that oh i'm a muslim everybody is watching me because i'm different no nobody knows that you're a muslim even if you wear that muslim attire and your pants or trousers are below your ankle and you have a beard everybody else has this no problem be confident of yourself lower lower your gaze don't free mix with the opposite gender don't mix with the disbelievers openly but have normal relationships good morning morning how are you doing good day oh it's going to rain normal stuff don't hang out and become best friends try to choose practicing muslims to be with all the time when you go to class and there is a need to uh maybe the teacher is a female look through them don't look at them meaning that you don't look and start to visualize and take the measurements and fantasize no look elsewhere look at the writing on the boards but don't look at the teacher herself because islamically you have to lower your gaze if they're addressing you don't look them in the eyes look beyond them so now i'm as if i'm looking at you but i'm not looking at you i'm looking behind you i'm looking at what's behind you and you can't see that you think i'm looking at you which i'm not this is something only allah can see and know of you and be kind to people always deal with them with their with islamic etiquette of generosity of being courageous of being polite and helping and inshallah you'll be fine you"
