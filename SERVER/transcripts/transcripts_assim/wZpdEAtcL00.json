  "title": "How should a Traveler Pray behind a resident Imam, Shorten or Full and Vice Versa? - Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "he has a confusion and he says basically the Sunnah and I mentioned this before if a traveler prays and imam is a resident and a man prays for rak'ahs it becomes compulsory for the traveler to complete so even if I come late three rak'ahs late and the Imam has only one Drakkar to complete so I join him in the fourth raka he sits for two jihad he offers Salam and then I stand up to complete my prayer I must as a traveler pray three more Rakas and this is backed up by a hadith where I belong our best may Allah be pleased with him was asked why is it when a traveler prays behind a resident he completes his prayer and not shorten it it's not shorten it even a best said this is the son my nephew meaning that this is not from my own opinion this is what the prophet alayhi salat wa sallam told us to do and hence you have to comply now the opposite does not take place meaning that if the Imam is a traveler he prayed two Rakas offered Salam why does the resident continue because this is again the Sunnah whenever the Prophet used to lead prayer Allah salatu salam he used to say assalamu aleikum wa rahmatullah atomo salata come for in oman suffer continue your prayer Jonnie stand up and pray the remaining two Rakas because we were travelers so he did not tell them sit two is enough because you remember the traveler and a large ocean knows"
