  "title": "Is it permissible to eat food on which Fatiha has been done? #Assim #assimalhakeem assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "in my region some people recite three and thees and then blow on food which they call performing fa and then they distribute the food is it permissible to eat such food if it give if they give it to me or at my home such food will not change permissibility just because they read read something on it so this green tea with me if someone comes and recites kufur or shik things in it which I don't believe it wouldn't become NIS or Haram because it is in essence Halal so what they recite is an innovation is a sin by its own but this does not change the nature of the food therefore if you're not with them in the Gathering and they recited the three and the fat f three times and they gave you halal food you can consume that without any problem"
