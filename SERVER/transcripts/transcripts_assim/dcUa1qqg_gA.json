  "transcript": "we have from the UK today said allah sheikh i want to ask you what should we do you shall been pressured to shake hands with the opposite gender if you're not saying such a situation but i feel it may happen in the future if you pressured by opposite gender to do what to shake hands okay any more question okay so she hub is saying that i fear that i may be put in a situation where the opposite gender would force me to shake hands and this happens in kafir countries where they don't have any restrictions so you would go to a meeting a woman would extend her hand for you to shake hands with so he's saying that i this is haram in my religion i know that in the authentic hadith the Prophet said that is awesome it is best for you to be stabbed in your head with a needle of steel rather than to touch a woman who is not permissible for you so now he says I'm forced okay you are not forced unless there is gunpoint when you're at gunpoint this is forced so you have to have the pride in your religion you have to be proud of it when you are committed to it you simply tell people I can't shake hands or when you see a woman coming and you know that she's gonna reach out and try to shake hands with you you just do this and greet her from a distance and take a step or two back but in worst case scenarios you simply say I apologize I'm sorry but my religion prevents me from shaking hands with women out of respect or whatever some people may even joke about it but this is not recommended you have to hold your ground and say that this is not permissible and reverse it imagine if your wife or your mother was forced by a man who wanted to shake hands with them would you allow her to do that and what about if you were in Spain for example they don't shake hands they kiss on the cheek so then what you say I was forced Wow no you have to hold your ground so you have to be proud of your religion and not feel ashamed of it because this is the religion of allah azza wajal [Music]"
