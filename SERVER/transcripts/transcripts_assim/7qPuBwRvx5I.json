  "transcript": "yeah uh my questions are related to the Quran especially the reason viral activities in Sweden the burning of the Quran and my question is how we as a Muslim react to that should we hit the street and do a side do a demonstration or so we just do nothing about it and according to the Quran what we as a Muslim should react to that activity should we like try to fight it or should we do something about it two days ago or three days ago who's counting Sunday I think I did a lecture in at 10 weird Masjid in Jakarta about this topic so I will refer you to the lecture but in a nutshell I don't see dogs in Jakarta do you have dogs I don't see dogs but if you go to any European country they love their dogs like their children and if you walk some dogs May bark at you when a dog barks at you will you fall on your hands and knees and bark back why not because he's a dog and I am a better person if someone bullies you and says you're from the United States for example what is he expecting a negative reaction so if I become angry and what are you doing you're this you're that he wins I lose but if I ignore him and let him speak speak speak and I just give a big smile check my WhatsApp messages and after 10 minutes he will feel ashamed of himself he will feel silly what am I doing everybody else would say martial the chef is very patient very wise this man is crazy not you of course so what should we do with Sweden now Sweden Germany America Terry Jones was in America then he went to Canada you know the priest Terry Jones big mustache he burned the Quran he did no problem Holland they're doing this are this or is this the norm of all Swedish people no this is one or two and by the way the one who burned the Quran is from Iraq he's not Swedish he's a refugee but he wants to kiss ass excuse my friendship because he wants to become Swedish a citizen so what he does he insults Islam he insults the Quran so what is our reaction number one yes we are angry number two our anger has a limit we don't go to the streets because in Islam demonstration and protest is Haram this is the greatest Scholars of our time said it's Haram some people say oh Sheikh is from Saudi he's afraid they'll protest is Haram because they will put him in jail no I'm not afraid I'm in Indonesia and from me then it's called My My Hometown so I'm not afraid I say what Allah tells me to say as an obligation I don't fear governments yes if it's going to put me in trouble I will shut up but I will not say falsehood if they if they come and say clap and say good no no I'm not going to say this either I say the truth 100 or I keep silent so Protestant demonstration according to Islam is Haram so many times you make a demonstration the FBI the CIA the KGB the government the authorities put five or ten drug addicts they give them money burn kill attack police destroy property and then they accuse all Muslims if I want to close this Masjid what do I do one demonstration and I put one bad person with and he attacks a police car five minutes later the police will come and close the machine why because so this is what they have been doing in Europe 9 11. what did 911 do totally eradicated Islamic dawah because they wanted to curb down all Islamic organizations Islamic centers made the opposite people started accepting Islam people have read the Quran this burning of the Quran in Sweden what happened people now reading the Quran the Swedish people are saying what is Quran making this fuzz Kuwait is very positive they said okay you insult the Quran we print 100 000 copies in Swedish so now they're printing a hundred thousand copies of the Quran in Swedish and they're giving it to Sweden what is our role number one social media expose them say subhanallah you're insulting the Quran but you're promoting lgbtq one one XYZ why you are insulting the Quran and the hijab and the Islam number three us as Muslims who elected the government the Swedish people who elected the court judges that approved and gave the green light to burn the Quran the Swedish people so the Swedish people has the power to change because you have the power I will buy caught your products I will not buy anything Swedish this is what they understand money so I have English American Chinese I can buy from any country but not from Sweden when they feel that they are suffering economically then they will come and say we apologize we will not allow this insult of the Quran or the burning of the Quran then inshallah we would have been positive but demonstration attacking burning destroying this is not from Islam"
