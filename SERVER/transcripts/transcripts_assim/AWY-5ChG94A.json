  "title": "Is it Haram to distant herself from her family as they oppress her for practicing the religion",
  "transcript": "raluca has a question and says i am a new muslim living in a non-muslim country and a very oppressive country towards muslims her family is also against muslims and is extremely difficult for me to practice my religion i'm in a situation that i cannot live on my own without my parents help when i pray my mother always shouts and curses me and it hurts me very much i love my family but i wish to be far from them in order to practice freely my religion is this haram that i wish to be distant from them actually it is not haram to have such a wish because as you've stated you love your parents you love your family and the only reason for you to have such a wish is because of the way they are treating you so this wish only came up because of their abuse to you sort of to speak and because of their treatment and because of your mother's uh shouting and cursing you whenever you pray now because you do not have the means to migrate or to move into a better situation the thing i i would advise you to do is that you stay and remain with your parents they can take good care of you they would not let anything harm you it is much better than moving to a friend's house or to a relative's house or to a campus or whatever thinking that you would be able to practice your religion freely but in the other hand you don't have someone to take care of you so i believe that you should try your level best to be kind to your mother and to your father be obedient when she curses when she shouts as if she did not say anything try not to pray in front of her so that she would not go to such a level and always remember that you are in jihad what you're suffering and what you are uh tolerating allah will reward you for that but you have to be respectful tolerant and obedient to your parents until allah makes a way out for you"
