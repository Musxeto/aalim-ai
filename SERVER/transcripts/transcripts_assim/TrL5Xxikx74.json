  "transcript": "so our parents strictly forbid us from sharing our problems with outside our nuclear family so that we don't tarnish their good names however when problems continue to drrive on and all communication attempts fail we often feel hopeless against the Dilemma we face between trying not to upset our parents and the difficulty in communicating it causes extreme emotional distress as we are immediately labeled disobedient without chances to explain ourselves so the question is would we betraying our parents if we finally decide to seek help from others because by doing that it would inevitably make us expose some of our parents shortcomings I understand that your parents may not want your domestic problems to be disclosed to others especially those who are related to them who are within their closed Circle and this is logical but but what's not logical is that they expect you not to discuss this with anyone at all and this is not normal and not acceptable you sometimes need to vent you sometimes need to seek counseling from someone who's El older someone who's wiser someone who's more experienced in life and this can be done with distant relatives like uncles or uh great great uncles or grand uh uh uh parents this can be done through Consulting the Imam of the Masjid your local Imam someone you trust someone who has no knowledge of your parents and you don't have to tell them that these are my parents but to block you from disclosing or discussing even your problems with others no this is not logical in you are not considered disobedient if you go and choose the right people that would cause the least harm if they were to know that this was coming from your parents and Allah Knows Best"
