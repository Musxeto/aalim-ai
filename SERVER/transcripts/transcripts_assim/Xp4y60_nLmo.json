  "transcript": "from Brother Muhammad is the Hadith whoever dies on Friday or a night before Friday will be safe from the punishment of the Grave authentic this Hadith was narrated byi and others and was authenticated by she Al albani may Allah have mercy on his soul and hence as we are layman in the field of Hadith we follow Al albani most of the time in his authentication of the Hadith and therefore we say that this Hadith is authentic now some Scholars said that this Hadith is not authentic and they based their allegation upon logical Concepts in the sense that they say if a person dies on a third Thursday or a Saturday this is not in his hand no one chooses to die on a specific day and gets what he desired therefore what is the benefit of dying on a Friday where you would be Exempted from the torment of the Grave or the questioning of the Angels Etc this doesn't make any sense and hence they graded the Hadith to be weak in add to other reasons not only the logical reason in their sense and this is the opinion of and the likes however we find that as long as the Hadith is authentic there is no place for our logic to be applied here and hence we say that this is Allah's favors and blessing if Allah Graces us to die on a Friday and he gives us this gift from his uh uh favor and blessing alhamdulillah if not then he dealt with us with us through his justice so we're either between Allah's treating us with his Justice or with his grace and favors subhanahu wa ta'ala and hence I see no reason to um consider this Hadith not to be authentic"
