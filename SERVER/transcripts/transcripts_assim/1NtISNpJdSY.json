  "transcript": "Can a revert ask for a share in the property proceeds of non-Muslim parents if they are planning to sell it? None. What if they want or intend to give some of it themselves but it's not in written if not question you have you have one question far you can't ask me a multiple question and expect me to answer it. Number one, if a revert accepts Islam and her family wants to sell the property, it's their property. She has no right in it. If she says, \"Okay, I need part of it.\" And they give it willingly. This is a gift from the father who's a non-Muslim to his Muslim daughter while she's alive and he's alive. There's no problem in that. What is haram is to inherit once the father is dead and they start to distribute the wealth. A Muslim cannot inherit. And this is one of the uh uh opinions of the scholars. Other opinions say that no she can inherit but if she dies as a non-Muslim he cannot inherit her. And it's an issue of dispute and Allah knows best."
