  "transcript": "want to ask when we make woodo we have to wipe our ears and I know we wipe the back of our ears just with our thumb but when it comes to wiping the inside of the ear what I did was I placed my index finger into the hole of my ear and I just took it out I didn't actually rub anything I didn't wipe anything I just placed the index finger in the hole and took it out is that enough or is it not is it not valid it is enough inshallah but it's not the right thing to do this is laziness we know that you have to do this place the index finger in the cavity not inside and the thumbs at the back and just do this that's it a small wiping that is symbolic that follows the Sunnah without any exaggeration but just to Simply place it and take it out off this is not the right thing to do but it does the job inshallah"
