  "transcript": "siddiq from spain i am a student and i received scholarship uh is there's a cut on that okay so sadir is a student and he gets a scholarship meaning that they give him an allowance or a monthly salary so is there zakat on it the answer is you have to understand the concept of zakat because this is a pillar of islam so this is an important question for all muslims and you must learn these things because in islam there are things that are mandatory for you to learn such as how to pray what to say what is zakat if you have wealth how to fast the things that break your fasts and there are things that are a communal obligation if other scholars students of knowledge and people know of it's not important for you to know so if i were a poor person and i'm penniless is it obligatory upon me to know what is zakam no i don't have to because there is no zechariah so why would i learn it so for us muslims we have to learn our religion now zakat especially when we're talking about zakat of cash money is obligatory upon me only with two conditions condition number one that i possess a minimum a threshold of wealth that is equivalent to 595 grams of silver you go online and check how much is the value of 595 grams in silver in your currency whether it's a euro dollars real derham or whatever condition number one if i have this threshold or above then i look for the second condition and that is this amount that is the catabol has to remain in my possession for a whole lunar year a whole hijra year so if i received it in the first of ramadan then the following ramadan a year later if i still have this amount or more i have to give 2.5 percent of it so i hope this answers your question you"
