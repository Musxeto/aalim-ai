  "transcript": "regarding a particular Hadith which narrates um so on and so forth I noticed that in modern brochures and pamphlets and even Instagram pages that promote Hitler they tend to have added such extras to this Hadith such as even though the reference to these extra sadistas is our reference to the same Hadith I just said am I advised to stick within the parameters of what the Hadith has mentioned regarding the Decca or is it okay for me to follow these pages and broaden the Decker by getting creative as they do well because so the question of brother qasim is if there's a particular Hadith that places like a huge amount of reward over a particular um structure of words for example the hadithi coaching is a very long Hadith but it's been authenticated by sheikhil al-bani may Allah which is authentic when we come to a Hadith such as Subhan Allah when we come to this Hadith that highlights the importance of sayings as much as this and this and this and this which is countless can one say Can someone say alhamdulillah Can someone say this is an issue of dispute some say no we have to refrain to what came to us through the prophet Allah others say it's the same concept it's not something related to subhanallah that we can associate it with the number of Allah's creation subhanallahu as heavy as his throne is so why not say alhamdulillah as many as Allah's creations it sounds logical and to tell you the truth this is logical you can be as brother qasim rightly described it creative however keep this creativity to yourself what people do in Instagrams on Facebook and and such social media posts where they uh cut and paste different ascar in the same pattern is wrong because this would confuse people and they would think that this is part of the Hadith you want to do it for yourself I have no problem with that at all on Allah Knows Best from Canada"
