  "title": "Father & family gets angry if I dont join them 2 visit Relatives/ Events (Freemixing assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh uh you have cleared many things for me and I just want to say thank you so much. Uh my question is I live in the US and um my family gets invited to a lot of dinners if um and there's a lot of free mixing, no segregation between the men and women and my father gets angry when I tell him that I'm not going and I stay home and he gets very angry at me. So I just want your advice. What can I do in these situations? Unfortunately, this is your test from allahel. You live in a kafir country and you're trying to practice your religion to the best of your ability and Allah is testing you with such a father, maybe such a mother, maybe such a community and family. So it is like prophet Muhammad wasallam when he was in Mecca when he was trying to give dawa and call people to Islam and toed and every single Tom Dick and Harry were was against him. He did not budge. He did not give up. He did not surrender. Rather he stood firm, held his grounds and trusted Allah and believed that whatever he does he does it for the sake of Allah and this is why Allah made him victorious. So you try your level best while keeping your eyes on the ball. Your father is your gateway, middle gateway to Jenna. You have to obey him, respect him and be dutiful without disobeying Allah. So when there's a clash between obeying him and obeying allahel, definitely you obey Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala. This goes, this is a no-brainer. But this does not mean I have to be confronting him head-to-head. No, I try my level best to be diplomatic. I try my level best to be polite and to dodge the bullet whenever it is possible. How? If you drive and you can go with them to my uncle's house, my aunt's house, I come five minutes before thearamlaykum salam. I lower my gaze. I just sit in the corner of the table, eat myar and sambusa and shbalaykum and leave. That's a win-win. Yes, I still was not supposed to be there. But if this mitigates the problem and reduces my father's anger, inshallah, inshallah, I'm not doing a big sin. But no, if my father wants me to stay the whole night there, no, this is something you have to draw the line and say, \"I'm sorry, Dad, but I can't do it because it goes against what I believe. I respect you. I love you. I care for you, but I care about my and I'm not saying that you're a kafir. I'm not saying that you will all go to hell. But this is my conviction. I don't want to do something that goes against my beliefs. And inshallah, Allah will make a way out for you."
