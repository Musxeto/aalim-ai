  "transcript": "check if a person plays a one record solat and he decides to pray the court resides the Quran from the musaf or a phone instead of our memory with the reward be same as if he recited it from the memory the Quran is the Quran so whether he recites it from the phone or from a a must-have or from his memory it is the Quran that he is reciting the reward is almost the same of course when he reads it from his memory he's not moving so that's lesser in movement which means modern reward and he is refreshing his memory and cementing his memorization of the Quran rather than depending on the musaf and this is the way of the salaf to read from the memory not from uh like we do or most of us do from the Quran or from a mobile phone but technically speaking the reward is almost the same if you want a higher reward of course reading it from your memory is higher in reward insha Allah"
