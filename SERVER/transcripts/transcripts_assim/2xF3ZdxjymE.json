  "transcript": "so we stopped at I think huh okay so after the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam had his Siesta his and he was notified by B for Sal he prayed four raas in his home as per the Sunnah two by two and then when it was time for he went to the Masjid and he led the prayer with his congregation with the other Muslims in the Masjid now the prophet before oh no we did not go reach there yet before doing his Siesta after d when we said that this is a blessed time from Sunrise till before this is a blessed time where the Prophet used to do so many many things atat and among these things that he used to eat so their lunch would also be at that time but how many meals did the prophet have there is no specific number the norm among the companions at that time the Arabs they used to have two meals one in the early morning and this is called not lunch because it's done in the morning and one is called as which is supper or dinner but this is done between and so this was the norm two meals however sometimes they would eat in between and this is up to do whatever there is available so if we would like to dive in to the diet of the Prophet Alat so what were the foods that he ate and what types did he prefer there are a number of things if you look into the S and try to write down what he ate and what he preferred you will find for example number one on the list is dates this is number one the prophet said oh a house that does not have dates in it the people of that house are hungry so we should ask ourselves how much dates do we eat during the week unfortunately some of us eat dates only when they break their fast and those who follow the Sunnah of the prophet in fasting Mondays and Thursdays this is when they eat dates where we find that the prophet himself sallallahu alaihi wasallam used to recommend eating seven dates of every morning the first thing you eat Why seven dates specifically from AA specifically from Medina the prophet says whoever does thisat would be protected from black magic and from Poison so he would not be poisoned and he would not be affected by black magic with the grace of Allah but you have to do this first thing in the morning you wake up every single day Scholars differed why yeah uh uh specifically seven because this is from Allah okay should it be any type of dates again it's an issue of dispute I preferably yeah would recommend that it is from AA because this is the Hadith of the prophet Al and the Muslims at the time of the prophet in Medina the vast majority of their diet was made off of dates because they used to grow dates and it was easily grown in Medina and mother's Hadith that we used to see the Crescent after the Crescent after the crescent and fire would not be lit in the houses of the prophet alham and our only means of sustenance in food was water and dates the two blocks she said Alan though water is not black but this is in Arabic called when you give the name of one thing to the other so it's it's all Associated and that's why when we say the two moons what do we refer to the Sun and the Moon and when we say uh uh uh omaran came we mean Abu Bakr and Omar we give them both names referring to Omar as if they're two Omar but they're Abu Bakr and Omar and the likes and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam always broke his fasting over which is the ripe fruit and if not then the dates which is the dried fruit if not then he would just sip water and he said that the best sahur pre-dawn meal the prophet said the best of the believer is date all of this indicates what that we have to have a lot of it in our home next to our uh uh seat and uh uh take as much because it's filled with everything that is good in it yeah it it consists of the vast majority of what your body needs and the rest of what your body needs is found in item number two which the prophet used to consume a lot of and that is a little bit no milk milk the prophet used to drink milk in the Hadith of the night Journey he was given a choice and he chose milk over I think honey and wine and jiel said you chose the F the natural inclination with milk and dates you could never go wrong because this has everything the body needs and you can live and survive on this for ages with the grace of Allah item number three which was in the diet of our Prophet Alat may Allah be pleased with him and with his father said the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam and his wives used to sleep night after night hungry yeah they did not have any supper did no food what can we do and the vast majority of the bread they consumed was made of barley and and this is something that a lot of us may not find tasty we are used to eating wheat and barley is not something that people look to consume however Bary by the way medically speaking does wonders Subhan Allah it is one of the best medication for depression not proac huh you take barley and it has substances that would cure or at least reduce your depression mother says at the time of the Prophet whenever a person died we would go to the Widow and to the family of the deceased and we would uh uh um prepare food and we would put on it why she says because I heard the prophet saying that is a cure to the heart of the of the of the ill and it takes away sadness now this is the saying of the Prophet by the way this was reported by bukari and Muslim which gives it AAA grading of authenticity so we believe this as we believe the Quran Prophet says it helps the heart of the sick and takes away the sadness some of the sadness what is Talina it's a sort of soup and it's done with two spoons two full spoons of uh uh grinded barley whole not selected the whole thing you just grind it and then you add to them one glass of water and it is cooked over yeah moderate uh fire not to be boiled for 5 minutes and after that you add to it maybe a spoon of honey why is it called Talina because it looks like leemon like milk because of its white and its softness Scholars of medicine say today it is the best of substances people can consume because it contains a lot of chemical components that would lower your cholesterol levels and it has many uh uh advantages for your neuro uh connections so it would calm you down it would relieve you from your depression and introduce some form of Happiness no it's not ruies and you know drugs and but it's Hal it's something that the prophet Sall used to advise taking component number four in the prophet's diet honey mother AA says and this is in bukari and Muslim the prophet used to love sweets and honey of course natural sweets huh not chemical but honey was in his diet on daily basis the prophet used to am take water with a spoon of honey and drink it he would not y uh um like to drink water alone because the water of Medina was a bit salty not very pure and the prophet used to love to drink sweet water and sometimes he would go and extra mile and send people and some of companions to travel for a day or two outside of the skirts outskirts of Medina to bring him from a specific well some water that is sweet so this was in the diet of the Prophet Alam and I've heard doctors say to take this in the early morning like the seven AA to take it before having breakfast to just have some honey with water some in I think the Far East do this with water that is a little bit warm and they mix it with honey some they put some lemon in it and they say that this is a magical portion that would prolong your life energizes your body and gives you long life well I don't care the prophet used to love it and do it so we would like to know what the prophet used to love and take and he said about honey of course honey in the Quran is mentioned to be a cure that comes from the bellies of the Beast Allah says in it there is a cure and you know whenever you have cough respiratory infection flu you just take like five six spoons of of Honey every couple of hours and with the grace of Allah it's all gone it takes all bad substances in your uh system and you spit it out and mallah you're good as gold number five the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam used to love and used to consume meat so the prophet wasn't following today's trend being a vegetarian oh I'm vegan Mah you me I'm I'm vegan so M I'm Saudi welcome what do you mean vegan I don't eat meat why so no meat is not good I'm not a a beast I'm not a lion yes but you're not a cow why do you eat only vegetables this is crazy yeah I understand you don't like to eat a lot of meat this is up to you but to say any meat product or eggs or fish is Haram or you don't come near it you're crazy our religion every the Sunnah is to slaughter your sacrifice and the first thing to eat from is your liver not your own liver of course yeah some people will understand wrongly what I say so and you have to be careful of what you say you have you have to always be careful not to be misunderstood and I told you this before they suspended my Twitter account for about 3 months and I had a fight with them why someone asks me she is it permissible to eat in Europe from KFC in McDonald's and I said yes the slaughtering of the Jews and the Christians is permissible what do you expect happen they suspended my account he said remove this uh post said why said you said the slaughtering of the Jews is in Christian yeah look at the question the question is clearly and I explained it and the comments everybody understood it but for them as disbelievers and cfer I agree the post by itself is an encouragement for you to go and Slaughter any Jew or Christian I meant the animals Slaughter by the Jew and the Christians are permissible so sometimes your wordings are very important and I always tell people it is a blessing from Allah to have a small you in front of you when you speak there is small aam sitting in front of me so whenever I speak he tells me hey oops you did wrong correct it or don't say these things likewise when you write an email always have a small U reading that email before you send it because the word in your mouth is like a lion in a cage if I'm outside the cage can the lion hurt me no I the line is in captivity he cannot do anything the moment the word comes out the lion is out he's going to eat everyone and me included so when you write an email in response to someone's comment at work or a friend or a relative and you're angry let it marinate and come the following day read it again and you will find that you will edit 60% of it reward it don't send it come after 2 hours read it again you will edit another 15% then you may send it and it would have the best impact and people would say you're wise but if you're impulsive if you say and then apologize the prophet saidat do not say what you have to apologize of or from meaning that it's best to refrain from talking so that you don't apologize but if if every time I say something and then I have to apologize no no I did not mean this this oh I was wrong this is not befitting at all so meat is a type of food that the prophet used to eatat and he used to love it and the most he used to love was of of the meat the should the he used to he used to love the shoulder meat and the should meat is the most tender it's more tender than the thigh of a lamp and in theah the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was invited when he was in Medina by a Jewish woman she sent him an invitation to come and eat from a lamb that that she slaughtered a sheep that she is offering him and his companions so he went not knowing that that she filled the Lamb with poison spe specifically the shoulder because they told her that he loves the shoulder so he went and accepted the invitation and he ate one morsel and then he spit it out and he told his companions to stop because Allah made the Sheep speak to him and say to him I'm poisoned Bish may Allah be pleased with him who was one of the companions he Mah was very hungry he consumed one or two bites and he died because of that so the prophet saidat to the woman why did you do this she said I wanted to test you if you were an impostor you will eat from it and die and I would relieve the people from your evil and if you were a messenger Allah would notify you and tell you so now I know you're a messenger so the prophet Salli wasallam did not kill her but because Bish died there has to be compensation so he gave his family the right to either kill a soul for a soul or to take blood money or to forgive they chose a soul for a soul and she was beheaded because of that now this Hadith again although it's not part of our topic but it is very important to go through this the prophet Alat wasam did not ask this Jewish woman is the money you bought this sheep Halal or Haram because we are told in the Quran that you Jews consume usy and riba so you steal you lie so this might be Haram it doesn't matter why because the money earned is Haram on the earner but if I give you as a gift or you're my wife or children and I give you groceries and I buy you things it's Halal for you it has no impact so the Haram money impacts who the earner clear number two the prophet did not ask her is this or not did it fall from a mountain did you find it dead he just went on the default of chapter 5 verse number five Ayah number five where Allah says the meat slaughtered by the people of the book is halal for you so we don't have to go out of our way to ask oh Christians did you Slaughter it or not did you say bismah or not it's sufficient for us to know that they're Christians and they're providing us with beef or lamb or chicken and I can say bismah and eat why do I bring this up because so many people make a lot of a fuzz about restaurants in the West America UK Germany and they say oh it's not Zab yeah do you have ample proof and evidence said no but uh these guys don't Slaughter how do you know they're Christians and the prophet ate from what was presented to him by a Jewish woman without investigating he says okay they're not Christians they're atheists how did you know oh the vast majority of people in the country they don't go to church they don't believe in Christianity but they identifi themselves as Christians so how do you know did you again cut the chest and check their hearts to see what's in it no so the default is that they're Christians and Subhan Allah the people make a huge argument out of it we always say you don't want to eat in these restaurants good for you nobody's going to force you or put a gun to your head but don't condemn others who follow the Quran and the Sunnah and the default and what B said and say that they are bad Muslims they're not following the right path and they're wrong you don't want to eat good for you I raise my hat or my sh for you that's good but don't go overboard blaming others for not following what you believe because you are not someone to decide what is right and what is wrong rather the SC and the uh uh uh the Quran the Sunnah does this for us and Allah knows best uh number six the prophet sometimes ate rabbit meat oh rabbit is very nice we like rabbits don't we huh rabbits are very fluffy and you know Bugs Bunny what's up how we can eat it it's Hal the prophet Alat wasam was traveling once and the companions saw a rabbit and they started fighting to catch it and who can catch a rabbit you like a chicken can you catch a chicken it's very quick in movement so they kept on running and running and running until anas Malik who's a youngster who aile was able to catch it he took it to Abu Talha Abu Talha slaughtered it skinned it cooked it and sent the thighs to the prophet so the prophet accepted it and ate it so this shows you that also animals in the wild can be consumed as long as it was slaughtered in a Halal way whether it's a rabbit which a gazelle a deer a um a moose or whatever likewise something that people don't know of chicken the prophet wasallam ate chicken Abu musari once was sitting may Allah be pleased with him and someone brought him a dish with a chicken there was a man sitting with him the man went aside and Abu mus said why don't you come and join us so the man says I saw something that was disgusting the Arabs at the time used to think that chicken is a disgusting bird why in Arabic we call it jalala and jalala is an animal or a bird that eats waste droppings and you can see that the chicken eats whatever is found so if it's droppings poop uh meat um something rotten they eat whatever they can find so Abu Musa told him come and eat and the man said I'm not going to eat because he thought that yeah you're telling me to eat something disgusting Abu Musa said come and eat and expiate your oath because I saw the prophet eat from it now we can eat alhamdulillah chicken without any problem because our Prophet ate it was it normal of course not it's not as we find it today it's not that easy to uh have at that time and I don't have any recollection of the Prophet eating eggs though it's almost on daily basis we eat boiled eggs scrambled eggs too sunnide up medium uh cooked but at the time it wasn't found but chicken yes we have alhamdulillah evidence to eat it also fish so the prophet ate from the sea food and this is mentioned clearly in the Quran anything that lives in the sea you can eat and when we say sea we means Rivers swamps Lakes any water reservoirs you can eat of it regardless of the name now some books of f they come to the sea lion say Haram why say it's a lion this L is different that sea snakes Haram sea seals and the and the and the more they go so anything that lives in the water is Hal unless it is harmful if it's poisonous or causes you medical harm it becomes Haram regardless of the name so you can eat whatever lives in the water the issue is okay how do we know this the Quran says it's Halal and Allah says you eat from it uh soft meat and subh Seafood is one of the best yeah the fish the tenderness of it it's so compared to beef and and and to lamb it's so tender very nutritious very nice in one of the Expeditions the companions ran out of food until they came to the shores of jida where I live and they found a a huge whale on the seashore so they were hungry so they started carving meat and they say that it was so huge that a man in his on his camel could go inside of the ribs it was so big that a man on his camel walked and of course they didn't have selfies but at the time and it would have been a nice uh uh click to take so they ate from it and took as much as they can and went to the prophet Medina and when he told they told him he said the prophet sallai wasallam do you have some of the meat so you can feed us so G they gave him and he ate from it so it shows you that the seafood is not to be slaughtered this was a dead meat they did not catch it they found it lying dead on the shore as long as it's eatable and it's not harmful this is permissible so if you're in the water and you see a floating fish do I have to leave it because I didn't catch it no you can't even if it's dead and when you fish you have to say bahb oh I forgot to say can I eat it no eat it it doesn't matter because Seafood the dead of the sea creatures is halal for us now coming to something that may cross your mind what about amphibious creatures that live partly in water and partly on land such as alligators or crocodiles so what's the difference between alligator and crocodiles by the way huh it doesn't matter if you see one just run but I think the difference I have no idea I've never seen one I'm not interested in seeing one so people a lot of people say what's the ruling on eating it say well if you can eat it before it eats you that would be a plus may Allah protect us it's an issue of dispute because in the Sunnah the prophet prohibited eating anything that has a uh uh what what what do you call it nabar teth a sharp teeth some men have sharp teeth no it has something like lions uh canines or something like that yeah English is not my first nor second nor third language so it's lousy so anything that has a a claw or these canines and and the likes it's Haram for us to eat and definitely our friend the crocodile or the gator has lots of them but because it lives in water now we are hesitant so some Scholars say no it's and I'm inclined to say that inshallah it is halal because it cannot live outside water yeah maybe it can live for a day or two or three but then it will die due to its nature it has to be around water and use water not to breathe rather to sustain its its life however we come to something a little bit more luxurious what about the skin because we have many shoes belt and wallets that are made of gator skin and I I believe that this is halal as long as it is tanned then it becomes Halal due to this confusion but it's best to avoid the meat of it as for the leather is no problem number nine something that the prophet Alam used to consume a lot which is vinegar the people say vinegar what what do you do with vinegar now it's a luxury it's it's something you go to Italian restaurants and the appetizers they give you is some uh garlic uh fried garlic with balsamic vinegar and olive oil and you dip the bread in it whoa masallah I don't want to eat it's beautiful the prophet says and the is Muslim jab says the prophet asked do you have something to dip and they said wellah we don't have anything other than vinegar so he said bring it on and he started putting the bread in the vinegar eating and he said oh the best dip is vinegar jabber says by Allah since then I loved vinegar as long as the prophet consumed it and loved it and it's good doctors say that it lowers your cholesterol your diabetes uh apple vinegar is good and and the likes now what is with vinegar that is Haram in Islam if you bring the juice and add to it deliberately substances that would make it wine and then after a couple of days or more the wine wine turns into vinegar this is Haram you're not allowed to consume it but if it turns by itself sometimes I make apple juice and I leave it and I forget about it for 6 weeks and I come in its vinegar by Nature then there's no problem what about the vinegar we have in the market most of it is artificial and chemical no problem what about if I know that this is balsamic vinegar or vinegar made of red wine or white wine if it's made by Muslims it's Haram because they purposely turned the substance into wine and then added few things to make it into vinegar and this is Haram by the Hadith but if it was done by people who think it is halal like Christians Jews atheists uh Buddhist Hindus with the end product where we get is vinegar then there's no problem does the name impact the permissibility red wine vinegar no what is the end result vinegar is it going to intoxicate me have you ever I don't know you guys maybe know better than me does vinegar by any chance intoxicate of course not so therefore there's no problem in the name and this is another issue that a lot of Muslims are hesitant she can I buy this t-shirt the brand is XYZ which is Haram the name doesn't make things Halal or Haram the name is a name some of the companions name was ABD ABD and their name is Idol worshippers servant doesn't make it Halal or Haram the actual product W okay what number are we in 10 number 10 the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam ate cheese wow so when he was in tibuk he was brought in tibuk is close to the Romans and the bantian and Italy so maybe they brought him some mozarella I don't know they they brought him cheese he was in tabuk and up north next to close to Europe so they brought him a piece of cheese he brought he asked for a knife he cut it and he ate it after saying bismah which means that cheese is permissible in Islam by the Sunnah the prophet ate itat we have a problem cheese in the west is usually done by adding Ren and what is Reet it's something to do with the intestines or with the pregnant uh sheep that they take it from uh it and and it's something of an enzymes that would cultivate or produce this cheese so what's the ruling on it it's an issue of dispute but the most authentic opinion and the fat is on this that the prophet ate from it though it was produced through through this fashion and the companions used to get cheese from Christian countries and from the Jews and from the fire worshippers without any problem so it is halal you can consume it with no need for you to go into the ingredients number 11 the prophet used to love and consume and eat pumpkins now pumpkins are a huge family of plants I'm not a good in in in biology but the pumpkin the big one the red one that we know in Halloween we know this also there is the pumpkin that looks like a cucumber but a little bit twisted it comes green and there is the Indian pumpkin which is uh um orange also it's it's cender type all of this is pumpkin and what they call it um I don't know Kusa zucchini is it zucchini that's a small one maybe zucchini or squash some also is from the same family so all of this very beneficial Prophet yunus peace be upon him when he was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale when he came out he his skin had some deformity because of being in the belly of the of the whale and all of what's inside chemicals and the likes when he came out Allah grew a tree of pumpkin to shade him and this tree of course was not a tree because pumpkin is on the ground but it was all around him and they say it has huge healing yeah impact and effect on various illnesses one of them is diabetes it has tremendous impact on reducing diabetes levels and on skin care but you have to go through those uh specialist who know and have studied it and there's so many medical uh studies on it all of this doesn't matter to us but it's an added value to know because the prophet used to love it we spoke yesterday that the prophet Alam was invited by a tailor with anas may Allah be pleased with him and he presented them with a dish a a meal and the prophet used to pick this pumpkin from all over the dish it it had also dried salted meat with it but he used to pick the pumpkin and eat it because he loved it Anna says since then I it became my best and favorite dish so I always remember that the prophet loved it and I used to consume itat number 12 a combination I've never tried myself I know people have tried it but me myself I've never tried the prophet used to eat sallallahu alhi wasallam ripe dates with watermelon dates with watermelon mix them up and eat them now I would not I did not ever try this because I don't know how it would taste and the prophet Alat wasam also used to eat uh uh cucumbers with ripe dates a combination between the two one of the narrations he says we by doing this combination break the heat of this one with the coldness of this one now which one is hot which one is cold beats me but if I were to think I would think that the ripe dates is hot because it has so much sugar and it would give you energy while cucumbers or the watermelon would cool it off so the prophet is making this combination I have no idea what benefit this is but this is what the prophet used to consume and I bet you Halal betting inshallah from one side you pay the money if I lose I forgive you uh I bet you that if you do the medical researches and the Physicians make medical researches they will find wonders and miracles in it number 14 another combination the prophet used toat combine between dates and butter but this is understood yeah okay some people like to eat dates with you know Sesame I don't know what it's called in I don't think they have it in English to begin with I think this is a middle eastern uh thing but lots of people love to eat dates with so eating dates with butter is butter is always good when you eat it with things the prophet used to love it the Hadith says that the prophet used to love the dates with butter number 15 and this is in Arabic problematic linguistically means to leave something and and leave it this is in Arabic anyone you hear him say it refers to wine wine because wine usually is juice that is left for a few days until it becomes wine the prophet used to love to drink water that had a sweet substance in it like dates some fruit left for one day and he would drink it the the the liquid would be juice so what was the procedure I Abbas says may Allah be pleased with him the prophet sallallah alaih wasallam used to order his family to place some um raisins is dried uh uh grapes in the liquid in the morning so he can drink it in the evening or to do this in the evening so that he would drink it in the morning and by the way the prophet used to sallallahu alaihi wasallam as we will hear later on he used to drink this juice after breakfast and after dinner so this tells you that this is how Sall alaihi wasallam used to enjoy drinking sweet things after breakfast after a meal and after dinner so this would remain for him to drink but not for more than three nights on the third night because he would drink this mixture this juice the first night the second night the third night he would say either one of you consume it or throw it away why after the third night it becomes intoxicating has fermented it starts to be intoxicating and no there's nothing Halal in that number 16 did we finish this uh number 16 okay um well actually this is something to be done with a mixture of barley or wheat that would be roasted on fire and then it would be mixed with water and mixed with dates and these are the tribes of Arabia especially in the South they have this mixture some of them call it ARA some of them call it they have it has different names and this mixture is very very healthy and and nutrition it would give you a lot of power a lot of energy and the prophet used to uh um eat this and ask for it especially after fasting because it gives you a lot of energy after a whole day of fasting and finally the prophet as stated before sallallahu alai wasallam used to send his companions to bring him Sweet Water because the water in Medina by nature in their Wells is a little bit salty and he used to love sweet water so he used to to send them uh away uh for that and drinking water is an essential how much time we have half an hour okay drinking is something essential in our life we eat and we drink and the prophet used to drink however there are etiquettes for drinking that the prophet also taught us and practiced it sallallahu alaih wasallam number one from his Sunnah he used to love Sweet Water unlike what the super super uh uh sufis would say because they would say no we don't drink anything sweet we don't drink anything that is luxurious so we would like to eat salted water uh rotten food or food that is not some old bread all of this is not part of Islam the prophet Alam used to love to eat meat especially the shoulder he used to love to eat sweets and he used to love to drink sweet water which means that as long as Allah made things Halal for you enjoy it why make life difficult oh because I'd like to be closer to Allah and who told you that making life difficult for you gets you closer to Allah Allah made these things Halal for us to enjoy without extravagance so you can do that without any problem among the eates it is to drink while sitting down an Malik says the prophet prohibited people from drinking standing up and Abu Hur said the prophet saidat one must not drink standing up but there are other hadiths that conflict with this for example IB Abbas may Allah be pleased with him says the prophet sallallahu alaihi alhi wasallam drank zamzam water while he was standing up narrated by Abbas reported in alkari he says I came and met Ali and I brought him some water so he started drinking standing up so he noticed that I didn't like him drinking standing up so he said there are people who hate drinking standing up and I saw the prophet did what you've just saw me done what you have just seen me do meaning I saw the prophet drink standing up number three Abdullah may Allah be pleased with him and with his father says we used to eat at the time of the Prophet Alat while walking we used to eat and we used to drink while standing and abdah may Allah be pleased with him and with his father says I saw the prophet drinking standing up and sitting down and also what Imam Malik reported in his Omar aliar Zu Allah be pleased with them all used to drink standing up and reported that and thought that this was totally permissible so after all of these authentic hadiths how can we combine between what seems to be conflicting ABD said it's very easy because whenever we have conflicting rules like this it means that the Hadith of prohibition would be degraded into not recommended and the Hadith of doing it would mean that it is permissible and this is the best approach whenever we have two conflicting evidences is to try to combine between them and this is one of the means of combining secondly among the etiquet of drinking is that you begin with saying bismah and you conclude with saying alhamdulillah and this is what the prophet says used to do and whenever he used to drink from a vessel he used to say bismah and whenever he took it away from his mouth he would say alhamdulillah and he used to do this three times so he used to three a drink on three uh times so he sayah alhamdulillah and if he wants to go again bah not that I want to drink coffee this it's not that good to drink it in three sips like that and he would do this now this is a highly recommended Sunnah because when you say bah Shan avoids drinking with you or eating with you and when you say alhamdulillah Allah forgives your sins theith when you say Allah forgives all your sins and this is really strange Allah gives us the food and gives us the drink and blesses us with it and when we praise him he forgives our sins what tell does this tell you that Allah is most forgiving most merciful you don't have to be in fear of doing kufur of doing sh of going to Hell Fire like Shan messes up with your head until he makes you do things that displease Allah think positively of Allah yes stay away from sin nobody says go ahead and do sins and then eat and say but when you do eat and drink and praise Allah acknowledge that Allah will forgive your sins thirdly do not drink directly from the water container why because people will drink after you and when you drink if you have a skin water container people usually pour water in their glasses and their vessels to drink from it if you come and put your mouth and drink from it this would make people disgust with what's in it now because you drank directly from it not only that you don't know what might come out one of the people did this and a snake came out to him so this is why it's not safe to drink directly from a big vessel or a water container rather you have to um pour it in another Vessel number four don't Breathe In The Vessel you're drinking from especially in the case when this vessel is used by many others so in the time of the Prophet Alam we know that a vessel of milk would be brought an 80 people would drink of it how is this possible this is Baraka so the prophet says bis drinks from it then he gives it to 80 people afterwards they drink their full they're all full kalas then he gives it to Abu hura Abu hura narrates this Hadith he says I used to starve and I did not have any food when did Abu accept Islam any idea on the seventh year of Hijra the the year of 7th when did the prophet die long time ago good M think this is your history which year 11th the 11th year of hij in on the 12th of all Scholars agree he died on what on the 12th of which is what the the innovators celebrate his mid so every year when they celebrate his mid actually they're commemorating his death and enjoying it but they don't know they're ignorant so Abu huray accepted Islam only for 4 Years yet he narrated the vast majority of a Hadith why he was asked this how come you only accompanied the prophet for four years other companions accompanied him for 23 years and did not even narrate 10% of what you did he said everyone had to make a living they all had had to farm they go to the market they sell and buy they had errands they had wives they had children I had nothing I accompanied the prophet wasam to feed me so I was with the prophet these four years 247 and I faced days where I was starving totally hungry so I used to meet Abu Bakr you wish to meet Omar and I stand in their face uh do you know the Hadith of the Prophet where he said something like that and he says I know the Hadith more than them just I want them to look at me and say yeah the Hadith is so and so you look hungry come and I will feed you and then none of them would say such a thing until the prophet once saw me lying in the Masjid I I thought I was dying and he said Abu Hur follow me so I thought whoa now this is my luck so he went with the prophet Alat and he said when he entered the home to his wives do we have any food Abu hur's eyes lit alhamdulillah now I'm going to get my meal so they said no prophet of Allah we don't have anything except one glass of milk was gifted To Us by so and so our neighbors so I said okay milk is good it does the job so he said Abu said yes oh prophet of Allah here I am I'm I'm here can you see me okay he said go to the Masjid and call the people of Assa the totally broke people who only live in the Masjid they have no houses no cupboards no clothes nothing totally broke like you he said go call them there are 80 plus of them what is this but it's a direct order so I left with an eye on the glass but I couldn't do anything so he went he called them so the prophet said invite them in 10 by 10 not all of them 10 people at a time so each one came the prophet drank from it and gave it to them and they drank their fill and they left another 10 came another 10 came another 10 came and then when they're all over the prophet said Abu drink why there is an authentic Hadith by the way remember it huh a lot of the Muslims don't know it the prophet saidat the one who hosts people to drink he's the last to drink so if you're coming to drink uh to to host the guests and you're pouring them some colas or some fizzy drinks or some juice some of us pour themselves and drink their food but then okay here no you give the whole of the guests this is the Sunnah and the last one to drink is you so Abu hura when he saw the prophet telling him drink he drank the prophet said after he returned drink more he drank drink more until he was stuffed so the prophet said drink more he said by Allah who sent you with the truth there is no room except for breath and Subhan Allah one glass this is the Baraka when people say the Baraka is important in our lives this is what we mean by Baraka someone who works in an interest based bank riba and he gets maybe 15 20,000 20 your your currency is strange uh 10 20 2,000 any some in in real he gets 100,000 real this is 10,000 uh KD everybody whoa big salary Big M good job and if he resigns because it's Haram you're crazy why are you doing this and he gets a job for 10,000 R 1,000 KD Allah puts more Baraka in it than the 10,000 KD how you buy something it lasts a month you buy a car it never breaks down you buy uh uh um things for the house your children don't get sick but when you have a huge Haram income and Allah takes the Baraka the food is not sufficient the clothes don't last the kids go to a hospital frequently you have so many accidents there is no happiness there is no Tranquility the Baraka is sought after from Allah through following the Quran and through following the Sunnah and Halal risk okay what was number four five we finished four now number five to breathe outside the utensils the The Vessel so when you drink you have to keep it away to breathe so so you do this once and then you drink a second and a third the prophet Al as described by anas he used to breathe out and away from the vessel three times and he says this is more satisfying this is more uh uh nicer and this is more best or better for health reasons and this would be easy on the stomach so it would take its intake little by little rather than and all of a sudden it expands in few seconds and it would be not healthy uh for it number six to consume moderately when you drink some of the brothers maybe drink a liter of juice a liter of of cola a liter of something they fill themselves up and the prophet saysat if you must then oneir of your stomach for food oneir for your drink and oneir for your breathing this is moderation so is it haram to fill it up no it's not Haram but it's not healthy in the Hadith of Abu what third did he fill the whole three F thirds the third of the food the third of the water and the third of of air he filled it up to here because he doesn't know where when there will be next chance to eat so he he was hungry so was it haram no the prophet would have told himat that it was Haram seventh uh etiquette to praise Allah after you drink and this is what the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam used to say Allah is pleased when a servant eats a meal and he says alhamdulillah or when he drinks a drink and says alhamdulillah Allah is pleased with you and in the Hadith the prophet Sall wasallam whenever he ate or drank he used to say this is one of the great blessings and favors of Allah that we don't um recollect what praise be to God to Allah who has given food and drink and made it easy to swallow and then provided an exit for it imagine if Allah gave us food and drink and it was not allowed to exit our bodies what would happen stomach St ache we would have poison in our bodies we would have so many illnesses but we go to the toilet we do number one number two and we don't pay attention that Allah Allah relieved me Allah gave me the food and gave me a way out of it and this is why when you look at the the prophet used to do it shows you how much connect to Allah he was because all the time his mind his soul was connected and praising Allah for the gifts that many many of us don't see don't notice don't contemplate on and we take things for granted why did Allah did not do this for me why did Allah deprive me from this and that Subhan Allah Allah gave you so much no no no no I wanted this particular thing Allah did not give it to me and this is in gratitude that we live in when you look at the glass and you say it's half empty she Allah did not give me a lot people who are optimistic and grateful would say it's half full although it's the same glass but people perception of things differ and this is why you will find people who are happy and and content with what Allah has given and you will find people who are always complaining uh eight to begin when you offer drinks with the people on the right and when you drink something and you want to pass it over to someone you choose the one to your right the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was brought with a glass of milk mixed with water and to his right is a nomad a bedwin and to his left Abu Bakr he drank from it and he gave it to The Nomad to the bedwin Abu Bakr is next to you and he said the right then the right indicating that the right is to be given first and in another Hadith he was brought with some drink to the right of him was a young boy in another narration is IB Abbas IB Abbas was like 10 11 years of age a young kid and to his left the elders and the yeah uh uh people of position Abu Bakr Omar and the elders so after the prophet finished Alam he asked the boy can I do you allow me because he was on the right would do you allow me to give it to Abu Bakr and to the elders said no Allah I don't allow you I wouldn't be in my right mind to allow you to give such Baraka to the people on your left no I'm more worthy so the prophet gave it to him and uh uh he drank from it now we have confusion who should we begin with the elders or with the right the the scholars say if you are sitting in line you give a must to the right there is no exception for that but if they are sitting in front of you or you're coming in to the Gathering and you would like to host then you begin with the Elder because there isn't a preference to bring to begin from right or left but if I'm here and I have have people to my right and left I have to begin with the right if there is no preference they're all in front of me I begin with the elders part okay number nine yeah of course part of the etiquette is that it is totally prohibited to drink in gold or silver utensils and vessels and this is found in many five-star hotels and I've been around the world in in in five star hotels when you ask for a for tea they bring you in a jug of silver and you can see it's silver when you go to eat the utensils are gold or silver it's different than the room service the room service people put in their bags so they can steal it but in the hotel itself in in the restaurant it's made of gold and silver it is totally Haram to consume it and uh to eat in that and also it is totally Haram to eat with your left hand this is a thing that the prophet wasam prohibit us from doing and he said that eating and drinking with the left hand is a treat of shatan that Muslims must uh avoid uh how much time a minute okay so all of this was uh at Before Time and whenever wanted to gather the Muslims the Gathering point was always in the Masjid so whenever there's something of importance he would send b or anyone to call [Music] meaning that prayer gathers people come to the Masjid so they come and he would either speak to them about something he wanted to advise him about or if he wants to send an expedition or a group of the army to a specific place he would do so or if there's a revelation that came and he wants to announce it to them he would do that before the time the prophet used to take his Siesta and this is like a 10 15 minute that would energizes energize you for the rest of the day because remember the prophet was awake since when since the middle of the night before fer he was praying night he just took a small nap before F and then from F until you're talking about 67 good hours so this 15 minute breaks the fatigue and the lack of concentration and re-energizes you with the grace of Allah and is part of the the prophet says take your the middle of the day nap your Siesta because the Devils don't so it's part of the Sunnah and I know a lot of the Executives in the corporate world who would take this sacred 10 minutes 15 minutes before time even in their offices they would tell you their secretaries that I have 10 minutes uh important meeting and they just do off for 10 20 minutes and mallah it gives them a lot of energy for the rest of the day so if it's time for the prophet Alam hears the aan and his his in his house he repeats after the MU and then he prays four ra Sunnah two by two and in the remaining time for the he would utilize it either to speak with his wife and to joke with her and to have a good time or to attend to his grandchildren and play with them and this was the norm because he loved his grandchildren and when Bal notified him that it is time for prayer he used to go to the Masjid directly sometimes the companions would find him coming to the Masjid with one of his grandchildren that was always the case in and there are so many hadiths one of the Hadith is uh of Umama B AB his granddaughter from Zab so he came to the Salat allahar he's carrying AMA whenever he went for Ru and he placed her on the ground and whenever he stood up he picked her up how would you think or what would you do if you see the Imam do this nowadays you probably throw your Android phone if it's iPhone no you it's too expensive you throw your Android phone and him or your old Nokia why thinking oh it's inappropriate and some people are so ignorant they would make a fuzz of nothing it's inappropriate how does he bring his child to the Masjid and pray carrying this is a lot of movement his prayer is invalid the prophet did it uh maybe the child's uh Napp is full with urine maybe there's n his prayer is invalid how do you know so people make assumptions and they make ideas of their own neglecting what the proof our Master sallallah wasallam did it so you more Roman than the Romans it doesn't make any sense so don't judge things by your own whims and desires always before you judge look for the for an answer in the Quran and the Sunnah and follow and comply not the opposite don't come up with an opinion and then okay let me see what supports my opinion from the Quran and Sunnah because this is manipulating uh uh the religion the prophet's Salat of was the second longest of the day and unlike a lot of the imams nowadays unfortunately is very quick it takes 6 minutes 7 Minutes the companions say the of used to be given and one of us goes all the way to alak you know the graveyard alak is an open area outside this outskirts of Medina to answer the call of nature they didn't have public toilets in their or or even toilets in their own homes they had to go outskirts of Medina so one would go answer the call of nature come back to his home perform W go to the Masjid and pray the First with the prophet how long was that a lot which means that the prophet Sall wasallam used to take his time inor prayer and after finishing the prayer of if there was something of importance the prophet would give them a a reminder for example once he prayed and after he prayed he saw men from the tribe of mud but they were so poor that their clothes were torn off so the prophet's face changed and and he went to the pulpit after and he praised Allah offer salutation upon the prophet and then he said spend for from your money make a visor between you and hellfire someone spends from his dates someone spends from his s someone spends from his mood spend from whatever you can and he kept on reminding people and the people were sitting interesting listen listening to the prophet giving nobody moved but then one of the companions stood up and rushed to his home and came back with a huge sack and bag barely able to carry it and went in front of the prophet and dropped it the moment the companions saw this they all stood and went and they brought whatever they can from their homes and a big p pile formed in front of the Prophet wasallam The Prophet's face glittered and started shining and he said whoever does open the door for a good deed and people follow him he will get the reward of all those who followed him on the day of judgment without anything being extracted and reduced from their Good Deeds imagine if you have a child two or three years of age and you teach him how to read the faat and he reads it for another 60 or 70 years every day he reads it you're rewarded imagine if you have a colleague and you teach him how to pray DHA and he prays DHA for the rest of his life and you your home sleeping the meter is sticking so this is one story uh we have one minute okay okay by the time okay you remind me inshah we stop that uh his reminders after insh"
