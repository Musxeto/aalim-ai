  "transcript": "brother Bali from Egypt asked three questions all related is a cuttlefish all are given to you together and you can split them on the first is when do we give the cattle fitter can it be money or food and what type of food if it is to be filled well first of all the cattle fighter has to be paid before the performance of salat or eight and so at Allah as we know it's after fajar prayer on the first day of Shabbat on the day of eight so before that you must give it but can you give it on the fifteenth of Ramadan for example because it's before that the scholars say no you can do pay it two to three days before eight so starting from the 27th onwards of Ramadan you can pay zakat ofit are providing that you do not exceed salata late if it's after salat too late the time has expired and it would not be either cut outfitter anymore as for the question can we pay it in money in forms of money the answer would be no because the Prophet Elias Elohim is the one who specified as in the hadith or beside the hoodie of Abram our bass melody pleased with them all that we pay it and in the form of food so our Mendte asar of food and this food as the scholars say is what the people eat and are able to store so any food that you can weigh or and that is you can weigh and store you can use this so dates would do wheat would do and nowadays in the Arab world rice is the best food they usually consume so everybody's getting rice as zakat outfitter does that look"
