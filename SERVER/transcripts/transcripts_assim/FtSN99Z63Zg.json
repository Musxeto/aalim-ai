  "transcript": "so I have a question regarding like uncertainties and UND doubts uh like regarding W and and impurities uh for instance I was like during the time of f i was urinating and I saw in my underwear I knew that there was no traces of impurity or Medi and then I got up afterwards and then you know had some time to you know spend some time looking in the mirror and brushing my teeth uh before I made wo and then I made uh and then uh maybe I thought I sense some uh uh wetness maybe before W so I made my woo and then uh uh so I made my woodoo and then I uh decided to check if there's any impurities and then I checked in my underwear and saw there's a one trace of Medi so I was kind of like doubtful and not really I wasn't certain whether that came while I was in W or before or you know before the wo while I was brushing my teeth and looking at the mirror maybe I'm inclined that it came before but I'm not really ever certain so uh so while so since it was F time and the time was constrained I just decided to pray and not make another woodo as I thought this would uh might open a door for wias so what's the ruling on what I did should I have show should I must I should I have done another woodo or was I of course of course you should have cleaned yourself removed that spot of NASA and made wo and your prayer is invalid you have to repeat it now oh even when I'm not certain no no no this is no nothing to do with your certainty you're definitely certain you made woodo and you had a feeling you checked before Salat what are you talking about you didn't even you didn't check after Salat if you checked after Salat I would have said your prayer is valid but you checked during and you found it and still you did not do anything about it definitely your prayer is invalid"
