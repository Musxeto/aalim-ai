  "title": "ðŸ†•âœ¨ If prostration was allowed, wives would be commanded prostrate to their HUSBANDS - Hadith Weak?",
  "transcript": "Aisha says, if prostration was allowed to other than Allah, it would have been to the husbands. Is this hadith weak or authentic? No. The hadith is authentic without any doubt. The Prophet ï·º said, if I were to order a woman to prostrate, if I were to order an individual to prostrate to another, I would have ordered a wife to prostrate to her husband. And this is to illustrate the importance of the husband's status in his wife's life. And prostration is divided into two types. One of worship, and this can only be devoted to Allah Azza Wa Jal. And if not, then it is a form of shirk, major shirk. And the second type of prostration is prostration of respect. And this is permissible only when the shari'ah allows it, as in the case of Allah ordering the angels to prostrate to Adam. They were not worshipping him, they were following Allah's commands. Also at the time of Yusuf ï·º, it was the custom and the habit, and it was permissible in the religion that out of reverence, they would respect their elders and their rulers by prostrating to them, as mentioned in the Qur'an. But in our religion, this is totally prohibited, and this is why the Prophet ï·º said, if I were, and this to show you that this is prevented, this is prohibited, because if he were to, he would have. But it's not permissible, that's why he did not order a wife to prostrate to her husband.
