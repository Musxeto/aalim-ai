  "transcript": "while we're alive and well going to schools and to to work and to places of interest to us when we fly we have to have the fear a little bit more than the hope why they say because it's human nature that we feel lured and tempted in this life so if you have more hope in allah's forgiveness you will do more sins isn't that true i've prayed five prayers yesterday alhamdulillah and allah forgives from one prayer to the other this means my ability to do sin is great i can i think i can do this when i make umrah i'm close to makkah when i make umrah come back what is the first thing i do i pray to allah azza because i'm a good believer and my records are clean no i turn on the tv and watch a soap opera or a movie why my records are clean so i am starting all over i think i can afford to sin a little bit this is how shaytan comes to you this is exactly how shaytan comes to you after a form of worship he tells you you're a great man sin and that is why scholars say maybe a sin would make you enter paradise while a good deed would make you go to hell how is that they said a good deed would make you feel proud of yourself and would give you confidence that alhamdulillah practicing muslim allah loves me which entitles me to do sins or at least to feel arrogant over others you're not like me i'm sheikh what are you i'm a scholar i'm a guy i'm a person of knowledge all of you are nothing your aunts this good deed made me go to hell because of what's in my heart while that person who sinned he made the sin and after making this thing you say allah what have i done and he starts to repent ask allah for forgiveness and feel remorse it's not enough i have to do more so he prays night prayer no no it's not enough i have to recite the quran i have to go for umbra i have to participate in da'wah i have to uh give leaflets i have to do this so he keeps on doing good deeds because of that sin and he ends up where in the highest levels of paradise because of a sin so always have your trust in allah azzawajal always be positive but when you're alive now always be afraid when you are on your dying bed your fear should be much much less but your hope in allah's forgiveness in allah's mercy must be overwhelming because this is the time for thinking well of allah and trusting allah subhanahu wa as the prophet says no one should die except thinking the best of allah you"
