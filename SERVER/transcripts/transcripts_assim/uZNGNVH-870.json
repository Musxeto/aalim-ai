  "transcript": "from the us um i have trouble like pronouncing certain letters and when i recite i like repeat the ayah over and over like to see if it's sorry do i have to keep doing this or is one time enough mahmoud do you do this in loud raqqa's or silent rakaas uh outside when i'm reading the quran so you're doing it silently yeah this is shaytan why listen and look at me i'm gonna recite the fatiha silently or as if i'm reciting it from the quran i mean so now shaytan comes to me and say him you did not say it right maybe you said maybe you did say okay this is there is no wind coming to my vocal cords my tongue is not going exactly where it's supposed to be because this is a silent prayer island recitation so this is shaytaan messing up with you ha you cannot tell unless i pronounce it loudly so when you get these thoughts do not repeat the i this is from shaytan messing up with you continue to pray and you're on to recite and that's totally legitimate you"
