  "transcript": "okay so nadine from the uae says that insurance medical insurance is compulsory in the united arab of uh the united arab emirates so uae whatever so the company provides him and his family and his dependents with insurance but whenever you go to visit a hospital they charge you 20 dirhams so is this permissible or not the answer is medical insurance as long as it is provided by your employer you have the full right to benefit from it all the way because the sin is not on you the sin is on those who are provide engaging in it and the sin is not on the company because they're following the laws so there's no sin on you now if the requirements are that you pay 20 dirhams to get checked by a doctor or to get an x-ray or to do this or that there's nothing uh there's no problem in availing it and using it insha'allah"
