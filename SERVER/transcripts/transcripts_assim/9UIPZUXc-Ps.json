  "transcript": "[Music] people so often say you only live once and usually they say this when they are justifying their carelessness or justifying the desires and lusts and maybe the sins they fall into and this statement is correct to those who do not believe in the existence of Allah the creator of the heavens and the Earth to those who do not believe in the existence of the Supreme Being who has created us and that is why you find a lot of the people un willingly dodging the idea of the existence of a Creator so they live and they die only for the sake of this life and if you look around you you don't have to be a rocket scientist to discover that everything around you is a sign of perfection unfortunately we always tend to be pessimistic not optimistic we tend to look at the empty half of the cup rather than seeing the full half of the cup so when you tell people to look around them they will tell you look at the tsunamis the volcanoes the earthquakes and this is all what they can see something that happens once every blue moon they do not look at the Perfection around them in their bodies in the world of plants and animals in this huge and vast universe everything there's a sign that tells you this was created by the Almighty allaha and how is that well look at how men are created the perfection in their creation how strong how agile how quick how smart how intelligent they are look at the universe look at this beautiful sun that Allah has created if it draws closer to Earth miles only it will burn it and everything on it and if it goes further away from Earth miles only everything would become Frozen on it who made this Perfection who made these beautiful animals the fish in the sea the trees and the leaves that fall from them it is only Allah if you look at one single organ you'll find that an eye is so perfect that people are unable to manufacture anything similar to it with all their technology yet Allah created how many billions of humans do we have on Earth six Allah created 12 billion eyes existing on Earth not only that Allah has created these eyes that are being created in the wombs of pregnant women so give or take two three additional billion of eyes and Allah created all of this not only that look at the number of fish in oceans and seas how many eyes do they have look at the number of animals how many eyes do they have look at the insects how many eyes they have and this is only created by Allah who created everything if you look at it you realize that this Perfection was not made by itself and this is why Allah asks a question rhetorical but for those who have Minds to ponder upon Allah says have they been created by nothing or have they created themselves it can't be either you created yourself and this is no one says this no one says I've created myself or something that is nothing created us and nothing creates nothing therefore the only logical explanation would be something has created us and this thing Muslims believe to be Allah the almighty because whatever created this Perfection has to be wise has to be knowledgeable has to be strong has to be providing has to be a sustainer and these attributes and qualities can only exist in the OWN Almighty Allah who has no Associates people say live because you only live once if I were to only live once what stops me from killing people what prevents me from stealing whatever I desire what is the obstacle between me and whatever I desire desire and wish for if I'm only going to live this life definitely I'm in the wrong business I should be doing anything that crosses my mind because at the end of the day I'm going to turn into dust I'm going to die and there's no accountability there is no questions to be asked at the end of the day when I die there is no day of judgment if this is the case then I should enjoy my life to the fullest and could care less about what people feel I could care less about what people possess because it's mine I'm the strongest I can take it with my power if this is the case then life would become a huge jungle yet with the grace of Allah this is not the case we live on Earth but this is a transition IAL period as we know a Muslim is the happiest person on Earth why they're not as Rich they're not as powerful they're not as educated as us true but a Muslim has the answers for all the questions that that the non-muslims are suffering to find a Muslim knows what he was created from ask any Muslim who is your great great great grandfather and he would tell you Adam and Eve Allah created Adam with his own hands the almighty Allah and we are the descendants of Adam non-muslims would say I don't know my great great grandfather might be an ape might be a champane I don't know so they don't have the answers to such questions a Muslim does not feel depressed maybe it comes and goes but he's not always depressed why because he knows that Allah created him for a purpose so I know the reason of my existence is to worship Allah the almighty a Muslim knows how his life is going to end so he sees this to be as a Target I'm going to die but this is the conclusion of this stage after my death there will be an eternal and everlasting life so what we live in at the moment is a transitional period 60 years 80 years 100 at most and then you will die once you die your life and your actual life begins we are not here to stay this is only only a phase this is a stage it's a transitional period and then it will take us to an everlasting eternal life however it depends whether it's Hell or Heaven whether it's fire or Paradise what we do in this life will affect our destiny in the Hereafter so I ask you this isn't it time for you to listen to your heart to listen to the sound that's echoing in your brain isn't it time to apply your intellect and logic to find out whether this is the last we will see of this world or that there is a window of opportunity for a longlasting and eternal life believe in the Hereafter believe in Allah Asel and you will find true happiness"
