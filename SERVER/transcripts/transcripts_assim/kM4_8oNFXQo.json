  "title": "Prayed maghrib AFTER Isha due to the muathin calling isha late, valid? What to do for past mistakes?",
  "transcript": "We have brother Omar from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. So I was living in a Muslim country during Ramadan and one thing which I didn't realize is that they push the Isha time 30 minutes later than usual. And so sometimes I prayed Maghreb during this 30 minute window thinking it was still Maghreb time. I only found out afterwards that it was you know actually the Isha was pushed backwards. So is my Salat for those Maghreb Salat accepted or not? Okay so what are the options? And people usually ask this question. Sheikh I woke up late and it was a minute or two before sunrise and I went to the toilet and I did wudu as soon as I can and then I prayed and then after finishing the prayer I found that it is four or five minutes overdue. So is my prayer valid? That's a valid question. Now I'm trying to teach you how to fish instead of coming for me asking for a fish every day. What are your options? And this is what I usually say to people in counseling sessions. They have a long problem. They could spend hours talking. Cut to the chase. What are your options? So my option Sheikh is that Maghreb prayer that I prayed off time is valid. Alhamdulillah. My second option no it's not valid which is most likely because I prayed it after time. Okay any third options? I don't think so. If it's valid we have no problem. If it's invalid what are you going to do? Pray it over again. Why? Because I prayed after the time was over. Okay if you pray it again what are you doing? Praying it after the time was over. So there's no point. Okay Sheikh again in a nutshell what should I do? Answer is nothing. Why? First of all because you've already prayed it after the time was over. Secondly I should ask myself am I sinful or not? And the answer is definitely not. Why? I purposely delayed the prayer. You did that purposely but you did not know that the prayer time was over. And Allah stated in the last ayah, the last ayah of Surah Al Baqarah رَبَّنَا لَا تُؤَاخِذْنَا إِن نَسِيْنَا أَوْ أَخْطَأْنَا Oh Allah do not hold us accountable if we were to forget or to make an error and you made an error. So Allah will not hold you accountable. End of story. So I hope this answers your question, Akhi Omar. I am entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
