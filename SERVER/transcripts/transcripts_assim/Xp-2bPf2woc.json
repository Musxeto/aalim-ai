  "transcript": "oh ah in the chapter we're studying is the chapter that deals with rusul the obligatory or the total bath and the hadith we have before our hands is hadith number 100 and who among us will read in sha allah brother muhammad all right narrated by may god be pleased with him allah's messenger taking a bath on friday is a must for every adult okay i think that the following hadith is also connected to it so i think it's relevant that we also read it brother muhammad whoever performs a pollution on the day of juma has done a good thing and whoever takes a path takes taking a bath is better for him now these hadiths seem to conflict with each other because the first hadith tells us that it is a must it's mandatory to take a bath on the day of jummah and the other hadith tells us that if you take a bath it's good and if you perform ablution it's also good so it's better to take a bath but evolution does the job so what is the verdict on friday's obligatory bath is it a must or not if you look at the first hadith you will see that the prophet says it is a must on every adult and this include females includes women but the consensus of scholars that women are exempted from this hadith they're not included so there are loopholes in this hadith that one could follow and say well then if if they're exempted from this hadith why not males also to be exempted from this hadith why make it a must in the first place and if we if you read the hadith the original hadith it has a prolonged virgin a longer version that says the prophet salallahu said that taking a total bath on the day of friday is a must on every male adult and the siwak and putting perfumes so the consensus of scholars that using the siwak if you remember the the the the thing that we brush our teeth with uh uh using this whack and performing and putting perfume for the day of jummah is not obligatory it's not a must so the prophet said having a total bath using the swag and putting perfume so the scholars have two different opinions the majority say it is not a must it's preferable and a big chunk of scholars a lot of other scholars say no it is a must to take the obligatory pre uh bath why is that they say because this hadith says that we should do it and there's another hadith that states that uthman ibrahim may allah be pleased with him came to the mosque while um the second caliph was delivering the speech and he came late so ramar did not address earth man directly he said how come some people come late for friday it's not a good thing to do to make it a habit to come late on fridays while the imam is is giving the speech so utman spoke out and he said well khalifa or caliph of of of the messenger salla sallam excuse me pardon me but i did not realize it was friday uh prayer until i heard the adhan of the the mosque so i immediately performed the evolution and came to the mosque said you performed evolution and did not wash for us did not make kosher you do not take obligatory uh uh bath turtle bath don't you know that this is a must so scholars say omar telling us man that he should have taken a total bath means that it's a must in another hadith may allah be pleased with him told his son to perform russell for friday so the son said his son said that i have performed russell after having intercourse with my wife he said no this is not enough make another one for friday so the group of scholars that say that said that it's obligatory they have evidence from the hadith of the prophet from the actions of umar and from the actions of saturn of now those who say no it is not obligatory say it because of the hadith of the prophet allah when he said it's a must on every adult plus siwak plus perfuming and the later two is not a must it's a sunnah it's preferable so why not make the first one also likewise a preferable thing to do and again they have other evidences such as even abbas may allah be pleased with him explains to us when someone of some of his companions came to him and said ibn abbas uh is showering is taking the obligatory bath for jummah a must or it's recommended preferable he said i'll tell you the story behind that at the time of the prophet allah all the companions used to work where did the companions used to work uh fadi in the market markets mohammed factories seaports mustafa marcus medina what was medina famous for creating medina dates farms it was filled with farms so most of the companions used to work in farming so even abbas explains they used to work in farming from early in the morning and they used to have only one garment they didn't have you know a wardrobe full of suits and armani's and versace or whatever they had only one garment that protected them and that you know covered their bodies so in usual it was made of wool and wool is very tough and it's very hot therefore whenever they came to the mosque for friday a prayer and they all sat down they started to smell and they of course you don't feel comfortable when everybody else is smelling including yourself you feel agitated so they felt very bad about it so the prophet ibrahim the prophet came to them and said that it is a must on every adult to wash himself himself once a week and this was the uh origin of washing or taking the total bath for jummah so from this ibm abbas tells us that this means that if you are clean and you do not smell then you don't have to take a bath it's okay that you do not bathe for jumu'ah for friday and the other hadith of samara the prophet tells us whoever bathes this is great but whoever performs evolution this is acceptable if you perform evolution for jumrah this is acceptable but it's greater that you take a total or obligatory uh bath now the thing that i would like to point out is unfortunately there are some muslims that smell and this is unacceptable you should always maintain to have a good smell in your body you know some of the brothers have odour and some of the brothers once you smell them he says oh dear this is too much and and they should do something about it and islam tells us you have to wash you have to shower you have to clean yourself now it doesn't tell you go to the extent of buying deodorants and put perfumes and put makeup on no not to that extent but you have to maintain the minimal level possible which is you must not harm others with your smell and that is why in islam you're not allowed to enter the mosque if you have eaten onions or garlics though it's something useful for your body but imagine you sitting and we see this among some of the brothers you know them in prayer and magritte and the imam says well he says and this odor comes out and you see people left and right falling on the floor of the smell what the heck this is unexpected acceptable prophet salallahu tells us that the angels are annoyed with the things that annoy humans such as onions garlics and so on so a muslim is always clean and smelling nice you cannot call people to islam when you're smelly or when you're dirty and you can afford not to be now i'm not talking to a poor person that has nothing he cannot buy soap uh soap he cannot buy a deodorants he cannot buy perfumes this guy needs charity i cannot tell him don't come to the mosque no come into the mosque it's allah it's allah's house it's allah's place of worship but if you can afford it then this is unacceptable the prophet salallahu once saw a man and the man was poorly dressed and his hair was untidy so the prophet asked him do you have money he said yes he said what kind of money he said all kinds prophet i have camels i have cows i have sheep so the prophet said subhan allah allah if he blesses someone and gives him wealth he he would like to see it apparent on his appearance so the man went and he put some oil on his head he calmed it uh and he dressed nicely he washed and perfumed and came to the prophet and the prophet was satisfied with him this does not mean that you go and spend thousands and thousands on designers clothings or or on expensive watches and no this is not what allah wants you to show off he wants you to be to be properly dressed clean and you don't smell and that is why the scholars say that it is not a must for you to take a total bath obligatory bath for jummah unless you smell if you smell then you have to take a bath and you it's recommended highly recommended that you have a set of clothes specially designated to be worn in uh jummah or in eight as the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam used to do we have a short break so please stay tuned and we will be right back inshallah in your stand point of view are there specific or certain criteria to choose your spouse or a partner to marry or not to marry maybe that's the question do we revise the quality of performance of our treatment between the family members as fathers or mothers as they say usually it's not what you say it's how would you say it wouldn't you like to be a good storyteller for your kids neurobiologically speaking child abuse and emotional trauma causes scars in the brain of the child and this might be not easily healing what's the exact job description of a father is it closing payments and feeding or other important things well i think the job description of a father is merely giving him love and care self-confidence giving him sense of security and checking for the points of strength to stress on them what about potty training and its planning oh yeah actually it's a state it's a condition fatherhood is not a body or a person it's a state are you a good or skillful designer for the policy and the long-term plans of your the life of your kids join us every wednesday for family issues and welcome back just before the break we're talking about russell al-jumura and if it's obligatory or recommended and the question to you mustafa is what was the verdict the final verdict that it is recommended or preferred that we do that is correct the authentic and correct most correct verdict is that it is recommended and this is the choice of ebentaymia may allah have mercy on his soul he said that it's recommended unless a person smells and if he has an odor then he it's a must that he performs uh obligatory uh obligatory bath the following hadith is read by noor okay narrated by ali may allah be pleased with him the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam used to teach us the quran except when he was in a state of sexual impurity okay the hadith was narrated by ali the prophet sallam used to teach us the quran except when he was in the state of sexual impurity unless he was junob and we discussed this issue before so i don't think we have to uh go through it again but just as as a reminder now there's a difference between touching the holy quran and reciting it we said that the consensus of scholars the four schools of thought in islam the school of abu hanifah malik ashafi and they all agree that it is forbidden to touch the holy quran there is no difference among them in this issue and we said that reciting the quran there's a difference between a person who has a sexual impurity due due to intercourse and administrating woman now in the case of sexual impurity janaba it is far easier to get rid of this state than it is with a woman in her monthly period because this woman may take seven days eight days to get pure and in the case of a woman that has given birth to a child she would probably take 20 30 maybe 40 days until she's pure so by us coming to her and telling her you must not recite the quran that would be too much asking too much because one should always be connected to allah azzawajal in the case of this janub in the case of this person with sexual impurity he would not last more than four or five hours because prayer is coming so he has to perform whistle and pray so if we tell him stop these two three or five hours without reciting the quran that would not be asking too much of him so the authentic inshallah and the correct verdict is that they should not read the quran just to be on the safe side the one that has sexual impurity except if you recall fatty yeah if he he's gonna recite it before he goes to bed okay and and we justified this by saying that the supplication that one says before going to bed he's not considered to be reciting the quran though he is reciting either the last three chapters of the quran but he's doing this because he is doing it as a form of supplication before going to sleep so this is a agreed upon and it's okay for a person to do that now the hadith ali tells us that the prophet used to teach us the quran the only thing that would prevent him from teaching us the quran is being on the state of sexual impurity and this is acceptable and we said that one should avoid this um i think that this is all that we have uh regarding this hadith we spoke earlier about not miss using the quran by hanging it in your our necks or putting it under pillow or putting it in our cars as a protector and this is not acceptable or permitted in the quran in islam because this is insulting the quran quran has been revealed to the prophet has been given to us so that we can read it and do and apply what's in it the instructions that are embedded in it not to hang it on walls or to hang it on a necklace or to put it in a car or in a flight kit or whatever father you had something to ask yeah i have a question so if someone recites the quran in a state of when he's impure during daytime and not a night has he committed this in if he does so or not it's a rule of thumb always put it in your mind whenever we say that this is forbidden or not permissible or haram this means that whoever does this has committed a sin now sins vary there are major sins and there are minor sins but still there are sins and whenever we say it's obligatory mandatory you have to you must then this means that if you do not do it then you have committed a sin now preferable things we say it's preferred that you do this it's recommended that you do this if you do them you're rewarded but if you don't you're not a punish for that this would not be considered a sin because it's preferable it's not obligatory and on the other hand the not recommended things and al-makru if you do them there isn't a sin on you but if you abandon doing them if you do not do them allah will reward you for that and then there's the last and final thing which is in between which is what is permissible so everything in this life has five names or five is divided into five categories it's either obligatory on one side or forbidden or it's either recommended and preferable or not recommended or not preferable and the fifth one which is permissible whether you do it or not is up to you must i drink this glass of water one says it's recommendable no it's not one says no it's not recommendable no it's not again so what is it it's permissible if i drink it it's okay if i don't it's okay when does it become obligatory for me to drink this glass of water if i am going to die out of thirst and i don't want to drink this water i'm going to die it's obligatory for me to drink it when it's forbidden for me to drink it if i am fasting or if there is najasa if there is filth then it's haram i know it it's haram for me to drink it or if it's poisonous so you always have to label everything whether it has these five categories forbidden obligatory preferred not preferred and permissible so we come back to uh your question your question was i forgot when you recite the quran during daytime and not at night you told us we're supposed to stay away from it yes if we do it's not sin yes that because during the day time or night time it is forbidden for you to recite the quran when you are on the on the state of sexual impurity unless it is part of supplication so whether the timing doesn't matter it has no significance whether it's day or night the state you're in is what matters here um again i think we should go on to the following hadith hadith number 100 if one of you has sexual intercourse with his wife and wishes to repeat he must perform ablution between them al-haqem added abolution makes one more active for repeating the sexual act now this hadith talks about performing evolution between intercourses if a person performs intercourse and wants to repeat this uh process again then it's recommended that he performs evolution before doing that and the prophet sallam justified this by saying it makes him fresh more active the following hadith hadith number 100 and 4 narrated by aisha may allah be pleased with her whenever allah's messenger salallahu sallam take a host meaning a bath after sexual intercourse he would begin by washing his hands then pour water with his right hand on his left hand and wash his sexual organs he would then perform abolution then take some water and run his wet fingers through the roots of his hair then he would pour three handfuls of water on his head then put water over the rest of his body and subsequently wash his feet agreed upon and the work and the wording is muslims muslim reported from maimuna may allah be pleased with her allah sallam poured water over his private parts and washed them with his left hand he then struck his hand against the earth in another narration he robbed he rubbed it his left hand with the surface soil and in the end of this narration then i brought him a tower but he returned it and began wiping off the water with his hand agreed upon now to go through this hadith i think we need some more time and we are just about to finish this program therefore i'll delay it to the next time we meet inshaallah and i'll conclude this uh program by elaborating a little bit on uh abolution after sexual intercourse now aisha tells us that the prophet saws has advised those who want to repeat the process of going back to intercourse again to wash to perform evolution is it a must no it's not a must but evolution itself reduces the heat and tension in a person and it refreshes him again and it we are ordered to uh perform uh evolution in a various of places such as before going to bed it is a sunnah that a muslim performs abolution before going to bed and why is that because the minute he does this allah azzawajal would have an angel protecting him and make praying for for this a man so with whenever he wakes up in the middle of the night whenever he wakes up because of his sleep on the street of pahara and he performed evolution the minute he wakes up and makes zikr and asks allah for anything allah will grant him this thing so the catch is that we all should perform ablution before going to bed so if we die we die on a street of tahara of purity and if we wake up we call allah azzawajal o allah grant us a good wife grant us wealth grant us health then allah will answer our call i'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program and until we meet next time was"
