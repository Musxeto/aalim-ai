  "transcript": "from the from saudi arabia he says is using masha allah in a mocking way kofor no the answer is not when i say at someone who prays for in front of me like sometimes i see one of my grandchildren praying and he does it from zero to 100 in like three seconds even maybe faster than a tesla so i say masha allah what a beautiful prayer am i mocking masha allah am i mocking subhanallah no i'm walking the way he's praying in a very hasty way so using this phrase has nothing to do with mocking islam at all in sha allah"
