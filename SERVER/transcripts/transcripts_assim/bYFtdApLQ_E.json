  "transcript": "I am just a simple man trying hard to understand where's my place in your great plan oh Lord help this man Lord dear brothers and sisters and welcome to a new episode of contemporary issues we have with us again our special guest welcome sheam is one of the well-known and Callers In The West he travels extensively to many countries around the world delivering lectures and he is the IM and a of a Masjid in jeda Saudi Arabia and he has been in such position for the last 21 years sheam last time when we were discussing on the show we were discussing the term uh or or contemporary issues and what this means to Muslims and how to how the scholars derive rulings for this issue we also discussed looking at it from an overall uh point of view and we were briefly getting into the issue of how to categorize uh the the Contemporary F issues if you could elaborate please okay we mentioned that we have to first of all visualize an incident in order for us to be able to understand it so if there is something that's contemporary a physician would be the best person to explain it to a scholar in order for the scholar to be able to know what ruling to give yet this physician would not be suitable to give the verdict whether it's permissible or not permissible because he's not equipped with the Islamic knowledge and tools of science likewise if we want to talk about Finance transactions a person from the finance world would be the most suitable person to explain and elaborate on how things are going to a scholar of religion therefore we have to first of all visualize it sometimes without visualizing it you give the wrong interpretations the wrong rulings on a particular issue for example if we look at what is known as suicide bombing and some would call it missions of marm they would think that if you do this if you blow yourself up you're a martyr and on the other side there are Scholars that would call him a person who committed suicide without visualizing how this takes place you cannot give the correct fatwa because the most authentic opinion is that suicide bombing is suicide regardless of the benefits who is the one who pushed the button it is you who's the one who who pulled the trigger it is you so you are actually killing yourself and in so many incidents and cases a person kills himself without killing anyone else or kills indiscriminately kills children women and in Islam we're obliged and we're instructed not to kill the elderly women or children only those who fight us only Warriors so by doing this you're actually not killing others you're killing yourself you're committing suicide and you're going against Islam when a scholar gives a fatwa if he does not look into these aspects he would give the wrong fatwa and that is why visualizing it is very important after you visualize something then you move on to categorize it and you go to the scholar of Islam and ask him about what category does this incident fall under and the scholar has to follow a process first of all he visualizes it and then he goes on to see does it fall under a evidence from the Quran Sunnah or the consensus of Scholars for example we gave that last time we met an example of electrocution This falls under a dead animal which was not electrocuting the animal yes yes to execute we as Muslims cannot eat an animal unless it is slaughtered islamically by a Jew Christian or Muslim and it has to be slaughtered so if it was killed before being slaughtered this is considered to be a dead animal whether it was killed because it fell from a mountain or it was hit on the head or um it was um electrocuted or it was um suffocated it or whatever it's still a dead meat so even though there's no direct ruling from the Quran or Sunnah that says if you electrocute an animal to slaughter it this is not considered lawful slaughtering we can devise or the scholars can devise by the evidence that if an animal dies by any other means other than slaughtering it's considered dead meat so there is a direct ruling exactly this is exactly true we can give another example for uh for example wearing a wig in Islam the prophet told us about that it is for bidden for a woman to connect false hair to her own hair but this is not connecting false hair this is putting a whole thing on top of your head that looks like hair so does it take the same ruling the the answer is yes because it falls under the same evidence and you can also uh uh talk about visualizing or citing the moon because nowadays we have people saying that can we calculate where the moon is going to appear and when the moon is going the chent is going to be born instead of just visualizing and citing it and the prophet clearly said that you have to fast once you cite it and you have to break your fast which is once you cite it so this is something that was spoken for the prophet already had Drew draw uh had drawn the the line for us in this aspect but regarding contemporary issues since there's something that fell upon the Muslims as you explained for us in the last episode it's not something that we can directly take from the Quran and Sunnah and something that the scholars really have to derive so we mentioned from those issues that they have to look at first they have to see it from an overall point of view and they have to look at the experts for said field what they explain so they have to have knowledge of what they're talking about uh then we discussed briefly of how to categorize so how would they categorize this well act as I said categorizing it Folds under four main branches first of all they would categorize it if there's a verse of the Quran Sunnah or the consensus that falls under it okay if not they go to uh uh um type B which is looking at an incident that took place before which was a nazila at the time and Scholars gave fatwa on and nowadays this incident that we have falls under the same fatwa or is similar to it for example I give an example of uh an open bouet eat as as much as you can there isn't anything that covers this but if you look in the books of f you would find that Scholars gave an example of the public baths if the consumption of water in public baths differ from one person to the other so if someone with like a 450 lbs takes a bath is different than someone who takes 100 who weighs 150 pounds so the consumption of water of soap of whatever is different yet the price is the same and likewise in open bouet they make an average and people might eat a lot and others might eat might not yet the price is the same so the variation of size and the consumption is negligible as Scholars uh uh say"
