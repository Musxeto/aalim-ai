  "title": "Let's talk part.2 - Huda Tv (Giving the best of you to Islam)",
  "transcript": "in reviewing it I think another question has has come to my mind that I think maybe we need to to address uh when we say as is the topic of this episode that Muslims should work harder at their religion and being good Muslims and spreading the correct uh message of of Islam are we also are we saying that we should also put our doing our best at work and at home and in school on the back burner or are we not saying that well if we looked at the typ of this segment probably we would yeah but the prophet gave us the answer to this question by saying that Allah the almighty loves when some of you is doing a task that he perfects it and this goes all over so it goes with propagation of Islam it goes with your performing forms of worship and it goes with your daily job with your studying in in in University or at school it is a concept that all Muslims must perfect that whenever you do something do it in the best fashion possible and that is why this one of the brothers who was asked he justified the early Muslims by saying that they gave all what they had to modernize the science say and develop and improve what they had at the time and this is the the the the the technology that we're enjoying nowadays is the result of their studies and their hard work yet we have to be careful when we generalize and say that these scientists were Muslims because some of them had corrupt ideology and they had only Islam by the name nevertheless we have proper practicing Muslims who were scientists who um added a lot to uh science and and Technology without compromising their own religion and this is the balance that we have to have it is almost impossible to say that what are you doing you're doing more to Islam or you doing more to science or your school or your family or as I said in the very beginning it is you're putting everything in a blender and at the end of the day you are doing what Allah wants you to do because you're practicing uh uh you're a practicing Muslim and your Islam tells you to perfect everything that you do so to be clear you would say that the message is nothing should be done half-heartedly right we if we're going to do it whether it's school or being Muslim we should do both of them 100% to the best of our ability this is what Allah says in the Quran Allah says in the Quran prepare whatever you can of force to fight the enemies whatever you can so in order to prepare this you need to have rocket science scientists you have to have people who know technology who know engineering who know medicine who know uh n nanosciences and Technologies everything in all aspects but this would not inter interfere with your worship of Allah because this is part of your worship of Allah but if someone comes and says listen I have to work in the lab I can't pray couple of prayers so I'm going to skip it because I'm working for Allah no this goes beyond the red lines that we're not supposed to well what if someone isn't going that far let's say he's not missing his Salah but he gets so wrapped up in his work that maybe he isn't spending as much time with his family as he should or maybe he's not missing his Salah but he delays it to the last minute and he's not really focusing cuz he's thinking about what's going on in his school or his lab or something something like that would you say that that's like a warning sign that he needs to sort of rep prioritize definitely he has a problem with priorities because there are no NOS there are red lines that you should not cross at all and among these things are your prayers you cannnot uh uh delay them or not pray them with congregation because these are your priorities now the family you have to have someone to take care of them if there's no one except you and you're focusing on something else then you have a problem because you are choosing something that is not the appropriate thing and I give you an example in forms of worship a lot of people may understand this if you are in the last 10 nights of Ramadan and let's assume you are on the 27th of Ramadan and the Imam is praying prayer or night prayer which is the most preferred prayers to Allah at that time and you instead of praying with them say to yourself no I'm going to make ta around the Kaa and make and this is rewardable by Allah It Is rewardable by Allah but at this particular moment the best thing you can do is to pray with the congregation and supplicate to Allah and you can delay this later on so you have to prioritize in order to reach what Allah wants from you very good okay I think at this point we're going to go to our audience and see if they have any questions Alum go ahead yes I would like to ask that if you see a friend for instance at a university doing something wrong for instance talking to a girl should you pull him to the side and say this is wrong or should you uh leave it for later or or ask him for a double date tell him at all well definitely it is not to pull him and put yourself in a situation that is is not something to be praised for what you should do is whenever you see something that is wrong you have to tell people educate people and you have to change this Vice as the prophet said whenever you see Vice you should change it with your hand if you have authority with your tongue if you don't have authority but you can advise and with your heart if you are hope uh helpless and the only thing you could do is just you know uh try to change it with your heart by by moving out by leaving the place so if you see someone like this you should advise him but you should pick the right moment if you advise him in front of his girlfriend he's going to feel insulted and he would like to PR to prove his manhood in front of her so probably he would say bad things to you and maybe curse Islam and maybe commit something that would make him an apostate God forbid so you should keep this in mind once you see him you can write him an email you can send him a letter you can talk to him in the evening and not straightforward you know just give it like five six minutes and then go into the subject but this is the proper Muslim who is not impersonating something he is not but he who is actually believing in changing the whole world to what pleases Allah within his capacity so whenever I see something that is not in accordance to what Allah wants I try my best and my best has limitations I try my best to change this but I would not allow Satan to execute my heart I would not allow myself to have a dead heart whenever I see bad things happening I just look at them give it a smile and move away I have to have this in myself to be able to give all of me for the sake of Islam and give Islam my best efforts I have to comment on something you said because it's so perfect to something I witness with my own eyes you're saying don't correct him in front of his girlfriend he'll feel like he needs to say something and maybe he'll say something against Islam just in anger I saw this exact thing happen where I was with a Muslim friend of mine who's very outspoken but he's good Muslim alhamdulillah and we were walking in the street and he saw a guy and a girl way closer than they should have been and it was very obvious you know they weren't married or anything and he just my friend just told him fear Allah you know he said it very tough like that and they got in this argument which ended with the the guy with the girlfriend the brother with a girlfriend he said okay fine I'm a CF and he's not you know but he was angry so I just think it's amazing that you told this and I've seen this happen with my own eyes believe me it is the best way of calling people to Islam by just smiling at them so many times those who do wrong know that they're doing wrong but they don't need you to come and tell them because they wish that you're doing the same thing that they're doing in so many cases I drive by people by young young guys with their windows down in their cars and they're putting M&M or uh uh 50 cents or 25 cents or whatever and they're blowing their speakers out I I I bet you they don't betting is Haram I challenge you that they know nothing of what these guys are saying but they just you know cruising and doing this and being who I am I just simply drive next to them and say with a very big smile the first thing they do is they turn it off and I say may Allah forgive us all on the day of judgment and make us with the prophet and they say Allah do that for us thank you she I didn't do anything I just gave a smile and a Salam and it had it effect"
