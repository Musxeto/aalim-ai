  "title": "I take medicines, can I skip fasting? New revert finding difficult to Pray & Fast - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "unfortunately they're unable to pass due to medicine they um but recently i talked to them and they said that because they're having also trouble with you know they have trouble to pray the five people like they're trying but you know it's difficult for her and so she asked or she said that she's been quote-unquote fasting but still taking the pill um and that this felt like there's little kid for her and she was trying this for her first of all we pray to allah azzawajal that he makes her steadfast on islam and we have to look into her illness and her medication if it is a genuine illness and the doctor said that she must take this medication and she cannot fix her timings so that she takes it only at night time rather it is a must for her to take it during the daytime the answer is she cannot fast she must skip fasting until the course of her medication is over and then make up for her fasts later on in sha allah after ramadan is over but if the illness is not that serious or the medications can be delayed an hour or two taken straight after maghrib and straight before fajr in this case she must fast and she has no excuse as for the salat there is no excuse none whatsoever for her to skip a prayer the moment a person enters islam he's obliged to commit to the prayers the five daily prayers there's no excuse none whatsoever unless she's get she has her monthly excuse her monthly cycle then this is a different story otherwise she must pray standing up if unable sitting down if unable lying on her side no matter what happens she must pray on time finally a word of advice about if she's not one of your mahram you're not supposed to be in communication with her in contact with her this is one of the steps of shaytaan especially when she is a revert and shaytan makes her more beautiful than other women oh she's fresh she's just converted to islam she has no sins i'll have much reward teaching her etc all of this is from the whispers of shaytan what's halal what's haram is haram this is the basics in islam so what you're doing is not permissible if she's an mahram to you abu talha"
