  "transcript": "Sulaiman says can we recite the route to us like sleeping eating da washroom dua etc in the state of major sexual impurity so that man's question is regarding mentioning the name of Allah when a person is in his major ritual impurity is it permissible or not do rude is the Ordo word for salutation upon the prophet alayhi salatu salams so that the route is allah humma salli wa sallim ala muhammad whether the short version or the extended Ibrahimi virgin allahumma salli ala muhammadin wa ala muhammadin camel so later later he Mahima in Nagahama damaji so what's the ruling if a person is in his major sexual impurity major ritual impurity after having intimacy with the spouse or after ejaculating nocturnal emission that is what's your ruling on offering salutation upon the prophet alayhi salatu salam saying dua or a scar before going to bed or before eating or entering the washroom the answer is all of this is permissible and there's no problem in that what is problematic what is not permissible is for you to recite the Quran and this is backed by a hadith where Adam may Allah be pleased with him said that the prophet alayhi salatu salam used to recite the quran on all of his situations and nothing would prevent him from reciting the Quran nothing would block him from reciting the Quran except being in the state of sexual impurity this hadith you will find in the vast majority if not all books of  in the very beginning yet the hadith is not authentic and this is why a lot of scholars apply and implement the hadith because it's so famous though it is not authentic and because it is safer so the period of a person being in the state of major ritual impurity is very negligible it's a couple of hours maybe less the longest would be if a person goes to bed at night in such a state wakes up at such a time so it's like four hours or five hours but that's it so your need to recite the Quran as a form of worship is not that necessity not necessary now having said that anything else is okay so that car of going to bed is permissible for you to recite while you are in the major ritual impurity state sure but we have Quran in it I know you have Quran and there's no problem in that how what do you mean see the Quran you recite as part of the F car is different than the Quran you recite as a form of worship what you read is ayatul kursi the last two verses of surah al-baqarah the three holes wipe your body surah tauba Rock these are read as part of the bedtime of car and not as part of reciting a user of the Quran and worshiping Allah through that therefore scholars say that this is totally legit you are at car of leaving the house bismillah before you eat before you enter the toilet out of alignment hope Sahaba if all of this there is no problem in that none whatsoever you"
