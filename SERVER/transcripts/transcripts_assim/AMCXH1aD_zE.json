  "title": "A person being made imam",
  "transcript": "while my husband is saying prayers at workplace people join in with him and make him IM for the JAMA is this right or wrong because he didn't start prayer as an Imam this is right and the evidence behind this is the Hadith of Abbas may Allah be pleased with him when he spent the night once at his aunt's housea may Allah be pleased with her and the prophet woke up in the middle of the night and started to pray night prayer Abbas says I was pretending to be asleep but actually I was watching him and when I saw him start his prayers I stood to his left and started my prayer as well and the prophet pulled my ear and made me start uh stand at his right and we prayed from this Hadith we learn that the prophet who started Ed as an individual and did not start his prayer as an Imam changed his intention from being an individual into an IM when Abbas stood next to him so this is completely permissible and correct and legit and Allah Knows Best"
