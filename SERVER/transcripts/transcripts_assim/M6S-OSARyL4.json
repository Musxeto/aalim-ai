  "title": "How to deal with my Parents backbiting one another? Am I sinful for listening? | Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question was that i know that if a person is advising another person and even if he is doing backbiting he is not sinful for doing back biting but the scenario was that um i did not defend my mother in something that my father was saying bad about her and i agree that it was my mistake i should have defended her so my mother was advising me that see you should not have feared your father you should have said what is right in every situation you should say or decide so she was advising me in this way for a quite a long amount of time um so i wanted to ask am i sinful for listening to my biting here if she was saying bad things of course about my father okay while she was singing i will answer inshallah from india she says that i did a mistake my father once was bad-mouthing my mother in front of me and not only i kept silence silent i agreed so he said my your mother is so-and-so and so i said yes so my mother now when she heard about this she started scolding me and saying how you did this and not defend me how this and that so now she's doubtful is she sinful in both cases because her mother was also about mouthing her father the answer is yes she's sinful for in both cases and in her father's case she's more sinful because she approved something that is not true so not only she heard back biting she approved of it and said it was true though it was not true usually in fights and problems and issues between the parents the son or the daughter is caught between a rock and a hard place and imam ahmed the great imam of jamaa was asked once by a man and he asked him he said oh imam my father tells me to do something and my mother forbids me to do it what should i do so imam said obey your father and don't disobey your mother how is this he said this is the only answer i have he cannot say obey your father and neglect your mother and he cannot say to him obey your mother and neglect your father's instruction this is something you have to walk yourself out of it's a very thin line and yes it's hanging by a thread because pleasing one on the account of the other is sinful so how is it going to be done but in your case if your father started to bad mouth your mother you should have either politely defended her or sought permission and you should have uh seek permission and leave the room and not participate in such backbiting or slandering allah azza knows best"
