  "transcript": "shihab from bangladesh is doing the sunnah of culture an innovation to recap the things that the prophet had done islam either they are sunnah of worship or sunnah of culture and habit so when the prophet tells us asap to grow the beard and he grew it himself and he told us to go against the five worshipers the jews and the christians this is sunnah of worship the ruling is mandatory but he did it and we follow when the prophet says pray as you've seen me pray this is sunnah of worship and if you do it you're rewarded there are other aspects of sunnah which is called sunnah of habit of culture that the prophet used to do that does not relate to islam the way he sits to eat the way he wears his clothes or his hair what he rides on this had nothing to say that do this and you will be rewarded or allah would grant you this in this level in jannah or follow what i'm doing which makes it not part of the category of worshiping allah azza but the 1 million kuwaiti dinar question is if i do this sunnah of culture would i be rewarded for it or not it's an issue of dispute some scholars say that allah says in the quran in the prophet isaiah there is a role model to follow so allah is telling us he's a role model we should follow some scholars say we should follow in everything whether it's sunnah of worship or sunnah of culture others say no this is only to be followed in what is type of worship which is rewarded by allah how he wore his hair has nothing to do with worshiping allah azza not sitting on a chair and eating food doesn't mean i'm sinful and if i sit on the ground and eat on the floor i will be rewarded more because this is what the prophet did at islam these are sinners of culture so some scholars say yes you won't be rewarded for it would it be bitter the answer is no because scholars said that doing it would be rewarding now except if a person does something and the people are drawn back from it so one says okay i understand totally what you say so if i wear a kufi or a topi or something on my head only to pray would that be the answer is yes because you're doing it only for prayer if you do it throughout the whole day and night as a cultural thing thinking that the prophet used to always put something on his head and this this in this case is not a bidder but doing it only for salat this is a bidder if you decided to go to work tomorrow morning writing a mule saying that the prophet used to ride the mule we said no never wait wait this is an innovation because people would be drawn back they will abhor this they will resent it and they would probably speak ill about the sunnah when you say to them oh it's the sun of the prophet so definitely these things must be avoided in law knows best"
