  "transcript": "Salik from the Philippines. Salik. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Walaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Sir, Sheikh, is it impermissible for me to say istighfar 100 times after every fard prayer? The answer is yes. It is impermissible for you to say istighfar 100 times after every fard prayer. The reason is the Prophet ï·º taught us what to say after fard prayers, and the companions told us what he used to say after fard prayers, and none of the narrations that were given to us had him saying istighfar 100 times. This makes it an innovation. If you were to tell me, can I make istighfar 100 times any time of the day and night? The answer is yes. Sticking it to the fard prayer after every fard prayer makes it an innovation, and Allah knows best. Al-Fatiha."
