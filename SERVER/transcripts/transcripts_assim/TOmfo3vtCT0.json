  "title": "What goes around comes around Concept of Karma in Islam #Assim #assimalhakeem #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so my question is is there any concept of what goes around comes around in Islam for example if I bully someone or if I judge someone or if I hurt someone will I also get a same kind of treatment the concept of Karma and what uh uh goes around comes around is not an Islamic concept yes we believe that if you make a sin you'll be held accountable for it and you'll be punished for it if not in this life In Your Grave if not in your grave then in the Hereafter on the day of judgment but not necessarily if you bully someone someone else would bully you this might happen and this might not happen it depends on Allah's judgment AEL"
