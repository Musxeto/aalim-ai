  "transcript": "ababeel says what should be the ruling if the Imam made mistake in salat where he is required to do to Judas ah who the forgetfulness prostration but does not maybe because of him being unaware of the mistake itself is my prayer behind him valid first of all this depends on a number of factors one of them is whether the thing that Imam made a mistake in is it a pillar or a mandatory act so if he for example forgot to offer a prostration in one of the rock eyes instead of doing - he only prostrated once and continues his prayer and those behind him failed to notify him the answer would be this prayer is invalid if no one notified him and they continued following in such a grave mistake their prayer is invalid his prayer is still because once he finishes the prayer and they tell him listen in first Rock are you missed passage des he has to immediately stand up and offer a full complete raka in the place of that which was rendered void but if it was in a mandatory act so for example he said in the record Allahu Akbar and then when he raised up he said Allah ho Akbar instead of saying something Allahu Liman Hamidah out of forgetfulness and no one said Subhan Allah and he continued the prayer and finished it your prayer and his are valid but once he gives Salam you should tell him Imam you did the mistake you have to prostrate to prostrations he looks at the congregation they say yes you did that so he immediately offers frustration and no harm done let us say that he forgot you guys forgot and you went home the prayer is still valid due to forgetfulness and there's nothing wrong in that and there are a number of different cases that can be addressed but I hope this answers your question"
