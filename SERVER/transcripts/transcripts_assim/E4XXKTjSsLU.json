  "title": "Should we say Allahu Akbar at the end of 7th round of tawaf? #Assim #assimalhakeem assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "if one is doing ta and he begins the seventh round and he say he raises his hand at the Blackstone and says Allah abbar and he completes that round and he comes to the Blackstone again what he say Allah abbar and raise his hand again no when we begin ta we haven't started the round we sayb so we complete the round and then we say for the second round and so forth until we reach the seventh round we sayar once we finish it we don't say anything because if we say it this means that we're going for an eighth round so allahar is said in the beginning it's like saying she every time I stand up for prayer I say Allah abbar so after I give Salam and I want to stand up should I say allahar no prayer is over it's concluded you don't say that so you sayb in the beginning of the round not at the end of it and Allah Knows Best"
