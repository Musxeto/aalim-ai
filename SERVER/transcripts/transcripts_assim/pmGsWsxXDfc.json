  "transcript": "Yunus, from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi So Sheikh, I searched in Arabic, in English, maybe for hours, I sent a question to Islam Q&A and so on. I didn't find an answer. I don't know who to ask after you. So my mom cooks with nutmeg. It's like one teaspoon per week or so. And I removed the nutmeg. So she did it in the past. But what remains is these very small trays. It's unstable. You can't notice them on the plates. Like 0.1 grams or so. And I heard that one wine drop in food is too much. So if we say nutmeg is not nauseous, then it's cooked in a pot. And then the pot is wiped with a towel. If it was nauseous, it would still be nauseous. We have to remove every single tray like I would do with najas. So it's like this unseeable amount of excuse. I hope it's clear. It is clear, Akhi. Those who say that nutmeg is prohibited due to being an intoxicant, they do not say that it is najas. The issue of whether wine is najas or not is an issue of dispute. And great scholars of Islam stated that it is not najas physically. Because there is no ayah or hadith that states that it is The ayah that stated that it is najas, also with it in the ayah was mentioning gambling and drawing the lots and the idols. And these are not physically najas. So it has to be spiritually najas, sentimentally najas, but not physically. And among this, the evidence is that some scholars have used was the hadith of Anas, when the prohibition of wine was revealed in the Qur'an, all the companions poured it on the streets of Medina. And the Prophet did not tell them to avoid walking on the streets or to cleanse their shoes before praying because of its impurity or najasa. Therefore, coming back to nutmeg, even the scholars who say that it is intoxicant, they say that hashish or cannabis, whether marijuana or hash or whatever or pot, they say that physically it's not najas. If I touch it, I don't have to go and wash my hands before prayer because there is no impurity in it physically. Therefore, what you have done is sufficient and Allah azza wa jal knows best."
