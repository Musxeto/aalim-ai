  "transcript": "Bailey from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Assalamu Alaikum There is a hadith about reading 100 verses per night. So my question is in Isha prayer we recite This hadith is an authentic hadith where the Prophet ï·º said whoever recites at night prayer with 10 verses he will not be registered as the negligent. And whoever recites 100 verses at night prayer he would be among the qaniteen, those who prolong their prayers and make qunoot and stand up in recitation of the Qur'an. So this is not related to Isha prayer rather it's related It's an issue of dispute. I personally believe and I'm inclined to say that this is not part of may consider it to be part of the 100 ayahs but it's best to be safe rather than sorry and Allah knows best."
