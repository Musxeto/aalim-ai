  "transcript": "Yusuf from Egypt, Assalamu Alaikum, Assalamu Alaikum, my question is my my dad or I don't know me my mom they got a an idol in my house that it's like a Greek idol that people worship back then and still some people worship it so I searched them is it permissible for me to open the door and close it keeping in mind that there's a key chain in with my mom that has a cross on it so am I assisting in in shirk if I open and close it the door of the house no of course not there is no assistance in that it's like saying is there any assistance of shirk if I breathe the air around it so should I refrain from breathing until I suffocate and die nobody says this and opening and closing the door has no direct color coloration or relationship with this idol or that cross it has nothing to do that you're entering the room you're exiting the room you're admitting people in or out you're not assisting idol worshipers to come and worship it so these are two different things try to give advice with fair preaching and wisdom may Allah open their hearts and guide them to the straight path"
