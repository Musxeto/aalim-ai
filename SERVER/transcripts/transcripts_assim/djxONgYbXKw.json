  "title": "If a man divorces his wife 100 times in one sitting, it counts as one, but Umar enforced 3 as final",
  "transcript": "Z from Kashmir sh I just came across a post of yours on Instagram uh in which uh the question was related to the divorce and you told that even if a man divorces his wife 100 times it would count as a single divorce if he does it in one sitting but I have seen some contradictions according to the hadiths that say Omar changed it three can you please clarify this is the ruling that the prophet gave and this is an issue of dispute among Scholars for Layman like you you follow a Sheikh so that he would be able to give you the right verdict there are so many things that Scholars differed upon either because of the evidence is not authentic in their eyes or maybe it's authentic but it doesn't mean what you may think it means or it means what you you may think it means but it was abrogated to them so these issues of dispute among Scholars laymen are not qualified to look into it the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam made the divorce three times in the same setting as one so this is what a great group of Scholars followed and said this is the ruling of the Prophet Alat when Omar came may Allah be pleased with him and saw that the people were taking it as a game and they're playing and mocking the religion by divorcing and saying that no I did not intend it except one and they divorce and divorce and the divorce then he implemented it as a form of punishment so some Scholars follow follow that Omar is one of the four rightly guided Cals whom the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam ordered us to follow their Sunnah so this is why they differed but again Layman should not be involved in such differences because they are not qualified it will confuse them they cannot comprehend such differences"
