  "transcript": "so brother Abdullah from the UK says if the chairman of a Masjid prevents someone from giving the event does he have the right to do this that says yes he we cannot have the Masjid to be in chaos or anyone who comes in gives the Adhan at any time he wishes without knowing whether one he knows the beginning and the end of the times of the advance he has to have knowledge - is he qualified is his voices nice and beautiful three does he know how to give the Adhan for do we know him in the message so imagine that I go into a Masjid and I just go straight to the microphone turning on Allah who are you I'm a vigilante I am someone who's interested in giving the event I love the reward from Allah yes but you cannot come to my message and give that I than just like that so there has to be order likewise sometimes I've seen this in some message then is given people are sitting reading the Quran praying after 15 minutes all of a sudden someone stands up give a armour and he wants to eat and he's not the Imam and he's not even from the message what are you doing he said well it's late 15 minutes we have some errands to do and I have to leave early so I'd like to make this a lot meses not at all acceptable such a person should be pulled from his robe and thrown out of the message this is not your house to give a than any come in without the permission therefore as Muslims we are organized we have authority in every place we go to whom we are supposed to obey and look at the Masjid of al-haram muscle harem of Mecca you see a million people sitting talking walking doing this doing that the moment the Karma is given and the call for prayer is given less than 30 seconds they're all standing in rows shoulder to shoulder foot to foot nothing that is missing in that beautiful portrait perfection in 30 seconds this is a religion of order so in short no Fe you cannot go and just make a van when you want to if the authority in the Masjid restricts this to this person and this person and prevents others from doing this this is their god-given right"
