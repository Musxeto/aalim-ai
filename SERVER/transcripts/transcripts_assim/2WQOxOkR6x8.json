  "transcript": "Shareef from India. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Sheikh, my question is there is a transport service in India similar to Uber, where you book a cab and it comes to your house, but after it has arrived, for every minute that you delay, they add like three rupees to the fare. So is it halal to use this or is it riba? It is 100% halal. Their service starts from the moment they reach your home. Imagine, you're hiring me to do a particular service for you and it's counted by minutes. And I come and the first 10 minutes you're saying, okay, you can wait, I'm in the shower, okay, I'm drying my hair, I'm putting my clothes on, and you take 10-15 minutes of my time. And you expect me not to charge you for that? This is not fair. So this is totally halal and permissible inshaAllah. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days. And I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all. Al Fatiha."
