  "transcript": "[Music] oh [Music] ald we move on to a new chapter in the book a chapter beloved to those who are not married a chapter may be beloved by those who are married and may not depending on how happy their marriage is this chapter deals with marriage and the rulings related to marriage are plenty and a lot so you have marriage and if it is not successful you have divorces and with with divorces you have to know the number of or waiting period and so many things related to it such as the ruling on suckling or breastfeeding and when to do it and when not to do it also related toat which is maintenance and child support and the provision that has to go to the wife Etc the rights of the husband the rights of the wife the obligations on the husband obligations on the wife all of these are discussed in details in the books of f so we have Hadith number 302 and who will read that for us yes abdah reported that Allah's messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam said to us oh young men those among you who can support a wife should marry for it restrains eyes from casting evil glances and preserves one's private parts from fornication but he who cannot afford it should observe fast for it is a means of controlling the sexual desire okay this Hadith of Abdullah is an address to the youth and why not to the old people because the youth are in Greater need of getting married and the Younger You Are the more difficult for you to get married when you grow older this becomes easier so the prophet Al is addressing the young men and he says that whoever is capable to get married he should do so and what is meant by the ability to get married two things physical and economical oh or financial very good so these are the two requirements physically and financially the prophet is indicating that whoever is capable financially and physically to get married he should do so now what is the rooing on getting married and Scholars as usual put the five rulings on it it can be mandatory it can be highly recommended it can be permissible as it can be not recommended and it can be also forbidden depending on the situation if a person who does not have enough to support his family and he's unable to physically assume his responsibilities as a husband so neither physically nor financially and he gets married this is forbidden he's harming the other party in this marriage both physically and financially if a person has the wealth has the health and fears that if he doesn't get married that he will fall into Zena into the major sin of fornication marriage becomes mandatory upon him he has to get married because he's able and you can Cascade that to different uh sorts of scenarios as well what's the benefits of marriage there are tons of benefits of marriage Allah mentioned that in the Quran and he spoke subhah wa ta'ala about the compassion about the mercy about the care between the spouses and this can only be attained by marriage no matter how close your mother is no matter how close your father is no matter how close your brother and sister are again nothing takes the place of a good and righteous and caring and loving wife and those who are pessimistic would say she this is only found in Jenna a good righteous caring loving compassionate wife no no this is not true alhamdulillah we have millions of successful marriages and millions of practicing righteous caring loving sisters who are doing their job EXC excellently and that is why the prophet said that D this life we are living in is something that is Transit and it's not solid something that is pump and glitter of this life and the best of it is a righteous woman the best thing that a person could gain and part of the treasures of this life is a righteous practicing loving and caring wife and this goes for the Sisters as well the best thing that a sister could have is a loving and caring husband if he's Rich this adds value but if he's rich and not kind or compassionate this has no value none whatsoever among the benefits that the prophet has mentioned in this Hadith for marriage is that especially for the youngsters when they get married then this would help them to lower their gaze and it would help them to protect their Chastity because then they have no reason to go and look around or to do something Haram such as masturbation or such as fornication Zena all of these are sins and Allah described those who do such things as aggressors wrongdoers they are wrongdoers they are committing a form of transgression then the prophet gives a solution because the first thing that would cross one's mind would be I don't have money what can I do I cannot get married if this is the case the prophet gives you a solution for you not to fall into sin for you not to send your gaze or or not to fornicate then you have to fast because fasting would stop and prevent and reduce your desire to commit something that is Haram from this Hadith we learn the benefits or some of it of marriage and we learn also that it is something that is highly recommended providing that you can afford to do that now there are lots and lots of rules related to marriage which are not discussed here and it might not be the right place to discuss it because as stated before this is a summary of f for example there are pillars for marriage there are conditions for marriage there are marriages that are Haram among the pillars of marriage is the consent of both parties and that they are are able to get married a man cannot marry his aunt because she's among the Maham he's Maham to her he cannot marry his sister through suckling for example and so on so they both have to be capable of being married to each other there has to be consent so the guardian has to give his proposal and the groom to be has to give his acceptance without that the marriage is invalid so any woman that marries without a w a guardian her marriage is invalid and so on a lot of the Muslims unfortunately we find women asking the question and acting upon before even knowing the answer sheh I love this man in the university and my father is not willing to give him to me in marriage or give me to him in marriage so we went to the Imam of the Masjid and he made the contract and we've been living together is this acceptable the answer is no this is Zena your marriage is invalid because you have to have the approval of your guardian if the guardian is a wrongdoer himself you got a 100 proposals and he's refusing all of them without any legitimate reason you cannot still m without a guardian you have to go to the ruler to the Muslim judge who would look into your case and decide whether to give the guardianship to someone who's closer so instead of your father he gives it to your brother but this has to go through the Muslim judge or the Muslim ruler not by your own whims and desires so many things are connected to marriages the issue of Mahar or dowy or Sak is it a pillar or part of the conditions it must it be paid immediately or can it be postponed can the Mahar be paid from the girl to the boy as it happens in some cultures this is of course unacceptable the Mahar can only the da can only be given from the boy to the girl not the other way around some make the trick so the boy says in the contract yes I give 5,000 rupees as Mahar as to my wife to be but from under the table he requests the father to give him a car the uncle to give him a house and maybe six tons of gold and this and that what is this can a man accept such a thing he would not become a man the financial burdens of marriage could only be born by the husband by the man he is the one who pays and the woman is like a queen to have it the other way around this is wrong and we have lots and lots of unfortunately similar situations that you all know of maybe we will get some of your questions in the Q&A session and we will clarify this or if it's understood alhamdulillah we will keep on what we're doing so before moving to the following Hadith we have a short break so stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back [Music] a servant is not Afflicted with any punishment greater than having a

question me in De to [Music] ask dare to ask next on peace TV asalam alaykum and welcome back during the break we made an inquiry to the brothers whether they want the following Hadith or questions and we had many questions pending so we will devote this inshallah portion or this part of the show for questions and answers so we will take the first question the brother yes sh right now the says that marriage is not accepted when uh the lady has ref ref used to marry to the guardian that I don't want to marry the man so in the previous session we learned that friend says to another friend I would like to give my daughter to you and he accepts but the daughter refuses to marry the man okay that's a very good question marriage cannot be correct cannot take place unless we have two consents of the girl and of her guardian without these two consents the marriage is not correct so if someone proposes and the father meets him and he says wo this a good boyas I will give you my daughter and the daughter says I don't like him I don't want him no said I will force you he cannot force her the most authentic opinion of Scholars she cannot be forced so the marriage does not take place the opposite is the same if she comes with a boy and she says father I love this man and I want to to marry him and the father says Over My Dead Body and she says okay this would not happen of course but if he refuses totally and his refusal is justifiable if he's from a different country if he is from a lower class that would not be able to support his daughter in the same living standard if he is someone religiously unacceptable he doesn't pray think he and she loves him and this happens a lot women have a problem in making decisions that are suitable because they're emotional they think with their hearts so if they fall in love this may hinder their vision and they cannot see clearly not that men are always able to make the right decisions but it's a characteristic of most women that is why Allah says the approval of the Guardian is a must because he can estimate things he can evaluate things so I hope this answers your question the brother with a brown shirt you said that if a man cannot marry and he should fast how often should he fast very good the prophet told us that fasting cannot exceed a day on and a day off as in the Hadith of abdah may Allah be pleased with him and with his father he told him fast the fasting of David of D skip a day and fast a day now if the brother says when I skip a day and I don't fast it I may fall into sin in this case as a precaution he may fast the entire time because he's not doing it to get closer to Allah he's doing it as a form of treatment and prevention from falling into sin there's a couple of non-muslim who are married and one of them he a Muslim and accepts Islam yeah one of them becomes a Muslim so can they stay together or they have to be separated the answer is depending on the situation if both were non-muslims and one accepts Islam it depends who accepts Islam if it's the woman and immediately she has to separate from her non-muslim husband because a Muslim woman cannot marry anyone except a Muslim so if a couple non Muslim the woman accepts Islam she has to be separated from her husband who's not Muslim is she considered to be divorced or the marriage is void this depends on what happens next if she wants to marry someone else after the period She can marry whoever ever she wants but if she remains unmarried and after six seven years the man reverts to Islam and they would like to go back together do they have to make a new contract the answer is no because was married to the daughter of the Prophet z may Allah be pleased with him and her when she accepted Islam he didn't so she migrated to Medina and lived with the prophet Alam for a number of years then he accepted Islam and the prophet reunited them again without making a new contract alayum shum Salam when we speak about Guardian who shall be the guardian of a newly rewarded system the prophet saidat wasam that there is no marriage meaning valid without having a guardian and two trustworthy Witnesses and in another Hadith the prophet says whoever does not have a guardian then the sulan whether he's a ruler Muslim ruler or the Muslim judge acts as her guardian so if we're in a Muslim country you have no problem if you are in a non-muslim country and you do not have any judicial Muslim Authority you go to the nearest Islam Center and the IM or the leader of that Islamic Center becomes the ruler who takes or assumes the position of AUM a man adopts a boy a man adopts a boy a boy can he allow the marriage of the boy and his daughter okay can he marry his daughter to this adopted boy what do you think because there is no relation between the adopted boy and the girl of the man they're not brothers and sisters he's adopted in a sense that he's being raised in the house but there is no relationship he's not her there is no suckling between them there's no milk between them that forbids them from each other so there's no no problem in that yes so if the guardian does not agree that the woman should get married but still they get married so will this be considered as marriage of Z fornication if the father opposes and does not agree for his daughter to marry someone yet they still go ahead and marry one another is this marriage valid or not and the answer is it is not valid because the prophet said that there is no marriage without a w and this is called marriage that is void we have another kind of marriage which is B B and facet mean the same it's all invalid it's all void however B is when the marriage takes place with the consensus of Scholars that it is not correct when a man marries his sister through suckling two suckled from the same woman and they became brother and sisters through suckling and they got married this is B all Scholars agree on that a man married a woman without a guardian this marriage is FID why because there is a school of thought that allows this and this is reported through Imam Abu may Allah have mercy on his soul he allowed a woman to marry without a guardian but vast majority of Scholars say that this is Haram and the evidence supports this the Hadith of the Prophet supports this so the marriage is invalid can a non-muslim be a guardian of his daughter very very good question can a non-muslim be a guardian and the answer is no there is no guardianship for a non-muslim over a Muslim meaning if a sister accepts Islam and her father is still a non-muslim and I want to marry her I do not approach the father even if he opposes I have nothing to do with him her guardian is if she doesn't have any Muslim relative of hers her guardian becomes the Muslim ruler or the Imam of the Islamic Center yes brother today's world for being financially viable it's a long road boy has to go through academic learning and employ compet competition by the time he get job he's you know far he's on the higher side of the age now the the vulnerability has increased you know in this age of internet all that so looking to the that fact that Allah subhana tal has promised the risk and the prophet has commanded it early so is there any way and what according to you should be the ideal age well if I understand your question correctly nowadays it's the responsibility of the parents now usually if a boy goes to his father and says I want to get married he said no wait until you finish graduate from University and then get a job for seven years and collect money and you're capable of getting married then you get married and by the time he would be 35 years of age this is wrong if the father is capable it is his responsibility to open a house for his son or to let him marry and live with him in the same house and this is better than the boy being forced to face Haram or fall into Haram and this is happening in a lot of the countries alhamdulillah those who are open-minded and they have they're a bit well off they do this to the children because at the end of the day feeding one mouth it's similar to feeding two mouths it's not going to be a lot of expenses that I cannot bear and Allah knows best this is all the time we have until we meet next time [Music] oh [Music]"
