  "transcript": "fim from Bangladesh alikum shum sh to be very honest nowadays I find it really hard to find Halal earnings being an IT graduate suppose if I work as a web developer sometimes I have to work on projects like female under government websites with inappropriate images so if I refuse this project after a few more Halal projects there might be another Haram project so even if I change the track and shift to an AI related track sometimes there I also have to work with Haram project occasionally and if if I keep refusing Haram this is problematic from the company's end because no company allows an employer to pick and choose and shck I'm not a businessman material so I can't quit my job to start a business so given this situation how can I continue my career while maintaining my religious principles when you say sometimes for what is the other side sorry shake when you say sometimes there is Haram what is the other side of this equation I mean sometimes I don't have to deal with such Haram projects alhamdulillah for example alhamdulillah see the issue is everything in life has Haram and Halal and this is your test Allah cannot put you or would not put you on Earth without being tested as mentioned in the very first first two or three verses of Surah anab the spider do people think that they will be let alone to claim that we're Believers without being tested nay we have tested those before them and we shall test them so that it would be clear and proven who's telling the truth and who are lying so this is your test from Allah and alhamdulillah not all projects are related to female underwear alh and there are cars there are furniture There are uh Commodities there are food products gazillion options why only choose female underwear I don't know so there are many options now you're saying that not all companies it's true but there are companies that will accept so look you can say in the interview it depends on how high level your expertise are if you are a high level employee and they know that you are an artist and you are an excellent uh hardworking individual they will look the other side when you tell them listen I'll work for you but I don't deal with riba I don't deal with insurance and I don't deal with women uh photos and I'll design the web for you as much as you want they'll accept it and alhamdulillah you have the expertise to be a freelancer you can do work for people for half of the price they would get from such companies as yours and when they see the quality and the professionalism that you have you will get customers over and over and over again with time after the grace of Allah of course so believe that Allah is your provider believe in that that nobody can provide for you except Allah and if you seek Allah's provision through Halal ways Allah will give you without account the moment you have weak IM and think that oh I have to do something Haram otherwise I will not have a job look at these grocery shops in the middle of Muslim countries and they are mashallah practicing Muslim owners they pray in the first row of the Masjid you go to their grocery shops and at the counter you'll find cigarettes and tobacco this is Haram said I know with a big smile why are you selling it said because if I don't sell it people will not come to me and they will not buy groceries from my shop and I'll lose business said mashallah very smart remark I could not have seen it a mile away but let me ask you a question who's the Rak the people or Allah there's a big problem in people's understanding of the beautiful names of Allah and this is why when we say we have to focus on this yeah this is all what you guys do yes because this is what the prophet taught for 13 years in Mecca and then another 10 years in Medina a without AA you have nothing you have only rulings doesn't do you anything without if you worship Graves and you do everything correctly according to the you go to Janam to Hellfire for eternity because your a is corrupt if you don't know Allah's beautiful names If you deny Allah's beautiful names like many sects and Cults do and you see Allah doesn't have a face Allah doesn't have hands Allah does not have on the Allah does not speak Allah does not do who are you worshiping nothing so all of this is related to once you know that Allah is the then you have no problems or issues"
