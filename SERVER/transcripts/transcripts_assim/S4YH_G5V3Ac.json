  "transcript": "Raqib from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh, I made multiple promises to Allah in the past that I will not do this and this and that I broke them. I forgot the number of promises I broke and so I started fasting after estimating an amount. Recently I fell into a sin and a doubt hit my mind that did I promise Allah that I will not do this sin or not? And I'm not inclined to the either opinion like it's 50-50. So what should I do in this scenario? Should I just ignore the doubt or add three more fasts to my previously estimated number? First of all, when someone makes an oath to Allah Azza Wa Jal and breaks it, he's obliged to do one of three things. Either to feed ten poor people, ten poor Muslims, or clothe them, or free a slave. If he's financially unable to do any of the three of his choice, then he may move on to the substitute which is fasting three days. It is a misconception among Muslims that whenever they break their oath, they fast three days. Though they're financially capable. No, this is unacceptable. It does not expiate your oath. You have to feed, clothe, ten poor people, or free a slave. If financially you are unable to do any of these three, then you fast three days. Number two, if you don't have certainty that you made an oath and that you broke it, then ignore this whisper of shaytan and move on. If it's 50-50, there is no certainty, so there's nothing on you insha'Allah."
