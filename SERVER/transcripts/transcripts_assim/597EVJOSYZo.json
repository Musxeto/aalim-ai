  "title": "35 years old & yet not married, when is the right time to get married? (Girls rejecting proposals)",
  "transcript": "this I am 35 years old when I see people getting married so [Music] foreign to get married I don't know I don't have boys I only have girls I only have daughters no boys everyone on Earth is being tested by Allah married or an unmarried so those who are married they're being tested and those who are single they are being tested my problem is that the test of Allah is manifested in different ways we only see the negatives and we never succeed and seeing the positives so people come to me for counseling and they say I have a problem I have this I have that and I say to them okay you're a problem how would you rate it on a scale of 10. and they say 10. your problem is a 10. he says yes so when I say okay you're a 35 year old and you're unmarried how much would you rate this you should stand he said okay I'll give you options would you like to have your Varian cancer or breast cancer with chemotherapy radiation and the whole nine yards or stay unmarried person marriage the who who wants to have cancer no I don't want a husband okay and do you have parents yes would you like to lose your parents and get married they die no I want them to live alhamdulillah okay would you like to live in a country like Yemen or Syria where you find your relatives and loved ones being bombed killed burnt tortured by famine and hunger and illnesses or stay where you are unmarried no I'll say where I am would you like to be with the rohingya in Burma where the Buddhist priests come and slaughter their own babies and play football with their heads in front of the parents and you're watching or stay unmarried stay unmarried would you like to be in Somalia famine and drought with your child skin over bones walking 20 kilometers under the sun looking for half a glass of water and you hear the breaths of the child coming out for the last time as he's dying would you like this or stay unmarried okay what is your point my point is being unmarried at 35. of a scale of 10 how much is it she says fee now it's three yes it is maybe it's less I always tell those who are unmarried would you like to get married for three years have two children and discover that your husband is a junkie a drug a drug addict doesn't trade goes to graveyards and worship them and he is evil physically and mentally abusive hitting you with the belt every day and after three years of Agony and torture you get divorced and now you're a single mom with two children would you like that or to say unmarried [Music] see we fail to see the big picture is this half empty or half full is the same if you say that it's half full you're optimistic you see Allah's Grace you're Allah Allah has favored me Allah has given me half a bottle of water I am so blessed so many people don't have water but if you are pessimistic said what is this why me I know so many people with a full bottle I know people with six or seven bottles Allah doesn't love me Allah doesn't want good for me so always look at the full picture number one you're being tested then what you'll die game over everyone is being tested and you have a life limit can you exceed that limit how old is the oldest person you know among your relatives 90 do you have anyone in your family that is 100 raise your hands no hundreds 95 no 95 well I'm gonna die soon 90. no 90 85 you guys are kidding or lying or don't understand English I don't know okay there is one there so how long would you think you're gonna live on earth very little but then what it's Paradise for eternity you will have everything you ever dreamed of so what to do imagine the prophet said on the day of judgment the worst person on Earth who was ever tried by Allah with calamities illnesses debts problems Wars mutilations diseases you name it he's got it the worst person ever to have lived on earth the worst on the day of judgment Allah will bring him and dip him once in Jannah only just dip then he's asked my servant 70 years you have lived on earth have you ever seen a bad day he would say I would I did never had never seen a bad day you forget everything so why are you not patient so what to do Sheikh 35 I need to get married most likely I don't know you I don't want to know you most likely you don't have a patch on your eye like a pirate you don't have a hook hand or a wooden leg you're a normal human being so 35 years why didn't you get married or share her nobody is interested in getting married to me well actually they proposed a lot when I was young but I said I have to finish University and after I finished University I had to do my MBA shift so I rejected all of them and then I wanted to pursue my career in my job so I can have a steady income so that I can help my parents and become a better person and now nobody is coming so it is you who is or was rejecting secondly there are many men proposing oh I don't like him he's short he's fat he has a big belly he doesn't have a good job he's not educated he's not this he's not from my same uh tribe he's not from my people he you rejecting you have to lower your bar you're not Miss Universe so don't expect Mr Olympia to come so anytime you get proposals you have to do your check and balance if the minimal requirements are there Bismillah and get married but to keep on rejecting rejecting rejecting you will end up in an age where you will not get someone interested in a wife you'll get someone like me interested in a nurse so you don't want this and Allah Knows Best"
