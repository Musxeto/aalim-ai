  "transcript": "a question um yes sir uh when when someone insults you on your face and what is the most practical way that you can calm yourself down and smile and move on uh i'll it feels too hard so i would be happy to have your advice on this matter you have one of two choices one is to retaliate so one says to you you're stupid islam permits that you say you are stupid without transgression without saying no you and your family and your loved ones and everyone you know no this is transgression hold your horses if someone transgresses against you you may retaliate in the same level this is your right in islam and if you forgive and pardon that's a higher degree so choice one to retaliate choice two is shrug your shoulders and move on and this is exactly what the prophet allah is to do he used to forgive and pardon and wise people do this um was once in his court and he's the caliph and i think he's asked permission to enter and speak so his nephew allowed or interceded and allowed him in so the moment he walked in he said oh umar you're this and you're that and he started insulting him that he doesn't give enough time for the people and he doesn't divide equally among them and as if he's saying you're unjust and unfair romar was outraged and we know that he was a strong a person and he was not the soft type so he was outraged the nephew of this man who was a man of of knowledge and a scholar he told him and calmed him down and he said allah says in surat al-araf whatever is more than what the people need what they give willingly and order with what's common and known among the people among the norm and ignore the ignorance and this man he's referring to his uncle is among the ignorance of caliph or immediately omar calmed down why because he always limited himself to the quran and the sunnah never to exceed that or go beyond it he follows only the quran the sunnah so whenever someone insults you always put your shoes or put yourself in the prophet's shoes how would he react he would pardon and forgive he would not go down to the level of these ignorance and i tell people usually if you're walking a dog starts to bark would you fall on your hands and knees and bark back of course not you just walk away so don't pay attention to what these abusive people say or do because all what they want is to get a negative reaction depress you provoke you or sadden you and this is what they want so don't let them achieve their objective abdrazi"
