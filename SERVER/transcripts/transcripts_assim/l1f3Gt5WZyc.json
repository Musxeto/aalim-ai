  "title": "Is it permissible to play sports video games such as FIFA? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "rafi from bangladesh he says what's the ruling on playing video games this is too generic he says fifa etc i don't know i don't play video games and there is a criteria a rule of thumb if there is nothing haram involved such as music or free mixing or indecent scenery such as women playing so you play fifa of men not of women if there is no creation from your side so you don't build a player that has the face of zinedine zidane and the body of ronaldo and the height of messi for example that would be messy but um this is creating other than allah's creation this is haram if it's halal just football you knew our two teams playing without anything haram there's nothing wrong in that"
