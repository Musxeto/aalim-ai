  "transcript": "Finally, does reciting Subhanallah Wa Bihamdih only 100 times a day and not 100 times in the morning and the evening also remove all my minor sins? And the answer is yes. Saying Subhanallah Wa Bihamdih once, 100 times a day, does the job. If you say it in the morning and in the evening, following the sunnah of the Prophet ï·º, that's a double benefit to it and it impacts your forgiveness, the possibility of forgiveness of your minor sins further more and Allah Azza Wa Jal knows best."
