  "title": "Prolonging the last sujood recommended or an innovation",
  "transcript": "question from the philippines he says many imams in the philippines when it comes to the last sujud in prayer they prolong it so would that be recommended number one or is this an innovation as for the recommendation it's not recommended what do we mean by it's not recommended i did not say it's prohibited i said it's not recommended meaning that there isn't in this anything backing up the fact that the last tajda is better than any any other sajdah it's the same thing so the recommended thing is to have all sujud equivalent in length throughout the salah this is the recommended sunnah of the prophet islam secondly is it an innovation i asked this question to sheikh bin baz 30 plus years ago myself on the phone and he said to me no it's not an innovation but it is not recommended and i kept insisting but sheikh nobody is doing this except in the last sajdah and prolonging it to show the people that he's making dua so can we say that this is showing off he said no we we're not allowed to open people's hearts and claim that this is what they intended so this is not recommended this is not an innovation but definitely it's best to avoid this but whoever does it there's no problem you"
