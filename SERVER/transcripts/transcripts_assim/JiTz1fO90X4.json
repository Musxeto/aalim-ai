  "title": "Zakat due but do not know any poor people, can I give zakat to those who sell or beg on the street?",
  "transcript": "vidan from turkey she says there is zakat due upon her but she doesn't know any poor people so is it possible for her to go to those beggars on the streets those who sell napkins and tissues or who are on a wheelchairs um and ask them if they are people of zakat they're poor or needy the answer is no generally speaking because most likely these people are professional beggars and they're probably richer than you and me you must fulfill this pillar of islam by asking those around you so ask your relatives ask your neighbors they would definitely know truly poor people who are unable to pay the rent who are unable to buy medication who are unable to renew their residency in that country due to the fact that they are immigrants like the syrian immigrants etc then you can give them from the zakat insha allah"
