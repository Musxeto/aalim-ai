  "transcript": "Ibraheim says during this time of pandemic we sanitize our hands very often which contains alcohol in it so is it allowed to read the Koran and offer Salah after sanitizing our hands with alcohol-based sanitizers the answer is yes alcohol is not neji's alcohol is not impure which means that if I apply perfumes that are alcohol-based I cannot pray no there's nothing wrong in that at all when alcohol is found in a drink or food that if consumed a lot would intoxicate this becomes haram an intoxicant but still it is pure not neji's like the blood of a swine for example this is not just one drop of it prevents you from praying and prevent you from being able to maintain your purity"
