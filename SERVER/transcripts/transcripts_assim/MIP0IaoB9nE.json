  "transcript": "Salma from the UK. I apologize for asking this question many times, but I don't know a good way to give the girl who's like intimidating to actually give the money back. I could just text her and ask her for her car details and send her the money, but then I feel like it would make things worse. So I don't really know like an actual good way to give her money. I wouldn't know either. How do you think I would know? This is your life, this is your neighbor, this is your car. So this is something again, there are so many things and I do encounter a lot of similar questions where people want to be spoon fed. So Sheikh, what happens if this happens? The answer is so and so. Okay, what if something like this happens and they keep on cascading so many things and this is not normal. The people are overthinking issues, exaggerating and inflating it so where a small grain of sand becomes as big as a mountain in their heads. And this is a huge sign of OCD. And this is how Shaytan messes up with your head. You should not expect the Sheikh to tell you, okay Sheikh, I don't know how to give them their money back. And I don't have their bank account. Do I have to say to you, go and ask them? If I ask them Sheikh, I don't know, should I transfer it in UK pounds or dollars? Or can I use PayPal? And PayPal may take some commission from me or from them. And they keep on asking over, it's like a snowball. It's becoming bigger and bigger and bigger. You have to find out for yourself. You have to apply your logic. You have to put yourself in their shoes and ask, okay, if something similar to this happened to me, how would have I wanted them to react? And what would my response be? And so on. And have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it, inshallah, within the following two days or three days. And by Allah's will, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all."
