  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Bangladesh My question is, is it permissible for \na woman to ask any kind of question   in an online forum where \nmen can answer her question. Well, this needs to be looked \ninto, if there is no fitna   and it's not a private chatting with \na Non-Mahram so it's seen by everyone   and the question is appropriate and decent \nand the answer is appropriate and decent   and there is no possibility of future \ncommunication or relationship. I believe that   this is totally permissible Insha Allah and that \nthere is no problem in that and Allah knows best."
