  "title": "Per your request: Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem || FULL Question & Answer in Kuwait ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡¼ Part 2",
  "transcript": "for this important of proph I'm sure all of us must have benefited from this workshop and very a lot of points which we can Implement in our everyday lives actually all the points I request each and everyone of you please go back and try to these points and like to revise we have all these vide on Instagram and again and so as you know we have completed the workshop so what we do is we will do the Q&A session and we have some questions left from yesterday so we'll answer them and if you have time again then we will in take a few more questions so this is no order since yesterday I don't know the FES but we just start the first question is can money to be used by the poor so that they can buy medicine alhamdulillah the interest money is Haram for you to use or utilize or benefit from and Scholars say you have to dispose of it in order order to cleanse your wealth and one of the means of doing so is to give it to the poor and to the needy with the intention of cleansing your wealth as you will not be rewarded for it so don't give it away thinking that Allah will reward you for this no you're sinful for acquiring the interest in the first place so disposing of it giving it to the poor is permissible inshallah but without anticipating any reward the next question is what are the d r and rules of the marriage ritual in Islam you're just you're kidding me yeah this needs a workshop the dos and don'ts this is unapplicable in in my view but generally speaking dos you have to fulfill your obligations and responsibilities to your spouse don't you have to avoid and doing what goes against these UH responsibilities and duties and Allah knows best next question I but sometimes at home at my Grand's the without and most of the time I'm not to and we don't have lot so I just have Allah does not hold us accountable for what we have no control over someone says w i was involved in a car accident and the car rolled over and I was out of uh conscience and all of a sudden the paramedics came and and they took off the hijab and they exposed my body in order to save my life am I sinful of course not this is something that is not within your grasp or reach or control likewise if you're sitting in the comfort of your home and one naham bargees in or your brother comes in with his cousin with his friend without knowing that you're in the room and they see you there is no on you and no one in his right mind would say always be in your and even if you are in the comfort of your own room but of course if you go to your grandmother's house if you go to your relative's house and you're insecure you don't know when people would jump in no you have to be protective if you are in a secure room and it's locked or you are with the family members of the house and they say no one will come and they assure you you're protected there is no sin on you inshah next question is what advice Muslims from theire to societal pressures and distractions this is something that you have to work on because this is each and everyone's test from Allah the environment we put ourselves in dictates whether we will have a prosperous and faithful and religious experience or otherwise so you surround yourselves with people who don't pray with people who curse with people who commit sin on daily basis what would you expect your Iman to be in the Dungeons and in the sewer but if you surround yourself with righteous people with half of the Quran with students of knowledge with practicing Muslims by default you have to elevate yourself to their level and you will find that you are increasing in knowledge and Iman so you have to decide what you want to be the next question is Islamic BS say that theet is but what profit is fixed no if the profit given over an investment is fixed this is riba anyone who takes money from you says give me 10,000 KD and I will invest it for you and every month I will give you 500 KD fixed this is riba because the percentage can be fixed of the profit not of the capital so if I'm investing 10,000 KD and you give me 10% profit from the 10,000 KD this is a fixed uh uh percentage over the capital this is riba the right way of doing it is saying whatever profit I make I'll give you 10% of it so if it is 500 KD I will give you 5050 next month is 1,000 I'll give you 100 next month I have no profit I'll give you zero this is permissible because it's a percentage from The Profit not from the capital invested itself and whenever an investment guarantees there is no loss give me 10,000 KD and I'll invest it if my project loses I will give you the 10,000 back this is complete riba because it's an actual loan that you're giving it back to me 10,000 as it is and the profit is interest so this is totally Haram does he have toing forgiveness of that end of his life or if he has a green light from Allah that his repentance was accepted no he doesn't ah that was supposed to be a joke the next question did you get it yeah okay alhamdulillah so the answer is of course you have to ask Allah for repentance and forgiveness till the end of time you don't know whether Allah accepted it or not Shan wants you to feel safe and secure but you have to all the time ask Allah for forgiveness and to repent not to feel despair oh Allah is not going to forgive me I'm going to no but all the time be optimistic think positive and continue to be balancing between hope Allah accepted my repentance and fear he may not have accepted it this is the balance between fear and Hope question is and the Jin as is our responsility to spr Islam everywhere even in the place in in this ER people are reaching do you think that the class of the Muslims are to spread Islam to the whole Allah says fear Allah to the best of your ability it is not an XY Z responsibility to spread it to Amazon or to eBay or to whatever platforms they are looking at we are talking about spreading Islam to the best of your ability in your office I'm meeting people I'm spreading Islam on social media people are following I'm spreading Islam and I travel for a business meeting when I travel for Ledger when I go back home I spread Islam to the best of my ability no one says oh you have to devote your summer vacation one month and go to the jungles of Africa you're not ABD Smith may Allah have mercy in his soul this guy is dedicated he was gifted by Allah and he W had the willpower the money the ability the Charisma to do what a thousand like me can do no one can do what he did so each and every one of us we can't be clones of one another no one can say okay I'm going to be tomorrow inam I'm going to give lectures I'm going to participate in in in in TV series or tomorrow I'm going to be Dr zacher I'm going to have a debate with the Pope not everyone is qualified not everyone is qualified to be okay I'm going to be alen musk I'm I'm going to be the greatest businessman of the billionaire I'm going to be this I'm going to be an athlete I'm going to be no each one Allah blessed him with his own gift his own ability utilize this because this is what Allah will ask you about Allah will not ask you why didn't you give last week last week I'm not qualified I don't have the guts if I go to the pulpit and say alham I'll faint I'll faint I know people who did this in a in a j Friday the did not come so they looked in the front row the first the biggest beard and the guy comes regular to F said give we we stranded okay he said and sat down IM the gave the the then finished then the guy stood up looked at the crowd fainted who scared some people can't even say alhamdulillah they start to cry take it easy what's wrong with you it's a gift not everyone is qu and it's not a deficiency or oh Allah is not a real man no everyone is qualified to do things that people cannot do so you search yourself what do you have that you can excel and come closer to Allah you might be the best manager you can manage events you can manage coming making conferences lectures you can be a facilitator you can be a good accountant so okay we can run this event with minimal expenses you can be a businessman well she listen I don't know how to lecture I don't know how to participate but I can give you money so take this money I have lots of it you can be a scholar like myself I just talk I have nothing to do I just talk and speak and people listen so I'm a good salesman I sell Jen H who's buying so this is my profession I'm good in convincing people I'm good in presenting my point and ID with the grace of Allah everyone has something someone has nothing except the ability to drive so he brings brings me from the airport to the lecture to the hotel then back to the airport no one else could do the job so he's rewarded for whatever I give whatever I speak he's rewarded because this is his ability so never underestimate but don't cross your borders and say no I want to go to the Amazon I want to go to the jungles of Africa I want to go to Siberia no this is not part of the DAW and Allah Knows Best the next question is how do we keep our up for 24 hours you can't in the Hadith of and this is reported in Muslim he met Abu Bakr once and he said how are youah Hanah replied I have become a hypocrite abak said why are you saying this he said well when I go to the prophet he reminds us of Allah I feel that I am almost flying in heaven but the moment I go back to my home and to my farm and I meet my wives and the children and and and get involved in business I don't recognize my heart anymore Abu Bakr said well this is how I feel it makes two of us let's go and rush to the prophet Alam so they went to the prophet and the prophet said how are things so he repeated I have become a hypocrite and when he explained he said the prophet said by Allah if your iman's level with me is similar to your iman's level when you go and meet your families the angels will descend in broad daylight and shake hands with you you will be able to see them because this is a high high level of Iman but 1 hour and 1 hour meaning you can't maintain the same level of Iman this is you know heart heart patients they give them a pill called Concor what is Concor for to keep your heart rate at a certain level it cannot go exceeded so it's always by 130 125 if you run When You Reach 125 130 you feel okay system is down I have to sit when you go to heart surgeons said why is this they say because it's like a car if you keep on highing High Rev you will consume the engine and it will die soon so because you're a heart surgeon a heart patient we reduce your heart rate so that it would not exhaust your likewise if you have a very very high level of Iman you may burn out out so this is Allah's favor upon us that Iman fluctuates goes up and down you try to keep it consistent but you will never have it at the peak ever forever because then you will become a prophet or a messenger it has to go up and down so we try our level best and Thrive to keep it up but sometimes it cannot reach that level so we try to be as consistent as possible and Allah knows best how do ad again and again and again someone who comes to you with a severe migraine or headache you give them two panad dools or Tylenol the headache is gone for 6 hours he said wow this is Magic but after six hours it comes back again gave them another two Panadol and another two and another two for a whole week have you helped him no because I've managed to heal the symptoms but not the real illness he might have cancer he might have an in infection he might have something serious the symptom is the headache so now your relative who's celebrating anniversary or birthday or or whatever your relative who doesn't wear the hijab your relative who shaves his beard your relatives who misses Salat every now and then these are symptoms you can't keep on solving and curing the symptom you have to look where the illness is so you have to increase their Iman you have to show them the true meaning of the beautiful names of Allah you have to remind them of the pillar of e and how there is a day of judgment and how there is Heaven and Hell make them fear Allah that would cure the disease and the symptoms as well the next question is what are the best resources for learning AR a boy or a girl if it's a boy marry my no I was joking no don't marry anyway stay single but this I was joking again uh I don't know I'm an Arab so how would I know I'm an Arab how would I know how to learn Arabic if you ask me about English or any other language I would say go to the country live there for 6 months don't communicate in your own language and if I want to learn learn Spanish I'd go to Madrid maybe Madrid is awful I go to Barcelona I go go to Pad de mayorca I go to Malaga anywhere I'll go to a place in Spain I would sit and not speak English or Arabic communicate with the people buy newspaper in Spanish every day alongside Arabic newspapers or English newspaper and read this happened in here and there this happened here and there this happened here and there and read it in Spanish now I know what happened and I'm reading the article but in Spanish M I think this means this this means this and take classes in 3 months time you'll be good A lot of the people go to Egypt go to Jordan and do this for six months go to a college go to an academy and stop speaking in English completely and okay they will learn what is this this is Egyptian in Arabic it's 80% Arabic when you speak Kuwaiti is this Arabic this is not Arabic if you speak Saudi this is Arabic this is 70% 80% but at least it says Arabic you're learning a lot from the Quran because the vast majority of it is from Arabic but once you do this and you get it in your system stop communicate the problem is that when you go five of you to this country to Egypt and you all speak English throughout the whole day cooking and and and and and hanging out and why you'll never Arabic go alone or take a pledge not to speak your native language and you will be able inshallah to learn the next question is what is your top three favorite I don't have any I can't tell you what is my who are my favorite duat because in my life I've noticed that remaining steadfast is very challenging I have so many friends duat who flipped like a fish so if I tell you XYZ is good D and next month he has a scandal of going out with a girl if I say this D is number one and next month wah he took money from charity and bought his new Bugatti so I can't trust people in the sense that I cannot recommend them I I have so many I have good relationship with all du they're all my friends but can I say that I vouch for this guy I don't know him I I can't guarantee people all duat are good insh ask him ask him for permission is a prer of is a caller of Islam so I am a and the plural of me is Du ask what your favorite top three prayers du who said this what did you read Dua so he's right you wasted my time this is difficult I personally believe and and and strongly embrace the Dua of prophet yunas I think in the subcontinent they call it no sh something this Subhan Allah I whenever I'm in a a trouble whenever I'm in a queue whatever have Dua you just say it because what did he ask nothing he's in the belly of the whale what you would say get me out give me this give me that no he says there's no God worthy of being worshiped except you sub glorified be to you I confess that I was among the wrongdoers and Allah set him free so this is one of the most beautiful Dua um the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said the most beloved words to Allah after the Quran nothing is more beloved to Allah after the Quran accept this Subhan Allah alhamdulillah allahar this isth the most beloved to Allah so whenever I'm walking from here to the car or when I'm at the gym or when I'm walking around the swimming pool to get some uh sunlight and to get the heart working that's it's already dead so I say this and I try to finish a 100 of them a day because of the Hadith of and we've mentioned this in uh The Fortress of the Muslim and the third one the prophet used to say it between the and so these are three and Allah knows best the next question is what is your advice to people to soften their heart use softener what me softening your heart is related to a number of factors number one remembering death the prophet saidat I used to forbid you from visiting cemeteries now go and visited because it reminds you of the Hereafter when you go to a cemetery you forget everything you forget your wealth your wife your children this is my final abot this is my final destination also the prophet said wasam said to one of his companions would you like to attain what you want from Allah and soften your heart the compan companion said yes the prophet said wipe over the head of an orphan when you show and express your mercy to orphans and wipe over their head out of Mercy Allah Asel would soften your heart and reading the Quran definitely soften your hearts making Vick soften your hearts visiting the the the sick and the patients soften your hearts so many things would soften your heart and get you closer to Allah Dua is one of the main reasons for softening your heart when you say and the like and Allah knows rest the last two questions what is your advice to escape from this is one of the tricky questions because each and every one of us has to be sincere and one of the Dua that the prophet used to teach us I seek refuge in you that I would associate others with you while knowing it but sometimes I don't know it so I ask for forgiveness for what I don't know and Ria a lot of the time is part of what I do not know why is it tricky because Shan plays a huge role in messing you up so many of the Deeds you're sincere but he says maybe you're not and so many people come to me in counseling they say she I have problems with sincerity every time I want to do something I get the idea that maybe I'm not what if I'm not sincere so I say to them ignore say she we can't ignore this it's too difficult it's deeply rooted in our hearts so I say to them do you have a mother and they say yes do you love your mother said yes of course I hug her and I kiss her every single day I say what if she's your adopted mother and she found you at the steps of the Masjid do you have a DNA to prove her that she's your mother the guy said uh no so what are you going to do are you going to stop hugging her and kissing her said no sheh why because I know she's my mother how we look alike you look like 100 million individuals two eyes one nose what do you mean you look alike she maybe your uh uh uncle's wife you never know so again if you open the door what for what if you're not going to live I made wo and I'm in the first row of praying and I've seen this myself I was in Syria once I went to W and the guy next to me was almost washed not making wo he was there before I came in and he was there after I left and after maybe 10 15 minutes he came all wet to stand in the row is giving Allah the guy said [Music] Allah and we finished three and he's still doing allahar he did not start what's wrong with you you have a problem your carburetor is not fixed or can he said every time I start prayer I get these Whispers that what if my Allah abbar is not right I get people in counseling sessions they make me crack in laughter is said sh I recite the faat and I repeat it and I repeat my Salah 20 to 30 times why he said because I make mistakes he said okay recite the fat for me and he re the faat perfectly okay fat was good said no yes to you is good but in Salah I [Music] say what are you doing what is you're crazy and he repeats [Music] and he's suffocating this is not Islam you're practicing a different religion with all du respect this and say I don't know if you say alhamdulillah or alhamdulillah and they stress themselves and I say all of this is not from Islam he says she this is not the funny part come on there's a funny part he said yes he said what's the funny part he said she this is my struggling in silence prayer you're making me nuts you're doing this in silent prayer said yes I'm just trying to say and who does this in silent prayer it's not silent anymore said no no even when I'm not making a sound I'm trying to make the sound come from the you're crazy you need to go to a a a lunatic uh psychiatric Bo this is how shatan messes up with you with is the same thing oh she my intention I don't know if my intention is good my intention is bad I have to repeat what do you do I stand and I make intention I said okay do you have a car he says yes he said okay when you go to ride your car what is your intention before opening the door and starting it I just go in and start it so this is your intention do it in Salah is that easy yes yeah Islam is the religion of Simplicity and ease why are you making life difficult so the issue of sincerity is in the heart so if I ask you are you praying to impress no I'm praying for Allah and that's it but how would I ensure how would I make it certain what if this is Shan ignore it and move on all Psych psychiatrist and psychologist in the world Muslim and cafir and all sh in the world say your medicine your healing is dependent on a sixlet word and this is ignore whatever feelings you get ignore it and move on because Shan wants to shame you to the ground and Allah knows best last question is what are the you mention in go to fors of the Muslim I did a workshop on the whole book with the grace of Allah it's in Arabic and in English I cannot repeat all of that in here in the section in the Fortress of Muslim the the orange book you will find that thear of sleep you recite it it's all in Arabic and English and you can read it inshallah with that everybody who been here the last days and I thank for us this time as knowled anding with us and I hope everything he in our lives we get for it and as I mean I think I think we took photos yesterday huh so you get anyway"
