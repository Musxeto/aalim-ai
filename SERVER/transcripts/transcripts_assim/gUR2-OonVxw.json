  "transcript": "from the US so in the Quran Dam said accept those who believe and do righteous deeds and how few are they and my question is why are they so few and does this apply to us today and what happens to well I don't understand your question and you can ask one only one question so what is your question why are those who believe and do righteous Deeds so few because Allah gave this religion which is in accordance to human nature to the people to follow as the Hadith says all human beings are born with this inner inner F and nature inclination natural incl Nation to follow and to believe in the Oneness of Allah however the Devils have distorted them and derailed them from their straight path and this is mentioned in many places in the Quran the vast majority of people even if you're keen and trying your best would not accept Islam the vast majority of them do not believe in Allah except while associating others with him so this tells you that only the best the cream of humanity would submit their will to their creator others would follow their desires and their lusts whether it is related to their private parts and we have them insanely spreading in cfir countries lgbtq where they are stripped from their nature and from their humanity and behaving like this or whether their lust and desires are in wealth and the fitna of our umah is in money so they keep on pursuing hoarding wealth and Gathering money from Halal and from Haram income not caring where the money comes from and the lust and desires are so many and people who decided to obey Satan and to follow whatever he tells them to do are so many while those who submitted their will to Allah and followed his Shar are compared to the vast majority of human beings are few and little and Allah Knows Best"
