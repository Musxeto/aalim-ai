  "transcript": "so Nia is asking about the ruling of ADA for a widow who is aged who is old is there any form of relaxation first of all read ADA this is an Islamic terminology referring to a period of time and it is commonly used when related to a female after after being separated from her husband either due to death divorce filing of horror separation etc and each has its terminology its rules etc when it comes to a widow a woman whose husband has died her EDA is one of two and this is depending on her status whether she is pregnant or not if a man dies while his wife is pregnant Herod lasts until she gives birth and this means that if he dies today and she's two months pregnant she remains in Heredia until she gives birth after seven months and if she is nine months pregnant and he dies at five o'clock p.m. and she gives birth at 5:15 p.m. she is out of her ADA because her it that was fifteen minutes while she was pregnant and now she could get married at 5:25 or 5:30 hypothetically speaking but this is what it is for the pregnant woman if she's not pregnant it's a fixed duration whether she is eighteen years old or 80 years old Herod is for months and ten days as mentioned in chapter 2 Surat al-baqarah now having said that what is meant by Aida Aida is something to express and show the status the love the respect the position of the deceased to his widowed wife so it has nothing to do with being pregnant or not because four months and 10 days if she's not pregnant so we can tell that she's not pregnant by one monthly cycle which can be in a week time but still she has to remain four months and ten days and this is a form of worship to allah azzawajal what does she do actually what she does not do is to be asked about meaning a widow must be confined to her husband's house for four months and ten days not to leave unless it is a necessity she has to go to the courts to finish some paperwork she has to go to the hospital to check with the doctor she is a working woman she has to go to her job all of this or all of these are legitimate reasons she must not wear fancy clothes that attract people to her as she is not displaying herself for marriage she must not wear perfume shoe it must not wear makeup among other things so this is the same for men let me rephrase that this is the same for women whether young or old and there is no form of relaxation in the sense that okay because she's eighty years old she can go every like couple of days to the beach and maybe go sightseeing no well can she because of her age travelled to live with her husband with her son in a different country no this is not a necessity this is a period of four months in ten days that she must stay and be patient and Allah social will reward her for that are there any exceptions not that I know of except if there is a necessity and this this differs and it depends on each case scenario"
