  "transcript": "Humar one day asked the Sahabas while they were discussing that what would you ask Allah? What would you pray to Allah to fill this room with so that you could use that thing to spread the dean? So the Sabah said we would pray to Allah to let this room be filled up with gold so that we could use it in the spread of the dean. These sahabas they were not after money. They said so that we could use this wealth to spread the dean. They didn't want for themselves. They didn't want luxury. We pray to Allah to let this room be filled up with gold so that we could spend it in the way of Allah subhanaa tala. So the may Allah be pleased with him asks ask for something better. So the other sahaba gets up and says I will pray to Allah let this room be filled up with rubies and jewels and diamonds so that I could spend it in the way of Allah. May Allah please say ask for something better. He is not saying what you're asking is wrong. He's saying ask for something better. So the saba says yeah. Oh head of the moment, you tell us what is better. Hatumar says, I will ask Allah to let this room be filled up with D like MB off so that I could send them to spread the dean of Allah. So money is not the most important thing. What did our prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam leave behind? Did he leave behind money? When he died, what did he leave behind? He left behind Sahabas who were trained by him. And who spread the de the sabas in the vida vida the f pilgrimage when he gives the 124,000 sahabas and he asked them did I deliver the message to you? All of them said yes be shakuted. Then he asked go and deliver the message to those who are not here and majority of them they went all over the world to deliver the message. A small percentage were buried in Arabia. So the most important thing is Allah's help manpower not money. So the most important thing for success is the help of Allah. Allah says in surah Imran chapter number 3 verse number 160. If Allah helps you, none can overcome you. If Allah forsakes you, who is there then who can help you? So let the believers put their trust in Allah. Number two is striving and struggling. Allah says in Surah Kabut 29:69, if you strive in the way of Allah subhanana wa ta'ala, Allah will open up your pathways. If you strive and the pathway is not opened, who's to blame? You, not Allah. Because Allah promises if you strive, he'll open up your pathways. If you strive and the pathway is not open, that means your striving is not correct. It's not sufficient. Allah promises that if you strive, if you do jihad, Allah will open up the pathways. And the last third important is the technique. Allah says in surah 16:43 and surah amyia chapter number 21 verse number 7 first if you don't know as the person who's knowledgeable then third comes the technique amongst the most important thing money is the least important if there are 10 important things I would put money as number 10 but most of the Muslim organization unfortunately even today they think money is the most important thing it is not number one is Allah's help. If there are 10 important things, money would come last. Do you know we started our organization Islamic Foundation if you know about organization? We started our organization in 1991. I was inspired by Shik Ahmed Hidad and I told my father that you give so much charity outside why don't you give me 5,000 rupees a a month that is $80 in 1991 it was $80 so why don't you give me $80 a month I want to start a DA organization that is $1,000 a year so when we started organization that's about 33 years back our budget was $80 a month. That's $1,000 a year. Now, if you want to multiply in today's age, it may be $10,000. Not more than that. How much more? $12,000. Not more than that. We start with a low budget."
