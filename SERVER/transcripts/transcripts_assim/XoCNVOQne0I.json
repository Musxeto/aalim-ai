  "transcript": "Rajab from Russia Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Can you hear me well? Wallahi half half Let's give it a shot When we install a program a window appears on the screen in which we need to agree to the rules of the agreement but there may be many things that we can violate for example those actions that are allowed in Islam but are prohibited in the rules of the agreement for example the terms of the agreement say people living in Russia are prohibited from using this program and if you use it then you violate our rules of the agreement I live in Russia and if I just click the yes button or check the box and use the program is this considered a violation of the contract if I do not agree with the terms the Prophet Alayhi Salatu Wasalam said Muslims are bound by their conditions that they agree upon so either you agree or disagree if you intentionally agree and you violate this is a breach of contract and you are sinful for what you're doing does it invalidate the contract? No it doesn't it puts you at a position of being reprimanded maybe illegally charged of paying something or a fine or the likes however this is different than terms and conditions that are imposed upon you where you have no other choice or alternative such as when you apply for an app or for a software office or windows and the likes and they put this long list of contract and they say terms and conditions and you have to agree and accept and you have no other solution there is no other alternative this is different something that you go with the landlord for example you're renting a house and the landlord says no pets you're not allowed to bring your cat and you agree and you sign and you bring your cat you're breaching the contract and the trust of the owner who would not have agreed to you moving in and leasing you the house if you did not agree so this is prohibited and not permissible and Allah knows best.
