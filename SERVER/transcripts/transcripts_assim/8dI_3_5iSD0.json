  "title": "My abusive husband swears at me all the time & we're not intimate, am I sinful, can I file for khula",
  "transcript": "um I have this question that I am not having a good connection with my husband because he's always abusive and staring at me all the time I'm not feeling regret about it he is like all the time swearing at me because he doesn't mind about the words what he used against me so due to this we don't have a relationship like normally a husband and wife will be having intimacy so I'm having issues with him and I feel that I am sinful that when I'm not being dutiful as a wife I'll have to answer Allah so in this case am I permissible to ask for kab because he's not ready to give me divorce and okay first first of all such cases are not answered by yes or no we have to know the background of your case so that I would give you the proper advice because maybe if I were to speak to your husband he would portray you as the villain while you here are portraying him as the villain and this what happens in marital disputes you listen to one side you say to the wife whoa your husband needs to be hanged but when you listen to the husband's point of you you say that oh your wife needs to be shot by a firing squad when you make them set sit together you can tell and you can identify who's right and who's wrong and give the appropriate advice now if the man himself is not interested in having intimacy or being intimate with his wife there's no sin on her because she's available she's offering herself but he's the one who's refusing so why would she file for no she can stay in this marriage try to fix things up try to give him some time and in space until he comes back to his senses as long as he's providing a roof and putting a table putting food on a table but if she's the one who's being harmed by such neglect and she needs her natural desires to be fulfilled and unfortunately there's no man Halal who is capable of doing this or willing to do this in this case it is permissible for you to file for no"
