  "transcript": "The next question is, is it permissible to land at Jeddah airport without a driver? Then go to Mecca and rush for a day, and next day go to Baghdad for a program. The Prophet ﷺ said when he named the Mawaqeet, هُنَّ لَهُنَّ وَلِمَنْ أَتَى عَلَيْهِنَّ مِنْ غَيْرِ أَهْلِهِنَّ مِمَّنْ أَرَادَ الْحَجَّ وَالْعُمْرَةِ These locations are forever, whoever passes through them, who is not from their residency, who wants to perform Hajj and Umrah, meaning that you cannot pass them and do Ihram if you want to make Hajj and Umrah. So if someone is coming from Kuwait, where is your Miqat? Taif, or known as Al-Sayl Al-Kabir or Wadi Mihrim. This is your Miqat. So when you come and you come on your flight and you land in Jeddah, did you make Ihram? No. You stay two days, three days, visit the locality. Then when you want to go to Mecca, you drive all the way to Taif. You wear your Ihram, whether from Jeddah or from Taif, it doesn't matter. Once you reach the Miqat, you say, لَبَيْكَ اللَّهُمَّ عُمْرَةً And you drive another half an hour to Mecca, make your Umrah. You're solid, good. You have not done anything. You want to make your Ihram from the airplane? That's even better. But either way is halal. What is not halal is for you to come to Jeddah and assume your Ihram from Jeddah or say, I will go to Masjid Aisha in Tanaim and make my Ihram from there. This is not permissible. Why? Because you passed over the Miqat. So this is the Miqat you have to go to. Taif, OK, if I come to Jeddah and then I go to Medina. And on the way from Medina, I make my Ihram from Abiyar Ali, known as Dhul Hulifa, from Medina itself, Miqat of people of Medina. Is this valid? This is OK, because it's far, far further than your own Miqat. And you are intending Umrah while passing by a valid Miqat. So I hope this answers your question."
