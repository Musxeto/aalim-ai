  "title": "Is it permissible to hide an illness or deficiency from my future Spouse? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "and finally sister says I'm 32 years old I suffer from a mental illness since six years ago which I'm still taking medication can I hide my illness from my future husband this answer is if your illness affects your marriage and your husband's interest in you you must disclose that so if it's an illness that is diminishing and going away it doesn't affect your household work it doesn't affect you when it comes in regards of intimacy or dealing with the husband then you don't have to tell him but if it's something that touches the core of the marriage and he would be feeling cheated not to have known and it would affect your relationships in this case you must disclose that and tell him and Allah so Jill knows best"
