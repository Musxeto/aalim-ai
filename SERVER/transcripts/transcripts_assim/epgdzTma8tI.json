  "transcript": "Ibn Saeed from France, Wa Alaikum Assalam wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu So Sheikh the other day I was sleeping and something strange happened, it was like a dream or I don't even know. So I was, it's just a memory of me like saying words of Kufr. So I don't, I honestly don't know if it was a dream or it was a reality because the memories are just blurry for me now. Ibn Saeed, Ibn Saeed, Ibn Saeed, are you a Muslim? Yes. Do you want to become a Kafir? No. Do you have any intention of Kufr? No. Yes or no? No. So do you want me to label you as a Kafir based on a memory, a hallucination, whispering of Shaitan? Is this logical? No. So what is the right thing to do when you get such feelings or thoughts? Just ignore it. 100%. Thank you for coming."
