  "title": "Can We Obey Parents in Superstitions to Avoid Conflict?",
  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Bosnia So Sheikh if our parents believe in any \ntype of superstitions, and they ask us not   to do it for example they tell us don't wash \nyour clothes on this and these days because   this and this will happen, we know for \ncertain this is nonsense what they say but   if we decide not to do it in front of them just \nnot to make them angry, but we would normally do   this without their presence, is this problematic \nand is this maybe some kind of hypocrisy? Okay first of all to believe in superstitions   defies your belief in Islam because our \nIslam is based on the six pillars of Imaan,   to believe in Allah Azzawajal, the day \nof judgement, the angels, the prophets,   the scriptures, and in the pre-destiny whether \ngood or bad, when you believe in superstitions,   you believe in something other than that, \nand it's something that did not or was not   revealed in the Quran or in the Sunnah, therefore \nit's baseless, so it defies your belief in Islam,   nevertheless some parents are old, are ignorant, \nthey don't have the proper knowledge and   for you to avoid any conflict, you've tried \nso many times to convince them, but they still   believe that you should not walk underneath a \nladder for example, this for you to avoid it   just to please them and to avoid any conflict or \nthough you have done your due diligence, you've   advised them before, you have tried your level \nbest to give them Da'wah, but they're defiant,   so to avoid this not out of any belief in \nsuch superstitious things, rather it's just to   avoid conflict, there is nothing wrong in that \nInsha Allah because it all depends on your belief,   no one says no you have to walk underneath the \nladder and whatever happens, happens, nobody says   wash your clothes on that particular hour of \nthe day or on that particular day of the week   just to prove they're wrong, nobody \nsays this and Allah knows best."
