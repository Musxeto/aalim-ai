  "transcript": "Al Hajji from India. Sir, we are searching for players. Is there any restriction on the purpose of travel? Like, can I search my players when I'm just going for a college program in another state? And, sir, we have some foreign students here. One question, excuse me. So, what is your question, Hajji? When you want to go to your college, which is in another state, is there any reason or ruling on Qasr prayer? Is this what you're asking about? Searching in players when I'm going to another state for a program, a college program in another state. Can I search in my players? Okay. Do you live there or just once in a year you go? No, once. Just once. Okay. So, yes, the answer is, of course. Whenever you travel out of your city limit to another city or to another town, and the people consider this is a traveling distance, maybe 100 kilometers or more, in this case, you're entitled to shorten and combine the four rak'ah prayers of Dhuhr, Asr, and Isha. You can combine Dhuhr to Asr or Asr to Dhuhr, and you can combine Maghrib to Isha or Isha to Maghrib while shortening it, and pray Fajr on time as it is, until you go back to your hometown. And this is a concession from Allah Azza wa Jal. I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah. Al-Fatiha."
