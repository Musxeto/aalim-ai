  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Bangladesh. My question   is there is a verse of [ ] ayat 96, where \nit says that Allah has made the night for   rest. So there are some places where the sun \ndoesn't set. I just want to gain my knowledge.   I believe on that. And I know you are the \nbest person from [ ] right now. You know,   please allow me to learn some words from you. \nAkhi, the verse speaks about general things.   So what is the percentage where we have day and \nnight on earth? 99%. So Allah is addressing this.   The one percent that comes three or four months \na year is not the norm. So it wouldn't be logical   that when Allah addresses an issue like day and \nnight, where men - people work a day and rest   at night, that Allah talks with the exception of \nthis one percent found in Antarctica or whatever,   where there will be four months of day time, or \nfive months of day time and no night. This is   an abnormality and an exception. Likewise, 99% \nof the people, if not more, they sleep at night,   Allah will not go out of his way to address \nthe fact that, oh, there are people who work   night shift. So they sleep at daytime. Again, \nthis is not the norm. So Islam, the Qur'an,   the Hadith, talks on general issues, not \nin particular little tini-gritty details   that may not benefit the masses and the \ngeneral public and Allah knows best."
