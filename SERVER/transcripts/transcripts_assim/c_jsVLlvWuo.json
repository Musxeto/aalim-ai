  "title": "When to use Miswak? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "brother Mohammed from Saudi Arabia was asking about using the miswak the miswak is the tooth brush that Muslims usually carry in their pockets it's this one we usually clean our teeth with and it's a Sunnah meaning that the Prophet Isis I'm used to do it and used to recommend it and he even went further to say had it had I not feared that I would burden my Ummah my followers out of ordered them to use it with every c-walk with every prayer so he's asking what's the time of using it he the time is general so we use it with the wood whether you do it before or after finishing the wood and we do it before the salat at the time where the salat is present we do it before entering the house so that a person when he meets his spouse the odor and smell of his mouth is pleasant and accepted acceptable we do it before night prayer because the Prophet told us assume that the angel puts its mouth over your mouth and whatever Quran comes out of you goes into the Angels so you have to always have a fresh breath we use it so often all the time 24/7 but the recommendation is highly when you are making wattle or after it and when the time of prayer is so after that then you're in the message you are occupied and engaged in cleaning your mouth this is something hygienic and maybe the dentist would not like this because it would keep the person's teeth in good shape any of those who are looking for money but usually dentists do highly recommend this Iraq made of Iraq because it has a good material in it"
