  "title": "I use memes to respond to slanderers of Islam online, is this permissible? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh she my question is uh there are a lot of people who are slandering Islam and uh Muslims on the internet so I'm using the the memes and stuff to defend Islam because there is no one who is there defending Islam in these social social uh platforms and which is causing FNA to a lot of Muslims in that in those platforms so is it permissible to use memes and such kinds of stuff and would I be rewarded for such I don't know what these memes are about Al these memes consist of cartoon characters and some kinds of photos of people those kinds of things not uh those kinds of things that are exposing the aura but it's just cartoon features of it no I still I cannot decide because if I understand correctly you're making fun of them so you're putting uh memes that make fun of them or uh put cartoon that is ridiculing what they're saying and this is not appropriate this is not the right way to respond if you're going to respond scientifically by showing them logic and by countering their argument yes but to make fun of them is a waste of time and would Harden and make your heart black so the best is avoid them when dogs bark you do not fall on your hands and knees to bark back you just ignore and walk away"
