  "transcript": "finally shiva says from india that after the imam offers salam because i've missed a raqqa or two i do not have a sutra a visor or something that protects me from people walking in front of me so is it permissible to walk a step or two forward or sideways so that i would be close to someone who's sitting or a pillar or a stand for the quran answer is totally permissible there's no problem in that none whatsoever because such steps are taken for illegitimate reason and this is permissible insha allah"
