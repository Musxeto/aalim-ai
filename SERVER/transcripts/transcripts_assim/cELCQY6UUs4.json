  "title": "Ruling on reciting Surah Al-Fatiha behind the Imaam during congregation prayers?",
  "transcript": "The next question is, what is the ruling of the scientific school of thought they have behind the Imam and propagation trends? Is it sunnah or permissible in loud prayers? So the follower, if the Imam is praying loud prayers, two raka'as of Fajr, two raka'as of Maghreb, two raka'as of Isha, then if he doesn't recite it, there's no problem. The recitation of the Imam is okay for him. But in silent raka'as, I don't have to mention it for time purposes, it is a pillar. If you don't recite it, your prayer is invalid. Despite what is said in the Hanafi school of thought. And this is the opinion of Shaykh al-Islam ibn Taymiyyah. May Allah have mercy on his soul. He composed a small booklet, it's found in the market, in Arabic, it's called, To the acknowledgement of the ruling of the recitation behind the Imam. And this is what he concluded, and Allah, Azza wa Jal, knows best."
