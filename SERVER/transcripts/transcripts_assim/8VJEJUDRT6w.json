  "transcript": "oh ah we're studying the chapter that deals with evan and then as we have said is the notification is the call for prayer so that people once they hear it they know it is time to pray and the hadith we have in today's program begins with hadith 146 narrated by enes or the allahuanu bill was commanded to announce the event meaning each phrase twice and the akama meaning each phrase ones except the prayers stood ready to begin meaning to be pronounced twice which is in arabic all right okay now the hadith here was uh narrated by anas bilal was commanded who commanded him the prophet uh logical and understandable what i don't understand is that uh he he instructed him or commanded him to announce the than each phrase twice and the to announce it how many times once now how do you say each phrase twice and what about allahu akbar if then this hadith means that we should follow the adhan of imam malik where he said that allah is only said twice so that it would be allahu akbar then repeating it twice so can anybody clear my misunderstanding uh brother fatih because then allah agrees two times is it twice that's four times well it's four times it's not two times yeah but he says twice and it's actually two times so it's four two times two is four so this means that the proper way of saying because then it becomes four but when you say allahu akbar allahu akbar this is once this and in arabic this is called meaning overcoming or giving the general name to uh uh all the thing we're talking about for example the prophet salallahu and and again this is arabic it might be a little bit difficult to explain in english but when she was describing how they used to live with the prophet salla she said that we would see the christend after another after a third which meant how many months two months and no fire would be lit in the house of the prophet allah what does this tell you it tells you that they didn't cook because they didn't have food to cook so one of the companions asked aisha and you know he was he was astonished said mother two months and you wouldn't cook in the houses of the prophet so how did you feed what did you eat she said we had nothing to eat except the two blacks now this is arabica two blacks and she explained water and dates dates is black dates the dates itself are black in color but is water black no scholars say in arabic this is called we give the name of one to the whole group it's like in sira when they say that the two rumors came and the two umar left with the habit of what is the meaning of that mustafa okay no well so they give the name of umar to abu bakr by saying instead of saying abu bakr and umar came abu bakr and umar went they say the two om what do you think the two moons are the sun the sun and the moon they call it the two moons and it's quite a normal in arabic to have this that is why we give the name of one to the whole group so um there is a difference between a van and which has more words nor what which has more words has more words than the has something that is not found in the adhan muhammad but and one athan out of the five daily prayers has something that is not found in the ekamah and the rest of the advance which is which is okay can we try to figure out why the words in the athan are more than the words in the fadi i think because the first event is for the call of prayer for the people to assemble and gather at the mosque but the second one has to be shorter and faster for them just to stand up and start praying because they are already gathered present and gathering gathered in the mosque so the first one is to notify those who are far away so they may miss a sentence or two but if you make it prolong it and make it lots of words and sentences the possibility that they hear it is far greater than if you make it short and this is the reason why we have the advan longer and more in sentence than the the following hadith has the number 147 narrated by abu juhifah may will be pleased with him i saw bilal calling for prayer and i will follow looking at his mouth as he turn it this right side and that left side with his fingers in his ear in a narration of ibru maja and he put his finger in his ear and also in a nourishing in and also a nourishing of abu dhabi he turned his neck to the right and left when he reached hayala salah meaning come to the players and didn't turn his body okay this hadith tells us how to perform the adhan physically how to do it but something just popped into my mind we always hear the terminology the six books of hadith there are six books of hadith the the most famous ones so uh noor do you know them yes i know can you please first uh okay sorry muslim okay um well it's not sorry it's called sunin and then and these are the six books the most famous six books of hadith the you some make the mistakes uh the mistake of saying they are the asahaha they are regarded as the six books but they are not only two are sahih which are the bukhari and muslim and then you have in in the authentication of them as follows then then then finally ibn maja which contains a lot of weak hadees and also a lot of correct and authentic hadiths abu juhaife is describing to us how bilal may allah be pleased with him used to call for the prayer and he says that he used to follow his mouth going right and left now the sun is that you put your fingers in your ears and why is that do you think mustafa because at the time they didn't have microphones so they wanted to say it in a loud voice as much as they can so what does your fingers in your ears do to you malik physically i heard the doctors say that if you block the ears then the strength of the mouth you know the voice coming out of the mouth will be stronger okay and and and this sounds you have to ask a doctor to confirm this uh it sounds logical because if you have problems with problems with your nose if you if you have a cold or so your ears got get blocked and you thought you have a sore throat and so on so they are all uh connected to each other so apparently once you block your ear passage then the air goes through one passage which is your throat and the more you don't hear yourself the louder you can get now saying that this is the sunnah we mean that this was done at the time of the prophet not that the prophet ordered it but being done at the prophet time sallallahu sallam and he did not say anything towards it this means that he agrees to it so it's a sunnah now in the hadith it says that he used to go write and say allah twice and goes left to say why do you think he did this fadi to send the the call of prayer to the largest amount of people possible so if he does it this way that means that the people on the right the far right the angle itself would be limited but if you you know turn right and left then the angle the circle would be much bigger and wider now the question that comes here do you think that we should do this nowadays mustafa says yes fadi says no i don't think we should do it as a as it's a good it's permissible so it's a good thing to follow the sunnah but the purpose of it is already fulfilled by the loudspeakers so yes or no mandatory no but permissible or better it's better to do so mustafa has another opinion again i thought then was an act of worship so this means that if the prophet muhammad commanded us to do it this way to turn right or left while saying then we should do it either way abu malik well i do agree with brother mustafa on that because it's sunnah okay noor i agree with that we can find that muhammad peace be upon him not command him to do so okay i i will give you the floor inshallah after the break we have a short break so stay tuned and we will be right back inshallah reviewing the second rule of el meme that is the letter meme so if the first meme is non-vowel or followed by a vowel meme so i will merge the first in the letter and i will pronounce them as one min and we spoke abundantly on the virtues of sikh refuge with allah from the outcast satan especially for the first suicide he's got to recite it out loud thank you for joining us and welcome back before the break muhammad was uh commenting on our question so can you please elaborate yes i told that in hadees of abuja he reported us that i saw bilal looking left and right and that not um we find that not uh the prophet uh told him for to doing that so if we do it's better because it's act of sahabi so the consensus of the floor uh we have say that it is sunnah now we have other mustafa is changing his mind i'm not changing my mind if it was explicitly for that purpose for letting people know then it would have been not just in it would have been in other and other sentences as well okay this could also count but i beg to differ simply because if you call for the adhan and you have the mike here and you say people will not hear you now this was possible when you got on top of the mosque and you called the people without any microphones this the the the angle of the circle would increase because you're doing it this way you're doing it this way and you're doing it this way if you are inside the mask and you have one mic in front of you if you turn your face from it this means that the whole circle outside the mosque will not listen and will not hear it so you have to look into the form of worship itself to realize first was it instructed by the prophet or not secondly does it have a meaning that is comprehendable and to look whether i should continue or not meaning and if you remember in russell we said that the prophet sallam started by washing his hands washing his private parts and hitting the ground with his hands and why did he do this because he wanted to remove the filth that may have stuck into his hands now do we have to do this we said no we can wash our hands with soap that was survive suffice the same thing comes here with the adhan you have a comment about malik has a comment let's start with you i was i was going to say that you could just like hold the mic and like move yeah you can do this but it's it's it's not if you do this as muhammad points out if you do this then you have a problem with putting your fingers in your ears and then well well what should i do it becomes well you could put a wireless you know like the the singers do with with the mic and and then depends on your costume and you're in the wrong place at the wrong time this is a van albumic well my question is similar to brother mustafa i want to ask you know what if the mic can pick up if it's in a strong mic enough then it's okay if you do it and it's okay if you don't but if you ensure that the sound is as strong as it is then go ahead with it but then we have the dilemma of putting your fingers on the spot yeah but remember that you have a mic it's not the sound that you want it to be as strong as possible it you want it to be as nice as possible also so imagine if you put your fingers in your ears and you have a mic that is strong with big loud speakers and you start to shout your way out for the adhan a lot of people will be disturbed with it and and this is not islam we don't want to disturb people we want them to listen to the adhan know it's a form of notification and come to perform the prayer so the last any conclusion we we could reach is would be that it is recommendable that you follow the footsteps of bilal in doing it and looking right and left providing that this does not jeopardize the reach of the event as for the fingers we don't want to uh make it so loud that people would reject our adan so if you keep your distance away from the mic you know some people make it really noisy they stick their mouths to the mic and the sound becomes very loud and it's another pleasant thing to hear islam doesn't want you to do this islam tells you to be a pr person tells you to be a public relation person you always have to look for the image you always have to portray the best image for the religion you believe in you don't want any people or anybody to you know reject what you're calling them to hadith number 148 narrated by abu mahadura may allah be pleased with him the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam liked his voice so he taught him that then meaning called to prayer uh promised you before that we may talk about this man uh i'm not going to talk a lot about him but where did the prophet hear him make the event does anybody know on the day of conquering mecca fatih when the prophet sallam went from medina with his army and they conquered mecca without any bloodshed just went in and the people accepted them as conquerors that was on which year does anybody know which hijra year now this is you know embarrassing the 10th tenth year and when did the prophet die alice al-salam that's even even worse 18th 18th so the prophet stayed in medina for 18 years that's a lot a lot of time 13 13 13 in medina and makkah 10. well if we reverse it we might have a better answer he stayed in mecca for 13 years and he stayed in medina for 10 years so then he did not perform hajj on the 10th year he performed hajj on the eighth year and the prophet salallahu ah sorry uh he uh conquered makkah on the eighth year uh sallallahu alaihi wasallam and performed hajjat al-wadar on the tenth year the ninth year was the hajj of abu bakr and ali where he sent them to clear the way and to tell people that after today no mushrik will be allowed to enter mecca so the conquering of makkah was on the eighth year of hijrah when the prophets went there is a salam bilal called the prayer for prayer from the masjid the holy mosque was a young boy playing with his friends and when they heard the adhan he started to mock and make the advantage of his own you know when someone hears something and he makes fun of it so he started making fun of it and making fun out of it with a loud voice accidentally the prophet saws heard this voice now he's the conqueror and he came after being kicked out of makkah and after being chased out of it and they had so many wars so you can tell the personality and how he feels after all these years they killed his uncle they killed his loved ones they killed his companions and now he is the conqueror of the city and no one can say anything to him and all of a sudden he hears this boy making fun of the adhan what would you do what would you have done if you were in his shoes you would have probably brought this boy you know sliced him to pieces and put him in the microwave and had him for dinner the prophet salaam was not like this he did not avenge himself the prophet salallahu was not a type of a man with a temper he loved his religion he loved mankind he loved he was the mercy as described to us in the quran to mankind and to jinn he was sent as a mercy of allah so he called his companions and told them bring this man or they bring this boy to me so the guy came you know trembling and shivering and and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wiped on his forehead exactly as you do when you have a child or a young boy and you just pat him on the head you know it's okay just to call him down and the prophet sallallahu assalam also taught him how to call for the evan and he prayed to allah azzawajal that he guides this boy to the right path so the boy did exactly what the prophet taught him to but there's you know something strange the boy was not a muslim or he was a muslim on the surface but he was a hypocrite because everybody reverted to islam and by the sword and he was a while ago making fun ridiculing of the adhan he said to us after the prophet sallam wiped my forehead and prayed to allah that he might he may guide me subhanallah allah took all the hatred in my heart and it was thrown away and it was filled with the love of the prophet and abu mahdura became one of those of the prophet and by the way his forehead that the prophet saw wiped over he never cut it short he never cut it short and and whenever people tell him it's getting long why not cut it short he said i would never ever cut short something that the prophet saw sallam touched because this is a blessing of the prophet and the issue of blessing of the prophet allah is a very wide thing now nothing in this world is worth touching and seeking the blessing of people go to graves and start rubbing the graves or wiping on the graves seeking blessing people go to kaaba and they wipe the walls and the carpets and and the curtains and they they seek blessing they go to the grave of the prophet allah they go to the window or to the door and wiping it with cloth and seek the blessing of allah this is all wrong you may not seek the blessings of allah azza except from the things that we were told to seek blessings in such as the prophet himself so if the prophet were to be alive among us yes it's a blessing to hold his hand it's a blessing to take his clothings or to take his sweat or whatever and use it as a form of blessing from allah because because he is a blessing nowadays we have nothing to go for except few things that are mentioned in the sunnah father we have 30 seconds to go like his sword and his pieces of his hair and you have to prove that these are his swords and uh pieces the remaining of of his hair or of his cloth and you cannot do this now you go to istanbul you go to jalalabad you go to here and there everybody says listen this is uh some of the hair of the prophet this is some of his perfume this is some of his clothings this is his sword this is his knife this is his turban this is and none of them have the authentic that this belongs to the prophet allah and accordingly we cannot argue and we cannot say it is or it isn't so we cannot seek the blessing of allah from it i'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program so until we meet next time ah"
