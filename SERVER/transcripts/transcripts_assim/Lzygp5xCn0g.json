  "transcript": "Abdul Aziz from Sri Lanka Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh How are you Sheikh? Alhamdulillah Sheikh my question is there is a dua to recite in Sujood, I think it's So this one, this dua can I recite it throughout the day like a form of Zikr? Yes the answer is yes, this is one of the authentic duas that the Prophet ï·º used to say So whether you say it in Sujood, whether you say it before concluding your Salat with Salam, whether you say it in the last third of the night, whether you say it between Adhan and Iqamah, whether you say it throughout the whole day, this is a beautiful dua that you should say and continue to say"
