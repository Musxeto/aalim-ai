  "transcript": "question saying which is the correct answer in a way when we rise up from Brooke or do we close the arms or leave it straight down brother Abdul Ahad is asking a question about what to do with the arms after you are in the position of Recor bowing and you say sami allahu liman hamidah what to do should I fold my hands on the chest or should I leave them at my sides there isn't a clear hadith stating which is which and this is why scholars differed and as many son actions in the prayer it should not be an issue of dispute it should not be an issue of disagreement or argument and it is wallahi bringing sadness to the heart when you hear about some of the messages in different countries where they literally prohibit people who practice the Sunnah such as raising the hands in bowing and when raising from the bowing position they kick them out from the message because they are applying the Sunnah and the people of the masjid are blind followers of a particular method it's an act of sinner if I do it or if I don't do it what does it harm you so these little issues should not be part of the causes of disagreement or argument or fighting or dividing the Muslim Ummah it's a sunnah you do it ham delay or rewarded you don't do it there's no sin on you and there's no reason for you to fight over it if I want to do it and if I believe in it now the issue of putting the right on the left over your chest in salat was reported by y11 Hodja may Allah be pleased with him and the Prophet told us that this is the Sunnah this is the way of the prophets of Allah peace and blessing and praise of Allah be upon them all so this is not an issue of dispute among the majority of scholars when you're standing in salat reciting the fat house I think this surah we put the right on the left whether on the chest or above the belly button or underneath it's an issue of dispute the most authentic is you put it on the chest whether you put it anywhere in the chest where you feel relaxed this is the chest you just put it normally like this now when you prostrate when you bow when you sit before between prostrations when you do different acts of salat we have evidence for every single thing backing it up so we know exactly where the Prophet used to put his hands in the bowing a record position in the prostration between the two prostrations when he was sitting we have ample evidence is backing it up now when the Prophet says Samia Allahu Liman Hamidah and he stands up after the bowing position we don't have any narration telling us that he used to put his hands over or by his sides so the scholars said the hadith of wildmen Hajer says in simple arabic that the prophet used to put his right over his left on the chest when he was standing so now let's look at the description of a worshipper when he raises his head from rock or what is he doing everybody would say normally that he is in the standing position therefore we believe that the most appropriate is to put your right on the Left fold your hands and put them on your chest after you rise from the rikuo position now if I don't do this a my sinful no not at all but if you do this thinking that it is part of the Sunnah because of the general hadith of the companion describing the salat of the prophet or sir you are in good hands and you have not done anything wrong in sha Allah on the contrary by doing this people would know that you're praying by doing this you're restricting yourself from having free hands to move around in search in your pockets or scratch your body or do whatever so it's more closer to being submissive and attaining kosher and Allah Azza WA JAL knows best"
