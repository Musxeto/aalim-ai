  "title": "Is skipping a single prayer an act of apostasy? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so i have heard from a student of knowledge that imam ahmad narrated in his mustang from why they've been double that the prophet saws said and this student of knowledge also said that this is sahih so does this mean that leaving a single salah is a act of apostasy no it is not and i doubt that this hadith is uh authentic regardless of what this so-called quote unquote student of knowledge says the issue of takfir is prevailing nowadays so nowadays people just try to get people out of the fold of islam for the easiest and simplest things so one abandons a prayer ahmadin you can interpret this in many different ways so you can say that he did this deliberately thinking that's not mandatory yes this is an act of apostasy but a person out of laziness skips a prayer the vast majority of muslims say that this is a major sin and he's sinful for that but no one takes him out of the fold of islam the vast majority do not do this so i don't know about this narration i have to check it but i am most certain that if you go and look what the scholars have said in the tafsir in the explanation of such a narration if there is a big if if it is proven to be authentic that uh you will find what i've said to you inshallah is the truth"
