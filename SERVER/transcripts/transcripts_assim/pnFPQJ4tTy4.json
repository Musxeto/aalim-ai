  "title": "Ruling on taking Covid 19 vaccine if it contains Gelatin - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "says now what do you think of the covet 19 uh vaccine if it contains gelatin we talked about gelatin so many times and said that it's an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion is that it undergoes a rigorous vigorous very strong process that changes its chemical and physical uh attributes so that it is not any more the substance that it was before whether it is dead meat or pork or whatever and hence because of the difficulty in staying away from it and this opinion says that it has been transformed into a new substance then it's to consume it whether it's in covet 19 vaccines or in any other vaccines because there are hundreds of vaccines measles smallpox cholera etc now what's the ruling on taking it without verifying the results as it has not been tested and it is not approved it is given an emergency approval but it was not approved or thoroughly tested so if a person doesn't want to take it would he be sinful the answer is no is it safe to take it though it was not thoroughly tested i'm not a specialist i cannot tell i cannot come and say um no there is is this mrna has this problem it's going to attack your brain cells it's going to cause you alzheimer's it's going to cause you many uh progressive cases of of cancer etc how would i know i'm not a specialist so you don't ask a sheikh unless there are studies that the sheikh can read and give his verdict according to trusted people at the moment we don't have this data so it's all every person's own call you want to take it take it you don't want to take it nobody's forcing you to do it so how are you going to take it definitely not i'm not going to take it because i'm not in need to it alhamdulillah i don't see any reason compelling me to to take it with the grace of allah azza and maybe a year or two if we don't see them changing into chinese or growing bat ears and and wings maybe i would take it by but by now no this is something that you have to go and ask your trusted physician not any doctor that is parroting what he heard from the who or the cdc or whatever no go to researchers whom you trust and there are many of them and ask them and if you believe what they say you can follow that without any problem"
