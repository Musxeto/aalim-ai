  "title": "Arrogance with people vs Arrogance with Allah (believing man made laws are superior to Sharia)?",
  "transcript": "Juwayriyah from France Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh can you please explain what is being arrogant towards Allah? Like the characteristics of a person who is arrogant towards Allah? BarakAllah Wafiq BarakAllah. Arrogance is one of the major sins that might take a person out of the fold of Islam if it was with Allah Azza Wa Jal. If it's with humans it's a major sin. The Prophet says Alayhis Salatu Wassalam he who has an ant weight of arrogance in his heart will not be admitted to Jannah. So with people arrogance is when you reject the truth when it comes to you or look down at people as if they are of a lesser quality whether due to their ethnicity, due to their colour, due to their nationality, due to their social status. This is arrogance. When it comes to Allah Azza Wa Jal rejecting Allah's commands thinking that they are not equal to other commands. For example implementing man-made law and preferring it over Shari'ah and believing that it is better than Shari'ah law or equivalent to Shari'ah law. This nullifies a person's Islam and takes him out of the fold of Islam as mentioned in Surah Al-Ma'idah. In three places that whomever does not implement the Shari'ah, the law of Allah Azza Wa Jal then they are the disbelievers, they are the transgressors, they are the sinners. To refuse to prostrate to Allah Azza Wa Jal out of arrogance as some of the disbelievers said I would never have my backside above my head meaning criticizing prostration. This is arrogance, the arrogance of Satan. When he defied a straight order, a direct order from Allah to prostrate to Adam, he said nope I'm better than him, you created me from fire and created him from clay and the likes. When you believe that you are better, you are more intellectual, you have more logic, this all means that you've lost the essence of being in need of Allah, of being a servant of Allah, of being submitting your will to Allah Azza Wa Jal, this is when it becomes something that nullifies your Islam and Allah knows best."
