  "title": "Don't know my biological father, whose name should I take? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "says that I've never met my biological father or mother and I do not know my father's name I was adopted at birth and given my adopted father's name but he abandoned me I reverted to Islam and changed my name is this permissible to do I have or I have to keep the name of my adopted father or take the name of my mother which I have just found out or can I take my husband's name as I have just got married this question is a bit complicated first of all generally speaking a person must not be called except after his father and his forefathers so what many Muslim women do due to their imitation of the disbelievers or of the non-muslim countries and traditions when they get married they changed their name to their husband's name this is totally prohibited and it has to be changed and it's awkward when people call for feminism and when they call for the rights of women yet they themselves are the first to change their god-given names to their husbands names in Islam we don't have this a woman keeps and is called after her father and her grandfather and her family name never to be changed into anybody's names this is the basics now if a woman was born out of wedlock so her father did not marry her mother she is not to be called after her biological father because there was no legitimate marriage she would be called either after her mother's family because this is the trend that the mother the the child that was born out of wedlock is not to be called after the biological father but rather by the mother's family or in an a an incident where a child does not know the father nor the mother in this case he would be or she would be given a name that is general so the first name we have no problem with whatever your first name is this is okay now the second and family name it should be general so each and every slave of Allah is Abdullah so if her name is Kathryn then say her name would be Kathryn the daughter of Abdullah caffeine Abdullah if she took a Muslim name her name would be let's assume Zeinab bent Abdullah daughter of Abdul Allah or Abdul Rahman because this fits all humans Muslims and non-muslims they are all slaves of Allah there are all slaves of Allah man in your case amatulla if your mother whom you had discovered recently acknowledges that she had a marriage contract with your biological father you have to be called after him if not then you may be called after a general name like mentioned Abdullah etc but not after your husband and I hope this er inshallah answers your question"
