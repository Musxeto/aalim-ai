  "transcript": "so um there is this store near me that sells shoes and clothes and I would like to apply to that job but some of the clothes that they sell has pictures on them so I was wondering if it's permissable for me to work there basically it is not permissible for you to sell something that is Haram and unfortunately living in a cfer country like the us or Europe and being the bread winner would be next to Impossible if we were to say that you have to work in a 100% Halal job because usually people in such lands don't pay attention to what is halal Oram and they would consider what you're asking them not to do as ridiculous if not insane and extreme so it seems to me that if the majority of the clothes that you're selling is halal and there is this one or two or few items that may contain a picture on them and you don't have any other choice or alternative but to sell them I pray to Allah Asel that this is permissible for you and if you give some money in charity as a compensation for any Haram income that may have occurred on your paycheck due to selling such Haram clothes that would be a positive thing to do and Allah Knows Best"
