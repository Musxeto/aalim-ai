  "title": "Sujood At-Tilawah without Wudu? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh sharus from sri lanka saying that is it permissible to perform uh the prostration of recitation without being in the state of wudu the answer is yes because the state of wudo is required when you're praying but if you're reciting the quran you're not obliged to be in the state of wudo and if you pass by an ayah or a verse that has a prostration of recitation you can offer it without wado you can offer it to other than the direction of qibla and you can offer it even without covering your entire aura so this is permissible because it is not a prayer"
