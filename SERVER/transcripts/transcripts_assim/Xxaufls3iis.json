  "title": "Ruling on men wearing tight jeans & does it impact their prayer? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign basically what I wanted to ask is um what is the permissibility for men to wear tight slash tighter jeans is it something Haram or macro or something generally to be avoided because I remember in a video of yours from a while back it seemed basically that you were against it but you mentioned that it's better than obviously a woman wearing tight jeans so what is the ruling on this the scholars say that the Hadith where the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam mentioned the two types of the people of hell that he had not seen and he described them to us meaning that they will be coming in the future one of them was women who were dressed but nude at the same time how would that be possible Scholars said that either because they're wearing see-through that exposes their aura or their wearing tights that would give the shape out of their bodies this Hadith was about women now for men we don't have the same Hadith though wearing see-through that exposes your aura is prohibited without any doubt because you can see the aura which you are ordered to hide and conceal wearing tights for men is a bit different because the fitna of them wearing such tights is not at all similar or even close to the fitna of women wearing tights and this is obvious without any a lot of thinking alhamdulillah therefore Scholars say that this is not recommended and it's highly recommended that you wear something that does not expose your aura but if someone does wear such tight clothes and pray then the prayer is valid and Allah Knows Best"
