  "transcript": "Aqib from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Sheikh I have a question regarding no cost EMI Regarding what? No cost EMI What is that? I will tell you what the process is So I have two options here In my country So if I go to a merchant And buy a product Say the product price is 1000 Rupees And I have to pay in monthly installments So I am paying in 10 installments 100 Rupees per month And it is financed by a bank And whatever the interest is It is a deal between the bank And my merchant So this is option A Option B When I go to the merchant He tells me The price is 1000 Rupees If you are having an installment facility The bank will charge 100 Rupees interest So that goes to 1100 But we are giving you 100 Rupees discount So it comes back to 1000 Rupees And we have to pay 100 Rupees In monthly installments So in both the cases I am paying the same amount And if I buy it I am also paying the same amount First of all You have to know that Long distance calls The sound is not very great And if you have an accent That would Cause A great difficulty For me To understand your question This is why I urge the people when they speak That they try their level best To speak clearly So that the words can be understood From what I understood From your question That you want to buy A product worth of 1000 Rupees And there are Two scenarios One scenario I did not understand The second scenario Is that the bank Charges 100 Rupees Interest but The seller gives you A discount so that What you actually are paying Is 1000 Rupees The problem is That if you are Dealing with a third party The third party Is a bank And this is a conventional Interest based Riba bank They don't care About what you are buying or selling What they care is how to Magnify The 1000 Rupees Into more So 1000 Rupees 1100 Rupees 1200 Rupees All what they care about Is the interest So if you are Dealing and agreeing With the bank as a third party Financing your transaction This is clear Riba It is Haram If the seller himself Has under the table Agreement with the bank To finance such Transactions and deals And you As a buyer Has nothing to do with the bank You are dealing directly With the seller In this case buying Dealments is permissible With two conditions Condition number one When I want to buy this Mug from the seller He has to possess It and own it So when I go to buy It and negotiate the price He already has it in his possession So I am buying Something that he owns Unlike when I buy it through the bank The bank is selling me Something he does not possess And all what he is interested in Money versus money Here it is a product versus money So there is no loan involved Condition number one The seller owns it and possesses it Condition number two We negotiate the price The original cash price Is 1000 Rupees The seller wants to sell it On installments For 2000 Rupees I as a buyer I am shocked 100% increase Why? The seller says You want it? You can buy it You don't want it? Go away, buy it somewhere else Because I need it And I don't have the cash I agree with him And I say 2000 is too much Give me a discount He may give me a discount And goes down to 1500 He may not Whatever the end result is As long as we come to a conclusion And an agreement That I will buy this product For 2000 Rupees Over the duration of X amounts of months And we sign a contract Then this is permissible And valid Providing that the final price Is fixed And it cannot go 1 Rupee up It cannot be increased And at the same time It must not have any Late fee penalty Because any increase Over the last price agreed Before signing the contract Any increase Would count as Riba These conditions fulfilled You are fine to go You"
