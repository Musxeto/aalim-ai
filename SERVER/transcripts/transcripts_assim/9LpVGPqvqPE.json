  "title": "Layman follow 1 madhab in all cases, can he choose an easy opinion? Lick saliva fast Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "you said in the past that a Layman has to follow a methab and share picking like taking a p from different method is Haram but for example the Ramadan I ask you uh if swallowing the saliva from the lip would break the fasting I want to hear your opinion as I'm following the Han and according to the Han M and also to the shaf doing this Del liberity would break the fasting that was of IM and but this opinion can be very difficult for a person so is it permissible for a Layman to follow the opinion from a different me if he finds the opinion from his own me to be very difficult whether it's or should he always stick to his M even if it's very hard for him as long as they do not contradict with Quran and Sunnah okay first of all I did not say a lay man must follow a m usually people quote this and forget that I give a full package I usually say a Layman must not cherry pick and he must follow a trusted scholar in whatever he tells him and if you can't find a scholar then you may follow a maab but you cannot just blindly follow a maab without a sheh from from the maab guiding you around because every maab has two or three opinions on the same topic such as the issue of swallowing your saliva if it came out of your mouth to your lips and then you swallowed it again and by the way this is a hypothetical issue not mentioned in the Quran and the Sunnah the Quran and the Sunnah says do not eat do not drink now cascading this to licking your lip like this and then imagining that I've swallowed my saliva swallowing your saliva is I cannot show it on live TV because this is rated PG most likely not rated whatever so to have your saliva on your uh uh lip in mass in quantity this is something that is Deb yes in this case we may say oops what have you done you have a a chunk of saliva on your lips and you're swallowing it that's something with mass just licking your lip like this and then licking it again like this has zero impact on your fasting with all due respect to the schools of thought that say this invalidates your fasting it doesn't imagine the quantity of water after rining your mouth and spitting it out do you mean to tell me that there isn't any amount of water remaining and mixing with your saliva of course there is is it something to break your fast of course not why because the prophet ordered us to rinse our mouths and to spit it out the remaining is negle legible so you tell me the amount of saliva when I lick my lip like this is it less or more than the amount of water remaining and mixing with my saliva when I spit the water after rining it in wo so definitely we have to uh um be a little bit logical and not make Islam too difficult to practice number one second secondly following the books of is difficult without a she you have to have a trusted sh to help you navigate through the different opinion this is in the old opinion of shaf and this opinion is the new opinion of shaf which one I take that would be cherry-picking because one says right one says left okay that's that's nice I'm following the shaf I have the choice no there is the most authentic opinion of the two which you are obliged to follow so I hope this answers your questions we"
