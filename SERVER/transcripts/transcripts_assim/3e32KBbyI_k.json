  "title": "Ashari calls me a Wahabi or a Najdi for believing Allah has a Hand || assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Talha from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh and he tells me that how can Allah have a hand, this means that Allah has a body for us and stuff like that, how should I respond to him? First of all, if someone accuses you of being a Wahabi or a Najdi, that should be a medal, you should be proud of it. It's like someone, when you tell them don't torture animals and he says, you're a human? Is this an insult? Of course not. Second of all, this ignorant, imbecile friend of yours, did not even read the Quran. It was Allah who described himself to have a hand, to have two hands and his two hands created Adam. So is he falsifying the Quran or saying that no, Allah doesn't know what he's talking about? You don't even need to talk with ignorant imbeciles like this, leave them. Let them worship whoever they want to worship. We worship Allah, we follow the footsteps of the Prophet, peace be upon him, of the companions, of the Tabi'een, of Tabi'at Tabi'een, the favorite three generations that the Prophet told us they are the best of the best. We follow them. Now you tell me, who these people are following? If they can manage to quote one from the Quran or the Hadith or the Prophet, peace be upon him, or from the companions or the Tabi'een, so be it. But they don't. Let them be in their confusion and their chaos and move on with life. It's not worth it to debate and talk with such people. May Allah guide us all to Islam."
