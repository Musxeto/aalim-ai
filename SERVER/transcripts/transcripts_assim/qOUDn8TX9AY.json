  "title": "Using Cracked Software for Video Editing in Dawah",
  "transcript": "you have cd from germany um what's wrong on using crack version of video editing programs for dial purpose for example uh brothers making street tower and he's also filming it but he wants to use crack version of video editing programs to edit his videos is this permissible the most authentic opinion is that as muslims we do not cheat and we do not lie and people have invested hundreds of thousands if not millions in such programs for us to come and trespass and crack their work depriving them of what they deserve it's their product this is prohibited whether it's for dawa or for anything else because now you are taking someone's piece of pie without paying the money now if you reversed it if you worked hard and for long hours over an application and you've invested a lot of money and someone came in used it without paying and maybe helped in spreading it to others causing you great loss how would you feel now lots of the muslims unfortunately due to their lack of knowledge and lack of fear of allah they say these are kafir so microsoft or whatever i can use their cracked virgin without any problem and this is not permissible at all even if they're kafir and they're disbelievers this does not allow me to take their rights and to abuse their copyrighted virgins uh and work without uh a justifiable reason and allah knows best you"
